The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The research will use snake venom as a model system to develop hypotheses for how new gene regulatory networks (GRNs) evolve, which will increase our understanding of the ?rules of life? that link genomic processes to variation in organismal phenotypes. The project will also utilize cellular variation to test hypotheses for the function of GRN components, which will be applicable to any eukaryotic system. Further, findings from the research will contribute profoundly to advancing our understanding of how snake venom is regulated. The World Health Organization identified snake envenomation as a priority neglected tropical disease and a better understanding of snake venom regulation stands to improve the treatment of snakebite with the potential to impact millions globally.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the fellow?s research is to use snake venom as a model system to investigate mechanisms underlying the evolution of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control phenotypic traits. More specifically, the project objectives are to understand how complex traits are regulated, how GRNs arise through the re-wiring of existing physiological and genomic components, and to identify the mechanisms that shape cellular and evolutionary variation in organismal phenotypes. To accomplish these project objectives, the fellow will test mechanistic hypotheses for snake venom GRN evolution and function by integrating across multiple biological scales, from organismal-level phenotypes, to tissues, to single-cells. The fellow?s approach will leverage evolutionary variation to develop tissue-level hypotheses for the function and evolution of novel GRNs. Further, the fellow will integrate single-cell experiments to (I) test the roles of specific GRN elements, and (II) understand how cellular heterogeneity manifests in organismal-scale traits. The project will build upon the fellow?s skills in bioinformatics to expand the fellow?s training in the analysis and interpretation of functional genomic data at the tissue and single-cell levels. Further, the fellow will gain new experience in developing and implementing predictive models for testing GRN hypotheses, which will contribute profoundly to the fellow?s development as a computational biologist. The fellow will also be involved in implementing computational workshops (for 50 undergraduates from any institution) designed to encourage students from underrepresented groups to embrace computational biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research investigates a fundamental question in biology: how do organisms respond to changing environments? Populations face extinction if evolution cannot keep pace. This work investigates how an individual?s genes and environment interact to allow for rapid acclimation and adaptation to altered environments. Such work better informs predictions of how organisms may avoid extinction in rapidly changing environments. By training undergraduate students in research techniques, crafting educational displays at local museums, and developing lesson plans on related topics in ecology and evolution, this project also will enhance public engagement with science, and help prepare the next diverse generation of biologists.<br/><br/>Phenotypic plasticity ? or the ability of organisms to change their traits in response to changes in their environment ? can allow individuals to better match a new environment within their lifetime. It is thought that this ability may allow populations to avoid extinction in altered environments and buy time for evolution to occur ? but this hypothesis remains largely untested. This project uses the model nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans to evaluate conditions under which plasticity contributes to the persistence of populations in novel environments. The fellow will use a genome-wide association study to characterize the mechanisms of environmental assessment and how they vary across natural populations. The fellow will then use experimental evolution to evaluate how worms varying in plasticity for production of an alternative life stage (the dauer) persist and evolve in novel environments. The fellow will also use gene editing to manipulate plasticity and ask whether this ability to change traits within a generation can be necessary for population persistence across many generations in novel environments. This project will demonstrate if plasticity can promote population persistence, under what conditions, and how this occurs. The fellow will learn new techniques in genomic analysis and the use of genetic tools while expanding the conceptual and methodological scope of their research program and building mentorship skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results of this project will inform land managers and conservation practitioners of best practices for planning and employing approaches that protect migratory routes. The fellow will conduct research in collaboration with land managers, private landowners, collaborators throughout Baja California, and the public to monitor butterfly populations and movements. Thus, this project will provide an opportunity to directly broaden participation in STEM while supporting binational conservation efforts.

The fellow will collect field data and use existing archival data which will provide insights into plant community composition and butterfly habitat use across a management gradient. Additionally, the fellow will receive training in using species distribution modeling to broaden our understanding of how projected land use and global change will affect plant-butterfly networks. The findings of this work will also give insights into how various environmental stressors impact U.S.-Mexico butterfly populations and movements which have implications for binational efforts to promote ecosystem recovery and resilience.

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Global biodiversity loss can have cascading effects for dependent species so that declines in one species negatively impact the other. Seed dispersal is important in many plants, and they produce fruit to attract animals that spread the seeds. Yet, little is known about how plants respond to the loss of their animal dispersers. This project investigates the consequences of wild bird loss on the chilies (fruits) they disperse in the Mariana Islands. The introduction of an invasive snake species on the southernmost island (Guam) has decimated native bird populations; however, the snakes are not present on other islands, and these have native birds.  The research aims to improve understanding of how plant species respond to global change by comparing differences in fruiting on islands with and without birds. Further, by focusing on a culturally important plant in the Marianas, the fellow has excellent opportunities to provide outreach to communities already impacted by ecosystem change and accessible research participation and mentorship for prospective scientists in geographically isolated locations.  <br/><br/>This project aims to answer the following: Q1) In islands with varying seed disperser density, are there differences in frugivore visitation and fruit traits in wild C. frutescens populations? (Q2) What is the genetic and environmental contribution to fruit trait variation in Mariana C. frutescens populations? (Q3) How do individual C. frutescens from different island populations respond to low disperser activity? To approach these questions, the fellow will measure natural variation in physiological and chemical fruit traits in C. frutescens populations across the Marianas (Q1), grow individual C. frutescens from different islands in a common garden experiment (Q2), and assess the impacts of manipulated fruit removal rates on fruit traits of C. frutescens plants from different islands (Q3). The fellow will be trained in relevant fieldwork and chemical analysis techniques to conduct these activities, mentoring undergraduate students at the host institution and the Marianas to facilitate research. The fellow will also engage in outreach activities in the Marianas, including classroom presentations and informational booths at agricultural events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are also the largest natural source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. However, it is difficult to predict how much methane produced in wetlands reaches the atmosphere, and how this might change in the future. Through field, lab, and modeling work, this project studies the link between water flow and methane in wetlands. It will investigate how methane in wetlands responds to environmental changes, focusing on how microbes consume methane without oxygen. This work will provide mentoring and research opportunities for undergraduate students from backgrounds that are not currently well-represented in the Earth Sciences. It will also develop data-intensive Earth Science teaching materials that include ways to engage ethically with Indigenous peoples and lands.<br/><br/>Dr. Samuel Shaheen has been awarded an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship in collaboration with Drs. G.-H. Crystal Ng and Cara Santelli at the University of Minnesota. In this project, Dr. Shaheen will integrate field, experimental, and modeling work to examine how microbial-scale biogeochemical reactions and multi-scale processes such as hyporheic zone hydrology influence wetland methane dynamics. Current uncertainties in our process-based understanding of the hydrobiogeochemical controls on wetland methane dynamics limit our ability to predict future changes to methane fluxes. While much attention has been focused on quantifying the microbial production of methane in wetlands, some of the methane produced is biogeochemically consumed before reaching the atmosphere, and major understanding gaps persist regarding methane consumption occurring under anoxic conditions. The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is widely detected in wetland hyporheic zones, but estimates of its significance in mediating wetland methane emissions vary widely. This uncertainty may reflect that the significance of AOM depends on dynamic hydrologic conditions and a ?cryptic? sulfur cycle able to resupply sulfate as an electron donor for AOM in anoxic settings. This project will characterize hydrologic fluxes, redox processes, and methane emissions from wetland sites with varying availability of sulfate. In particular, the relationship between AOM, sulfur cycling, and methane emissions will be assessed to address this understudied aspect of wetland methane dynamics. Incorporating field measurements and laboratory experiments into a reactive transport model, redox processes relevant to methane cycling can be evaluated across hydrologic conditions and under potential global change scenarios. Moving beyond the detection of AOM in wetlands, this project will build on emerging evidence of rapid sulfur cycling in wetlands to develop a quantitative understanding of AOM?s dependency on sulfur cycling and hyporheic fluxes and investigate how carbon and sulfur cycles in wetlands evolve across dynamic shifts in hydrology and temperature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. One of the most surprising facts about lungs is that they first evolved in fish hundreds of millions of years ago. The origin of lungs was crucial to the evolutionary success of vertebrates?lungs enabled fish to later venture onto land and diversify and enabled active buoyancy control in fishes. Fundamental questions remain about how fish regulate their buoyancy and how these mechanisms evolved. The fellow will study the anatomy, physiology, and behaviors used for buoyancy regulation across a broad range of fish species and model the evolutionary history of these traits. This research will reveal fundamental information about how fishes maintain homeostasis and interact with their environment, as well as reveal how changes in ecology and anatomy drive evolutionary changes in behavior and physiology. The fellow will develop educational STEM workshops for underserved high school students in Washington, DC, and mentor undergraduate students in the development of independent research projects related to the proposed work.<br/><br/>The original mechanism of buoyancy regulation was the use of air breaths to modify lung or gas bladder volume. While some extant fishes use this behavioral mechanism, other fishes use a specialized gas gland to physiologically regulate buoyancy. Little is known about the evolutionary transitions between these mechanisms and how their phylogenetic distributions relate to patterns in fish ecology. The fellow will integrate histological techniques, pressure manipulation experiments, and phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate diversity in 1) the morphology of the pneumatic duct (which permits or restricts the use of air breaths), 2) the presence and density of gas gland cells (which physiologically regulate buoyancy), and 3) the use of air breaths to restore buoyancy. The fellow will synthesize these data to develop a predictive model of buoyancy regulation mechanisms based on ecological traits. This research will result in the first comprehensive picture of the evolution of and relationships among gas bladder morphology, gas gland physiology, gas bladder ventilation, and ecology. The fellow will gain experience with histological techniques and phylogenetic comparative methods and will strengthen mentorship and science communication skills by working with undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project will investigate how an alpine plant from the Rocky Mountains will respond and adapt to climate change. In the alpine, climate change causes earlier snowmelt that makes the alpine growing season longer, drier, and stressful for alpine plants. To respond to these changes, plants may either move to areas with more favorable conditions or stay put and adapt to the new climate. This project investigates how native alpine plants respond to earlier snowmelt and uses spatial models to predict how the species might move its range or adapt to climate change in the future. Alpine systems are very vulnerable to climate change because they are confined to mountaintops, and this research improves understanding of how these systems will change and how they can be protected in the future. The fellow will also contribute to society by mentoring community college students and doing community outreach for elementary schools.<br/><br/>Species distribution patterns are governed at multiple scales, from local habitat preferences to global geographic range limits. However, we have limited understanding of how population responses to microclimate variation impacts if and how fast range shifts can occur. Addressing this challenge requires an integrated understanding of genomic, phenotypic, and environmental variation within and among populations that span a species? range. This project will use a widespread alpine plant (Androsace septentrionalis) as a model system to evaluate the genetic and environmental drivers of range shifts in response to climate variation at multiple spatial scales. The fellow will use field and greenhouse experiments, genetic analyses, and modeling to understand how population responses to microclimate mediate range expansions under multiple climate change scenarios. These complementary approaches will provide new information about how ecological, demographic, and evolutionary processes at multiple scales collectively influence the dynamics of species ranges. This fellowship will train the fellow in experimental, genomic, and modeling approaches in preparation for an academic research career.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Environmental stressors and immune challenges are increasingly common facets of life for every organism. How individuals, populations, and species respond to these challenges, particularly when they may have synergistic negative effects, can influence individual fitness and ecology, and ecosystem-level processes. Quantifying these responses across biological levels within individuals is critical to understanding the co-evolution of stress and immune systems in diverse taxa, as well as the impacts that synergistic stressors may have on populations and ecosystems. This project will holistically characterize this synergy from a molecular to a behavioral scale in an endangered and understudied vertebrate immune system through the integration of multidisciplinary data, including whole-tissue transcriptome data in particular. The results of this project can be translated for application to other vertebrate and even human systems to improve our understanding of how they/we respond to simultaneous stress and disease in an increasingly stressful and pathogen-rich world.<br/><br/>This project seeks to answer the question: do sublethal disease and anthropogenic stressors synergistically exacerbate stress responses and decrease immunity in marine reptiles, and if so, through what mechanisms? Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) commonly face an epizootic disease (fibropapillomatosis; FP) that causes individuals to present with tumors that can limit maintenance behaviors and reduce survival probability. Vessel-turtle interactions at developmental habitats can further impact fitness, energy expenditure, and resource acquisition, and physiological responses to these interactions might synergize with simultaneous immune responses to FP. This project will focus on juvenile green turtles at a high-use area near Crystal River, FL. Green turtles at this area face both FP and a putatively stressful increase in vessel activity during a 2.5-month recreational scalloping season. The fellow will use a range of approaches (e.g., passive acoustic monitoring, animal-borne data collection systems, RNAseq) to quantify vessel abundance and potential interactions, and any turtle physiological and behavioral responses. The fellow will compare data across four categories (FP positive or negative, before or during scallop season) of sampled individuals to determine if and how stressors and immune challenges interact synergistically in marine reptiles. This project will provide the fellow with experience generating and analyzing data to study integrative physiology and disease ecology, and will allow the fellow to provide training in core computer science skills to students and researchers from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants breathe through small pores on their leaves called stomata that open to allow the uptake of carbon dioxide into leaf airspaces for photosynthesis, but at the expense of losing water. This exchange of water for carbon impacts plant growth, stress response, and function. It has been assumed that leaf airspaces are saturated with water vapor; however, this project will test this assumption, which is used to make important calculations in Earth systems models. If the project demonstrates these airspaces to be unsaturated, it would overturn decades of results and require significant changes. Furthermore, if plants can control the amount of water vapor in their leaf airspaces, this ability could be harnessed to make crops that use less water. This investigation can help clarify how plants adapt to changing conditions, at scales from a single leaf to global ecosystems. Furthermore, the fellow will expand the participation of diverse communities in science through teaching, mentoring, and science outreach.<br/><br/>This project will investigate a potential new Rule of Life: that plants can selectively restrict the rate of water loss from leaves without restricting photosynthetic carbon gain. The fellow will use experimental and computational approaches to validate unsaturation in leaf airspaces and assess bias in existing models caused by unsaturation. Two hypotheses will be tested: H1) Leaf airspace unsaturation varies among plant taxa, and increases proportionally with evaporative demand (vapor pressure deficit) and H2) The incorrect assumption of airspace saturation leads to bias in calculated leaf traits, which in turn skews both predictions from models and understanding of the physiology and ecology of carbon-water balance. To address H1, the fellow will use an experimental method to quantify unsaturation in a wide range of taxa and under different environmental conditions. For H2, the fellow will use computational approaches to quantify biases caused by unsaturation in leaf- and canopy-scale models of carbon and water exchange. The fellow will gain training and expertise in plant ecophysiology and biophysics, and will engage in teaching and mentoring activities for historically underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will delve into the deep-time record of amphibians to understand how they have been impacted by climatic shifts and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen that has driven devastating global declines in amphibians. To do so, the project will develop new genetic tools that will demonstrate how we can study the DNA of pathogens and their hosts across tens of thousands of years. Understanding the origin, ecology, and evolution of emerging pathogens like Bd is critically important, as the rising severity and incidence of emerging infectious disease events have profound impacts on public health, agriculture, and ecosystem resilience. Similarly, we can better respond to the current climate crisis if we can understand how climate-sensitive groups like amphibians have responded to past climatic shifts?and how climatic shifts and past disease outbreaks may have interacted. The PI will additionally continue ongoing work focused on increasing the linguistic diversity of science and will mentor undergraduates in applied amphibian research.  <br/><br/>This project comprises three specific research aims alongside two broader impact aims. Firstly, the PI will design custom genetic baits to selectively enrich and sequence DNA from Bd and the amphibians it infects, even when highly contaminated and fragmented. Secondly, she will use the new Bd baits to genotype Bd from amphibian museum specimens in three geographic putative points of origin for the pathogen to discover whether the 1970s-90s Bd epizootics in amphibians can be attributed to the global spread of a new Bd lineage. Thirdly, she will deploy both Bd and amphibian baits on ancient sediment cores from each of the putative geographic points of origin for panzootic Bd to explore how climatic shifts and the arrival of novel Bd lineages have contributed to amphibian community turnover over millennia. Fourthly, she will continue working towards a more multilingual academy, including publishing on how publishing science in multiple languages affects the frequency and geography of citations.

This project will identify the genes that respond to changes in the environment by studying a group of insects that have narrow diets. By changing the diets of these insects, the fellow will identify specific genes that respond to new environmental conditions. Finding these genes in insects will add to the current understanding of how organisms adapt to the environment and how changing environments can result in the formation of new species.

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Climate change is a major threat to biodiversity and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate. To mitigate this biodiversity crisis conservation decisions must be based on informed predictions of species response to environmental change. This research aims to identify where birds in California are most vulnerable to climate change today and where they will likely persist under future climate regimes. Results from this study will provide a novel conservation genomic framework to identify future climate-vulnerable areas and strongholds that are resilient to change and provide the basis for conservation implementation such as reserve design, ecosystem services, sustainable livelihoods, and environmental justice in California and beyond. The fellow will support broadening participation of diverse groups in STEM through mentorship and training, public outreach and engagement, and the development of conservation partnerships. <br/><br/>Accurately anticipating bird species? response to climate change remains one of the most pressing challenges for conservation initiatives across the country. Future forecasts often lack historical information to establish a baseline for how species have responded to past environmental changes. This requires a holistic approach to understanding contemporary and historic evolutionary adaptation (genomic signals of local adaptation) and population trends (increases, decreases, range shifts, extirpations, or extinctions) in response to climate change. The fellow will use natural history collections to compile modern and historical population and genomic data and use occupancy and demographic modeling to investigate historic changes in population sizes and the genetic and environmental factors involved in these fluctuations. The fellow will use this as a baseline to forecast species? evolutionary potential and identify where species will persist and be most vulnerable using future climate change projections. This research will develop a framework for incorporating collections-based research into conservation genomic studies that integrates occupancy, demographic, and predictive modeling.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. All organisms are influenced by their microbiomes and their environment. Lichens are a prime example. Fungi, algae, and bacteria grow together in symbiosis to form a lichen individual. They are also key parts of biodiversity in rapidly warming arctic and alpine habitats. However, many predictions of lichens? responses to environmental change ignore the responses of the microbial partners. Lichens faced with stressful conditions may rely on benefits from the partners to survive and grow. Alternatively, poorly performing partners may hinder responses to stress. The project will explore how microbes influence performance by transplanting a lichen across its range, along with characterizing the microbial community and its activity. The fellow will develop models to predict how lichen ranges may shift into the future. The research will also contribute to basic understanding of population biology in an understudied kingdom of life, fungi. <br/><br/>The composition of symbiotic partners within lichens varies across environmental gradients suggesting that engaging with locally adapted partners broadens the set of environments in which the lichen holobiont can persist, but this hypothesis is untested. The project will explore how microbial interactions shape the distribution of the lichen, Vulpicida pinastri, by integrating microbial metabarcoding and metabolomic analyses with a range-wide reciprocal transplant experiment and analysis of size-structured population models. Specifically, the fellow will characterize (1) the relationship between holobiont microbial community composition and metabolic phenotype, (2) how the phenotype that emerges from these microbial interactions influences fitness across environments, and (3) how novel environments may lead to shifts in microbial community composition. Individual lichen thalli will be transplanted across elevations at three latitudinal sites spanning the lichen?s broad North American distribution. To broaden participation in science, the fellow will mentor undergraduate researchers and develop teaching modules with authentic scientific context for high school students. In addition, the fellow will increase public availability of community observations of fungi by connecting widely used but currently distinct online platforms for biodiversity data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The relationship between Native American pastoralists and their animals has always been one of change and adaptation, even as it has provided continuity. This doctoral dissertation study investigates how and why a Native community?s herding practices and perceptions of wellbeing are changing in the 21st century. The project centers Native people?s perspectives and emphasizes the diversity of their experiences related to pastoralism to produce culturally relevant, empirically rigorous data useful to Tribal scientists, policy makers, and grassroots organizations working to support herders in pursuing wellbeing sustainably and in line with their varied aspirations. This locally focused work is a necessary complement to efforts and commitments at the federal level toward maintaining and enhancing Tribal prosperity, resilience, and self-determination in the face of changing, often challenging social, economic, and environmental contexts. The project trains a graduate student in methods of scientific data collection and analysis and builds capacity for the future conduct of scientific research in this context.<br/><br/>The objectives pf this doctoral project are to discover and explain (1) why some Native American herders persist in the practice of raising livestock despite numerous challenges while others opt not to herd despite this activity?s traditional value and importance, (2) why some herders conserve a traditional livestock breed while others choose non-traditional breeds, and (3) whether and how subjective wellbeing is related to variations in conceptions of a life well lived and in herders? specific practices in pursuit of a good life. The study integrates semi-structured interviews, structured surveys, participant observation, and mixed-methods analysis. The research innovatively combines case-based causal analysis with ethnographic and quantitative methods from cognitive anthropology to advance understandings of (1) the crucial link between culture (defined as shared meanings) and action, (2) processes of social and cultural change, and (3) diversity in perceptions and practices of wellbeing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Bats navigate their surroundings by making calls and listening for echoes as they bounce off objects near them (echolocating). This project will investigate the behavior of echolocating bats in groups of bats by analyzing their echolocation sounds and determining how they adjust these sounds when around other bats. Echolocating bats can navigate completely dark spaces using their advanced sense of hearing to listen for weak echoes reflecting off surfaces, even when surrounded by many other echolocating bats. Understanding how bats accomplish this will help engineers design better sensing systems, such as autonomous sonar robots, that can perform in challenging environments involving interference and uncertainty. This will also further the understanding of group behaviors of multiple bat species, which can lead to better surveying and conservation efforts. The activities of this project will be leveraged to train students from diverse backgrounds in conducting research, and to support the fellow?s service activities in scientific organizations to highlight the research of postdoctoral researchers from historically underrepresented groups and strengthen connections within the postdoctoral community. <br/><br/>This research involves recording groups of echolocating bats with synchronized arrays of ultrasonic microphones and thermal cameras. At least three species will be recorded at natural roosting sites: Myotis lucifigus, Myotis grisescens, and Tadarida brasiliensis. Synchronized acoustic and video data will be used to track the flight and echolocation behavior of the collective group and individuals within the group and determine whether individual bats dynamically adjust their echolocation (for example, their frequencies or emission rate) based on the presence of other echolocation sounds. These analyses will be used to build parametrized computational models of the sensorimotor behaviors of each species and identify similarities across species. This modeling work will enhance understanding of the behavioral heuristics used by individual bats taking part in collective group behaviors. To accomplish these goals, the fellow will conduct fieldwork, and build partnerships with a variety of organizations. Courses on deep-learning techniques will allow the fellow to gain the computational skills required for modeling echolocation behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research focuses on improving understanding of plant species interactions and coexistence under different environmental contexts, a critical need in the context of increasing global change. Rainfall patterns, including frequency and intensity, are shifting with climate change which can negatively affect plant communities, including driving losses in species abundance and diversity. Although prior research assessed plant response to changes in precipitation averages, it remains unclear how changes in precipitation frequency and intensity can affect plant performance. Using four annual plant species from a threatened California serpentine ecosystem, this research will inform how interactions among plants, such as competition, change under different environmental contexts and scale up to affect coexistence. Further, the research will help inform local conservation of the focal plant community and a federally threatened butterfly subspecies that is dependent on multiple focal plant species. Undergraduate and graduate students at the Fellow?s host institutions will benefit from this research through the development of teaching modules and undergraduate mentorship. <br/><br/>For their research, the Fellow will quantify plant performance, species interactions, and coexistence in a greenhouse setting. They will ask Q1) how do three precipitation regimes that differ in amount, frequency, and intensity affect survival, growth, and reproduction across species that vary in functional traits? Then, by planting focal species alone or with different background densities of conspecific or heterospecific neighbors, they will ask Q2) how environmentally-dependent species interactions mediate plant performance. Finally, they will ask Q3) how expectations of species coexistence versus competitive exclusion differ across precipitation regimes. This research will promote the training goals of the Fellow, including 1) further developing quantitative and analysis skills, such as Bayesian analyses, 2) managing greenhouse experiments and working with annual plants, and 3) training in pedagogy and mentorship.

This research will uncover how healthy microbial communities are maintained within social bee nests. Social bees live in large groups alongside stored food, making them susceptible to pathogens and food spoilage microbes. To prevent infection, bees may rely on associated yeasts that live within the nest and are known to produce antimicrobial compounds that may help maintain a healthy nest microbiome. This project will investigate how antimicrobial production varies among yeasts and how these compounds impact the growth of detrimental microbes, bee health, and bee behavior. This research will fill an important gap in the current understanding of these bee-associated yeasts, which remain an understudied portion of the microbiome. The results of this research will contribute to bumble bee conservation strategies by providing greater insight into bee-microbe interactions.

Yeasts will be acquired from multiple sources (bees, other insects, and fruit/food spoilage) and cultured in sophorolipid production media. Sophorolipids will then be isolated, quantified, and compared across strains and isolation sources. The impact of sophorolipids on nest communities and bee health will then be investigated. Yeast strains varying in sophorolipid production will be tested against the bee pathogens Ascosphaera apis and Aspergillus flavus in plate-based inhibition assays. Additionally, synthetic microbial communities of common flower-inhabiting microbes will be grown with and without Starmerella yeasts to determine impacts on community succession. These treatment communities will be fed to colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to measure the effects on bee performance. Finally, the impacts of sophorolipids and yeasts on bee feeding and foraging behavior will be tested using CAF assays and y-tube assays, respectively. The volatile compound composition of each yeast and sophorolipid concentration will be measured using GC-MS to determine compounds underlying bee preferences.

During the production of sperm and egg cells, a process called recombination occurs where genetic material is swapped between the two sets of DNA inherited from each parent. This results in each sperm or egg having a unique mix of the parents' genes, explaining why siblings from the same parents can be different. Recombination is important for evolution and plays a significant role in how organisms respond to environmental change. For example, recombination allows organisms to form new combinations of helpful genes or to remove harmful mutations that arise. Thanks to advances in technology, detailed studies on recombination have recently become possible. This research uses the latest genetic tools and builds on existing knowledge about evolution from studies on the Atlantic silverside fish. The goal is to understand how the rate of recombination differs between males and females and across various environments. Additionally, the Fellow will mentor undergraduate students in independent research projects and organize support groups for academics. <br/><br/>This research will investigate the evolutionary dynamics of recombination landscapes and adaptive trait architectures across varying degrees of gene flow by leveraging genomic tools, common garden experiments, and forward-time evolutionary simulations.

Organisms are facing new environmental threats because of climate change. Understanding why and how some populations persist despite stressful conditions is paramount to protecting life. This project uses genetic tools to understand adaptation to heat stress in giant kelp. Giant kelp is an ecologically important species under threat from climate change. During ocean warming events, giant kelp undergo extreme declines. Many populations recover shortly afterwards, but it is unclear how resilient kelp will be as ocean temperatures continue to rise. Using samples from before and after a marine heat wave, this project will measure the impact of warming on kelp populations and identify genetic variants underlying heat tolerance. These results will provide a foundation for the understanding of how wild populations adapt and persist and inform the management of giant kelp. The fellow will incorporate results into climate change education programs. <br/><br/>Adaptation is one mechanism by which populations and species can meet environmental challenges posed by climate change. This project investigates adaptive genetic variation in giant kelp with three objectives: (1) Determine if warming events are associated with genetic signatures of population decline, (2) Identify adaptive variants that play an important role in the resiliency of giant kelp to warming events, (3) Determine the history of adaptive variants, including their origin and age. Vital contributions of this project include an assessment of the frequency at which adaptive variants are generated through new mutations or exist as standing genetic variation and the importance of their dispersal through gene flow for facilitating adaptation and population persistence. The fellow will receive training in whole-genome and low-coverage bioinformatics, analyses for determining gene function, and experience building collaborations with diverse groups of stakeholders and conservation managers.

Increasingly, researchers approach this problem by developing statistical models that predict plant survivorship, growth, and reproduction from weather data. The results can then be used to forecast population growth under different potential future climates. Still, identifying the most significant ways that climate affects plants is challenging. Many different components of weather could be important, from average yearly temperature and rainfall to extreme heat or water stress over a short time. Many environmental changes are happening at the same time, and separating the effects of weather from other factors can be difficult. Also, multiple potential methods could be used, and few studies have evaluated how the choice of method might influence the results. This project will analyze long-term data from multiple plant species in coastal California to compare methods for modeling the effects of weather variation on survival, reproduction, and population growth. The research will provide important new information about the strengths and limitations of different approaches for predicting weather effects on plant populations, as well as about the effects of climate changes such as increased drought on this ecosystem. The project will train a mid-career scientist and undergraduate students in recently developed data analysis methods, expanding access to key skills.<br/><br/>This research will analyze 17?27-year long data sets for six species from the northern California Channel Islands (CI),10 years of data for a seventh species from a nearby mainland site, and artificially constructed data simulated from known parameters. The analyses will quantify correlations among different potential weather metrics, assess whether correlations are changing, and determine which metrics show trends that could be confounded with other causes of population decline. Alternative statistical models linking weather variables to demographic rates will be developed for each of the focal plant species, with multiple methods grounded in likelihood-based metrics such as AIC or in cross-validation approaches. The results of these alternative methods will be compared based on which variables and time windows are included, the strength of relationships identified for different parameters, and the strength of support for the models. Finally, the project will develop demographic population models for two of the species, testing sensitivity of model predictions under different climate scenarios to the methods used for parameterizing links with weather variables. Analyses will be used to determine which demographic rates are most important to variation in model predictions and uncertainty in driver estimation. This work will provide valuable resources for researchers navigating the complex diversity of statistical approaches available to model weather effects on plant demography, in addition to new insights into the climate drivers most important to ongoing and future changes in coastal California plant communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Agricultural expansion and urbanization have transformed how nutrients cycle and accumulate in the landscape which has had ecological and social consequences. Restoring Indigenous socio-ecological systems (SES) could mitigate harmful nutrient accumulation and enhance the health and value of the ecosystem. The Fellow will use a two-eyed seeing approach to study ecosystem changes in Indigenous SES undergoing restoration. Two-eyed seeing incorporates conventional and Indigenous lenses to generate understanding beyond what either approach could determine independently. This research will set a strong foundation for scientific advancement in understanding ecosystem change, and biology more broadly, and will also support culturally grounded research that elevates expertise of future scholars from diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>The Native Hawaiian proverb I ka w? ma mua, i ka w? ma hope ? moving forward into the future with eyes to the past suggests that the solutions to current social and ecological issues may exist in ancestral knowledge. Yet few studies have investigated nutrient dynamics during and after the restoration of Indigenous SES and the implications of cultural restoration for ecosystem services. The Fellow will explore nutrient dynamics in Hawai?i where past plantation agriculture and urbanization have modified nutrient exchange across the landscape. Current initiatives to restore Indigenous SES make Hawai?i ideal for evaluating the effect of restoration on nutrient exchange at local and regional scales. Aim 1 will quantify spatiotemporal nutrient dynamics in SES using conventional and Indigenous observation techniques. Aim 2 will generate a predictive model for primary productivity and nutrient dynamics that integrates remotely sensed and field data across diverse landscapes. This research will develop a scalable, transferable framework to enrich our understanding of nutrient dynamics and provide insight into the potential for Indigenous SES to harness modern nutrient regimes to enhance ecosystem services worldwide. The Fellow will organize workshops for postdoctoral scholars and graduate students in biology to explore opportunities to incorporate cultural knowledge into their research. The Fellow will also mentor undergraduate students from the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community through the Research Experience for Undergraduates: Environmental Biology for Pacific Islanders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Urbanization is often coupled with increased habitat fragmentation and shifting selective pressures on wildlife. While some species can readily adjust to these man-made habitats, others are less resilient and may experience population declines. As cities continue to expand, understanding how wild populations respond  to urban growth will be important. Rapid adaptation (e.g., adaptation on ecological timescales) is one potential response that can lead to long-term population persistence. The proposed research will compare historical and contemporary collections of wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) from around New York City (NYC) to investigate evolutionary responses to urbanization and identify genomic variation that contributes to rapid adaptation. The fellow will also increase public engagement with and awareness of urban biodiversity, by using the data generated from this project to develop and disseminate genomic datasets and K-12 classroom modules on urban wildlife and bioinformatics. <br/><br/>Using computational and statistical methods that combine environmental, genetic, and phenotypic data, the fellow will 1) characterize temporal shifts in urban population structure and genetic diversity and 2) identify genomic signatures of rapid urban adaptation, including parallel adaptive changes across space and time. The extensive genomic resources house mice provide as a model organism will facilitate the connection of genomic variation to phenotypes tied to fitness. Additionally, museum specimens open a unique window into a time period of increasing anthropogenic activity, which can help establish important baselines from which to evaluate genomic change and identify putatively adaptive loci. The fellow will receive training in low-coverage whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, as well as selection scan methodology.

For example, mountain lakes have been stocked with non-native fish that are ecologically disruptive predators. While much is known about the impacts of these fish on the sensitive alpine ecosystems, there is little known about the recovery trajectories once fish are removed. After fish removal, a succession of different prey species may reestablish in the lakes, resulting in some lakes that look like natural fishless ecosystems, while other lake communities may not recover to a pre-invasion condition. This project examines the return of the former prey species and delves into the functional traits of those prey species and ecosystem functions crucial for ecosystem resilience. The research will provide new insights into the connections between taxonomic and functional recovery. The project?s focus on functional redundancy as a vulnerability indicator will contribute to the broader understanding of ecosystem resilience. Using a combination of large-scale lake surveys and experiments, this project will elucidate fundamental principles of community recovery and establish a robust foundation for trait-based conservation in the face of unprecedented and pressing environmental challenges. Additional impacts include educating local communities about natural history and ecological research and creating an educational resource to train the next generation of ecologists in multivariate data analysis. <br/><br/>Community assembly frameworks, centered on taxonomic units, inadequately predict ecosystem function due to context-dependent species traits, leaving a gap in our understanding of ecosystem dynamics. This project bridges the gap between taxonomic and functional perspectives in ecology, recognizing the importance of traits in driving ecosystem function. The mountain lakes of the Sierra Nevada in California will be used as a natural laboratory for studying community reassembly following non-native fish removal. Plankton and trait data from 421 lakes will allow a robust comparison of the recovery trajectories of zooplankton community taxonomic and functional structures following fish eradication. To complement the survey data, a replicated whole-lake fish removal will examine the short-term dynamics of zooplankton recovery. Finally, a large-scale mesocosm experiment will determine how communities with varying levels of functional redundancy respond to disturbance, testing the utility of functional redundancy as a community vulnerability indicator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The lack of a high-quality observational climate database or useful projections of future climate scenarios, in particular, are major roadblocks that prevent implementing proper adaptation measures in the region. Therefore, the overarching goal of the ACCORD project is to build the first multidisciplinary network of networks focused on climate change across the Andes, by taking advantage of the multidisciplinary expertise of the 10 largest international networks to produce scientific breakthroughs that have so far been elusive due to the lack of interdisciplinary and international cooperation. This project will provide a new Andean climate database shared on an accessible platform, improve understanding of Andean mountain circulation, analyze how the intensity and frequency of extreme events (droughts, storms) will change, and document how climate change will affect glaciers, snow cover and water availability going forward. The results will be displayed using advanced visualization tools, making them easy to understand for policy-makers and the public at large. In addition, this project will contribute to training the next generation of US-based scientists that are capable of addressing scientific grand challenges, by involving students and early career scientists in all aspects of the project. While the focus of these activities is on the Andes, many of the processes affecting glaciers, snow cover and extreme events also play out in other mountain regions, including in the United States.<br/><br/>The AccelNet-ACCORD network of networks will develop a new and improved Andean hydroclimate observational database, advanced understanding of mountain circulation and dynamics such as orographic precipitation and atmospheric rivers, thoroughly constrained future extreme event characteristics (megadroughts, convective storms), and narrowed projections of future changes in the Andean cryosphere and water resources. To achieve these aims, AccelNet-ACCORD will also take advantage of new high-resolution and convection permitting model simulations. The AccelNet-ACCORD project will also prepare a globally competent scientific workforce in an international and interdisciplinary setting by: 1) Immersing them in interdisciplinary research activities in an international setting; 2) Strengthening cultural literacy of students through a joint international online seminar series; 3) Providing experiential learning opportunities for US graduate students and postdocs through two international summer schools and one WRF modeling workshop with hands-on training; and 4) Broadening participation of diverse groups in STEM by hosting Annual Climate Change Days reaching 300 undergraduate students.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This fellowship will explore ways in which organisms are connected to one another, across different levels of biological organization. Species may be linked spatially by occupying the same physical area, or ecologically by interactions or competition for resources. However, it remains unknown what genome (DNA) level features facilitate these interactions or how those features are modified when organisms become ecologically linked or co-dependent. This project will investigate instances of genome-to-genome interactions and use this information to show how organisms within microbial communities have been connected to each other over time. This research will give insights into how organisms cooperate on the ecosystem scale, how to identify and characterize these interactions, and how to apply this framework across diverse and changing environments. Research activities will be complemented by outreach efforts designed to educate the public about local biodiversity and microscopy.<br/><br/>DNA transfer, or the horizontal movement of genetic material from one genome to another, can serve as a record of which organisms have come in contact, directly or indirectly, throughout evolutionary history. Using this idea of ?genome connectivity?, this fellowship will generate data from diverse microbial communities to identify patterns of DNA transfers and use them to uncover taxa or trophic level-specific trends to model past and present ecological relationships. Historically, information encoded in genomes was thought to primarily travel vertically, from parent to offspring. However, it has now been well-established that organisms across all domains of life frequently exchange genetic information horizontally; when whole genes are transferred and retained within new genomes, they often encode adaptive functions. Most research on DNA transfer has focused on individual species but this phenomenon has not yet been investigated on the community level, where transfers may be driving or driven by the ecological interactions of resident organisms or stressors they encounter. Using a combination of theoretical, multi-omics, and phylogenomic approaches, this project will build a pipeline to directly characterize microbial communities, that takes a bottom-up approach from genomes to ecology and can be used as a predictive way to characterize past and present stress responses within an environment. The fellow will be trained in machine learning, -omics, and ecological modeling approaches and will pass on these skills to undergraduates who will be mentored as part of this project. The work will be integrated into broader impact efforts, including BioBlitz events to catalog local microbes, and to develop microscope-sharing programs to inspire a new generation of naturalists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coral reef ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots that offer immense economic benefits through fisheries and ecotourism. Photosynthetic algae live inside coral tissue in a mutually beneficial endosymbiotic relationship essential to coral survival. Rising ocean temperatures disrupt this endosymbiosis in a deadly phenomenon known as ?bleaching? wherein the colorful photosynthetic algae are expelled from the coral, leading to ecosystem collapse. Over the past several decades, ~50% of the world?s corals have been lost. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying coral bleaching, preventing the development of successful amelioration actions. This research will benefit society by elucidating symbiotic mechanisms using genetic and biochemical techniques to better understand coral bleaching. <br/><br/>Upon symbiosis formation, algae enter the animal tissue from the environment and reprogram host biology to live within coral cells. A key question in the field is to identify genetic factors that regulate the formation of endosymbiosis and its breakdown due to heat stress. In this research, the fellow will develop a protocol to isolate and purify symbiotic cells at different stages of algal infection. The proteome of these cell populations will be characterized by proteomics to determine host factors that change upon symbiosis formation to identify key regulators. Next, these putative regulators will be tested using cell biology and functional genetic methods to find those necessary for symbiosis formation. Finally, the fellow will characterize the conservation of these proteins across reef-building corals to determine the core regulatory mechanisms of symbiosis and study the role of these regulators during heat stress and bleaching.

Alternative reproductive tactics are discrete differences in reproductive behavior found within a single population, and they are often accompanied by variation in reproductive morphology. One example is illustrated by the ?searching? and ?guarding? males found in some species of the two-lined salamanders, a group of semi-aquatic, lungless salamanders that are widespread and abundant in the eastern United States. This project focuses on understanding the biotic and abiotic mechanisms responsible for maintaining this polymorphism in urban streams in metro Atlanta. Through data collected from field sampling, genomic sequencing, and behavioral trials, this project will evaluate the roles of natural environmental heterogeneity, anthropogenic landscape changes, and sperm competition in the long-term coexistence of reproductive variation in these amphibians. These results will contribute to a more general understanding of the maintenance of genotypic and phenotypic diversity in populations. Furthermore, this award will create 12 paid undergraduate research positions and allow 45 undergraduate students to engage in authentic, inquiry-driven research through a Team Research course at Kennesaw State University.<br/><br/>This project takes advantage of a new and tractable system to study the evolutionary maintenance of fixed, morphologically distinct, and genetically determined alternative reproductive tactics in wild populations. With undergraduate students, PI Pierson will develop and use genotyping assays to characterize the frequency of alternative reproductive tactics in two-lined salamanders and will collect paired environmental data from dozens of streams in metro Atlanta. They will then evaluate relationships between tactic frequencies and natural and anthropogenic landscape features to contribute to broader theory focused on the role of environmental heterogeneity in the maintenance of polymorphisms. Next, PI Pierson and undergraduate students will develop and use a new genomic assay to determine paternity of clutches laid following courtship trials. They will then use these data to evaluate evidence for multiple paternity, tactic-specific sperm competition advantages, and first- or last-male sperm precedence, which will inform more general ideas about how temporal variation in reproductive opportunities contributes to the maintenance of variation in reproductive behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a key enabler to this new paradigm, smart computing devices (e.g., Industrial Internet of Things) leverage their computing capability and wireless connectivity to form a hierarchical service functionality, providing the ability to perform real-time data analytics, to detect anomalies, and to make predictions to improve the efficiency and quality of manufacturing. Although this paradigm is promising, environmental sustainability issues are becoming increasingly urgent, especially during industry expansion. The substantial increase of new device production and adoption inevitably leads to higher greenhouse-gas emissions, contributing to global warming, which in turn results in economic losses for industries. This project develops a framework, termed sustainable revitalization, to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions by migrating current devices to their most suitable locations in the service hierarchy for continuing service. As such, computing devices maximize their lifespan by moving around inside a system at each device-updating stage while minimizing their environmental impact through greenhouse-gas emissions by avoiding frequent production and disposal processes during industry expansion. This project also seeks to broaden the scientific training of undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups in the field of environmental science and engineering, computation optimization, and communication, preparing them with the cross-disciplinary skills needed to succeed in the modern workforce.<br/><br/>This project introduces lifecycle sustainability into computing-system design and maintenance. By adopting an adapted approach to life-cycle assessment and by constructing new metrics for environmental sustainability as an optimization objective, this project addresses greenhouse-gas emissions during industry expansion. Specifically, this project lays a foundation by establishing a robust system boundary to comprehend the greenhouse-gas emissions of computing devices across various lifecycle stages, thus informing subsequent sustainable-revitalization efforts. To find optimal pathways for device migration, this project pioneers inventory analysis by integrating demand-based migration and compatibility-optimized computation strategies. From a system-design perspective, having these strategies within the system boundary facilitates examining the strategies' effectiveness. Based on the optimization strategies of migrated devices, this project introduces collaborative on-device learning that dynamically adapts smart devices to new scenarios while upholding environmental sustainability and addressing communication challenges through a novel physical-level parallel inclusive communication. This new methodology will help fully utilize obsolete computing and communication devices to meet environmental-sustainability demands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main objects of study in this project are modular forms, complex analytic functions that encode a wide variety of arithmetic information in various ways and play a major role in modern number theory, with connections to combinatorics, algebraic geometry, representation theory, topology, and mathematical physics. While the most classical modular forms are holomorphic, real-analytic modular forms have also been studied for decades and become essential tools in analytic number theory. More recently, harmonic Maass forms have appeared in many applications, for example, to indefinite theta functions, combinatorics, and elliptic curves. This project will explore the arithmetic information encoded by the harmonic Maass forms and their closely related generalizations, and ways of extending classical methods from analytic number theory to study them.  The PI will also use the grant to support the dissemination of the research ideas by the PI and her PhD students at conferences and to organize number theory seminars.<br/><br/>The PI plans to explore the connections between real-analytic modular forms and L-functions. This project will elucidate connections between values of L-functions and harmonic and polyharmonic Maass forms, and will use these connections to develop new methods of constructing modular forms and summation formulas for mock modular forms. The methods will utilize differential operators on modular forms, the spectral theory of automorphic forms, and techniques from the analytic theory of L-functions such as converse theorems.

This project will explore how interactions among individuals drive ecosystem scale function in coral reefs. Tropical coral reefs provide critical ecosystem services and harbor biodiversity but are threatened due to increased climate extremes and human impacts. However, highly social coral reef fishes may provide a path to resilience through their group-living and collective foraging behavior that links the open ocean to benthic food webs, boosting productivity even when reefs are degraded. Yet, precisely how such collective behavior drives ecological function, and how this process might be affected by environmental change, remains unknown. This project will advance scientific knowledge of collective behavior and help predict how important ecosystems such as coral reefs will respond to rapid environmental change long-term.

While significant research has explored malware detection for PCs and mobile devices, these methods are not suitable for IoT systems due to their diverse operating systems and low power. Current models also struggle against sophisticated attacks that aim to evade detection. To address these challenges, the project team is developing DANGER-IoT, an approach to IoT malware detection that works across heterogeneous platforms, is efficient for low-power devices, and robust against advanced attacks. The researchers are collaborating with industry experts to ensure the project's ideas work well in real-world settings and are creating open-source tools and datasets.

The first goal is to create a generic model that can detect malware across heterogeneous IoT platforms by constructing a common embedding space for similar functions across different operating systems and architectures. The project's second aim is to ensure efficiency for low-power devices by applying model compression techniques adapted from explainable AI and model pruning. To enhance robustness, the project will explore large-language models for code-style transfer, making malware appear benign to existing classifiers, and using the results to design a novel moving-target defense.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow who will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Sediment covering the ocean floor is one of the most widespread habitats on earth, and it is home to representatives of about one-third of major animal groups across the Tree of Life. In order to live in the spaces between grains of sand, these animals have to be extremely small (less than 0.5 mm in size) and are referred to as meiofauna. Many species of meiofauna evolved from large-bodied ancestors and are secondarily reduced or miniaturized. Miniaturization happens gradually over time or through evolutionary shortcuts, like changes in the timing of development. In the case of these evolutionary shortcuts, the adult miniaturized species resembles the juvenile or larval form of a closely related, large-bodied species. This research will investigate how animals can modify their genomes in order to make drastic changes to their bodies using these evolutionary shortcuts. Understanding the flexibility of animal genomes is important as increased pressure is placed on animals to adapt to rapidly shifting climates. The fellow will also create publicly available activities for educators focusing on increasing ocean and biodiversity literacy in school-age children. <br/><br/>Changes in DNA methylation correspond with major developmental transitions and growth but remain largely unexplored in the context of miniaturization.

Like a personal computer, each computer server in a data center includes a set of computing hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and disks. In recent years, a new data-center architecture called resource disaggregation has arisen. With resource disaggregation, different types of hardware resources are divided into separate pools (e.g., a CPU pool and a memory pool), and an application can run with any available resources in a pool, thereby improving the resource utilization of a data center. Prior resource-disaggregation research has taken two main approaches: (1) asking application developers to port their software to a resource-disaggregation-specific model and (2) changing the operating system to add support for resource disaggregation. The former requires manual work, while the latter incurs significant performance overhead because of its generality. To solve these shortcomings, this project proposes to leverage application features and behaviors in building resource-disaggregation solutions. The project's novelties are a new direction in resource-disaggregation research, new computing layers explored when building resource-disaggregation systems, and the study of data-center applications from the perspective of resource disaggregation. The project's broader significance and importance is to render resource disaggregation a cost-efficient and performance-efficient option for production data-center and cloud environments that often host a range of applications with diverse behaviors and performance requirements launched by multiple users.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project aims to extract and leverage application-inherent semantics, including static and dynamic semantics such as memory access patterns, data object ownership, type-based data structures, execution profiles, and language runtime activities. This project lays the groundwork for constructing programming languages, compilers, and system support that can integrate a comprehensive range of program semantics into diverse disaggregation choices. This project aims to enable disaggregation systems to customize, without manual intervention, these multiple choices based on application-specific behaviors rather than relying on generic decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the current scientific understanding of how the virus transmits in this new host is not fully known, designing effective guidelines or rules to control the spread of H5N1 is difficult. Such scientific understanding is critical for developing federal and state decisions, but also in guiding the actions by non-governmental stakeholders to mitigate risk. These decisions and actions are shaped by H5N1 information, risk perceptions, and understanding of the causes of the problem. This project enhances national health interests by investigating how different stakeholders, from government officials to the general public, use and perceive information about H5N1. The insights gained from this research help guide better communication and decision making for safeguarding public and animal health. <br/><br/>This proposal seeks to understand what information informs decisions at the federal and state levels and compare this to the information guiding veterinarians and the U.S. public in their risk perceptions and decision making.

Accurate computer simulation can help confirm or refute scientific theories by comparison with experiment, can replace experiments, and can be used in engineering design processes.

This project removes important obstacles to the adoption of IEMs in such a setting, and it validates the case for them through two ambitious motivating nonlinear model applications involving interfaces. The efficient solution of elliptic (i.e. globally coupled) computational problems remains a major challenge, and IEMs have crucial strengths in this area. While one major strength of IEMs is the use of boundary (i.e. lower-dimensional) unknowns to represent volume solutions, the presence of nonlinearities invariably necessitates the use of volume unknowns. We demonstrate that this use can often be kept localized, particularly in problems modeling interfaces, while maintaining IEM's suitability for problems on unbounded domains. We propose a new method for the evaluation of the resulting volume potentials that retains high-order accuracy in the presence of complex geometry. The project builds on recent advances made by the PI on high-order accurate fast algorithms for the evaluation of layer potentials, the building blocks of IEMs, in the presence of complex geometry in two and three dimensions. We further propose research leading to major efficiency gains in the underlying singular quadrature method and, motivated by empirical observations, a theoretical investigation of the influence of geometry on the accuracy of that method. A final line of proposed research concerns the reduction of resolution demands posed by boundary layers, embodied in IEMs by rapidly-decaying Green's functions, which often result in increases of computational cost that threaten to make certain simulations infeasible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like a personal computer, each computer server in a data center includes a set of computing hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and disks. In recent years, a new data-center architecture called resource disaggregation has arisen. With resource disaggregation, different types of hardware resources are divided into separate pools (e.g., a CPU pool and a memory pool), and an application can run with any available resources in a pool, thereby improving the resource utilization of a data center. Prior resource-disaggregation research has taken two main approaches: (1) asking application developers to port their software to a resource-disaggregation-specific model and (2) changing the operating system to add support for resource disaggregation. The former requires manual work, while the latter incurs significant performance overhead because of its generality. To solve these shortcomings, this project proposes to leverage application features and behaviors in building resource-disaggregation solutions. The project's novelties are a new direction in resource-disaggregation research, new computing layers explored when building resource-disaggregation systems, and the study of data-center applications from the perspective of resource disaggregation. The project's broader significance and importance is to render resource disaggregation a cost-efficient and performance-efficient option for production data-center and cloud environments that often host a range of applications with diverse behaviors and performance requirements launched by multiple users.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project aims to extract and leverage application-inherent semantics, including static and dynamic semantics such as memory access patterns, data object ownership, type-based data structures, execution profiles, and language runtime activities. This project lays the groundwork for constructing programming languages, compilers, and system support that can integrate a comprehensive range of program semantics into diverse disaggregation choices. This project aims to enable disaggregation systems to customize, without manual intervention, these multiple choices based on application-specific behaviors rather than relying on generic decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many animals rely on microbial partners to carry out key biological functions. However, it remains unclear how these partnerships may contribute to host species diversity. This research leverages the unique geography and diversity of Hawaii to understand what role microbes play in shaping host diversity across multiple scales. Two groups of related insects are found in Hawaii yet one group holds much more species diversity than the other. Despite this, both groups contain species adapted to lava tube caves. The parallel histories of these two groups provide a strong framework for a new model system for the study of symbiosis. This project will produce genomic data of hosts and symbionts.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. A long-standing challenge of disease ecology is how to scale individual variation in immune responses up to population-level pathogen spread. This challenge is further complicated by how individual differences in immunity can be caused by stressors (e.g. energetically costly life stages, exposure to contaminants). This project investigates how stressors affect immunity and infection as well as how differences in immunity translate to pathogen spread within the larger host population. This project will broaden participation by providing research experiences to underrepresented undergraduate students in the field and in the lab as well as provide quantitative training to undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Host immunity is the primary barrier to infection and, as such, can determine disease risks in natural populations. Intrinsic and extrinsic stressors throughout the lifespan of a host can alter immunity, which can then impact pathogen dynamics within the host population. This research aims to understand the complex interplay between wildlife stressors, immunity, and infection. Specifically, this research will quantify wildlife immunity under simultaneous stressors of reproduction and contaminant exposure at the individual level, then use mathematical models to scale those responses up to shape infection dynamics at the population level. Simonis will build epidemiological models and explore how varying relationships between contaminant exposure and immune-relevant parameters drive infection prevalence across the host annual cycle. For empirical data collection, Simonis will capture big brown bats in Oklahoma, which are regularly exposed to contaminants due to their resiliency in human-disturbed habitats and also harbor coronaviruses across their range in North America. Blood, saliva, fecal, and fur samples will be collected from bats to measure contaminant exposure, innate immunity, and coronavirus infection status and intensity. Underlying empirical relationships will inform immune-relevant parameters in epidemiological models, and Simonis will identify parameter combination(s) that have the greatest likelihood for influencing coronavirus prevalence in the field. This project will inform how human-induced environmental disruptions can drive seasonal epidemics in natural populations and will provide the mentorship and training needed for Simonis? research goals in disease ecology and ecoimmunology and to obtain a tenure-track faculty position.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To ensure the safety and security of executing user-developed programs in the operating system context, the Linux kernel implements algorithms for static program analysis through abstract interpretation, encapsulated into an in-kernel component called the eBPF verifier. Given that Linux is a widely used operating system, a bug in the eBPF verifier can compromise the safety and security of all devices using it.

It is impractical to test a system as completely separate units without considering their dependencies. Software engineers have devised a mechanism called mocking, which replaces the test dependencies of the function under test by creating mock objects. Various dedicated mocking frameworks provide well-constructed application programming interfaces (APIs) to support the mocking mechanism in practice. However, practitioners often find adopting these frameworks challenging. This award targets the following challenges: (1) there is a knowledge gap regarding what to mock and what not to mock in unit testing; (2) despite mocking being used in practice for decades, there is little understanding of good practices to follow and bad practices to avoid in mocking; and (3) mocking and its maintenance require a high level of expertise and manual effort, which raises the bar for using mocking frameworks. This award aims to contribute valuable empirical knowledge and develop a framework with automated support for achieving ""just enough"" and ""maintainable"" mocking in unit testing. The proposed research will facilitate creating more independent, efficient, easier to debug, and more maintainable unit test cases. The research team also plans to develop an advanced course about mocking for undergraduate seniors and graduate students in Software Engineering, Computer Science, or related fields. Additionally, the team plans to prepare publicly available online tutorials and training sessions to benefit practitioners interested in building skills in mocking.<br/><br/>The research team will focus on three research directions in this project. First, conducting an in-depth empirical study of mocking practices. The objective is to provide extensive empirical knowledge about what to mock and what not to mock, including good ""design patterns"" to follow and bad ""anti-patterns"" to avoid in mocking. Such empirical knowledge benefits practitioners by offering guidance and references for effectively using mocking framework APIs. Second, developing a framework to enable ""just enough"" and ""maintainable"" mocking. This framework consists of two key components: (1) automated detection of dependencies to mock to achieve ""just enough"" mocking; and (2) automated detection and refactoring of mocking ""anti-patterns"" to ensure good design and maintainability of mock objects in test cases.

State-of-the-art instrumentation continually improves the ability to collect these data; however, equally important are sophisticated software packages that perform the careful processing of raw data into calibrated spectra ready for scientific analysis. The PypeIt (pronounced ""pipe it"") software package has emerged as a comprehensive data-processing product that leverages modern, industry-driven support infrastructure for open-source code development. This NSF award enables PypeIt to expand into a full-fledged open-source ecosystem (OSE) that will support nearly all medium- and large-class telescopes owned and operated by institutions in the United States. The wide reach of this effort reduces barriers to processing data from both new and existing spectrographs, improving the scientific productivity of both experienced astronomers and those relatively new to processing spectroscopic data. The OSE also introduces PypeIt support for commercially available spectrographs used by amateur astronomers, enabling them to quickly produce calibrated, science-ready spectra from their observations.<br/><br/>Although initially developed by a small team at the University of California Observatories for instruments at the Lick and W. M. Keck Observatories, PypeIt now supports processing data from more than 50 spectrographs at 18 observatories worldwide. Its success can be attributed to two of its guiding principles: (1) focus low-level algorithms on the commonalities of spectroscopic data process such that they can be cleanly separated from the higher-level specifications of each spectrograph; and (2) employ state-of-the-art algorithms that ensure systematic errors are negligible compared to the fundamental noise limit set by Poisson counting statistics. Building from these core principles, this NSF award enables PypeIt to reach its full potential as a community-wide OSE, meeting a critical need outlined by the 2020 Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics. This is achieved by four primary activities: (1) strategically broadening the current PypeIt developer base to include key staff at seven US observatories (Lick, WMKO, Palomar, MMT, LBT, Lowell, and APO) by directly funding them to enable PypeIt to support processing data from their instruments; (2)  building partnerships with additional observatories both, in the U.S. and abroad, by supporting open-source development by the worldwide astronomical community and by hosting bi-annual workshops that introduce new users to PypeIt and provide real-time collaboration between users and developers; (3) implementing a new community-driven governance structure for the project that improves prioritization of the development activities and is more broadly inclusive of all stakeholders (developers, observatory staff, and users); and (4) extending existing, but observatory-specific, tools that facilitate real-time decision making for observers at the telescope (key to improving observing efficiency) and that streamline long-term data archiving (a key priority of the astronomy community) to new observatories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that about half of the students involved in the research will be from under-represented groups. Also, as another educational impact, the development of digital learning environments to teach undergraduate and graduate-level courses related to quantum technology will be continued, in collaboration with a colleague from Ecole CentraleSupelec (Orsay, France).

The developed methods will be applied to study photoionization of air molecules: N2, O2, and H2O. The results will be benchmarked on available data on photoionization of O2 and N2. Photoionization spectra and branching ratios will be produced to help modelers to develop applications as well as to experimentalists and astronomers to interpret observed spectra. A theoretical first-principles approach able to describe photoionization of small molecules, accounting for vibronic coupling of the photoelectron with the molecular ion will be developed. The approach will combine several elements: the molecular multi-channel quantum defect theory, the UK R-matrix codes for electron-molecule scattering calculations and geometry-fixed transition dipole moments, the vibrational frame transformation, hyperspherical and normal mode coordinates for the triatomic molecule (H2O). As a continuation of the previous grant, the obtained results will be used to consider cavity-free lasing in the diatomic molecular ions.

However, beyond common textile products, modern machine-knitting manufacturing equipment has the potential to produce complex interactive smart textiles with a variety of useful, innovative applications. For example, fabrics embedded with conductive yarns can be used to make clothes with health sensors. Imagine a sweater that can measure the heart rate of a patient with heart disease and be washed and handled like any other sweater. Such sensors are not produced because the software used to design these smart textiles and control these knitting machines is limited and too complex for many garment designers. This issue makes the production of smart textiles too expensive or complex to put into practice. This project will investigate the user-experience needs of garment designers and hand-knitters for machine-knitting software to help them create these complex smart textiles. This project will promote science by advancing knowledge of the machine knitting design process and how it can be integrated with existing machine knitting tools to produce novel smart textile materials. This advancement will support national health and well-being by providing a new way of manufacturing smart textiles for various applications such as healthcare, sustainable and local, within the United States, manufacturing of clothing.<br/><br/>This project will enable further development of machine-knit materials and the design of smart textile garments. Success will be measured by three outcomes: (1) a comprehensive examination of the design space of machine knitting, (2) the development of two software systems, KnitScript for programmers and KnitCAD for designers, to support the design of machine-knitted smart textiles, and (3) the creation of interactive, health-sensing garments. To engage with stakeholders such as programmers, machine knitting experts, hand-knitters, and textile designers, the research will employ various human-centered methods, including interviews, artifact collection, participatory design, and design probes.

This Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for geologic CO2 Storage Modeling, Analytics, and Risk Reduction Technologies (CO2-SMART) creates a multidisciplinary program that accelerates the safe and cost-effective sequestration of CO2 in the deep subsurface, at scale. This is done via use-inspired, basic research and workforce development in an area needed by industry. CO2-SMART is a partnership between the Pennsylvania State University and the University of Southern California. The Center focuses on advancing the current understanding of the complex processes that are triggered during and after CO2 injection into geologic formations. It develops advanced modeling and other activities that improve the safety, efficiency, and economics of subsurface CO2 sequestration operations and develops a pragmatic policy framework for large scale deployment of geologic CO2 storage. The Center brings together leading faculty, researchers, and their students from across the fields of engineering, machine learning, computer science, statistics, subsurface flow, simulation, geoscience, energy policy, and economics at the two participating universities. It enables collaboration between university personnel and CO2 sequestration field operators and carbon management regulators to develop synergistic collaborations that allow key stakeholders to tackle the challenging problem of CO2 sequestration. Broader impacts have signifcant societal, energy security, and public health implications. These include development and training of the next carbon sequestration workforce, including developing engineers and scientists as technical leaders who are well-versed in implementing and managing large-scale geologic CO2 storage projects. The Penn State Site will work to broaden participation in the CO2 sequestration industry of groups underrepresented in STEM fields through both new course and credential programs and through relationships with local community and minority serving colleges and universities. In addition, CO2 SMART's benefits can be extended to other subsurface flow systems including those related to groundwater, geothermal, and hydrocarbon resources, all of which share similar technological challenges. An Industry Advisory Board, consisting of companies, government agencies, and other interested parties will help guide Center research to ensure it is responsive to the evolving needs of the carbon economy and companies implementing geologic-carbon storage.<br/><br/>The CO2-SMART Center aims to enable and accelerate safe, reliable, efficient CO2 storage and implementation strategies through use-inspired research relevant to the carbon sequestration economy. It's activities include workforce development and public outreach in this important area. The Center achieves its goals through collaborative, pre-competitive, basic research in the following key thrust areas: (1) Site screening and characterization, including fluid, rock, and fracture properties; (2) Multiscale and multi-physics modeling/simulation for prediction of CO2 displacement in storage aquifers; (3) Cost-effective reservoir monitoring and characterization, including geophysical, geochemical, and geomechanical monitoring for high-resolution imaging; (4) Machine learning and data analytics for flexible and efficient workflows, including multiphysics data processing, predictive modeling, and decision support tools; (5) Risk assessment and uncertainty quantification for complex multi-physics subsurface storage systems that to informs risk mitigation strategies; and (6) Improving the economics of geologic carbon sequestration through optimization and field development planning. As a complement to University of Southern California expertise, the Penn State Site contributes its expertise in characterization of CO2 storage sites using a combination of geostatistics and data integration tools that employ AI assisted workflows. It also carries out laboratory investigation of fundamental properties and processes associated with in-situ mineralization and fracture and fault reactivation and well injectivity as well as develops in-situ monitoring protocols that result in novel, cost-effective, geophysical techniques. This Site informs policy development that integrates economics, uncertainty quantification, and risk assessment in the CO2 sequestration space. In terms of workforce training, Penn State will integrate geologic CO2 sequestration into undergraduate courses and develop courses that emphasize both the technical aspects of carbon sequestration as well as the economic and regulatory aspects. Courses will be packaged as in-person and online certificate or credentialling programs that benefit both students and working professionals. Penn State will implement education and outreach activities targeting local school districts and work to broaden participation of groups underrepresented in STEM through its relationships with nearby Fort Valley State University and Lincoln University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Bumble bees are important pollinators of native flowering plants and agricultural crops, yet many bumble bee populations are declining worldwide. Bumble bee ranges have contracted in response to climate change and warming temperatures. This project will investigate the biological drivers of these observed range contractions in bumble bees. This work will provide insight into how bumble bees are responding to climate change and enable predictions about how these essential pollinators may fare into the future. The research will also directly address key knowledge gaps that are known to be hindering the recovery of endangered bumble bee species.<br/><br/>The fellow will employ a combination of field and lab techniques to ask how bumble bee body size and genotype interact with climate to influence dispersal, overwintering survivorship, and thermal tolerances across an elevation gradient at Mount Rainier National Park. The fellow hypothesizes that within species, larger body size will be positively correlated to dispersal distance, overwintering survivorship, and thermal tolerance, but that body size will be limited by the interaction between food availability and thermal tolerance at high elevations. This limitation may be a product of a combination of shorter growing seasons, fewer resources, extreme weather, and a limited ability of bees to forage on exceptionally cold days. The fellow will expand their work beyond traditional academic sectors by recruiting, training, and collaborating with community scientists to collect data on wild bumble bees at Mt. Rainier National Park. The fellow will also host workshops and events for community scientist volunteers, to ensure that this partnership is not a one-way extraction of data, but rather a bidirectional path of sharing knowledge, experience, and expertise. The fellow will further mentor undergraduate researchers to engage in independent research and will attend bioinformatics workshops, which, in combination with their existing expertise in organismal biology, will position the fellow to lead research on ecological and population genetic patterns at multiple scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) is regarded as the general human-oriented computing platform for the next decade. In the smart headset, eye tracking provides crucial information on human perception, and it is a key pillar that supports many AR/VR applications such as displays, user interfaces, and foveated rendering. Hence, real-time processing of eye tracking workloads is critical, but modern eye tracking algorithms are much slower than the desired specifications (over an order of magnitude slower). Eye movements including saccade dynamics are one of the fastest movements in human body. Therefore, to accurately track eye movements, we need to perform image segmentation tasks at a very high frame rate (>1000 frames per second, FPS). However, this involves a large amount of data movement between the image sensor and the processor that performs the segmentation tasks. In the current practice, integration of frontend complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor and backend microprocessor is slow and inefficient as they are generally placed in separate packages. To efficiently perform high frame rate processing, in-pixel and near-pixel compute paradigms have been proposed to reduce the latency and energy consumption from the costly data movements to provide >100 reduction in communication latency by placing compute close to the source of data. The outcome of this award will have synergies with other national efforts to revamp domestic semiconductor research and development under the CHIPS and Science Act. Besides the AR/VR applications, tracking fast eye movements could be useful in biomedical applications such as early diagnosis of Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s diseases. The objective of the research and education integration is to train the next generation of workforce with domain expertise and interdisciplinary skills in the broad area of semiconductor device, integrated circuit and advanced packaging. <br/><br/>This award aims to advance the software-hardware co-design for in-pixel and near-pixel compute for eye tracking in AR/VR applications. A multi-mode image sensor that supports eye tracking is proposed, featuring a successive frame differencing method for the event map generation with in-pixel compute chiplet. It will be capable of providing both an event map at a higher frame rate as well as a full resolution image at a lower frame rate. Moreover, the near-pixel compute chiplet will run eye tracking inference with dual-mode deep neural networks for both high accuracy and high frame rate. The proposed research activities also include exploring the fundamental device technologies such as characterizing the amorphous oxide semiconductor transistor for pixel read-out circuitry and exploring the advanced packaging techniques for system-level heterogeneous integration. Silicon tape-outs are planned to validate the in-pixel and near-pixel compute chiplets with a pathway for heterogeneous integration on a silicon interposer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, malware attacks on IoT systems are increasing rapidly, exemplified by incidents like the Mirai botnet and the Colonial pipeline attack. While significant research has explored malware detection for PCs and mobile devices, these methods are not suitable for IoT systems due to their diverse operating systems and low power. Current models also struggle against sophisticated attacks that aim to evade detection. To address these challenges, the project team is developing DANGER-IoT, an approach to IoT malware detection that works across heterogeneous platforms, is efficient for low-power devices, and robust against advanced attacks. The researchers are collaborating with industry experts to ensure the project's ideas work well in real-world settings and are creating open-source tools and datasets. Spread across four universities and three countries, this project is also impacting a diverse group of students through new courses, security competitions, and international exchanges.<br/><br/>The DANGER-IoT project focuses on developing advanced machine-learning models for IoT malware detection. The first goal is to create a generic model that can detect malware across heterogeneous IoT platforms by constructing a common embedding space for similar functions across different operating systems and architectures. The project's second aim is to ensure efficiency for low-power devices by applying model compression techniques adapted from explainable AI and model pruning. To enhance robustness, the project will explore large-language models for code-style transfer, making malware appear benign to existing classifiers, and using the results to design a novel moving-target defense. By integrating multi-task learning, behavior classification, and a comprehensive IoT malware dataset, DANGER-IoT aims to provide a scalable detection approach, robust defenses, and significant contributions to the community through shared data, benchmarks, and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Congestion is costly for travelers, forcing them to sit unproductively in traffic, sometimes for hours. Moreover, excessive car idling results in excess greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to environmental change. Given these social and environmental costs, mitigating traffic congestion is an essential challenge for decisionmakers and scientists alike. Congestion pricing has been demonstrated to be an effective tool for reducing traffic and emissions. However, many cities that have attempted to introduce congestion pricing have failed to do so, often because of strong local voter opposition. This study examines why voters support or oppose this action and how they adjust their beliefs and commuting behaviors in response. This is an important question for the future of green urban transportation decisions. The findings from this research could inform decisionmakers on how to communicate to voters to increase the support for and efficacy of green rules.<br/><br/>The study investigates how individuals perceive and integrate information into their decision-making process in response to new rules in the context of traffic congestion mitigation strategies. The study consists of a two-wave experimental survey timed around the introduction of a congestion pricing rule in a large city. The study includes an information intervention that tests whether correcting ex ante misconceptions about congestion pricing influences respondents? support for the rule. The study also follows respondents after the implementation of the rule to see the effect of information updating on their commuting behavior. Combined, the findings from these experiments advance understanding of how individuals update their beliefs about an issue of public concern and whether an intervention affects their perception of a new rule to remediate the issue, and their behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Many organisms restrict their activities to a particular part of the daily cycle of light and dark. When two species are active at the same time, they are more likely to interact. Thus light, through its influence on daily activity patterns, can affect the network of interacting species that make-up a community. The rapid spread of electric lights over the past century has illuminated the night sky and dramatically altered the light cycles that organisms experience. Artificial light at night (ALAN) disrupts the activity patterns of organisms, but it is unclear how species interactions and the communities they exist within are affected by light pollution. The fellow will address these knowledge gaps by investigating whether ALAN alters the interactions between night-blooming plants and nocturnal hawkmoth pollinators. The findings will increase our understanding of how an increasingly bright world will impact plants and insects, and the important pollination services they provide. The project will include mentoring and training of undergraduate students, as well as community outreach to educate the public about light pollution.<br/><br/>Successful interactions between night-blooming plants and hawkmoths require temporal synchrony between the plant?s release of floral scent and the hawkmoth?s ability to detect and respond to it, both of which are controlled by light-sensitive circadian clocks. For hawkmoths, this project will evaluate how the molecular, physiological, and behavioral daily rhythms that underlie their ability to respond to floral scent are impacted by ALAN. Moreover, the fellow will also investigate whether ALAN impacts the scent that plants emit to attract pollinators. Because we cannot fully understand the consequences of ALAN by observing a single species, the fellow will perform a manipulative field experiment to examine whether ALAN rewires the network of interactions in a community that contains night-blooming plants and free-living hawkmoths. The fellow will receive training in transcriptomics, sensory biology, and community ecology. To broaden participation in science, the fellow will mentor students as they conduct independent projects and teach data science workshops to build enthusiasm for reproducible data-driven research. Both activities will recruit undergraduates from underrepresented groups to arm them with skills that will propel them to future careers in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representative applications of PDEs include (but are not limited to) aircraft design, semiconductor chip design, medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and weather prediction. Traditional PDE solvers discretize the spatial and temporal domains into many grid points, resulting in huge memory and computing costs. In recent years, neural networks have been incorporated with physical knowledge to solve PDE problems. The resulting technique, physics-informed neural networks (PINN), has shown superior performance than traditional discretization-based PDE solvers in solving high-dimensional PDEs and PDE-constrained control problems. However, training a PINN can still be very time-consuming in many realistic engineering applications even on powerful graphic processing units. This has prevented the application of PINN from resource-constrained scenarios with strict requirements on the computing platforms' size, weight, and power. This motivates the research team to develop, for the first time, a real-time and real-size PINN training accelerator using photonic chips. The research results can be used to solve vast science and engineering problems with PDE descriptions in real-time and with ultra-low energy costs. The collaboration between the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Hewlett Packard Labs will enable effective technology transfer and train next-generation workforces in semiconductor chip design and artificial intelligence via graduate education and industrial research internship.<br/><br/>Despite the ultra-high speed of photonic computing, training a PINN with a realistic network size (with around 1000 neurons) on a photonic chip is very challenging due to the poor scalability of photonic chips and the hardware-unfriendly nature of backward propagation. This project will leverage the collaboration between UCSB and Hewlett Packard Labs to develop the first real-time and real-size end-to-end PINN training accelerator on a 2.5-dimensional photonic chip. The research team will create a highly compressed and completely backward propagation-free method for training large-size PINN, which only requires forward propagation in the training process. The training algorithms can be easily implemented on a photonic chip without using any photonic memory. A theoretical understanding of the training method will be developed to provide performance insurance. The unfunded industrial co-investigator from Hewlett Packard Labs will develop resonator-based wavelength-parallel photonic tensor cores and charge-trap flash memory to achieve a highly energy-efficient and scalable tensor-compressed inference accelerator with photonic in-memory computing. The co-package of electronic and photonic integrated circuits will be realized via 2.5-dimensional heterogeneous integration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research will advance understanding of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, one of the world?s most destructive invasive species. In its invasive range L. humile loses its ability to distinguish family members from unrelated individuals and forms immense ?supercolonies? that can cover hundreds of square miles. Evolutionary theory predicts that the disruption of family structure should reduce the efficiency of natural selection on unicolonial ants. This research will empirically test the unicolonial degradation hypothesis, which predicts that due to relaxed selection, populations of unicolonial ants should degrade over evolutionary time. The research will advance understanding of an important organism that has significant negative impacts on native ecosystems and human agriculture worldwide. The project will also support scientific outreach and education through the establishment of a public science program at the Oakland Farmer?s Market and the development of course materials aimed at using ants to teach evolutionary biology to high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The research will compare non-unicolonial L. humile collected from its native range in Argentina with unicolonial L. humile collected from its invasive ranges in the United States. Genome sequencing of ants collected from both ranges will allow comparison of genomic degradation, particularly in genes relating to worker ant function. Laboratory assays of living ants will be used to look for evidence that workers from invasive populations are less functional or more selfish relative to workers from native populations. These assays will involve various metrics of captive colony fitness, foraging efficiency, and effectiveness at caring for eggs and larvae. Other assays will compare social behavior by algorithmically tracking individual ants using video footage. Collectively the fellow will gain experience with field data collection, genomics, and behavioral and motion tracking assays. The work will test key predictions of powerful theory related to the evolution of cooperation and conflict, and underscore how shifting into a new environment can profoundly impact an organism?s behavior and role within an ecosystem. Additionally, the research will help inform management decisions centered on mitigating the damage caused by invasive ants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AI systems trained on biased data can perpetuate or amplify negative biases, with profound implications for areas like criminal justice, hiring, and lending, where biased AI could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Designing an ethical AI system has significant social and political value. As AI models grow, the demand for cyberinfrastructure (CI) support becomes substantial. Much research has focused on designing high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures to accelerate AI/ML. However, support from CI for ethical AI is lacking, primarily due to distinctive constraints introduced by ethical considerations. Notably, such ethical constraints or objectives integrated with AI algorithms can slow down the inference and training processes. Conversely, without consideration of ethical AI, traditional CI technologies such as quantization and approximation might compromise AI ethics, even if they expedite the computation.<br/><br/>This project will establish interactive and integrated training for building high-performance ethical AI with three interdisciplinary training programs across philosophy, ethical AI, and HPC. These include nine training modules and activities for sustainability and fostering community. The goal is to fill the gap between CI and ethical AI and AI ethics and train both CI contributors and CI users to build high-performance ethical AI. The training programs include: 1) Philosophical AI ethics training for CI contributors and ethical AI designers; 2) Ethical AI training for CI contributors; 3) CI software and hardware technologies training for ethical AI designers. Moreover, several hands-on projects are proposed to deepen trainees? understanding of those programs, including hardware acceleration for machine learning models, ethical AI implementation, etc. The long-term goal is to boost the adoption of new ""Computing+AI+Ethics"" to multidisciplinary students and researchers from different STEM domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, a program may need to allocate screening services to a subset of people with symptoms in a community or a homeless youth shelter may need to invite a subset of people to participate in an educational program. Both problems require identifying the most effective and timely subset of a group for inclusion. Solving these real-world problems is difficult as they involve large amounts of data. Combinatorial Optimization is a field that attempts to find solutions to these complex problems. This project will build innovative technologies to efficiently solve the real-world COPs in public health. The main novelty is an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based framework that addresses complex real-world COPs, which has been an open challenge for traditional non-machine learning based methods. The developed technologies will be able to assist the stakeholders to make more informed decisions about resource allocation and task scheduling, in a wide range of societal problems in public health, conservation, and more. As an interdisciplinary research project, the research outcomes of this project will promote broader participation of AI research for communities outside of AI, and beyond academia. This project will get the AI research community more exposed to real-world societal problems and inspire more AI researchers to get involved in AI for social good research. Moreover, this research will provide interdisciplinary experiential learning experiences to a cohort of graduate and undergraduate students under direct mentoring of the investigator, as well as the development of courses on the theme of Data Science and Society.<br/><br/>Due to the computational hardness of COPs, traditional algorithms for COPs rely on handcrafted heuristics to construct a solution. Such heuristics require domain knowledge and may be suboptimal. Recently, there have been increasing investigations that use reinforcement learning (RL) as an alternative approach to automate the search of these heuristics. Despite the initial advancements, there is still a substantial gap when it comes to deploying RL for COPs in real life. This project identifies the following open challenges that are motivated by the above two problems in public health: (i) Hard objective functions (e.g., ill-shaped, or implicit); (ii) Uncertainty in problem parameters (or sim-to-real gap); and (iii) Multi-shot COPs. The primary objective of this project is a fundamental RL system that addresses these open challenges. The project comprises three major research tasks, each with innovative RL solutions that target the corresponding open challenge. Research task #1 proposes the idea of physics-inspired (task-aware) graph representation learning to enhance function approximation in the RL framework for ill-shaped and implicit objective functions. The new graph representation learning framework will incorporate the problem structure information into the design of the graph neural networks that better approximate the objective functions. Research task #2 designs a robust RL algorithm that deals with the uncertainties in the system parameters / sim-to-real gap, building on ideas from adversarial training and game theory that aims to better balance the trade-off between average-case and worst-case scenarios. Research task #3 introduces the idea of a new hierarchical RL algorithm that jointly decides the budget allocation on the high level, and node selection on the low level. The two levels of RL are interdependent and will be trained interactively. These technical innovations will not only advance research on RL for COPs, but also research on deploying RL for real life in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous studies have focused on understanding how individual variability in linguistic background and cognitive skills may impact language outcomes. However, the impact of the speaker?s social network for language acquisition and maintenance remains unclear. This project extends the inquiry to consider how the characteristics of the immediate social network of speakers influence their ability to learn and use a language. Specifically, this project focuses on heritage speakers of Spanish, an increasing community of people in the US who grow up with a strong familial or community connection to Spanish, while also being fluent in English. Heritage speakers provide a unique lens through which to study the interplay between individual capacities and social factors in language learning. This project includes the creation of the Bilingual Experience ARchive (BEAR), an online repository that provides access to language and social network data and modeling tools for bilingual language science. <br/><br/>This project is driven by two principal questions: First, do the compositional and structural features of a speaker's personal social network predict their language learning outcomes? Second, how do these network characteristics influence language outcomes over time? Utilizing interdisciplinary methods from language science, social network science, and cognitive science, this research involves participants from a university-level heritage language program. During the project, participants engage in tasks designed to both map their personal social networks and measure their language skills through written and oral tests. The assessments in this project include (1) a personal social network interview, (2) measures of written and oral fluency in both languages, (3) measures of sensitivity to the subjunctive verb mode in the heritage language, and (4) measures of attention and executive functioning that have been shown to play a role in language learning. Participants are tested at the beginning and at the end of a semester. The longitudinal approach used in this project allows for an analysis of how changes in social networks over time correlate with language learning outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seed production by plants requires embryo formation, and therefore the zygote is a critical stage in the plant life cycle. Zygote formation is accompanied by extensive reprogramming of gene expression, accomplished in part through modifications of DNA and associated proteins that are known as epigenetic processes. A comprehensive characterization of this reprogramming has not been performed in flowering plants due to technical difficulties in isolating egg cells and zygotes. This project will use improved methods developed in the model plant Arabidopsis to characterize genome-wide changes mediated by epigenetic mechanisms in plant zygotes, with an emphasis on rice, an important crop plant. The project will also provide training in plant biology and genomics to students and faculty from a historically black university. Knowledge of the mechanisms by which gametes give rise to zygotes has significant agricultural applications, including hybrid seed production through clonal propagation that substantially reduces the costs of hybrid seeds, production of haploids useful for accelerating plant breeding, and the regeneration of plants from tissue culture.  <br/><br/>In plants, rapid and extensive transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome occurs shortly after fertilization. Studies on rice zygotes show that transcription is primarily from the female genome, but the male genome provides key transcription factors for the initiation of embryogenesis after fertilization. This parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression must arise from genome-wide epigenetic modifications set during gametogenesis. However, there is a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and little information on the histone modifications in egg cells and zygotes, due to technical limitations imposed by inaccessibility and insufficient material. This project will employ recent technical advances that have made possible the analysis of histone marks from low numbers of cells, in combination with methods to isolate egg cells and zygotes in sufficient amounts for these new techniques. The methods will be optimized in Arabidopsis and implemented in rice, to elucidate details of the epigenetic reprogramming that accompanies gamete formation and identify epigenetic marks that establish the totipotent zygote. Integration of chromatin data with previously obtained mRNA, DNA methylation, and small RNA datasets from rice will generate a comprehensive genome-scale atlas of the gamete-to-zygote transition. The project will help fill a major gap in our understanding of a critical transition in the plant life cycle and provide fundamental knowledge that can be utilized in applications such as asexual reproduction, haploid production, and clonal propagation of crop plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With more than 1,700 known species in rivers and lakes of the Americas, Africa, the Levant, Madagascar and India, cichlid fishes ?one of the largest families of freshwater fishes? can help answer these questions. Although their evolutionary timescale is poorly understood, cichlids boast an extensive fossil record. These poorly-studied fossils could provide a window into the group?s ancient past. This project will study living and fossil cichlids to provide a better picture of when major events in cichlid evolution occurred. The project will also explore how cichlid ecology changed through time by comparing fossils with today?s living species, with the goal of understanding the life history of ancient cichlids. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher, two PhD students, a Master?s student, a technician, and undergraduate students, emphasizing development of transferable skills across STEM and non-STEM fields. The researchers will engage public audiences through university and public museums in the US, and in collaborating museums in Kenya, Brazil and the Dominican Republic.

Despite their importance in biological research, our understanding of cichlid evolution is limited by the lack of an accurate timescale for the group?s evolutionary history. While fossils represent the principal source of temporal data in macroevolutionary studies, a barrier their incorporation is a lack of phenotypic character sets that include both extant and fossil species. Additionally, the surprisingly rich cichlid fossil record, a direct source of temporal information, remains incompletely integrated with the growing body of data available for living species. This work will produce phylogenomic data along with the first comprehensive morphological character set for cichlids, and new phenotypic data extracted from well-preserved fossil specimens. The project will: (i) leverage computed tomographic (CT) examination of modern and fossil specimens to create a morphological framework for explicitly including fossil cichlids in a phylogenetic context with living species; (ii) combine these phenotypic data for extinct and living cichlids with existing phylogenomic resources to infer a comprehensive, dated genus-level phylogeny for cichlids; and (iii) test the impact of fossils on inferred patterns of cichlid ecomorphology and macroevolution on timescales of tens of millions of years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, the operation of directed energy systems hinges on the development of novel microwave sources and high-voltage high-current pulsed-power infrastructure. The project aims to provide innovative and robust numerical methods that will greatly enhance our predictive capabilities in the context of high-frequency electric charge transport simulation. This project will contribute to developing a new educational curriculum targeting the interdisciplinary training of graduate students at the intersection of mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, scientific computation, and physics.<br/> <br/>The project will develop numerical methods to solve electrostatic and electrodynamic fluid models of electric charge transport. The Euler-Maxwell and Euler-Poisson systems are some of the simplest electrodynamic and electrostatic (respectively) fluid models of electric charge transport. These models describe electrically non-neutral plasmas, electron inertia effects, high-frequency electrostatic plasma oscillation, and collective cyclotron motions such as the Diocotron instability. This project comprises numerical analysis, scientific computing, and graduate-level education. The research program will advance space and time discretizations for hydrodynamic models of electric charge transport that are mathematically guaranteed to be robust and preserve key mathematical properties of interest. Among such properties, we have preservation of pointwise stability properties (e.g. positivity of density and minimum principle of the specific entropy), discrete energy-stability, and well-posedness of linear algebra systems. This project comprises three research tasks involving the development of: (I) Semi-implicit schemes for Euler-Maxwell and Euler-Poisson systems, (II) Maxwell's equations formulations and solvers, and (III) Graph-based solvers for nonlinear hyperbolic systems (mathematical theory and high-performance implementation).

Fungi that interact with plants play one of the most critical roles in these processes, helping most plants grow and survive but also causing some of the worst plant diseases. Yet we know remarkably little about how plant-fungal interactions vary across the globe. Mapping plant-fungal partners could help us predict plant functions, particularly under environmental change. We need rapid answers to these questions and they must scale from microorganisms to the entire planet, but the small research communities working on pieces of this grand problem are largely scattered and independent. Our MICROBENet^Net project will unite a diverse array of research networks from around the world, integrating databases and tools to build a common foundation to predict plant-fungal roles and solutions in current and future environmental challenges and overcome logistical roadblocks. For example, more accurate predictions of plant-fungal interactions can help us enhance crop yield and disease resistance or better predict which ecosystems will absorb more carbon dioxide versus those that will release it. Our project also will train the next generation of biologists that work across currently siloed disciplines, so that they can be just as comfortable measuring the traits of individual fungi as modeling fungal-mediated processes across the entire planet. <br/><br/>Individual networks struggle to address some of our most fundamental interdisciplinary questions, inhibited by an inability to scale globally and a lack of interdisciplinary knowledge. Connections among disparate networks of plant and fungal biologists are also currently hindered by differences in disciplinary lexicons, limited face to face capacity, lack of harmonized data streams, and challenging cross-cultural interfaces. MICROBENet^Net, our proposed network of networks, will bridge convergent networks of people and research lines, train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists, and link databases, all of which are needed to address cross-cutting, societal challenges. Our online hub, annual colloquia, and research exchanges will provide an integrated, international community to build out an easily accessible integrative workflow that links our network of researchers to cross disciplinary expertise and data. With this access, individual networks (and new, future nodes) can rapidly advance answers to long-standing questions in plant-fungal interactions.

Enzymes are catalysts that convert substrates to products and are essential for driving processes that allow cells to function and respond rapidly to environmental conditions. There are a wide variety of enzymes in Nature corresponding to the diverse array of chemical reactions that a cell must execute for proper physiological function. It has been found that enzymes can exert forces when they convert substrates, and in this project, these forces will be harnessed to drive the motion of cell-sized capsules in response to substrates. The capsules will be made from biocompatible polymers, so they can be used to deliver drugs and communicate with cells by secreting bioactive compounds. Microfluidics will be used to assemble biocompatible capsules of defined chemistry, size, and composition. It has been found that asymmetry ? either in the chemistry or the geometry of the capsule, or both ? is required for robust motion. Asymmetry can be systematically built into the capsules using capsule chemistry and microfluidic design. A wide variety of enzymes will be tested to understand how the mechanism of action of each enzyme relates to its ability to support the propulsion of capsules. Capsules of tailored asymmetry with two faces ? Janus capsules ? will be used to understand how geometrical asymmetry can drive capsule motion via enzyme turnover. Systems in which capsules can communicate by secreting substrates to activate the motion of nearby enzyme-laden capsules or real biological cells will be developed, and furthermore, the motion of capsules in gradients of substrate will be measured. The project will train two graduate research assistants and two undergraduates, and the investigators will communicate their ideas to the broader research community through demonstration lectures to middle school and high school students and faculty.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Enzymes are a diverse set of molecules that catalyze a host of biochemical reactions throughout biology. Enzymes are known exert forces during enzymatic turnover, and previously catalase and urease were used to drive the motion of biocompatible cell-sized capsules. Based on the hypothesis that propulsion is due to osmotic influx at the catalytic binding site (osmophoresis), a wide array of enzymes will be tested to relate fundamental features of enzyme activity (reaction rates, Michaelis constants, and reaction schemes) to capsule propulsion. Of particular interest are cleaving enzymes, such as amylase and nucleases, which are hypothesized to generate augmented osmotic forces and hence avid propulsion. Furthermore, higher order cell behavior, such as chemotaxis and multicellular organization, will be recapitulated with enzyme-functionalized microcapsules. The microcapsules are made by microfluidics using biocompatible polymers (poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid), allowing the control the size, composition, porosity and asymmetry of the capsules. Asymmetry in capsules chemistry and geometry has been demonstrated to enhance capsule motion. The aims of this project will be to measure the motility of single capsules across a range of enzyme-substrate systems and measure the dynamics of motion of asymmetric (Janus) capsules; to quantify the directional motion of capsules in gradients of substrates, analogous to the chemotactic motion of cells; and to determine the ensemble motion of capsules, both with different volume fractions of active particles, as well as mixtures of active and passive particles, to understand how motility can be used to separate and organize multi-particle assemblies. Another goal is to build communication systems in which one capsule can secrete a substrate and drive the motion of a neighboring capsule. Finally, we will understand how motile, synthetic capsules can communicate chemically and physically with biological cells. The capsules can be thought of as synthetic cells (protocells) inspired by and designed to mimic biology. Since the capsules are biocompatible, a host of applications, such as targeted drug delivery and tissue assembly, can be envisioned in which these motile protocells can interface with real biological cells and tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lateral carbon export, or carbon outwelling, is impacted by tides and seaward groundwater flow. To date, studies of salt marsh carbon outwelling have focused on periods when biological activity is relatively high (i.e., spring through fall). As a result, prior studies have often neglected export during cold seasons, assuming that marshes are either impermeable due to frozen conditions or biologically inactive. This oversight limits annual water and carbon budget estimates to only a fraction of the year, potentially underestimating salt marshes? carbon storage potential and influence on the coastal ocean carbon budget. This project will address this knowledge gap by investigating the magnitude and drivers of cold season water and carbon export in North Atlantic salt marshes. This understanding is critical for refining estimates of carbon outwelling and improving understanding of the relative role of temperate salt marshes as a carbon sink. The project will develop a Science Exploration and Education from a Kayak (SEEK) program to teach middle-school students how to sea kayak while also teaching them coastal science through hand-on learning in the field. This project will also train a postdoctoral researcher, graduate student, and multiple undergraduate students through summer programs.<br/><br/>Cold-season hydrological dynamics and biogeochemical processes have seldom been evaluated in salt marshes, preventing accurate estimates of local and global carbon outwelling. This project?s goal is to better understand cold-season freeze-thaw processes, groundwater flow dynamics, and lateral carbon export in North Atlantic salt marshes. The project will (1) monitor soil temperatures and groundwater and surface water levels, salinity, and temperature in four salt marshes between Massachusetts, USA, and Nova Scotia, Canada, to gain better understanding of the extent and duration of marsh freezing; (2) quantify groundwater discharge in summer through spring, as well as during storm events, to compare discharge magnitude and sources across all seasons; and (3) evaluate seasonal variability in salt marsh porewater carbon concentrations and quantify carbon outwelling from the marsh platform to the tidal channel across seasons and following winter events. This project will result in increased understanding of coastal hydrological processes, refined carbon outwelling estimates, and improved projections of carbon outwelling dynamics in mid- to high-latitude salt marshes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, both national and global groups have called to include GSC in chemistry classes. For example, the fourth United Nations? Sustainable Development Goal is that by 2030 all students have the knowledge and skills to support global, sustainable development. Unfortunately, GSC is still not widely covered in organic chemistry textbooks, leaving instructors to decide if and how to include GSC. Furthermore, many organic chemistry instructors are not yet familiar with GSC. Thus, this study will identify how GSC is currently taught and assessed and what resources instructors need to teach GSC, both of which are critical for developing effective instructor training and resources. In addition, the study will also explore how teaching GSC impacts the way students, particularly from rural areas, see organic chemistry. To accomplish this, the study will involve redesigning the introductory organic chemistry curriculum to include GSC. This redesigned curriculum will provide readily available materials for other instructors. Finally, integrating GSC into the organic chemistry curriculum will help educate environmentally responsible consumers who understand how their decisions impact their community and environment.<br/> <br/>This study addresses two research aims: 1) to explore the nationwide integration of GSC into the organic chemistry curriculum and 2) to explore how integrating GSC into the introductory organic chemistry curriculum impacts student perception of organic chemistry, with a particular emphasis on its impact on rural students. To accomplish the first aim, an explanatory sequential design will be used in which the results of a previous quantitative survey study will frame the development of the qualitative interview questions and the subsequent analysis of the responses. Then, a nationwide survey will be developed and administered to explore the cohesiveness of faculty interview responses with a nationwide sample. To accomplish the second aim, data will be collected on student perception and class performance from an introductory organic chemistry course in the first year to be used as a historical control. The course curriculum will then be modified using results from a literature review, the interviews, and independently prepared instructional modules so that the prescribed curriculum is taught from a green perspective. Student perception and class performance of all students will then be evaluated to measure the impact of incorporating GSC. It is predicted that incorporating GSC will benefit all students, especially rural students, due to its ties to the environment and sustainability.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF?s STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) Program.

However, their reliance on invasive surgical procedures poses significant limitations. In this paradigm-shifting proposal, we introduce a novel method that eliminates the need for surgery altogether. Our primary focus lies in the development of bioelectronic brain implants that hold the promise of identifying target brain regions and autonomously implanting themselves. Once implanted, these devices will facilitate high-resolution brain stimulation, offering unprecedented control over neural activity. This pioneering approach not only revolutionizes the field of neural stimulation but also opens doors to a myriad of possibilities in neuroscience and medical intervention. By obviating the need for invasive surgery, our proposed method promises safer, more accessible, and more precise interventions for neurological disorders and brain research.<br/>Technical Abstract: Bioelectronic implants provide a versatile platform for diagnosis, therapeutics as well as basic research but require invasive surgery. Here, we propose a paradigm shift: wherein intravenously introduced ultra-small bioelectronic devices, circulate through vasculature to implant in target regions, without the need for surgery. Specifically, in this proposed work, we aim to develop the bioelectronic brain implants that can recognize target brain regions and self-implant overcoming one of the body?s strictest biological barriers: the blood-brain barrier without any surgery, and enable brain stimulation with high spatio-temporal resolution, leading to the first non-surgical brain implant for neural stimulation. Accomplishing this requires innovations in diverse fields of applied physics, electrical- and bio-engineering and we are uniquely enabled due to our expertise in not only physics and solid-state nanoelectronic devices but also in bioelectronics, synthetic biology and neural engineering. The proposed technology, to our knowledge, is a radical departure from all existing bioelectronic interfaces and if successful can lead to a new field of self-implanting biomedical devices. It is not only nearly non-invasive but it can also be extended to applications where surgery may not be even possible (such as intricate body parts challenging to access surgically, or patients not suited for invasive procedures). Specifically, the proposed first non-surgical brain implant for neuromodulation overcomes the challenges of existing brain stimulation technologies by enabling spatio-temporally precise targeted neuromodulation without any surgery and creates pathways for novel brain therapies. This technology is modular and beyond brain, it can have vast applications in numerous other arenas including cardiac pacing, therapeutic modulation of peripheral nervous system, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to name a few.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across the globe, software is integral to many aspects of contemporary life, making it crucial to be able to accurately identify and verify the components from which software is created. A well-known method for creating an inventory of software components, known as a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), is prone to inaccuracies and is vulnerable to unauthorized tampering. This project, called ?SBOMit,? aims to transform SBOMs by creating an open-source ecosystem that redefines how SBOMs are produced and checked. The SBOMit open-source ecosystem aligns with both the NSF's mission to enhance national welfare and security as well as the objectives of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. SBOMit minimizes the risks of tampering with SBOMs and improves transparency, establishing a new benchmark for trust in software supply chains. As an open-source product, SBOMit is available to industry, government, and other sectors at no cost, providing a free and open solution to one of the most important cybersecurity problems. <br/><br/>SBOMit's innovation builds upon the capabilities of another open-source product, known as ?in-toto,? to bolster SBOM reliability against malicious threats, leveraging the in-toto framework?s attestations to enhance SBOM trustworthiness. The in-toto framework ensures cryptographic verification at every stage of the supply chain, providing assurance of software integrity for version control systems, the continuous integration/continuous deployment process, testing, and all other stages of the software supply chain. Cryptographic verification serves dual purposes: diminishing SBOM tampering risks and setting a new transparency and trust standard in software supply chains. Additionally, the capability to leverage in-toto's attestations helps to fortify software against a variety of existing and anticipated software supply chain attacks. Industry participants within the growing SBOMit ecosystem are developing tools that will help to integrate the product across a diverse range of applications, fostering a community-driven approach that will protect software used in industry, government, academia, and elsewhere. The detailed metadata embedded within SBOMs by in-toto attestations facilitates a greater level of visibility and control of the provenance of components, empowering automated verification processes that can detect and defend against unauthorized modifications. As the SBOMit open-source ecosystem expands by integrating the product across various software domains, this standardizes a means to generate SBOMs and empower stakeholders across sectors with transparent, secure, and easy-to-use tools. The SBOMit open-source ecosystem can pave the way for the trustworthy software supply chain of the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow who will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. All organisms shed genetic material, referred to as environmental nucleic acids (eNAs), into their surrounding environment by sloughing skin, excreting waste, shedding mucous, etc. Analyzing eNAs can provide information about the presence and abundance of organisms, particularly in aquatic environments where species can be challenging to locate. eNAs come in the form of both DNA (double-stranded molecules that contain all information about an organism) and RNA (the single-stranded molecules that translate DNA into usable components for cells). New evidence suggests that eRNA may be a better marker of organism abundance and location than eDNA because the single-stranded molecules break down rapidly. This project will answer foundational questions about the fate of eRNA in streams and rivers, which could enable this relatively untapped tool to improve conservation efforts in the face of human impacts on ecosystems. Additionally, this project will allow the fellow to gain critical scientific training while broadening participation in STEM through educational outreach, training workshops, and mentorship.<br/><br/>This project will explore the relationships between the concentration and persistence of eNAs, organism abundance, and environmental context in flowing waters. The central hypothesis is that, as a uniquely dynamic molecule, eRNA will provide more accurate information about what organisms are present in flowing waters and where they are located. This will be investigated through three synergistic aims. Aim one is to quantify differences in eDNA and eRNA removal using flow-through experimental streams. Aim two is to compare the efficacy of eDNA and eRNA for estimating population sizes and overall community composition, using paired eNA sampling with an ongoing monitoring project that collects fish community data across Illinois. Aim three is to determine what environmental factors influence eRNA and eDNA concentrations by comparing results across sites. This combination of experiments and field approaches will inform the use of eRNA as a predictor of organism location/abundance for conservation and management.

This work provides policy-relevant data for cities developing guidelines around urban agriculture and organics waste recycling that is shared through collaborations with extension and agency partners. This project supports undergraduate research training and new curricula at the undergraduate and high school level. <br/><br/>The research addresses three objectives. Objective 1 is a continuation of an ongoing long-term experiment in which rates of nutrient recycling (recovery by crops of compost-derived nutrients) and loss (export via leachate) are measured in replicated plots that receive different types and amounts of compost. New water input treatments with different irrigation and rainfall simulation scenarios are added to better understand the interaction between climate change and the fate of compost-derived organic matter and associated nutrients that builds up in the soils of urban farms and gardens. From the resulting measurements, budgets are constructed for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water, in order to quantify nutrient recycling and loss, carbon sequestration, and cooling due to evapotranspiration. Objective 2 extends this research to understand the fate of compost-derived nutrients in urban farms and community gardens across Minneapolis-Saint Paul, which have a variety of background soil conditions and management practices. The project includes detailed interviews on soil management practices to construct nutrient budgets for ten farms and measurements of nutrient concentrations in leachate and along vertical profiles to determine the fate of excess nutrients. Objective 3 focuses on comparing various ecosystem services from different urban agriculture land use scenarios using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) suite of models. Calculations of food production and nutrient recycling potential for all scenarios are calculated directly based on project data. The InVEST models for carbon sequestration, urban cooling, urban flood risk mitigation, urban stormwater retention, nutrient delivery, and pollinator habitat are produced for these scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central goal of evolutionary biology is understanding how new species emerge. This process is known as speciation and is influenced by complex factors that are not fully understood. Researchers can learn about the factors that influence speciation by studying closely related species that live in the same area and interbreed, along with other species that can be found in the same area but do not interbreed. This research will help us understand how different factors promote or limit speciation by studying the relationship between environmental conditions, physical traits, and genetic variation. The findings from this research will help us learn about how biodiversity has arisen. This research will also produce online tutorials and book chapters that are available to the public. These resources will introduce people to bioinformatics and provide training to students from high school to graduate school.<br/><br/>Theory and empirical work suggest that natural selection can promote the accumulation of barrier effects that limit gene flow between species, which is required for reproductive isolation to evolve, and that it can also promote gene flow between species, which erodes the barriers. Previous studies, however, have often considered these alternative outcomes in isolation, limiting our ability to understand the interplay between gene flow and selection during speciation. This research will consider these alternative outcomes and test theoretical predictions using speckled rattlesnakes. Speckled rattlesnakes are an ideal system to explore the role of natural selection in alternative outcomes because speckled rattlesnakes include lineages at various stages of divergence, independent contact zones, distinct climatic niches, and remarkable phenotypic variation. The fellow?s training will include whole genome sequencing of the speckled rattlesnake complex and statistical techniques to link genotypes to phenotypes, understand conditions where natural selection imposes selective pressures, and establish the links between genotypic, phenotypic, and environmental variation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can help improve the quality of educational research and assessment. This kind of research and assessment is invaluable in advancing national interest by enhancing the ability to answer research questions such as the effectiveness of education policies and pedagogy techniques and closing the achievement gaps. Utilizing AI in education requires additional skills beyond conventional statistics training education researchers, school administrators, and policymakers receive. This project addresses the fundamental issues of training users to use advanced cyber-infrastructure, such as cloud computing systems, to deal with the challenges of working with large quantities of education data. The training materials, software tools, and hands-on project assessments developed as part of this project help prepare future educational researchers in learning analytics to use advanced cyberinfrastructure systems in the cloud. The other potential benefits include expanding the utilization of cyberinfrastructure resources beyond the traditional natural science researchers to involve other social science researchers in education to serve national needs.  <br/><br/>This project, AI4EDU, aims to develop innovative training materials for education researchers to enable them to utilize AI in educational research and assessment using cloud infrastructures. AI4EDU consists of three integrated thrusts to address this challenge. The first thrust is the development of educational materials that introduce critical aspects of planning, configuring, and utilizing cloud computing resources and frameworks (e.g., Hadoop, federated learning) to support various educational analytical tasks. The second thrust is to develop tools in data quality, cloud monitoring, cloud planning, and configuration to support utilizing cloud services. The last thrust is to design sample projects with accompanying datasets for real-world, hands-on training. In addition, AI4EDU includes a public repository to collect and share machine learning programs and datasets tailored for various educational research tasks to help build up the community of users. The AI4EDU project helps support the AI for Education initiatives by bridging the gap between the analytical techniques taught in the classroom and the tools and skillsets needed to work with data in education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, times series data are common in meteorology, medicine, and physics. However, the process of labeling time series data often demands a substantial amount of time. Typically, only domain experts have the capability to effectively label time series data. Consequently, data labels are often scarce in most real-world time series applications. To overcome this challenge, an approach called Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (CSSL) has been developed in the research community. However, the effectiveness of CSSL framework is highly related to the definition of ?semantic similarity? among time series data that represents the characteristics of the underlying system. In CSSL framework, the errors (whether they were wrongly considered similar or dissimilar samples) will likely generate meaningless or even misleading models that impact on the final artificial intelligence (AI)-driven models that utilize time series data. This project aims to address these challenges by conducting a systematic analysis of the CSSL framework for time series data and developing innovative algorithms to alleviate the identified  limitations. Additionally, this project will specifically focus on smart manufacturing system related application where time series sensors are widely recognized for their energy efficiency but lack data labeling. Furthermore, the project has a detailed plan to integrate research outcomes into existing courses and develop new courses at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Lastly, the project will promote the participation of Hispanic students in STEM research and participate in outreach events in the local community.<br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into two tasks corresponding to the two major steps in the CSSL framework: the view augmentation step, which aims at augmenting semantically correlated samples and the negative sample sampling step which aims at sampling semantically unrelated samples. The project aims to integrate the concept of time series motifs, a key primitive used to unveil underlying natural mechanisms in a wide variety of time series, into CSSL frameworks. Specifically, the project consists of two thrusts: 1) To address the challenge of difficulty to preserve semantic meaning in view augmentation operator, the project aims to design a motif-aware augmentation operator to use detected motifs to regularize the semantics of augmented data; and 2) To address the challenge of difficulty to sample high-quality negative samples, the project aims to design a motif-aware negative sampling to avoid low-quality negative samples induced by noises and redundancy existed in the time series data. The investigated theories and methodologies will deepen the understanding of the intrinsic working mechanism of the self-supervised time series representation and contribute to the research in a wide range of domain applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly emphasized in neurology where experts spend a substantial amount of time visually reviewing lengthy multi-channel time series of brain activity, called electroencephalography (EEG). Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a potential solution to ease this burden and create reliable and scalable solutions. However, most EEG ML models, which are based on supervised learning, do not yield meaningful EEG features because of labeling inconsistencies. In addition, these models have not been rigorously tested in out-of-sample settings and therefore can exhibit performance deficits during deployment leading to incorrect diagnoses or decisions. As such, there is a compelling need to develop more reliable, reproducible, and robust ML approaches for EEG review. The goal of this proposal is to develop a trustworthy ML framework to augment clinical EEG review and demonstrate its utility in real-world clinical applications. Our research will significantly improve the diagnostic capabilities of EEG while reducing physician workload. We will demonstrate the framework?s ability to augment EEG review by working closely with domain experts at the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic. We will also enable research opportunities for undergraduate and K-12 students, especially underrepresented minorities, and engage students with epilepsy in focused research projects. Finally, we will leverage the outcomes of this research to develop courses in engineering and medicine.<br/><br/>This research will develop a suite of novel ML methods to realize a trustworthy ML framework to augment EEG review. We will undertake the following strategies to ensure trust in EEG ML: a) developing domain-guided backbone architectures for EEG representation learning, b) leveraging self and weak supervision, instead of label-hungry and error-prone supervised learning, to scale up available training data, and c) performing model diagnostics to identify and rectify failure scenarios. The core of the proposed framework will be a domain-guided foundation model for EEG data that addresses the current limitations of EEG ML. Our proposed work includes a) development of an attention-based domain-guided architecture to capture EEG spatiotemporal dynamics; b) designing domain-guided self- and weak-supervision tasks to address labeled-data scarcity; c) development of model diagnostics and adversarially robust training to handle distribution shifts; and d) real-world validation of the framework in epilepsy subtype classification and treatment outcome prediction, and further evaluation in out-of-sample settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This data description fits across a wide range of domains, including financial fraud detection, e-commerce recommendation, scientific discovery, and rare disease diagnosis. Although there has been considerable research on long-tailed learning, the vast majority has been conducted in an artificial, closed environment with predefined domains, data distributions, and downstream tasks. A natural and fundamental research question largely remains nascent: How can we take this research one step further to enable Open-World Long-Tailed Learning (OpenLT), where the domains are heterogeneous, open-ended, and evolving over time? <br/><br/>Building upon the existing observatory work, this project aims to develop fundamental theories and algorithms for OpenLT. To be specific, there are three research thrusts. The first thrust aims to develop fundamental theories for a better understanding of the OpenLT problem. The second thrust aims to create a generic computational framework for heterogeneous long-tailed data in the wild. The third thrust systematically validates and verifies the theories and techniques from the first two thrusts on high-impact applications, including financial fraud detection and rare disease diagnosis. Upon completion, this project will advance the state of the art in long-tailed learning in two key dimensions. First, it will establish theoretical foundations for OpenLT, encompassing the unification of long-tailedness measurements, reliability analysis, and generalization bound analysis, most of which are currently absent in the existing literature. Second, it will lead to a generic OpenLT computation framework with novel pre-training, fine-tuning, and adaptation techniques, which is anticipated to exhibit substantial improvements in open and dynamic environments. The research outcomes will be integrated into a variety of educational activities during and beyond the course of this project. Leveraging various supporting programs at Virginia Tech, the investigator will ensure that students at different levels (e.g., K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students) have the opportunity to learn from and participate in the advancements brought forth by this research.

Accelerating wildfire activity is of pressing concern in many temperate and boreal forest regions; its frequency is particularly sensitive to climate change. Shifting patterns of wildfire, along with stressful post-fire environmental conditions, can erode resilience and catalyze ecosystem collapse. This CAREER project will test hypotheses of how disturbance and forest ecosystem structure interact to affect ecological resilience. Through integrated research, education, and training activities, the project will enable improved forecasting of forest ecosystem fate during an era of warming climate and accelerating wildfire activity. By integrating scientific goals of this project into multiple classroom teaching activities and bringing undergraduate scholars into the research team from a wide diversity of backgrounds, this project will also broaden societal dialogue around inclusive and equitable management of fire-prone ecosystems and empower early-career researchers in fire ecology.<br/><br/>This NSF CAREER project will integrate remotely sensed data and analyses of forest structure and wildfire patterns with new field measurements in an established and expanding network of permanent plots located in recently burned forests to test mechanisms of ecological and fire regime change. This work will be focused on temperate maritime forests of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, where biologically- and carbon-rich ecosystems are shaped by infrequent and severe wildfires in ways that are not currently well understood by the scientific community. Two primary research questions will be addressed: (1) How does heterogeneity in forest landscape structure interact reciprocally with heterogeneity in wildfire disturbances? (2) How does heterogeneity in post-fire landscape structure affect key mechanisms of forest resilience to fire and drivers of fire regime change? These questions will be approached using a combination of new and existing remotely sensed geospatial data on forest structure, wildfire patterns, and meteorological conditions across multiple scales. Together, these approaches will test multiple hypotheses about how disturbances and heterogeneity affect resilience mechanisms, and will provide key insights into how resilience will unfold in ecosystems characterized by infrequent and severe fire regimes in a warming and more fire-prone world. This project will catalyze inquiry-driven learning through new modules that are linked to data collected via research activities, and broaden perspectives around fire ecology and management through guest speakers in undergraduate and graduate courses.

To that end, the project explores the feasibility of catalytically converting ethanol and methanol (both potentially manufactured via green technology) to acrolein ? a chemical intermediate used in the manufacture of acrylate polymers.  The project represents a collaborative effort between Lehigh University and the Hamburg University of Technology under joint funding from NSF and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation, DFG).   The research explores molecular level details of how the chemical reaction progresses over an iron molybdate catalyst, obtaining information related to the site on the catalyst surface where reactions occur (active site) and the sequence of reaction steps to form the product (the reaction pathway).  The molecular-level insights will aid in the discovery of novel catalytic materials and optimal reactor operating conditions, thereby reducing process energy requirements. Taken together, the use of green feedstocks, combined with energy-efficient catalysts and    intensified process technology, has potential to greatly decrease the carbon footprint of acrylic polymer manufacture.  In addition to the technical aspects, the collaborative project will catalyze an international exchange of ideas, methodologies, and educational materials, thereby fulfilling the broader objectives of the NSF-DFG research initiative. <br/><br/>The project supports a synergistic and unique US-German collaboration to develop a novel spatial- and time-resolved analysis of catalytic systems whereby variation in the structure of the catalyst and the concentration of surface reaction intermediates, both along the reactor length and over time, is leveraged to obtain underlying information about the catalytic active site and the reaction pathway. The project combines research expertise at Hamburg and Lehigh to employ: (1) operando molecular spectroscopy techniques in the modulation excitation spectroscopy (or MES) mode to understand the fast transients of the catalytic system and elicit kinetically relevant surface intermediate species and reaction pathways; (2) a novel compact profile reactor (CPR) coupled with spectroscopy and mass spectrometry - a unique set up not currently available in the US - to understand the slow evolution of catalyst active sites, surface and gas phase species, and reaction rates along the reactor bed; and (3) spatial (CPR) and temporal (MES) data of the catalytic system along with hierarchical modeling tools (Density Functional Theory (DFT), microkinetic modeling, and optimization methods) to develop a mechanistic model of acrolein synthesis on FeMoOx catalysts from non-fossil methanol and ethanol. This work will allow deep contrasting spatiotemporal studies to elicit molecular insights about the catalyst and aid in the development of tools to create mechanistic models from DFT, MES, and CPR data that will be applicable to a wide range of catalytic reaction systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The intellectual merits of the project include a careful combination of many topical areas and wide applicability of the resulting designs in engineering, environmental policy making, and organizational structure, among others. The broader impacts of the project include inter-disciplinary graduate training, research dissemination through publications and seminars, promotion of diversity within the research teams, and engagement with K-12 students.<br/><br/>Incentive design is a hierarchical decision-making problem that considers how one rational agent might induce a desired behavior on another through the design of policies.

By doing so, the theory will apply much more broadly. Five thrusts of the project will build along the three following themes: (1) Can agents learn each other?s preferences through repeated interactions? (2) How do behavioral traits influence incentive structures? (3) Can incentives be designed to accommodate complex hierarchies of interactions among a population?

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Organisms face constant threats from parasites. Their immune response must be as effective as possible while conserving energy and minimizing damage. Immune factor production follows the central dogma of molecular biology: genes are copied to mRNA transcripts, which are then translated into proteins that then function in immunity. The speed of the immune response is a decisive factor in controlling parasite growth. Thousands of genes are transcribed in the early immune response. It takes many more steps for these transcripts to become functional, and cells struggle to keep up with the protein production demand. Deciding which transcripts to translate can then be life-or-death decisions during infection. This research combines various techniques across traditional immunology and ecoimmunology to demonstrate how protein translation regulates immunity. Furthermore, it aims to broaden participation in STEM through undergraduate research opportunities.<br/><br/>This research will employ a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches in the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) system, including cutting-edge ribosomal footprint sequencing techniques, to assess whether beetle populations differentially prioritize some transcripts over others for protein production during the early innate immune response across a panel of parasite challenges. In tandem, within-host mathematical models of immune kinetics will be built to assess translational regulation of immunity when exposure to certain parasites is unpredictable. Through the synthesis of these approaches, this research will investigate how selective translation contributes to immune specificity, determines infection trajectories, instigates tradeoffs, and drives local adaptation to unpredictable parasites. As both translation initiation machinery and innate immune signaling pathways are tightly conserved across species, this project will allow for general predictions regarding immune system regulation and evolution both within and across species. These projects will be conducted in partnership with the Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) undergraduate program at Vanderbilt University, which works to broaden participation in biomedical research, to mentor at least three undergraduates on independent projects adjacent to the work proposed here.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The majority of U.S. teen girls experience body image concerns, which include body dissatisfaction, body shame, and self-objectification. Body image concerns can negatively impact adolescent development, with increased risk for mental health symptoms and low self-esteem. Social media use likely exacerbates body image concerns for many adolescent girls, but the mechanisms are not yet well understood. The overarching goal of this NSF CAREER project is to understand how, when, and for whom specific social media experiences affect body image, in a diverse sample of adolescent girls. In the context of heightened public discourse regarding adolescent social media use, we expect the findings of this study to have broad impacts for science and society. Overall, this project has the potential to provide transformative insights into adolescent social media use and body image, as well as in-depth research training for the next generation of developmental scientists.  <br/><br/>During a developmental period characterized by heightened self-consciousness and need for peer approval, social media apps provide adolescents with an unprecedented context for self-presentation and social comparison. In recent years, a growing body of research has documented connections between specific social media experiences and body image concerns. However, most of this work has focused on adult women rather than adolescent girls, without attention to unique adolescent developmental processes. This project utilizes a longitudinal, multi-method approach to investigate how specific appearance-related social media experiences affect body image concerns among adolescent girls via a combination of 1) eye-tracking methods to assess attention to social media stimuli, 2) longitudinal surveys of social media experiences and body image concerns, and 3) ecological momentary assessments, in which adolescents are prompted to report real-time experiences related to social media and body image in their daily lives. Guided by developmental and social psychological theories and methods, this project examines whether specific social media experiences predict body image concerns over both short-term (i.e., hourly) and longer-term (18 months) periods in a diverse sample of adolescent girls. Based on prior research and theory, this project focuses on cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and emotional risk factors related to social media use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this end, the investigators will bridge this crucial gap by harnessing multi-functional origami as a mechanical neural network and leveraging its physical reservoir computing power as the needed foundation for creating, measuring, and designing the essential elements of intelligence. More specifically, the investigators will 1) explore the extent of complexity and sophistication that mechano-intelligence can attain on physical platforms, 2) formulate performance metrics to quantify and measure mechano-intelligence, 3) correlate the design and mechanical properties of the physical platform to the corresponding intelligence performance, and 4) create a systematic design method for integrating mechano-intelligence with engineering functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much attention has been given to studying large expansions of federal R&D investment. Yet federally-funded R&D, as a share of domestic R&D or GDP, has been on decline since its twentieth century peak?an era which has also seen a major reorientation of the federal portfolio from defense to biomedicine. The consequences of these changes are not yet fully understood. A traditional economic view is that public R&D fills gaps that markets leave behind. However, since the 1950s the U.S. (and global) innovation system have matured significantly, potentially leaving fewer gaps for public R&D to fill. Moreover, though the impacts of past public R&D investments often inspire new ones, there is less evidence on the effects of public R&D drawdowns and budget cuts to inform choices when renewing funding for programs.<br/><br/>This research evaluates the impacts of declining public R&D and the pivot away from defense innovation. Using recently-collected long-run data on government-funded invention, paired with new data on the postwar scientific workforce, this project examines (i) the effects of federally-funded R&D on the development of complex, science-based technologies (i.e., ?deep tech? innovation); and (ii) the impacts of large and abrupt cuts to defense research in the 1970s (before which the Department of Defense was nearly as large a funder of basic research as NSF) on the U.S. innovation system, including science, scientists, universities, and high-tech industries. The project results improve understanding of science and technology with new evidence on the effects of government withdrawal from R&D funding and produces new approaches to evaluating public-private R&D spillovers and identifying regularities and tensions that inform future policy choices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Animals with extreme life strategies help us understand what is possible for life on Earth beyond our own capabilities. For example, some migratory birds fly thousands of kilometers without resting every spring and fall. Yet, despite their capacity for these amazing feats, populations of long-distance migrants are declining rapidly. It is possible that extreme strategies like migration cannot evolve quickly enough to adapt to rapid environmental change. This project will use a genomic approach to better understand the evolution of extreme strategies like migration, answering two questions. 1) What genome regions help animals undertake long-distance migration? 2) Do the demands of extreme strategies like migration reduce capacity for rapid adaptation? The results will reveal how species evolve to succeed at strategies unimaginable to humans. Further, results will inform predictions about how animals with extreme strategies may cope with global change. This project will train the fellow for a career in integrative evolutionary genomics research and create collaborative connections between scientists in evolutionary genomics, ecology, and conservation.<br/><br/>This research focuses on shorebirds in the order Charadriiformes. Some shorebird species undergo extreme migration (>10,000 km nonstop), while others migrate shorter distances or not at all. The fellow will use comparative phylogenetics of whole genomes from shorebird species with diverse migratory strategies to identify genomic regions involved in adaptation for long-distance migration. Next, population genomic datasets from select species will be used to evaluate the influence of long-distance migration on genetic diversity across the genome and, specifically, at genomic regions associated with migratory adaptation. Population genetic analysis will reveal whether selection imposed by extreme migration reduces genetic diversity at genomic regions underlying migration, thereby reducing capacity for rapid evolution of the migratory phenotype in response to global change. Alongside the research, the fellow will develop materials to teach high school students about genomics and seasonal migration, and to increase access to valuable transferrable bioinformatic/coding skills among undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The intellectual merit of this project lies in its innovative approach to advancing the knowledge of how vulnerable portions of an electric utility microgrid can be deenergized while minimizing the life-threatening risks of outages. The broader impacts of this project are that even modest improvements in wildfire resilience of the electricity infrastructure can result in substantial financial savings and mitigation of adverse social, psychological, and physical consequences of wildfires. Additionally, this project will create materials for educating electric utility emergency operators while disseminating the results via media outlets. <br/><br/>The project has three main tasks. Tasks 1 compiles a comprehensive list of electric-powered home medical equipment through time-sensitive data collection, surveys, and interviews. Task 2 identifies flexible grid resources, dynamic microgrid reconfiguration strategies, and hidden capacities for safe deenergization of vulnerable portions of the grid before, during, and after wildfires. Task 3 proposes a novel time-triggered de-energization framework that accounts for both primary and secondary feeders within a microgrid to enable an in-depth exploration of the technical constraints involved in partial deenergization. Studies will be done to investigate scenarios involving vulnerable load points, varying levels of accessible backup and mobile resources, and a diverse spectrum of available flexibilities.

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The Fellow will study ecosystems that have been contaminated by lead, a type of metal that is highly toxic and yet has been used by humans for centuries. Lead pollution in the environment is widespread and long-lasting, but it is currently difficult to predict where lead will end up after it is released into the environment. This award initiates a new phase of lead research, a phase that focuses on how natural ecological processes can cause lead pollution to concentrate in certain organisms and habitats. Lead is a well-documented social justice issue because low-income and marginalized communities have endured disproportionately high levels of lead pollution, and so this research will be completed as part of larger program to increase scientific outreach, promote diversity in STEM, and direct the benefits of ecological science towards those who have been systematically harmed by environmental pollution.<br/><br/>The project will reveal how organismal ecology affects the long-term distribution of lead pollution in various ecosystems. Lead pollution results from human activities, but once released into the environment, it can accumulate within organisms. Yet, because of sampling and analytical constraints, very little is known about how lead is integrated into food webs and ecological communities. The Fellow will generate an extensive dataset of lead bioaccumulation using natural history museum bird specimens from the Great Lakes region and next-generation elemental analysis. It is hypothesized that historical lead pollution in the Great Lakes can be elucidated from regional bird specimens because birds occupy diverse ecological niches, have been actively collected by since the 1800s, and permanently accumulate lead in their bones upon exposure, which can now be measured rapidly using portable X-ray fluorescence analyzers. It is expected that bone lead levels will vary among bird species that have different diets and habitat preferences and throughout history as lead pollution rates have changed. Lead contamination is a major environmental justice issue, so this project will actively create opportunities for community members to learn more and participate in the research process. The fellow will develop K-12 outreach program, mentor students from minoritized groups, work with a SACNAS chapter, and explicitly incorporate environmental justice components into the research findings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solving these problems typically requires iterative algorithms like Newton's method, which linearizes the nonlinear problem in each iteration. Newton's method is known for its rapid local convergence. However, the convergence theory only applies when the initialization is (very) close to the unknown solution. Thus, relying on local convergence theory is often impractical. Farther from the solution, small Newton updates are typically necessary to prevent divergence, leading to slow overall convergence. This project aims to develop better nonlinear solvers. This will benefit outer-loop problems, such as parameter estimation, learning, control, or design problems, which typically require solving many nonlinear (inner) problems. The project will also support the training and research of at least one graduate student, the mentoring of undergraduate students through the Courant?s Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program, and the outreach to K-12 students through the cSplash activity in New York City.<br/><br/>To address issues of slow nonlinear convergence, This project aims to develop methods that lift the nonlinear system to a higher-dimensional space, enabling the application of nonlinear transformations that can mitigate nonlinearity before Newton linearization. The project will develop and systematically study the resulting novel Newton methods for severely nonlinear systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed lifting and transformation method can be interpreted as nonlinear preconditioning, a research area much less developed than preconditioning for linear systems. The goal of this project is to study for which classes of nonlinear PDE problems this approach improves convergence, to theoretically analyze why, and to make these methods a more broadly accessible tool for solving severely nonlinear systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both skills are important for school readiness because theory of mind predicts socially competent interactions with peers, and narrative comprehension predicts later reading comprehension.

In addition to training a graduate student in scientific data collection, the research will impact policy related to conservation and environmental management. <br/><br/>In order to test the strength of the relationship between environmental policy and management of species, the investigators use qualitative methods such as participant observation, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and archival research. The research tests for various factors and focuses on several stakeholders such as agriculturalists, scientists, policymakers, and conservationists involved in environmental management and policy. The research makes significant contributions to environmental anthropology, cultural and rural geography, conservation science, and science and technology studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Climate change has had a pronounced impact on vegetative communities globally, causing plant communities to shift in response. Nowhere is this more apparent than at the transitional zones between two distinct ecological systems (ecotones). The coastal marsh-forest ecotone is being strongly influenced by sea-level rise, which has caused forests to retreat and marshes to migrate landward, although these two processes do not always occur in sync. This research will reveal how vegetation is changing, and what factors are causing vegetation shifts to occur. Understanding more about these processes is important because forest retreat and marsh migration may be essential for coastal wetland persistence, which is vital for ecosystem health and to maintain this culturally significant habitat for Indigenous tribes. The fellow will broaden participation of groups underrepresented in biology, particularly aspiring indigenous scientists, with educational outreach activities to local Indigenous tribes in the Chesapeake region and through graduate mentoring and workshops designed for early career indigenous scientists. <br/><br/>This research aims to establish a new paradigm for understanding large-scale vegetation shifts through studying dynamics within ecotones for insight into the climate drivers of the adjacent ecosystems. By characterizing an ecotone as two discrete boundaries, this framework will allow the description of abiotic drivers that influence the leading and lagging edges of an ecotone independently, with major implications for ecotone expanse and species turnover. The fellow will employ remote sensing techniques to track migration rates of the leading and lagging edges of marsh-forest ecotones throughout the Chesapeake Bay. Furthermore, the fellow will use vegetative monitoring to explore how plant communities respond to various rates of migration, and mesocosm experiments to identify drivers in inducing the vegetative shifts that occur in coastal transgression. The fellow will receive mentoring in remote sensing techniques and advisory services to local and regional stakeholders through the sponsoring scientist. The fellow will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in biology through field trips with young tribal members of local Indigenous tribes of Virginia, mentoring indigenous undergraduate and graduate students, and developing networking opportunities for indigenous researchers at the annual Ecological Society of America conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cargo molecules include enzyme intermediates, mammalian signaling molecules, and metal atoms. The trityl forms weak carbon-element bonds due to the high stability of its free radical form, thus it is expected to release these cargo molecules under mild conditions. These cargo molecules will be used to study chemical processes relevant to the global nitrogen cycle, mammalian bioregulation, and the synthesis of magnetic nanomaterials. This research will provide excellent training to undergraduate and graduate students in the synthesis and characterization of air-sensitive inorganic and organometallic clusters and complexes, preparing them for careers in academia and industry.  In addition, Professor Hayton will develop a new undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory describing the synthesis and characterization of the trityl radical. This laboratory will introduce undergraduate students to free radical chemistry, which is infrequently covered in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, but is finding an increased prominence within the modern chemical sciences.<br/><br/>This project will explore the synthesis and development of triphenylmethyl-containing small molecule delivery agents for a variety of applications. The triphenylmethyl (trityl) group is stable in its neutral (radical) form, which enables facile small molecule release upon application of external stimuli, such as oxidation and photolysis. Specific targets include delivery agents for carbon disulfide and sulfur monoxide. The former is a poorly-understood mammalian gasotransmitter, whereas the latter is a proposed intermediate in the nitrous oxide reductase catalytic cycle. Professor Hayton will also develop trityl-containing carrier molecules for vanadium, chromium, and cobalt, which will be used to generate new magnetic materials and metal nanoclusters. These materials are of interest for a variety of applications, such as memory storage and quantum computing.

Miller of the University of Florida will convert post-consumer waste plastic and bio-based feedstocks into a novel family of sustainable polymers with properties suitable for replacing incumbent packaging plastics.  Despite what is taught in most textbooks, the ester functional group is generally more stable than the amide functional group, as proof of concept experiments and computations indicate.  This relative stability will be exploited to synthesize exemplary polymers via Amide to Ester Polymerization (ATEP), an unexplored polymerization pathway particularly suited for the chemical recycling/upcycling of post-consumer polyesters (e.g., water bottles and polyester clothing) and nylons (e.g., backpacks and fishing nets), yielding polyesteramides.  Convergent chemical recycling will transform mixed waste streams of polyesteramides and polyesters into a single monomer suitable for repolymerization.  Alternatively, the polyesteramides will be degraded via hydrolysis under environmentally relevant conditions (e.g., seawater).  Long-term studies will establish polyesteramide degradation rates, while computational studies will explain how they can degrade in water over relatively short timescales?necessary to combat the plague of plastics accumulating in the environment.  The U.S. plastics industry directly employs over one million people and generates $550 billion in annual shipments.  More sustainable polymers?whether from post-consumer materials or bio-based feedstocks?are expected to exceed a 40% market share by 2030.  Inclusion of the proposed ATEP polymers could further accelerate this amazing growth and expand the variety of materials applications.  <br/><br/>While polyester aminolysis is much more facile than hydrolysis or alcoholysis, the formed bis-amides have minimal demand because of their presumed stability.  ATEP creates an application for these bis-amides and is a novel kinetic pathway for their polymerization, generally yielding polyesteramides with properties excelling those of the original polyester.  Key polymer properties include melting temperature and glass transition temperature, and these measured properties will be correlated to polymer structure.  For example, aminolysis of post-consumer PET (polyethylene terephthalate) followed by ATEP will yield polyesteramides with a tunable glass transition temperature that depends on the nature of the amine originally employed for aminolysis.  Polymer upcycling will be achieved when the glass transition temperature substantially excels that of the precursor PET (72 C).  The complexities of ATEP will be unraveled by pursuing specific project goals: (1) optimizing PET aminolytic depolymerization conditions and applying them to a variety of commodity polymers, including polyesters, nylons, and others; (2) optimizing ATEP and comparing polyesteramide properties to those of extant polymers; (3) further developing the thermodynamic and kinetic rationale of ATEP via computational methods; (4) applying ATEP to a variety of bio-based diacids; (5) establishing polyesteramide structure/property relationships; and (6) investigating practical depolymerization conditions, including environmental degradation and chemical recycling.  Exploring the many facets of ATEP will greatly expand the fundamental understanding of polymerization/depolymerization chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, ecosystem functions and services that support life depend on biodiversity. With current unprecedented rates of biodiversity loss, the importance of understanding the consequences of biodiversity change has never been greater. Hundreds of controlled experiments with artificially assembled communities have shown that loss of plant biodiversity reduces the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this mounting evidence, it remains unclear how important biodiversity is for the functioning of naturally assembled communities. Monitoring biodiversity in natural systems continues to be challenging with traditional field-based approaches, which are time consuming, require lots of human resources and can be extremely expensive. Thus, we need more efficient ways to characterize and monitor biodiversity to understand the potential consequences of biodiversity change for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. This study uses a standardized network of observational studies to evaluate the effects of multiple dimensions of biodiversity on terrestrial ecosystem productivity. The broader impacts of this project include: i) advancing the career and professional development of two early career scientists from an underrepresented group; and ii) contributing to the training of undergraduate students in STEM in the use of spatial technologies to characterize plant biodiversity across large environmental gradients. Finally, the project will quantify different facets of biodiversity across NEON domains using remote sensing, which will be essential to provide an updated status of trends of biodiversity globally.<br/><br/>The project will integrate theory, remote sensing technologies, and field-based observations to understand the impacts of plant biodiversity for the productivity of grasslands and forests. The study will test the hypothesis that plant biodiversity will increase the productivity of grasslands and forest ecosystems. This hypothesis will be evaluated with a conceptual framework to identify the potential mechanisms explaining how primary productivity increases with plant biodiversity. The project will evaluate the extent to which different facets of biodiversity estimated using remote sensing techniques can predict primary productivity of evergreen, deciduous, and mixed forests across the United States. Thus, the project addresses important gaps in our ability to predict terrestrial ecosystem functions using remotely-sensed biodiversity across major biomes. This research will address fundamental questions about how biodiversity changes across regional scales, and the potential consequences of that change for ecosystem functioning. The research is innovative as it will provide an integrative framework that combines ground-based data, airborne imagery, and biogeochemical cycles to improve our understanding on how plant communities influence ecosystem productivity. The generated models across regional scales and biomes will also provide a baseline to develop more accurate land surface models to improve predictions on how carbon and fluxes will respond to predicted climate changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Semiconductor nanocrystals are well-established as a system with unique and size-tunable electronic properties, as emphasized by the awarding of the 2023 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the formation of nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs). Although much effort has been devoted to understanding how organic molecules and inorganic complexes that adhere to the surfaces of nanocrystals in solutions can guide nanocrystal growth and the resulting shapes, there are relatively few examples of selective modification of different nanocrystal facets. The ability to selectively modify nanocrystal surfaces according to crystal size and symmetry, leading to control over the type and spatial orientation of interparticle interactions, could ultimately enable new applications of fluorescent and/or magnetic nanocrystals ranging from efficient LEDs, to fluorescent voltage sensors, to quantum information technologies, to multiplexed detection of biomarkers.

A model gyrating engine is proposed to study theoretical limits to the maximal power and optimal efficiency that thermal engines can operate during finite-time cyclic operations. The sought quantitative theory to explain limits on how much power can be generated, and suggest ways to attain such, will have a broad range of applications in engineered systems and in gaining insights into biological ones. The intellectual merits of the project include contrasting the performance of model engines to that of naturally occurring biological processes, such as bacterial flagellar motors, and to derive theoretical bounds that limit the amount power that can be generated by physical processes. The broader impact of the project is to enable technological breakthroughs in nanoscale engines and in understanding biological processes, that in turn will bring economic and societal benefits, and inspire younger generations of students.<br/><br/>The fundamental issue that the project aims to quantify is the tradeoff between work produced and dissipation generated by a process that operates in a cyclic manner, over a finite period, and in contact with heat baths of different temperature.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Few structures are as ubiquitous or essential to life on earth as the leaf. These photosynthetic factories use energy from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugar, which in turn supports a multitude of life forms from insects to humans. Leaves, with their tremendous array of shapes and sizes, demonstrate the remarkable adaptability of plants. Due to their relative immobility, some plants have evolved the ability to produce multiple types of leaves on a single plant as a response to changes in their surroundings. This trait, known as heterophylly, is exemplified by aquatic plants which often produce different types of leaves above and below the water. In some cases, plants even modify how they take up carbon dioxide depending on their environment. A convenient example of both is found in Littorella uniflora, a freshwater plant that alters its leaf shape and photosynthetic pathway in response to changing water levels. While it?s simple to observe these physical changes, the mechanisms behind them remain largely unexplored. This research seeks to bridge the gap between genetics and the environment by addressing how plants adapt and respond to highly variable ecosystems.  Broader impacts from this work focus on training and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, engaging the public through digital media and academic outreach programs, and making findings accessible through lectures and publications. Furthermore, the results of this project will be essential to guiding conservation and agricultural practices in the face of a shifting and uncertain global climate.<br/><br/>Facultative shifts in leaf anatomy and physiology provide alternate but overlapping methods that allow aquatic plants to maximize photosynthetic efficiency in response to changes in their immediate surroundings. The project aims to use L. uniflora as a model to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of heterophylly and facultative CAM photosynthesis using high-resolution transcriptomic methods and comparative phylogenetics. Close comparison of leaf development under a range of conditions will allow characterization of the relationship between leaf form and function. Alongside anatomical observations, single-cell and bulk RNAseq will be used to generate an atlas of gene expression in developing leaves, and facilitate identification of key developmental genes and pathways driving shifts in anatomy and physiology. The association of gene expression and development will be further confirmed using in-situ hybridization. Finally, transcriptomic data will be compared with other plants, in particular within Plantaginaceae, to characterize changes in evolutionary rates, signatures of selection, and expansion/contraction of gene families related to adaptations to the aquatic environment. Comparative transcriptomic analyses will contribute to a broader perspective of genetic adaptation across land plants, placing the results in an evolutionary context.  This project will provide students with training in wet lab techniques and bioinformatic analysis as well as education in aquatic botany and plant developmental and evolutionary biology. Mentees will also be integrated into public outreach focused on aquatic plants and their unique adaptations to freshwater environments. To ensure accessibility, all transcriptomic data generated by this research will be made publicly available through NCBI and the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with anatomical observations and images deposited on Dryad and a public GitHub repository.

This conference series, initiated in 2003, aims to deepen the understanding of collective action in social dilemma settings such as public goods provision, natural resource extraction, and climate change. Social dilemmas are situations where individual incentives conflict with collective interests. Understanding their dynamics is essential for developing effective policies and strategies that promote cooperative behavior for the greater good. The conference promotes and disseminates state-of-the-art research on social dilemmas. Furthermore, the ninth conference seeks to identify scientific and political issues concerning social dilemmas, with emphasis on relatively under researched and highly relevant areas such as conflict resolution, environmental and climate change economics, revisited considering recent developments, and the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence in these contexts. The introduction of Artificial Intelligence's (AIs) role in solving social dilemmas to the workshop's agenda is a particularly timely and innovative addition. This event brings together leading scholars from diverse disciplines, to share their latest research and insights. Emphasizing mentoring, the conference includes dedicated sessions for young scholars, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to support their professional growth and inclusion in these crucial research fields. These efforts aim to facilitate the inclusion and exchange of diverse perspectives and enhance the effectiveness of self-organized collective action and policy initiatives addressing critical societal challenges. <br/><br/>The Ninth Biennial Conference on Social Dilemmas convenes a multidisciplinary group of researchers to discuss advanced topics in social dilemmas.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Animals routinely enter into beneficial relationships with microbial communities. Those communities are called a microbiome and greatly impact the host?s biology. The relationship between host and microbiome is so inseparable that a theory has been proposed that considers hosts and microbiomes as a single unit on which evolution acts. However, some organisms, like the rat lungworm parasite, have life histories that limit exposure to microorganisms. This project will determine if rat lungworm parasites need a microbiome, and if so, where it is obtained, and if having the microbiome leads to more successful parasites. The project will use data to build new mathematical models that include the microbiome as an important part of parasite transmission. The Fellow will participate in research with Pacific Islander students in Hawai?i and hold workshops with governmental agencies across the southeastern United States to increase awareness about the parasite and its emerging threat to wildlife and human health in the region. <br/><br/>This research will investigate the role of microbiomes in the life cycle of the rat lungworm, Angiostrongylus cantonensis (Nematoda). Experimental infections will be performed using axenic and non-axenic hosts and parasites to 1) determine if A. cantonensis successfully develop into their transmissible stages (L1 larvae in the definitive host Rattus rattus and L3 larvae in the intermediate host Lissachatina fulica) in the absence of microbiomes, and 2) if microbiomes are needed for parasite development, to describe the composition of the microbiomes using next-generation sequencing. Immunological data will be generated using the intermediate host, L. fulica, and will be measured and quantified using molecular and cellular techniques. Combined, the microbiome and immunological data will be used to develop a novel parasite transmission model that will be an important advance for parasitological understanding. The project?s broader impacts involve mentoring in the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program: ?Environmental Biology for Pacific Islanders?, and hosting workshops aimed at relevant state agencies in the southeastern United States where rat lungworm is currently emerging as a potential threat to wildlife and human health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With more than 1,700 known species in rivers and lakes of the Americas, Africa, the Levant, Madagascar and India, cichlid fishes ?one of the largest families of freshwater fishes? can help answer these questions. Although their evolutionary timescale is poorly understood, cichlids boast an extensive fossil record. These poorly-studied fossils could provide a window into the group?s ancient past. This project will study living and fossil cichlids to provide a better picture of when major events in cichlid evolution occurred. The project will also explore how cichlid ecology changed through time by comparing fossils with today?s living species, with the goal of understanding the life history of ancient cichlids. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher, two PhD students, a Master?s student, a technician, and undergraduate students, emphasizing development of transferable skills across STEM and non-STEM fields. The researchers will engage public audiences through university and public museums in the US, and in collaborating museums in Kenya, Brazil and the Dominican Republic. Museum-based activities and associated materials will be produced in English, Portuguese, and Spanish and shared with all participant institutions. Undergraduate teaching modules will be developed and made available as online resources for educators.<br/><br/>Cichlid fishes represent a textbook model system for studying adaptive radiation, sexual selection, speciation, and the interplay between ecology and evolution. Despite their importance in biological research, our understanding of cichlid evolution is limited by the lack of an accurate timescale for the group?s evolutionary history. While fossils represent the principal source of temporal data in macroevolutionary studies, a barrier their incorporation is a lack of phenotypic character sets that include both extant and fossil species. Additionally, the surprisingly rich cichlid fossil record, a direct source of temporal information, remains incompletely integrated with the growing body of data available for living species. This work will produce phylogenomic data along with the first comprehensive morphological character set for cichlids, and new phenotypic data extracted from well-preserved fossil specimens. The project will: (i) leverage computed tomographic (CT) examination of modern and fossil specimens to create a morphological framework for explicitly including fossil cichlids in a phylogenetic context with living species; (ii) combine these phenotypic data for extinct and living cichlids with existing phylogenomic resources to infer a comprehensive, dated genus-level phylogeny for cichlids; and (iii) test the impact of fossils on inferred patterns of cichlid ecomorphology and macroevolution on timescales of tens of millions of years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lateral carbon export, or carbon outwelling, is impacted by tides and seaward groundwater flow. To date, studies of salt marsh carbon outwelling have focused on periods when biological activity is relatively high (i.e., spring through fall). As a result, prior studies have often neglected export during cold seasons, assuming that marshes are either impermeable due to frozen conditions or biologically inactive. This oversight limits annual water and carbon budget estimates to only a fraction of the year, potentially underestimating salt marshes? carbon storage potential and influence on the coastal ocean carbon budget. This project will address this knowledge gap by investigating the magnitude and drivers of cold season water and carbon export in North Atlantic salt marshes. This understanding is critical for refining estimates of carbon outwelling and improving understanding of the relative role of temperate salt marshes as a carbon sink. The project will develop a Science Exploration and Education from a Kayak (SEEK) program to teach middle-school students how to sea kayak while also teaching them coastal science through hand-on learning in the field. This project will also train a postdoctoral researcher, graduate student, and multiple undergraduate students through summer programs.<br/><br/>Cold-season hydrological dynamics and biogeochemical processes have seldom been evaluated in salt marshes, preventing accurate estimates of local and global carbon outwelling. This project?s goal is to better understand cold-season freeze-thaw processes, groundwater flow dynamics, and lateral carbon export in North Atlantic salt marshes. The project will (1) monitor soil temperatures and groundwater and surface water levels, salinity, and temperature in four salt marshes between Massachusetts, USA, and Nova Scotia, Canada, to gain better understanding of the extent and duration of marsh freezing; (2) quantify groundwater discharge in summer through spring, as well as during storm events, to compare discharge magnitude and sources across all seasons; and (3) evaluate seasonal variability in salt marsh porewater carbon concentrations and quantify carbon outwelling from the marsh platform to the tidal channel across seasons and following winter events. This project will result in increased understanding of coastal hydrological processes, refined carbon outwelling estimates, and improved projections of carbon outwelling dynamics in mid- to high-latitude salt marshes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over-reliance on fossil-derived compounds to generate energy and chemical products has led to substantial emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). Immediate steps are needed to create a circular carbon economy, where CO2 is effectively reused and valorized into new products. This project advances the science and technology of reusing CO2 captured from air into potentially valuable products, specifically into biofuels. The overarching goal of this project is to achieve full CO2 utilization towards renewable-fuel production via an integrated nanomaterials light-based (photocatalytic) process combined with bioprocesses. The project will develop a core fundamental-level understanding of how nano-scale catalyst structure can controllably result in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce the one-carbon compound carbon monoxide (CO), which serves as an intermediate chemical converted to biofuels by bacteria. The project also will help meet the demand for a skilled workforce and accelerate STEM education. The project will train and encourage motivated teachers and students from local high schools and community colleges, particularly those from underserved groups, to participate in the hands-on summer research experience. The experiences will nurture nanotechnology and biotechnology principles in high school science laboratories. The project also will stimulate public interest by disseminating scientific findings through social media supported by the NSF Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine, Global Center for Water Technology, and the Biodesign Institute at ASU.<br/><br/>The research will develop the science and engineering foundations for a new, synergistic system capable of advancing the circular carbon economy. One of the project?s fundamental insights includes advancing reactor design by improving the efficiency of using light energy by employing nanoscale-photocatalysts coated on optical fibers and by understanding how water chemistry affects CO2 reduction. Nanotechnology will be used to optimize the material structures of the catalysts. Novel techniques to apply nanomaterials to optical fibers that side-emit light will eliminate reliance upon slurries of catalysts. The optical fibers also optimize utilization of light supplied into the reactors. To maximize CO2-delivery efficiency, the gas-permeable fibers can prevent bubble formation during gas delivery and achieve 100% transfer efficiency. The combined optical fibers plus gas-permeable fibers in one reactor are a unique technological advance that will be optimized to convert CO2 into CO. Then, the CO will be converted into longer-chain organic compounds via microbial chain elongation using a model bacteria strain. Key to chain elongation will be the ability to manage bacterial biofilms of a synthetic Clostridium coculture through optimized CO delivery and utilization that relies on the control of inter-strain metabolic interactions. The synergistic photocatalytic-bioprocessing platform will achieve efficient CO2 conversion and valorization while promoting environmental and economic sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unrealistic optimism influences people's decisions about many aspects of life, such as in health, education, and the workplace. Researchers, however, do not know whether unrealistic optimism is helpful or harmful in these situations. Unrealistic optimism might impair decision making and stop people from trying other options. On the other hand, unrealistic optimism might help people cope with challenges or find motivation for difficult tasks. By learning whether unrealistic optimism is helpful or harmful, this study show educators, managers, and coaches how to help everyone make great decisions and have the best chances of success. <br/><br/>This study aims to reconcile contradictions in prior research by determining whether unrealistic optimism helps or hurts and explaining why. The study distinguishes between different outcomes of unrealistic optimism (focal, alternative, and tertiary outcomes) and measures unrealistic optimism by comparing participants? expectations to data-based predictions. The study follows minor league baseball players attempting to reach the Major League Baseball for 3 years and high school juniors attempting to get into college for 2 years. Bayesian model testing determines how unrealistic optimism affects focal outcomes (reaching Major League Baseball, getting accepted to top universities) and influences alternatives. The study also measures variables that explain the consequences of unrealistic optimism. Results from this research have the potential to reconcile debates in social science by testing competing hypotheses, collecting new, insightful data, and introducing an overarching framework that can accommodate conflicting evidence and organize future research on unrealistic optimism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This method will specifically be used to provide details on the genetic and genealogical ancestors of human populations, with a focus on African-Americans. In doing so, the project aspires to directly address underrepresentation of genetically admixed populations in population genetics research, while also providing a general method to explore the genealogical and genetic ancestries of diverse human and non-human populations.<br/><br/>Genetic admixture is increasingly recognized as a fundamental process in evolutionary biology. Genetically admixed populations result from the interbreeding of two or more previously isolated populations. Admixture shapes genetic diversity across many forms of life, serving as an important vehicle for the introduction of genetic variation into populations. Typically, genetic admixture is characterized by assessing the proportion of genetic ancestry that admixed populations share with known source populations. Here, the fellow advances a new perspective, devising a method for exploring complex admixture histories using a set of equations derived from properties of mechanistic admixture processes for diploid populations. This method will then be specifically used to estimate features of the formation of the African-American population from distinct regions of Africa. The fellow will compile this method into software that will assist in exploring the diverse African ancestry of African-Americans. This research will provide training for the fellow in mathematical modeling and population-genetic methods development, while expanding the fellow?s research focus to include the field of human population genetics.

States vary regarding their regulations for cannabis advertising (e.g., health claims, youth-targeting) and required health warnings, which may have implications for cannabis-related disparities. Advertising restrictions are important, given that product ads and/or characteristics (e.g., flavors) may appeal to specific groups, and the use of health claims, price promotions, and various marketing channels (e.g., digital media). Health warnings can effectively communicate risks and reduce substance use rates. This research aims to reduce cannabis use and related disparities by advancing the evidence regarding risk perceptions, use decisions, and their determinants, specifically cannabis regulations and industry marketing. This study is among the first to address key research gaps including limited research: a) comprehensively analyzing cannabis marketing data; b) using industry market research strategies to understand lifestyle profiles of young adults most likely to use cannabis; and c) of cannabis ad and warning messages.<br/><br/>This mixed-methods study will address 3 aims.

This work is intended to advance DACs' resilience to climate change. Specifically, new solar cell systems will be built to supply stable electricity services to address the overload/blackouts communities often face during natural disasters. New electrochemistry technologies will also be developed to offer reliable potable water sources at the community level. Leveraging the expertise of researchers from Louisiana Tech University, Jackson State University, and the University of Nevada-Reno, the team will deploy MEWRS to the targeted DACs sites to support their unmet and unpredictable needs for low-cost energy and clean water without reliance on external resources and/or skilled expertise. The project is also partnering with relevant industrial participants to design, assemble, and manufacture MEWRS components for adoption in the targeted DACs. Integrated with these research activities, this project will help recruit and train current and future workforce in renewable energy, water treatment, waste recycling, and artificial intelligence skills. Given the high solar radiation level in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Nevada, such solar-powered, clean, and healthy water generation systems are expected to promote the sustainability of the environment, health, and economies of communities in the three involved states, and serve as a showcase for climate change adaptation for EPSCoR jurisdictions. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop Mobile Energy-Water Reuse Systems (MEWRS) using research advances in nanomaterials and electrochemistry to provide a safe and reliable water and energy supply in disproportionately affected communities (DACs).

They are indispensable in modeling solids, fluids, electromagnetics, and even the spacetime we occupy, all areas touched upon in this project. The overarching goal of this project is to build new numerical facilities for approximating certain important tensor fields using new finite elements. The pursuit of this goal is guided not only by the utilitarian considerations of the applications, but also by the elegance of mathematical structures within which the new numerical tools potentially fit. These abstract structures have transdisciplinary connections, including applications of societal impact in material science, fluid dynamics, and optics.<br/><br/>Several specific tensor functions, rich in applications, are targeted in this study for finite element approximation. They include the Riemann curvature tensor on manifolds, the Cauchy stress tensor in solid mechanics, and viscous stresses in incompressible fluids. Certain second-order differential operators, like the incompatibility operator, arising in mechanics and linearized relativity, are targeted for approximation using distributional techniques suited for non-smooth finite elements. The project develops new simulation tools for temporal evolution of certain tensors using symplectic integrators and automatic locally variable timestepping using spacetime tents. Varied elements of this project are unified by a modern viewpoint, exemplified by fitting many existing scalar and vector finite elements into a subcomplex of the de Rham complex. The search for a similar unifying algebraic structure connecting tensor spaces, through certain natural second-order differential operators, is a common mathematical thread running through all aspects of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viruses are the most abundant biological entity on the planet, but research is only just beginning to estimate the true diversity of virus species that infect plant, animal, and microbial hosts in the wild. Agriculturally significant viruses (e.g. those that elicit disease symptoms in crop plants) are studied and managed, but less is known about viruses that interact with wild plants, like the prairie sunflower (Helianthus petiolaris). This research will explore the consequences of diverse virus infections for sunflowers native to western grasslands of North America. Experimental infection trials in greenhouses, as well as infection plus drought experiments, will determine how viruses impact sunflower survival and fitness, particularly under stressful drought conditions. Results will provide historical context for understanding coevolutionary dynamics between plants and viruses, and will improve epidemiological predictions regarding plant-virus interactions in changing environments. The outcomes of this research will have conservation value for predicting and assisting virus-mediated adaptation to climate change in native plant populations and applied value for improving disease forecasting in agricultural contexts. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to generate novel temporal and biogeographic understanding of the eco-evolutionary mechanisms that govern virus richness and abundance, and will test fundamental questions about an understudied axis of biotic interactions. To complete this work, the applicant will use rigorous methodologies and existing resources to study new questions across biological scales, including virus metagenomic sequencing techniques, resurrection trials using historical host seeds, and fully-factorial field experiments. This project is novel because it i) facilitates simultaneous consideration of abiotic selective pressure for both host and virus symbionts and ii) will isolate potential mechanisms governing virus distribution and diversity across metapopulations of a single host species, which has not previously been accomplished in any system. Data and research products from the proposed project will be disseminated to scientific, student, and agricultural communities through formal channels (conferences, undergraduate curricula, and peer-reviewed publications) and community-oriented events (workshops, lab and field exercises, and stakeholder gatherings).

Such arrangement leads to engineered physical properties that are not directly accessible with their individual constituents. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support research that investigates the mechanics of a novel class of architected materials that constitute multiple material phases, specifically a soft solid and a liquid. This entails understanding the influence of solid-liquid phase interaction and geometrical arrangement on the mechanical response of these materials under external stimuli. The knowledge generated will allow creation of architected materials with tunable, multifunctional material response. This in turn allows design of structures and devices that emulate the flexibility and toughness of soft biological matter, without their complexity, for biomedical, healthcare, and soft robotics applications. Example applications include realistic organ models, energy absorbing structures, and flexible actuators or sensors. The educational plan will investigate pathways for integrating computational science and engineering, an increasingly critical component for all engineers and scientists, into mechanical engineering education and dissemination through modern web-based interactive computing platforms.<br/><br/>The overarching research objective is to understand the nonlinear thermomechanics of soft architected materials that embed liquid phase inclusions of characteristic sizes ~0.1-1 mm within a soft elastomeric solid to be created via a novel additive manufacturing process. To understand the effective material behavior and mechanics of these materials, a nonlinear homogenization framework that considers the liquid inclusion geometry, topology, and its interface with the solid will be developed. The homogenization framework will be validated via mechanical testing on additively manufactured specimens. The research performed will advance our understanding of architected materials with complex microstructures and multifunctional behavior and can potentially be extended to hierarchical multiscale materials. The main synergistic educational activity will involve the development of a science gateway to host a collection of open-source computational tools and educational resources relevant to architected materials.

For this reason, observational studies, wherein the assignment of group status to individuals is outside the control of the researcher, often represent the only path forward for inferring causal effects. While observational data are often inexpensive to collect and plentiful, regrettably, they suffer from inescapable biases due to self-selection. In short, associations between group status and outcomes of interest need not reflect causal effects, as the groups being compared might have considerable differences on the basis of factors unavailable for adjustment. This project will develop new methods for sensitivity analysis in observational studies, which answer the question, ""How much-unmeasured confounding would need to exist to overturn a study's finding of a causal effect?"" Quantifying the robustness of observational findings to hidden bias will help frame the debate around the reliability of such studies, allowing researchers to highlight findings that are particularly resilient to lurking variables. This project provides both theoretical guidance on how to extract the most out of a sensitivity analysis and computationally tractable methods for making this guidance actionable. Moreover, when randomized experimentation is possible, the developed methods will help researchers use existing observational studies for hypothesis generation, enabling them to find sets of promising outcome variables whose causal effects may be verified through follow-up experimentation. This award includes support for work with graduate students.<br/><br/>This project develops a new set of statistical methods for conducting sensitivity analyses after matching. These methods aim to overcome shortcomings of the existing approach, conferring computational, theoretical, and practical benefits. The project will provide a new approach to sensitivity analysis after matching called weighting-after-matching. The project will establish computational benefits, theoretical improvements in design sensitivity, and practical improvements in the power of a sensitivity analysis by using weighting-after-matching in lieu of the traditional unweighted approach. The project will also establish novel methods for sensitivity analysis with multiple outcome variables. These innovations will include a scalable multiple testing procedure for observational studies, facilitating exploratory analysis while providing control of the proportion of false discoveries, and methods for sensitivity analysis using weighting-after-matching for testing both sharp null hypotheses of no effect at all and hypotheses on average treatment effects. Finally, the project will establish previously unexplored benefits from using matching and weighting in combination, two modes of adjustment in observational studies commonly viewed as competitors. This will help bridge the divide between matching estimators and weighting estimators in the context of a sensitivity, in so doing providing a natural avenue for theoretical comparisons of these approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Selfish elements are genes that provide germline stem cells (GSCs), which produce sperm in males, with a competitive advantage over their neighbors. This allows GSCs to transmit their genes at an exceptionally high rate, known as gene drive, but regulation of gene drive remains poorly understood. Mutations in the gene chinmo act as a selfish element in GSCs from male fruit flies. The Chinmo protein binds DNA to change expression of specific genes, although how Chinmo is regulated and how it binds DNA are unknown. Defining these mechanisms will benefit our understanding of gene drive, which has relevance to evolution, ecology, and population genetics.  The fellow will perform outreach on the behalf of the National Postdoc Association in their advocacy and diversity branches. <br/><br/>It is known that chinmo-mutant GSCs remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to outcompete wild-type neighbor GSCs. The fellow hypothesizes that the chinmo-mutant allele causes gene drive due to dysregulation of direct Chinmo target genes, whose identities are unknown. First, the fellow will use CUT&RUN to identify Chinmo binding sites on chromatin, and RNAseq following Chinmo depletion to identify transcriptional targets in GSCs. Candidates will be prioritized for further study based on robustness of peaks and transcriptional changes upon Chinmo loss, and assessed for their role in ECM remodeling and GSC competition. Second, the fellow has identified three transcription factors that when depleted from GSCs also remodel the ECM. This suggests that they regulate cell competition as Chinmo co-factors. The fellow will investigate these three genes for their roles in GSC competition and gene drive using clonal assays. The fellow will use CUT&RUN and RNAseq to assess if these transcription factors share common target genes with Chinmo. Completing the proposed research will train the fellow in genomic techniques and clonal analyses, as well as in the topics of cell competition, gene drive, and gene regulation.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Diverse organisms ? from tiny microbes, to larger plants and animals ? vary remarkably in body form and lifestyle. Surprisingly, simple rules, such as ?allometric scaling laws?, can explain much of this variation. On average, metabolism, growth, feeding rates, and other traits scale predictably with organismal body size. Yet, there is variation not described by allometric scaling that represents adaptations to special ecological conditions. Fast-paced organisms have higher metabolisms relative to their size and therefore tend to have riskier and more aggressive behaviors when hunting because they need more food, while slow-paced organisms have behaviors to reduce activity and avoid predators. However, the extent to which this ?pace of life? affects predator-prey interactions, food webs, or ecosystems is unknown. This project will develop rules of life for how fast-slow variation affects ecological dynamics across spatial and biological scales using theoretical models and activity data from fish, mammals, and insects. The results will improve the predictive ability of population and food web models, including those used to manage commercial, recreational, and indigenous fisheries. The fellow will coordinate seminars with local and binational (US-Canada) management agencies to operationalize model results for the Great Lakes basin.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to (1) characterize intra- and interspecific variation in bioenergetic and behavioral traits, (2) test for covariation in these traits, which may form integrated ecological strategies corresponding to a pace of life for foraging, (3) study how (co)variation may result in characteristic dynamics in pairwise consumer-resource interactions, and (4) quantify how these dynamics propagate through food webs and across landscapes to affect emergent ecosystem functions such as productivity, yield, and temporal stability. To accomplish these objectives, the fellow will analyze a database of metabolic measurements and highly-resolved telemetry data for individuals of known body size across taxa. The fellow will use computational experiments to study allometrically-scaled consumer-resource models with newly-introduced parameters for activity, mobility, foraging adaptivity, and metabolic flexibility. Qualitative predictions will be tested using empirical data for food web dynamics and ecosystem function along a gradient of agricultural intensification from pristine communities (high trait variation) to monocultures (low trait variation).

Given the complexity of mixed mobility systems, a convergence approach is necessary. This approach could revolutionize our understanding of adaptive transportation and technology while fostering a diverse, globally engaged workforce with top-notch skills. To address this timely imperative, the project team uses an innovative, three-year US-Korea mutual workforce development initiative, hosting over 13 graduate students from each country annually for 6.5 weeks. This initiative aims to catalyze advanced international research alliances in next-generation workforce development by focusing on the seamless convergence of GenAI and disruptive technologies into unified student learning outcomes. Built upon the success of a prior IRES initiative, which has inspired a parallel Reverse US-Korea IRES initiative by the National Research Foundation of Korea, the proposed program focuses on groundbreaking research that integrates large language models into adaptable and responsive mobility solutions. This IRES program propels the development of a diverse, globally engaged workforce with world-class skills, as it is designed to function with enhanced intensity and efficiency towards fostering the exchange of novel ideas among IRES fellows. Such a collaborative environment within the overarching theme of ?Mobility Solutions of the Future with GenAI? will enable IRES fellows to address impending grand challenges in diverse contexts in order for them to develop globally applicable, verifiable, and repeatable theories, use cases, and algorithms. Six foreign collaborators at KAIST in Daejeon, South Korea, will contribute to transformative action learning opportunities and mentorship for the IRES fellows during their stay in South Korea. <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to expedite the development of new knowledge and technologies in GenAI by cultivating a globally competitive and diverse research workforce. The main objectives of this IRES are twofold: first, to foster the growth of a skilled workforce in the emerging field of mobility-GenAI partnership, and second, to generate a new and effective mobility-GenAI knowledge use case database on an annual basis, which can then be integrated into a cohesive cyberlearning platform for sustainable workforce development. The research themes and their convergence in the project's final year will uniquely facilitate comparative analysis and predictive modeling of various management and operational scenarios. This acceleration can maximize societal benefits by fostering a highly safe, efficient, and sustainable future transportation system. Beyond transportation engineering, management, and operation, the interdisciplinary nature of this two-way US-Korea IRES research offers broader social benefits. It delves into understanding human-GenAI interactions concerning transportation policies and their consequential impacts on mobility, safety, and the environment. Collaboration with communities and industry practitioners equips IRES fellows with world-class skills to tackle the complexities and challenges of real-world problems. The proposed IRES workforce training activities are grounded in Experiential Learning Theory (ELT), which underscores the principle of ?learning by doing.? Following the ELT principles of knowledge creation and action learning, this proposal outlines a novel three-pronged pedagogical strategy: (1) the development of conceptualized use cases, (2) transitioning from traditional pedagogy to an entirely research-driven project-based action learning format, and (3) engaging use-infused research projects. This US-Korea mutual IRES is tailored to provide a robust foundation for theoretical and practical exploration, yielding groundbreaking insights into the interconnected impacts of mobility, safety, society, and global warming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biomedical studies of diverse pathogens have led to a growing body of knowledge on how pathogens cause us harm. Yet these studies largely leave open the question of why harm the very source of your livelihood, your host? Existing theory on the evolution of virulence points to the importance of tradeoffs between transmission and harm to the host, that imply that some degree of harm is necessary in order to transmit to the next host. While influential, the current tradeoff models make a number of assumptions that do not hold for the large number of bacterial pathogens that can also prosper in environments outside of the host, therefore weakening the importance of host-to-host transmission. The current project seeks to develop new theory to understand how virulence is shaped by environmental pressures in bacterial pathogens with more complex environmental lifestyles. The project calls these highly flexible organisms ?environmentally derived opportunistic pathogens?, reflecting their ability to grow in diverse environments, unfortunately including humans. The project will combine diverse computational, experimental and theoretical tools to develop a predictive understanding of the environmental and genomic forces that together govern the evolution of virulence.<br/><br/>Environmentally-derived bacterial opportunistic pathogens are a growing global concern, with increasing numbers of deadly human infections driven by bacteria previously considered to be primarily environmental organisms. A cornerstone of infectious disease control is the development of predictive epidemiological models. Yet in the case of environmental opportunists, conventional modeling approaches are limited. The most influential approach is to construct compartmental models tracking the dynamics of susceptible and infected individuals, coupled by processes of direct (host-to-host) transmission and virulence. This approach has been adapted to address environmental opportunists via the addition of indirect transmission through an ?environmental reservoir? compartment. These models have provided qualitative insights into potential evolutionary dynamics of opportunistic virulence, given assumed tradeoffs with transmission, but are limited by an absence of data on whether virulence and transmission (direct and indirect) tradeoff at all. Machine learning tools have more recently been applied to opportunistic pathogens, with the goal to predict virulence phenotypes from genomic data of clinical infection isolates. Yet this approach is limited by an exclusive focus on clinical isolates (?winners? of the infection process, potentially systematically different from environmental isolates) and an absence of transmission analyses. This project will build an extensive library of clinical and environmental strains of the model opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and probe variation across strains using a mixture of machine learning and mathematical modeling tools. The project hypothesizes that that virulence and transmission (direct and indirect) are strain-specific, predictable from genomic features, and not constrained by classical virulence/transmission tradeoffs. To test these hypotheses, the project will pursue the following aims: (i) Develop and test predictive models of strain-specific virulence, transmission, and environment of origin; (ii) Develop and test predictive models of virulence and transmission evolution, as a function of environment and ancestral genotype.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hippotamus (Hippos) are crucial members of the rivers they live in. Hippos spend their days wallowing in pools, adding large amounts of nutrients from their urine and feces. During the dry season, water levels drop, and some pools become more isolated than others. When hippos defecate into isolated pools, bacteria from hippo feces dominate the community of bacteria in pools. When the rains return, stagnant water is flushed out, and the bacterial community in the pools becomes more similar to the river. While the effects of flushing on pools are known, how hippos are affected remains un-studied. The bacteria in animal guts affect their health and social behavior, so the rapid turnover in pool microbiomes during the rainy season may affect hippo well-being and sociality. This research will study connections scaling from bacteria up to rivers to understand hippos? health better. <br/><br/>This project will investigate two main mechanisms that could affect hippo gut microbial communities (microbiomes): the hydrologic connectivity of pools and hippo grouping behavior. Aim 1 tests how hydrological connectivity affects the hippo microbiome. Hippo density and pool size interact to shape the biogeochemistry of pools and rivers. Hippo gut microbiomes affect ecosystem health by making pools more toxic. Whether changes in the pool microbiome affect hippos' guts, in turn, remains un-studied. Aim 2 tests the impact of hippo behavior on hippo guts. Hippos live in stable home ranges for years. Females and young overlap dominant males, who exclude bachelor males. Aim 2 will test how these grouping patterns affect hippo density and how density affects the hippo gut. Aim 3 tests how these two mechanisms affect hippo health. Gut microbial diversity is an important indicator of gut health, with more diverse gut microbiomes providing more host benefits. While pool size and hippo density may affect the gut microbiome of hippos, whether these changes are important for hippo health remains to be studied.

Motivating paradigms include chemical concentration gradients in organisms that power biological engines as well as thermal gradients that may power nano-engines. A model gyrating engine is proposed to study theoretical limits to the maximal power and optimal efficiency that thermal engines can operate during finite-time cyclic operations. The sought quantitative theory to explain limits on how much power can be generated, and suggest ways to attain such, will have a broad range of applications in engineered systems and in gaining insights into biological ones. The intellectual merits of the project include contrasting the performance of model engines to that of naturally occurring biological processes, such as bacterial flagellar motors, and to derive theoretical bounds that limit the amount power that can be generated by physical processes. The broader impact of the project is to enable technological breakthroughs in nanoscale engines and in understanding biological processes, that in turn will bring economic and societal benefits, and inspire younger generations of students.<br/><br/>The fundamental issue that the project aims to quantify is the tradeoff between work produced and dissipation generated by a process that operates in a cyclic manner, over a finite period, and in contact with heat baths of different temperature. Such a problem, to quantify the power that can be generated by exploiting thermal gradients has been a challenging one in classical thermodynamics, yet amenable to the tools of stochastic control that have been developed in recent years. The goal of the NSF project is to thereby advance the understanding, and develop computational tools for the analysis and synthesis of processes that act as thermodynamic gyrating engines generating power from their anisotropic thermal environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of the 770,000 employed welders in the US, more than 155,000 are approaching retirement age. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted in-person welding instruction significantly, decreasing the availability of the career pathway to prospective students. These workforce shortages lead to a gap between funding levels for major infrastructure projects, such as those funded by the bipartisan infrastructure bill, and the availability of skilled workers to build them. In Northern Virginia, data center construction is at an all-time high with nearly 1 gigawatt of construction planned. Data centers have high volume water, HVAC, and power systems that require significant pipe welding, both onsite and offsite. Without a strong career pathway in welding, these critical infrastructure projects will be harder to complete.<br/><br/>Project BUILD intends to support revitalization and growth of the welding program at Northern Virginia Community College through (1) a curriculum redesign and resequencing with input from a business and industry leadership team (BILT), (2) the development of a welding fabrication capstone course, (3) support for co-curricular welding opportunities in collaboration with existing college clubs and programs, and (4) a structured high school outreach and engagement strategy to recruit students for this career pathway. BUILD will improve welding instruction at NOVA by redesigning and resequencing courses to be responsive to industry needs. This improved instruction will help meet regional demand for welders caused by an aging workforce. BUILD will provide welding students with access to co-curricular supports to improve their competitiveness on the job market.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. As climate change alters ocean salinity, biodiversity and fisheries will be impacted worldwide. Rising temperatures, polar ice melt, and altered precipitation decreases salinity in polar regions, while evaporation and reduced river flow increase salinity towards the equator. These shifts threaten ecosystem stability and fisheries, emphasizing urgency in understanding how organisms adapt to rapid habitat changes. The ability to regulate internal salt and fluid composition amidst the changing external environment will ultimately determine which populations survive. This research explores how the proteins responsible for moving ions in and out of cells facilitate adaptation to shifting habitat salinities. By characterizing specific protein functions and their interactions with one another, the results from this study will help predict population responses to climate-induced salinity shifts. <br/><br/>The estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis offers insights into the evolution of physiological mechanisms during salinity decline. This species has repeatedly colonized freshwater habitats across the Northern Hemisphere, undergoing shifts in ion regulation. Previous studies have identified selection on ion transport genes like Na+/H+ antiporter (NHA) during saline to freshwater transitions, which are likely crucial for ion uptake in dilute environments. In this study, the research fellow will conduct electrophysiological assays in Xenopus oocytes to elucidate substrate specificity and transport modes of saline versus freshwater alleles of NHA and identify causal SNPs responsible for enhancing survival in low salinities. By characterizing NHA paralog functions and interactions with other proteins, this research helps us understand how genes cooperate in ion transport across membrane systems. Furthermore, the research fellow will also investigate allele frequency shifts in response to salinity changes. Laboratory selection lines and wild population sampling across salinity gradients will reveal how natural selection acts on advantageous alleles. By integrating genetics, environment, and phenotype, the project aims to predict population responses to climate-induced salinity shifts via correlating allele dynamics with environmental salinity. This project?s broader impacts extend beyond scientific communities. Engaging the public through educational exhibits and STEM initiatives will foster awareness of climate impacts on marine ecosystems. In summary, this research bridges physiology and evolution to understand how ion transporter alleles drive population responses to climate-driven salinity changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, a tradeoff between the ability to survive starvation and growth rate upon recovery has been documented in a variety of organisms. However, the molecular mechanisms that underly such tradeoffs are hardly understood despite being fundamental to evolutionary adaption. The roundworm C. elegans is a powerful model system that experiences feast or famine in the wild, and these worms display a tradeoff between starvation survival and recovery rate. The research team has developed an innovative approach using DNA sequencing of mixed populations to measure the fitness of competing strains during starvation and recovery. They have also developed imaging tools to precisely measure biochemical properties of these worms during starvation and recovery. These approaches will enable them to identify strains that are most fit in different evolutionary scenarios and to characterize the molecular mechanisms that support fitness. Each member of the team will engage in outreach. Dr. Baugh will host high school students in his lab during the summer as part of Duke?s Cell Biology Academy (CeBA), and he will visit Dr. Towbin to learn innovative pedagogical methods from the Pestallozzi School Camps (PSCs). The PSCs have a similar mission to the CeBA but have been in operation much longer, and cross-participation will foster the exchange of ideas and approaches. This work will address a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology, advance state-of-the-art approaches, and engage students in research.<br/><br/>Evolutionary adaptation to different niches is shaped by phenotypic tradeoffs between life-history traits. Yet the proximal molecular mechanisms of life-history tradeoffs are unknown. The team proposes using the nematode C. elegans to address this knowledge gap and determine the molecular basis of a life-history tradeoff between growth and survival. C. elegans is a powerful animal model to address the molecular mechanisms of trait evolution given its genetic tractability, well-characterized development, short lifecycle, and the availability of hundreds of genetically diverse wild strains with sequenced genomes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the frequency and duration of larval starvation in a niche shapes the evolution of a phenotypic tradeoff between starvation survival and recovery speed, and that molecular rates of autophagy/ribophagy impact the balance between the two. This hypothesis will be tested using experimental evolution, genetics, proteomics, quantitative live imaging, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to identify wild strains with different life-history strategies in response to starvation, evaluate the mechanistic contribution of autophagy and ribophagy rates to natural variation in starvation survival and recovery speed, and to identify genetic variants that influence the tradeoff between survival and recovery and the molecular mechanism affected. Accomplishment of these goals will be impactful by illustrating the importance of a particular tradeoff to evolutionary adaptation to different niches and by linking adaptation to a particular, conserved molecular mechanism. <br/><br/>This collaborative U.S.-Swiss project is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and SNSF funds the partners in Switzerland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these shifts frequently reflect parental concerns for their children?s safety and academic development, recent studies highlight risks associated with a loss of independence and time spent in nature among children. With that in mind, the current study examines children?s exploratory behavior in two societies where opportunities for independence and time spent in nature are cultural priorities in childhood. The research team investigates children?s independent exploration of their environments (e.g., playing in their neighborhood without adult supervision) and the types of environments children explore (e.g., green spaces versus playgrounds). The researchers then examine how these experiences may be associated with children?s spatial cognition, executive function, and well-being. Finally, the researchers survey the children?s parents to establish possible links between parenting behavior and children?s outcomes. It is anticipated that this study can help parents and educators develop a more beneficial balance between (1) protecting children?s safety and structuring their experiences, and (2) promoting autonomy, exploration, and experience in natural environments.<br/><br/>The project assesses children?s exploratory behavior and time spent in different environments through several means including: GPS-tracking via phone, a vegetation index which is combined with GPS data, and a questionnaire concerning children?s experiences in nature.

Infectious disease is a natural phenomenon affecting wildlife populations. However, globalization and rapid environmental changes, such as land use and climate change, can worsen the impact of diseases on wildlife populations and increase the likelihood of spillover to humans. Thus, scientists are faced with the important challenge of understanding and accurately predicting future disease spread in a rapidly changing world. White-nose syndrome has caused severe declines in the number of bats in North America since 2006. Previous studies have found that some bats have a genetic makeup that helps them survive diseases, such as white-nose syndrome, while other bats can have genes that help them adapt to changing climates. To accomplish the project goals, in collaboration with researchers in the United Kingdom, a new computer model will be developed to forecast how bats move across large landscapes along with how key genes contribute to a population?s ability to adapt to threats from both disease and climate. The project will result in the training of a diverse population of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral scholars. In addition, results will be disseminated online, including creating educational outreach activities with a particular focus on underrepresented learners from all ages in rural communities of the USA.<br/><br/>The primary aims of this project are (1) to study three species of North American bats (Myotis lucifugus, Perimyotis subflavus, Eptesicus fuscus) affected by white-nose syndrome to understand how they adapt to changes in climate and disease threats, and (2) to develop a new disease modeling framework that simultaneously incorporates wildlife movement and connectivity with genetic processes over time by adding a flexible compartmental SIR-type model to an established spatially explicit, individual-based, eco-evolutionary model of metapopulation dynamics. The model will be developed from data from eight states stretching from Texas to Wisconsin to New England. Accomplishing these goals together will help generate more precise forecasts regarding the future of disease transmission within wildlife populations and between wildlife and humans. This project will yield not only scientific advances for host-disease systems, but also provide research-informed wildlife health planning maps to help locate important populations that are able to resist and tolerate disease while coping with climate shifts. To help achieve these goals, the project will engage a diverse set of conservation managers, scientists, and researchers across wildlife biology, disease ecology, bioinformatics, computational ecology, population health, and conservation biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow who will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Whole-genome duplication, or polyploidy, is ubiquitous across all flowering plants. Polyploidy may allow plants to persist in times of stress by changing how they interact with their environment. To date, analyses of the impacts of whole genome duplication on the ecology of naturally occurring species have focused on the establishment of new polyploids or the comparison of broad spatial patterns between diploids and polyploids. However, few approaches have attempted to link evolutionary processes with ecological outcomes of whole genome duplication. This project connects phenotypes, environment, and genotypes to understand the consequences of whole genome duplication on species ecology. This work will be of broad interest to those wanting to understand the evolution of a complex continuous trait. This Fellow will facilitate and mentor undergraduate researchers, as well as develop inclusive data science teaching material.<br/><br/>Hybridization is common across the tree of life; therefore, models and frameworks to understand the impact of discordance on trait evolution and species diversification are needed to recognize the rules of life. To identify the ecological implications of whole genome duplication, the nonindependence of climatic niche dynamics for a polyploid and its diploid progenitor(s) must be accounted for by considering their shared and reticulated evolutionary history. The Fellow will develop new phylogenetic comparative methods that incorporate admixture proportions and gene-tree discordance to reconstruct ancestral niche dynamics. This method will then be used to understand the consequences of whole-genome duplication on species ecology by classifying niche dynamics among Galax urceolata (Diapensiaceae) mixed-cytotype populations and across the phylogeny of the order Ericales. This research will leverage previously generated sequence data, paired with a cutting-edge phylogenetic reconstruction approach, to discern the consequences of whole genome duplication on climatic niche dynamics. This project will assemble a large amount of occurrence data, which will be disseminated with their associated phylogenies in a portal hosted by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as part of a new global initiative to connect phylogenies, occurrences, and traits.

Even key subsystems such as clock distribution networks, power delivery networks (PDNs), embedded memory arrays, and analog and mixed-signal systems can become incredibly complex, consisting of hundreds of millions of circuit components. As a consequence, it has become exceedingly difficult to model, simulate, optimize, and verify future ICs at a large scale using existing design methodologies. Recent research in spectral graph sparsification has made it possible to construct much sparser subgraphs while preserving important graph spectral properties such as the first few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. These findings have already led to the development of highly efficient algorithms for solving large sparse matrices, partial differential equations (PDEs), and simulating large-scale circuit systems. However, existing spectral sparsification methods do not efficiently allow for updating the sparsified graph when only incremental changes are made to the original network. The algorithms and methodologies to be developed in this project will be transferred to technology companies, such as semiconductor and electronic design automation (EDA) companies, as well as social and network companies for potential industrial applications. Furthermore, the source code of the developed EDA algorithms will be made available to other researchers through collaborations.

With more than 1,700 known species in rivers and lakes of the Americas, Africa, the Levant, Madagascar and India, cichlid fishes ?one of the largest families of freshwater fishes? can help answer these questions. Although their evolutionary timescale is poorly understood, cichlids boast an extensive fossil record. These poorly-studied fossils could provide a window into the group?s ancient past. This project will study living and fossil cichlids to provide a better picture of when major events in cichlid evolution occurred. The project will also explore how cichlid ecology changed through time by comparing fossils with today?s living species, with the goal of understanding the life history of ancient cichlids. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher, two PhD students, a Master?s student, a technician, and undergraduate students, emphasizing development of transferable skills across STEM and non-STEM fields. The researchers will engage public audiences through university and public museums in the US, and in collaborating museums in Kenya, Brazil and the Dominican Republic.

Despite their importance in biological research, our understanding of cichlid evolution is limited by the lack of an accurate timescale for the group?s evolutionary history. While fossils represent the principal source of temporal data in macroevolutionary studies, a barrier their incorporation is a lack of phenotypic character sets that include both extant and fossil species. Additionally, the surprisingly rich cichlid fossil record, a direct source of temporal information, remains incompletely integrated with the growing body of data available for living species.

This Research Advanced by Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RAISE) award is made in response to Dear Colleague Letter 23-109, as part of the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative. Developing critical floating offshore wind (FOW) technology is imperative to achieve the net-zero carbon goal by 2050. This award is dedicated to advancing the fundamental understanding of the complex individual- and system-level performance of FOW turbines (FOWTs) under operational and extreme conditions, and the comprehensive impacts of large-scale FOW on local and regional climate and ocean environments. Supercomputing capabilities will be integrated with multiscale multidisciplinary modeling to offer new knowledge and computational capabilities to achieve extreme-condition resilient, cost-competitive, and environmentally sustainable offshore wind energy. This research will advance the state of knowledge of the complex performance of individual FOWT and FOW farms exposed to wind-wave-current-wake flows under operational and extreme conditions. On the other hand, the short- and long-term impacts of FOW on local and regional climatic and oceanic environments will be studied systematically and comprehensively. Research findings from this project will enable optimized planning and design of the next-generation FOW facing climate change and extreme marine conditions. Research outcomes will help offshore wind industries reduce the costs associated with design, installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning to minimize the life cycle cost and environmental impacts. Cohesive outreach and educational programs will be developed and integrated with research activities. Specific outreach activities include developing new curricula for relevant STEM courses, engaging graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in research, offering seminars/webinars to stakeholders, coastal community managers, and governmental officials.  <br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to reveal the highly complex multiscale interaction mechanisms among wind-wave-current-wake flows and FOW (individual FOWTs and FOW farms), and the comprehensive FOW impacts on the local and regional climatic and oceanic environments. Novel multi-fidelity hydrodynamics computational modules will be developed and integrated with aerodynamic and aeroelastic modules to simulate the complex multiscale performance of FOW. To meet the huge computational demand, supercomputing capabilities will be leveraged to implement multiscale multi-fidelity multidisciplinary modeling to achieve the research goal. Specific research objectives of this project include: 1) development of a novel large eddy simulation based multi-fidelity model to simulate the complex dynamics of FOWTs; 2) understanding the individual- and system-level performance of FOW under operational and extreme conditions; 3) parameterization of FOW farms (FOWFs) via multiscale modeling; 4) modeling local and regional climatic and oceanic impacts of FOWFs; 5) exascale computing acceleration of high-fidelity models. The research project will answer the following fundamental questions: (i) how do extreme conditions affect the dynamic stability and structural integrity of an individual FOWT, and the system-level performance of FOWFs? (ii) what is the optimized FOWF layout under given wind-wave conditions? (iii) how do FOWFs impact the local and regional climatic and oceanic environments? The research data and developed computational programs will be made open source and shared with the offshore wind and natural hazard research community to educate the next generation of scientists, engineers, leaders, educators, and managers to be prepared for large-scale deployment of offshore wind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dynamics consist of a complicated interplay between the electrons and the nuclei, whose motions are strongly coupled and cannot be treated independently. As the dynamics are governed by the rules of quantum mechanics and involve many coupled particles, they are very difficult to calculate accurately. Furthermore, because they take place on ultrafast time scales [10^(?15) s], and on very short length scales [10^(?10) m], they are very difficult to observe and follow experimentally. In this work, the PI and graduate students carrying out the research will develop experimental approaches to follow the ultrafast dynamics of electrons and nuclei in small molecules following the absorption of light. They will use temporally shaped ultrafast pulses, and advanced charged particle detection techniques, as an ultrafast quantum camera to take ?pictures? of the molecules and produce movies of the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics following the absorption of light. The work will contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists, and ties directly to the 2023 Nobel prize in physics for the development attosecond pulses and the study of electron dynamics. <br/><br/>Octave spanning ultra-broadband laser pulses will be generated using nonlinear optical techniques (self-phase modulation in stretched hollow-core fibers) and shaped using an acousto-optic, modulator-based, frequency-domain pulse shaper. This approach to pulse shaping allows the PI and graduate students carrying out the measurements to produce pulses which are short enough to capture the dynamics as they unfold and to be sensitive to the detailed motion of the electrons. By measuring the energy and direction of electrons and ions produced by the interaction between the molecules and pairs of shaped laser pulses, the PI and graduate students can gain detailed insight into the evolution of the molecule?i.e., how the electrons and nuclei move after the molecule absorbs light. The measurements will be compared in detail with approximate calculations of the dynamics in order to develop better models and a more comprehensive understanding, which will ultimately lead to the development of improved light harvesting and energy conversion technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like humans settling down and building houses on land, bacteria prefer to attach to solid, wet surfaces in nature and build ?houses? known as biofilms (e.g., the slime layer on our teeth or on ship hulls) to survive. Cells living in biofilms ?eat? through the attached surfaces, causing significant structural and functional damage, a process known as biofilm-mediated biofouling. For example, biofilms can cause the metal in power plants to rust by secreting corrosive metabolic products or extracting electrons from the metal as ?food.? This problem costs U.S. power plants about $50 billion annually. As the need for sustainable energy, such as wind power, grows, tackling biofouling becomes crucial. With the award from the LEAPS-MPS program, researchers at the University of New Haven aim to develop new antifouling materials that respond to chitinase, an enzyme commonly produced by microorganisms in Nature. These materials will be studied to determine how they prevent and remove bacterial and algae growth. This research could lead to coatings that are long-lasting and effective in preventing and removing the settlement of microorganisms, especially for use in offshore wind farms and existing power plants. In addition to advancing scientific understanding, this project supports educational and diversity initiatives.

The research focuses on understanding the relationship between the properties of polyolefin surfaces, such as hydrophobicity and texture, and their effectiveness in preventing and removing microbial adhesion. A series of enzyme-responsive antifouling surfaces will be created using particle dispersion techniques. The study will test these surfaces against bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and algae (Chlorella vulgaris) due to their common presence in marine environments. Additionally, the enzyme response kinetics of the polyolefin will be characterized. The outcome of this project will lead to a better understanding of how microorganisms interact with polyolefin surfaces, eventually leading to the systematic design of new antifouling materials. Educational initiatives will include recruiting, retaining, and training a diverse group of students in materials and surface engineering and introducing high school students to biomaterials through a summer camp.

The quantum motion of electrons in these states is correlated. In other words, electrons move not independently of each other but in a cohesive correlated fashion. Understanding the character of these correlations is crucial for characterizing charge transport in quantum electronic devices. Some correlations result in ordering of the electrons and thus change the symmetry of the system; an example is a formation of a charge density wave, in which the electron density in the system develops a wave-like periodic spatial modulation. There are more subtle quantum correlations of the electron liquid, which are called topological. These topological correlations cannot be changed by small changes of the system, and thus distinguish qualitatively different classes of electron systems. Importantly, they are immune to material imperfections and disorder, which are critically important for useful device creation.<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical studies of charge transport and of the physical mechanisms of energy relaxation in correlated electron systems. A particular focus will be placed on studying charge density wave ordering in metals with topological correlations. Another part of research will be devoted to the study of current rectification in conductors the crystal structures of which lack inversion symmetry. Part of the research will be devoted to investigating the influence of energy relaxation on the charge transport in superconducting devices.

The proposed work is organized around three themes:<br/><br/>1) Topological surface and bulk effects in the excitonic insulator phase of Weyl semimetals: At low temperatures, Weyl semimetals (WSM) may become unstable towards the formation of an excitonic insulating phase. The project will investigate the nontrivial band topology of the parent WSM and distinct features in the bulk and surface electron response of this insulating phase, as well as the influence of topology on the bulk properties of the excitonic phase.<br/><br/>2) Theory of nonreciprocal electron transport in the hydrodynamic regime: Nonlinear electron response need not obey the Onsager reciprocity relations. Part of the project is devoted to the study of nonreciprocal transport in the nonlinear hydrodynamic regime, specifically the role of absence of Galilean invariance plays in the physical mechanism behind nonreciprocal hydrodynamic transport.<br/><br/>3) The third research direction is devoted to the study of dissipation mechanisms in superconducting systems. Although charge transport in normal conductors is not significantly affected by energy relaxation, in superconducting systems this is not the case. Part of the project will investigate the influence of energy relaxation on the charge transport in superconducting devices. The recently developed theory of Debye dissipation in superconductors will be extended to hybrid superconductor/semiconductors Josephson arrays.<br/><br/>The research program will be integrated with an education component.

Symmetry is a fundamental aspect of a physical system and has been recognized as a powerful principle in modern theoretical physics. A familiar example is the fact that total electric charge is conserved in everyday physical processes, which can help distinguish between electric conductors, insulators and superconductors. In the realm of quantum mechanics, a system of interacting particles, such as electrons, can form unusual quantum states, in which the constituent particles move collectively in highly intricate patterns, making them resilient to small changes in external conditions. Deciphering these subtle patterns requires ideas from topology, a branch of mathematics that concerns properties of geometric shapes that are unchanged by smooth deformations. A deeper understanding of these quantum states may enable new schemes in harnessing quantum materials and designing quantum devices. <br/><br/>This project will leverage the power of the symmetry principle to advance the knowledge of exotic quantum states. The first thrust will investigate the properties of ""symmetry defects"", which are specific disturbances introduced to the system to reveal its underlying symmetry. Studying how the system reacts to such changes provides new methods to observe and characterize the unique quantum properties of the states involved. In the second thrust, the focus will be on the relationship between physical properties of a quantum crystal and microscopic interactions at the atomic level. This will furnish new perspectives on how crystalline quantum materials can be modeled theoretically. In the last thrust, the project will explore how the quantum behaviors of many interacting particles are affected by their interactions with the environment. Progress on this front will be crucial in exploiting these quantum states as memory for quantum information processing.<br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities through mentoring and training of graduate students and postdocs in theoretical condensed matter research; writing pedagogical review articles and organizing conferences and workshops; outreach to K-12 students and the general public.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports research and education activities with a goal to advance knowledge about quantum phases of matter with global symmetry and many-body topology as guiding principles. Characterizing the emergence of quantum phases from complex interactions between microscopic degrees of freedom represents a key challenge in quantum science. Advances in both condensed matter physics and quantum information science have significantly broaden the scope of quantum phases and provided new settings where universal behaviors of quantum many-body systems can arise.<br/> <br/>The project has three main thrusts:  1) Systematically develop a theory for a new type of non-local observables, called the disorder operators. These operators probe the fluctuations of symmetry charges in a given spatial region of the system, whose scaling behavior contains universal information about the underlying quantum state. The team will study how subleading corrections to the disorder operator depend on microscopic details, and develop field-theoretic techniques to compute them at quantum critical points. 2) Examine new aspects of UV/IR mixing: The interplay between microscopic conditions in lattice systems and macroscopic observables will be examined using the newly developed perspective of topological defects. The project will study how anomaly of a low-energy theory manifests in lattice quantum numbers and, conversely, how anomalous fractonic symmetries constrain low-energy dynamics. 3) Symmetry breaking and topological order in open quantum systems: the research team will investigate a new kind of symmetry breaking in mixed-state quantum phases and its implications on equilibration dynamics, and explore many-body topological order in quantum states under decoherence and beyond.  <br/> <br/>This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities through mentoring and training of graduate students and postdocs in theoretical condensed matter research; writing pedagogical review articles and organizing conferences and workshops; outreach to K-12 students and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Critical for refining our understanding and improving model representations of biogeochemical processes, are quantitative reconstructions of how these variables have responded to different climate states in the past. This research investigates a new proxy for bottom water oxygen concentrations and provides new records of organic carbon flux. Data generated by the project will help constrain the response of these key environmental variables to changes in global climate over the last two glacial-interglacial cycles (150 ka). This proposal broadens participation in the Earth Sciences by supporting an early career Principal Investigator from an undergraduate-only institution, providing research and professional development opportunities for an undergraduate from an underrepresented background, and supporting K-12 students via a University of Colorado at Boulder Museum of Natural History program: Girls At the Museum Enjoying Science (GAMES).<br/><br/>This project quantitatively investigates the variables that control alkenone biomarker preservation in open ocean marine sediments. Previous work has used sedimentary alkenone biomarker concentrations as a proxy for surface ocean export production, neglecting the well-documented influence of changes in bottom water oxygen conditions on biomarker preservation. The investigator will employ a latitudinal transect of existing sediment cores from the equatorial Pacific?s Line Islands region (cruise MGL1208) that have experienced synchronous changes in BWO to evaluate several hypotheses, including: 1) alkenone biomarkers experience quantifiable preservation changes driven by variations in sedimentary bottom water concentrations, and 2) time series of preserved biomarker fluxes, measured at sites with a range of export carbon fluxes and conditions of sedimentary preservation, can be used to quantitatively constrain the multivariate equation that relates alkenone preservation, bottom water oxygen, surface ocean carbon export, and oxygen exposure time. To evaluate these hypotheses the investigator will use cores from five sites to constrain A) alkenone biomarker flux (C37:total), B) sedimentation rate (14C and ?18O-derived age models), C) oxygen exposure time (multisensor track data), and D) organic carbon fluxes (230Th-normalized Baxs fluxes). The investigator will also generate records of E) sedimentary redox state (aU), and F) alkenone-based sea surface temperatures (UK?37). New data, in combination with published results, will refine estimates of oxygen and respired carbon storage during the Last Glacial Maximum (~20 ka), and provide the first estimates for the penultimate glacial period (~140 ka). Results will also improve our understanding of C37:total-based paleoproductivity estimates by quantifying the extent to which reconstructions may be altered by changes in bottom water oxygen. These findings will permit better reconstructions of photic zone carbon export ? a key determinant of carbon cycle changes, and a more quantitative understanding of variations in bottom water oxygen and their global drivers.

This emerging area leads to novel statistical questions about the limits and possibilities of statistical learning where the inputs and outputs are both functions.

One of the most exciting directions in materials science research is band structure engineering, which allows for tailoring device functionalities for technological applications. The goal of this project is to engineer the band structure of a few-layer PdSe2 that has a unique pentagonal structure with an underlying square lattice; it boasts high mobility, sizeable band gap, suitability for wafer-scale synthesis, and large nonlinear optoelectronic responses. Its band structure will be modified by controlling the number of layers, by applying uniaxial strain, and by creating a moir superlattice by overlaying two PdSe2 monolayers at a small angle with respect to each other. By examining the consequent modifications in material properties, the project will lead to key advances in the rational design of novel functionalities, such as directional transport of charges and directional optical responses for novel electronic and optoelectronic applications. This research project is integrated with a comprehensive education plan by involving undergraduate students from OSU and a local community college in research. The principal investigator will continue her successful mentoring of members from under-represented groups, including women and minorities, and participate in outreach activities, serving as a role model to next generation of scientists who are traditionally under-represented in STEM disciplines. This project will support 1-2 graduate students, who will be trained in nanofabrication, quantum transport, cryogenics, Raman and optical characterization, as well as ?soft? skills such as written and oral communications, problem-solving, critical thinking, forming collaborations, and working in a team. These hard and soft skills are highly-sought after in careers paths in industry, government, and academia. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>PdSe2 has an underlying square lattice, which sets it apart from the mainstays of 2D materials research that focuses on materials with hexagonal symmetry. This project aims at engineering the band structure of PdSe2, via selective symmetry breaking, using such knobs as layer, strain, and moir. Specifically, the goals include optimization of materials properties for atomically thin PdSe2 field effect transistors, exploiting the even-odd layer effect of spin-orbit coupling in few-layer PdSe2, creating large band anisotropy via strain engineering for nonlinear anisotropic photodetectors such as polarization sensors, and achieving isotropic and anisotropic band flattening in moir PdSe2 superlattices. In addition to advancing electronic materials via band structure engineering, successful implementation of the project will also provide a quantum simulator for solutions of the Hubbard model in a square lattice that are relevant to long-standing mysteries such as high-Tc cuprates, while lending insight into some of the ?grand challenge? questions in the field, such as the general design principles of flat bands in moir materials and the emergence of correlated phases arising from the interplay of topology, symmetry, and interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Rapid changes around the globe are causing wildlife species to alter their geographic ranges, leading to intensified interactions between humans and wildlife. Human-wildlife interactions are complex. They have a range of outcomes and result from various societal and ecological conditions. To date, research on human-wildlife interactions is limited. Studies tend to focus on relatively small study areas, popular species, or one type of human-wildlife relationship. As a result, it is difficult to understand human-wildlife interactions in broad, predictive, or theoretical ways. The fellow?s research will enhance understanding of human-wildlife interactions by developing a new modeling framework and global database for predicting human-wildlife interactions and discovering how they are influenced under global change. The project will inform policy and decision-making at local to global levels. It will also broaden participation for underrepresented groups in biology through the fellow?s training in data science and artificial intelligence, teaching and mentoring of underrepresented undergraduate students, and engagement with underserved, faith-based communities in science communication. The postdoctoral training experience will help the fellow advance towards a professorship.<br/><br/>This project will focus on birds around the world, integrating biological, ecological, sociological, economic, and anthropological information with data science and artificial intelligence methods. The fellow will conduct a systematic review and mine through published article text to find case studies matching eight proposed archetypes of human-wildlife interaction outcomes. The fellow will then supplement information from these articles with additional species trait, environmental, cultural, conservation, and socioeconomic data to create an open-access human-wildlife interaction database. The fellow will develop Bayesian networks to predict human-wildlife archetypes by species, traits, scale, location, and socioeconomic or sociocultural conditions in current and future years. Finally, the fellow will determine the most explanatory drivers for predicting human-wildlife interaction outcomes based on sensitivity analysis. Throughout the project, the fellow will mentor and train underrepresented undergraduate students in research. The fellow will invite these students to present posters at scientific conferences. The fellow will also partner with non-profit organizations to speak at Christian churches and outreach events to help foster trust among faith-based communities, reduce tensions around human-wildlife conflict, and increase the recruitment of underrepresented students in the sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several developmental disorders are also associated with delays in the onset of walking ? yet, the process of how infants learn to walk is not well understood because it is challenging to measure these behaviors precisely outside of constrained (in space and time) laboratory settings. To address this challenge, this award supports the development of an innovative wearable sensing system that automatically detects a range of infant behaviors for long durations in the home environment. Data gathered using this system enables researchers to better understand how infants learn to walk and has the potential to provide insight into how this process is delayed or affected in developmental disorders.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to examine the role of pre-walking strategies in the development of walking. Specifically, researchers use an innovative wearable sensing system that allows automatic identification and measurement of a range of activities including standing, cruising, falls, independent walking, and spatial location of an infant. Obtaining precise measurements of these behaviors in laboratory settings is constrained by limited space and time. The novel approach enabled through the use of this new technology allows high-resolution scalable measurements in a home setting over extended periods of time. These precise spatiotemporal behavioral data are then analyzed with state-of-the-art machine learning mechanisms for characterizing behaviors that precede the onset of walking. The outcomes of this research have the potential to transform investigator ability to measure motor behaviors outside the laboratory settings, and thereby facilitate acquisition of more precise spatiotemporal data that can advance theoretical understanding of motor exploration during development of walking in infancy. Additionally, the novel methods developed and refined during this project have the potential to provide new insights into the multifaceted dynamics of other areas of early human development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the rapid growth of network research has led to variation and inconsistency in reporting, which severely limits the understanding of network data and results.  These guidelines enable network researchers to describe their network data clearly, consistently, and transparently and the project thereby enhances the value of existing network research in several ways. First, the guidelines create enhanced infrastructure for research and education by providing researchers, students, and journal peer reviewers with guidance on what to include when describing network data, or what to look for when reviewing research about network data. Second, the project encourages the full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM by recruiting a demographically diverse working group to coordinate the development of guidelines and by disseminating guideline materials at no cost via publicly available repositories. Finally, the guidelines lead to increased public scientific literacy by providing a clear and concise way to describe network data, which helps the public better understand what network data are when they are described in media reports.<br/><br/>Data-intensive methods such as meta-analysis have wide adoption of reporting protocols (e.g., PRISMA framework), but no similar guidance exists for research on networks. This project builds on the success of such widely adopted protocols, using the same collaborative guideline development process, to develop a similar set of guidelines for networks.  Specifically, the process begins with recruitment of a working group, who survey the multi-disciplinary network research community. Preliminary guidelines are derived from the survey results at an initial conference, and are refined at a second conference using feedback from listening sessions. The final guidelines will be shared with network professional associations and network journals for their formal endorsement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Laboratory work will center on the OH oxidation of multifunctional, water-soluble species, with careful control of reaction conditions (chemical environment, RO2 co-reactants) and the use of online mass spectrometry to measure reaction products in real time. Studies will be carried out first in the dilute bulk aqueous phase, then in the concentrated (high ionic strength, low pH) bulk aqueous phase, and finally in deliquesced particles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This can result in the contamination of surface waters, wastewaters, and agricultural lands and to chronic low-level exposure of animals from manufacturing and disposal. In addition, nanoparticles can move up the food chain in environmental systems. Silver nanoparticles easily bypass the linings of the gut and lungs and move into organs, including the brain where they stay for many months or more. This means that frequent exposure may lead to accumulation of low levels of nanosilver in the brain. Therefore, it is important to understand how brain function is altered by resident silver nanoparticles at levels lower than those that kill cells. This project will provide insight into how silver nanoparticles interact with the complex biological mechanisms involved in brain cell development and function. Using cells in culture and a simple animal model, the research team will investigate nanosilver interactions with specific proteins to provide a deeper perspective on the consequences that resident silver nanoparticles have on brain cell function. This work will help determine the impacts that chronic nanosilver exposures might have on mechanisms such as learning and neurodegeneration. The activities will be carried out by an undergraduate workforce at a primarily undergraduate institution in Appalachia that has a high proportion of first-generation students. This project will provide students with experience and training for success in postgraduate programs and science careers. <br/><br/>In contrast to tissues like liver, every part of the brain has unique function, and may not be able to compensate for local damage resulting from bioaccumulated silver nanoparticles. Nanosilver exposure disrupts cytoskeletal organization, inhibits neurite dynamics, and alters intracellular signaling pathways in cultured neural cells. Moreover, rats exposed to oral silver nanoparticles exhibited dysregulation of neurogenesis and accumulation of pTau, a hallmark of neurodegeneration. However, the cellular mechanisms targeted by silver nanoparticles to induce these effects are unknown. The overarching objective of this research is to understand the molecular basis of the interaction of silver nanoparticles with cytoskeletal control mechanisms to induce morphological and functional deficits in neural cells. Several lines of evidence identified collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) and its controller glycogen synthase kinase 3? (GSK3?) as candidate targets. First, this project will determine if nanosilver exposure leads to disruption of localization or activation of these key cytoskeletal regulators in cultured neural cells. Then, strains of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans will be used to measure how exposure to nanosilver during development alters morphological development. Strains expressing fluorescent fusion proteins will be used to assess the function of the highly conserved worm homologue of CRMP-2 (UNC-33) and pre-and post-synaptic structural changes in neurons of worms exposed to nanosilver during development. This is important because cytoskeletal control of morphological development is key to synaptic function. Behavioral assays and optogenetics will quantify neural function of whole worms and individual neurons after development upon exposure to silver nanoparticles. Finally, the worm model system will be used to further examine the formation of pTau aggregates in response to silver nanoparticle exposure. This work will offer mechanistic substrates for understanding nanosilver-induced alterations in neural plasticity and development. The project design is optimized for undergraduate researchers with modular and complementary experiments that allow each student to pursue their own project while contributing to the overall goals of the team. The PI will also develop a new Biology Capstone course that will help students develop skills in interpreting scientific data and foster critical assessment of primary science and its coverage in the mainstream media. High school students will participate in these class meetings to promote scientific research as a career path and to recruit students to undergraduate science programs.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Nanoscale Interactions Program (NI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These communities are part of the biology of normal, healthy organisms, yet certain changes in these communities can cause them to lose beneficial functions or even to become harmful to their hosts. This project will investigate how microbiome communities can resist change and what factors can lead to alternate states in the microbiomes of hosts. Microbiomes associated with humans and other large organisms can be difficult to study experimentally, but fortunately, simple hosts like the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans can be used to address these questions more easily. Although microbiomes in this small host consist of different bacterial taxa than are found in mammals, their microbiome communities have a similar ecology and can be used to learn general rules for how microbiomes respond to changing conditions. The project includes an educational component to help students build the quantitative skills necessary to succeed in modern science, using biologically motivated, math- and coding-focused course-based research experiences (CUREs). The educational activities developed as part of this project will be designed to build interdisciplinary skills, self-efficacy, and a strong understanding of research ethics among the next generation of working scientists.<br/><br/>This study aims to better define stability and properties of alternate states of the microbiome, using wild-type C. elegans and mutants previously shown to have altered microbiome structure and/or stability. First, the range of ""normal"" and the properties of ?stability? for a microbiome will be defined. Then, how disturbances such as antibiotic treatment interact with and alter community stability will be determined to better understand how perturbation-induced dysbiosis can be prevented or remediated. How host control contributes to microbiome stability and affects the landscape of available states will also be determined. Reaching this understanding will require identifying models that capture the salient features of stability in these noisy and dynamic systems. The use of a tractable model host will allow collection of high-quality data in large well-controlled experiments, suitable for testing alternate models of microbiome community ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen, a clean alternative to fossil fuels and one of the only zero-emission solutions to high-capacity and long-term energy storage, can provide a viable solution to the deep decarbonization of energy systems and thus bring profound impacts on climate change mitigation. Taking advantage of the most abundant and widely accessible renewable energy on Earth, splitting water using natural sunlight could not only meet potential hydrogen demand but also enable a fully sustainable approach without carbon emissions, i.e., green hydrogen production. Despite the great promise, existing solar-powered green hydrogen technologies suffer from (1) limited energy conversion efficiency (< 10% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency) and (2) substantial clean water consumption (> 9 liters of water per kilogram of hydrogen), which has posed significant challenges to making real-world impacts. The overarching goal of this project is to design, develop, and optimize a sustainable electrolytic system with natural sunlight and seawater as the sole inputs, which is expected to achieve a promising solar-to-hydrogen efficiency with additional clean water as the byproduct. The research will be integrated into STEM education and workforce development by equipping graduate students with interdisciplinary expertise through hands-on research projects, incorporating cutting-edge topics of clean energy technologies into undergraduate and graduate courses, and hosting high-school and undergraduate students through workshops and summer research programs. Furthermore, the project aims to increase public awareness of clean energy technologies by displaying the prototype and performing field demonstrations in local communities.<br/><br/>The research aims to develop a high-efficiency, low-cost, and off-grid solar-powered seawater electrolysis strategy for green hydrogen production combining interdisciplinary expertise in heat and mass transfer, electrochemistry, and material science. Realization of the design relies on the full-spectrum utilization of solar energy, which requires a mechanistic understanding of (1) the solar-electricity-water conversion to realize the optimal photovoltaic efficiency and solar evaporation rate, (2) the water-hydrogen conversion to approach the electrochemical kinetic limits of hydrogen evolution and the maximum clean water production, and (3) the coupling of key components toward the theoretical limits of solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. The research will not only advance the fundamental understanding of energy conversion and transport associated with green hydrogen, but also demonstrate a fully sustainable pathway toward unprecedented solar-to-hydrogen efficiency and clean water production with natural sunlight and seawater as the sole inputs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In surface water systems such as rivers, PPCPs degrade in the water columns and  sediments. However, their degradation byproducts can persist for long periods in aquatic systems with toxicities that are comparable or worse than those of the original compounds. Even at trace concentrations, PPCPs and their degradation products in river water columns and sediments pose a clear and increasing risk with impacts ranging from the spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens to the decline of fish populations. This ERI project will carry out foundational research to advance the development, validation, and implementation of next-generation risk assessment models that account for the spatial variability of contaminant concentrations in rivers with the goal of accurately quantifying PPCP exposure and risk in locations with high ecological sensitivity and/or impact on human health. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator proposes to combine laboratory experiments, field studies, and contaminant transport modeling to identify the physical and biogeochemical properties of river sediments that control the degradation of both PPCPs and their transformation byproducts using the Boise River (Lander Street Water Renewal Facility) as a field site. The successful completion of this project will benefit society by providing an improved fundamental understanding of how PPCP exposure is linked to measurable properties of rivers and their sediments. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student at Boise State University. <br/><br/>Recent advances and improvements in environmental analysis tools and protocols have established that pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are ubiquitous in surface water systems (e.g., rivers) with concentrations exceeding toxicity thresholds for many  aquatic species. The growing number of detected PPCPs in rivers highlights the need for risk assessments that accurately quantify exposure. This ERI project will focus on the development and validation of an integrated experimental and reactive transport modeling framework to identify the key processes controlling the fate, biogeochemical reactivity, degradation, and transformations of PCCPs and their by-products in river sediments using the Boise River (Lander Street Water Renewal Facility) as a field site. The specific objectives of the research are to 1) characterize the transport and transformations of 10 model PCCPs and their degradation byproducts in a laboratory chamber designed to simulate the behavior of river sediments, (2) probe and unravel the mechanisms of attenuation of PPCPs in river sediments, and (3) use reactive transport modeling to identify the physical and biogeochemical processes that control the formation and transformations of PCCP degradation byproducts in river sediments. To implement the education and outreach activities of the project, the Principal Investigator plans to leverage existing programs at Boise State University to partner with the Intermountain Bird Observatory to expand their educational program for public and K-12 participants at the Diane Moore Nature Center, which encompasses a recently restored side channel of the Boise River. The proposed new educational activities will include demonstrations of surface water-groundwater interactions and contaminant transport in groundwater, using both a tabletop groundwater simulator and dye visualization experiments in the restored channel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Namely, this collaborative team is focused on a new approach to the detection of ?forever chemicals,? such as  per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Researchers will first identify conditions under which the targeted PFAS molecules demonstrably influence the growth of metal nanoparticles in water. Measured physical and chemical properties of these particles will then be fed to sophisticated machine learning methods to derive a unique signature associated with each contaminant. The technique is designed to improve environmental monitoring technologies, and, if successful, to potential contribute to fundamental understanding of how these nanoparticles behave.  The work will provide interdisciplinary researach opportunities for students from groups underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).<br/><br/>Under this award, the U. Alabama researchers will focus on creating pattern-based chemosensors from metal nanoparticles to qualitatively detect specific anionic contaminants in water. The project will combine chemical synthesis, electron microscopy, and electrochemical measurements with machine-learning data analysis methods. It builds on existing expertise in synthesizing metal nanoparticles encapsulated in cationic hyperbranched polymers (Street) and simple yet powerful machine-learning algorithms to achieve chemical selectivity (Bonizzoni). Poly(ethylene)imine (PEI), a commercially available water-soluble cationic polyelectrolyte, supports the growth of encapsulated metal nanoparticles during chemical reduction of the polymer-coordinated metal ion precursors. The cationic polymer also attracts anionic contaminants to the immediate environment of the growing nanoparticles. Particle morphology is therefore expected to be influenced by the presence of target contaminants. The electrochemical signals associated with nanoparticle oxidation could then provide a unique signature for each PFAS contaminant. This information could be used to train a machine-learning classification algorithm to identify anionic contaminants in aqueous solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These tools are essential to understand fundamental concepts for energy storage and conversion, biosensing, biochemical reactions, aerosol chemistry, and have ramifications to understanding the origins of life. Small droplets, such as those found in clouds, sea spray, and even tiny vesicles within cells, permeate nature. For centuries, chemists have assumed that chemistry occurring in large volumes like that of a coffee cup can be extrapolated to chemistry occurring within vesicles inside cells. The new measurement methods developed in this project will allow insight into curious chemistry and reaction acceleration in microdroplets. A particular emphasis will be placed on understanding the importance of the nature of the interface, be it microdroplets suspended in an immiscible liquid (emulsions) or microdroplets in gas (aerosols). Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be introduced to measurement techniques through a historical perspective by learning how to build their own instruments to corroborate (or refute) centuries-old observations. The instruments developed will be donated to local schools, and resources will be made available to include frontier measurement science in middle and high school curricula. <br/><br/>Most studies of curious chemistry and reaction acceleration in microdroplets have dealt with microdroplets surrounded by gas. Electrochemistry is rather difficult to perform in gas, and this project develops new measurement methods to probe chemistry within single liquid droplets, where the microdroplet|gas interface is dominant. The project uses stochastic electrochemistry to probe reactions in single, sub-femtoliter droplets, and the electrochemical signal reports on the rate of the reactions occurring within the droplets. Stochastic electrochemistry offers high temporal resolution to ensure microdroplets can be probed on a droplet-by-droplet basis. Given that coulometry can be used to size individual droplets, this project offers a direct pathway to studying how reaction rates change as a function of droplet size with various interfaces and chemical reactions of interest. The project will enable detailed insight into the role the microdroplet interface plays in reaction acceleration, the spontaneous generation of reactive species, and the mineralization of hard materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Warm temperatures can reduce survival, and for marine fishes such effects may be particularly acute during the larval phase. Given recent temperature trends, it is critical that we understand how population sizes are likely to change in response to warming over the coming decades. However, to do so requires that evolutionary processes be taken into account. This project uses a novel set of experiments and field studies on a coastal fish species to investigate mechanisms that may either constrain or accelerate evolution in a warming, but thermally variable ocean. A major goal is quantifying genetic variation in responses to temperature. For example, populations may contain some genotypes that are cool-water specialists and others that are warm-water specialists. Understanding such variation is critical to projecting responses to ocean warming. Another focus is determining whether the species-wide genetic variation is promoted by adaptation to local temperature conditions (e.g., along a North-South gradient). Based on the estimates of genetic and non-genetic inheritance, the project tests whether evolutionary changes can be quick enough to affect the dynamics of populations over timeframes of 10-100 years. This project strengthens research and teaching opportunities at a primarily undergraduate institution that is one of the most culturally diverse universities in the nation. The team is providing research training for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups, conducting a before-and-after assessment to evaluate the effects that a recent change in fishery regulations have had on populations of California Grunion, and sharing the results of the research through exhibits at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and public outreach activities. <br/><br/>Ocean temperatures are warming at an alarming rate, and temperature affects the demographic rates of most species. However, responses to temperature are nuanced. Growth and survival are often maximal at intermediate temperatures, and individuals vary in their responses to temperature. Moreover, the effects of any long-term increase in temperature on populations need to be considered in the context of temperature fluctuations that occur at various temporal scales (e.g., annual, seasonal, weekly, etc.). This project tests the hypothesis that genetic variation in thermal specialization can both constrain evolutionary responses in the short term (via interaction with temperature fluctuations) and provide essential variation required for long-term evolutionary gain. Detailed breeding experiments to measure genetic variation are being combined with experimental manipulations of seawater temperature to measure thermal reaction norms. The project is also testing for local adaptation by making repeated collections of fish from northern and southern populations and rearing their offspring in a common laboratory environment and across a range of temperatures and 1) evaluating how the genetic covariance underlying thermal reaction norms for relative fitness can either constrain or accelerate evolution in light of observed trajectories of regional water temperatures; 2) comparing the relative magnitudes of genetic vs. non-genetic inheritance of variation in thermal reaction norms; and 3) developing an eco-evolutionary modeling framework tailored to studying the effects of ocean warming that is used for evaluating the effectiveness of fishery management strategies in a warming ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RiPPs are macrocyclic peptide architectures that have been recognized as important in drug discovery, particularly due to their ability to target relatively featureless flat surfaces on target proteins that were once considered ?undruggable?. Despite their promise, their unique architectures continue to pose significant synthetic challenges and currently no general strategies to RiPPs exist, limiting their further development. The major goal of this research is to develop a universal catalytic platform to enable the synthesis of any RiPP natural product in this class. Key to this strategy is the development of modular building blocks that will made broadly available, and the methods will be compatible with established automated peptide synthesizers to enable access to these compounds by non-specialists. The theme of automated synthesis is closely associated with the emerging concept of ?self-driving labs?, which integrate modern robotics and machine learning technologies and have the potential to revolutionize the way in which new medicines are discovered. An Interdisciplinary Future Scientists Lunch Series will aim to educate both graduate and undergraduate students on the importance of integrating automation, high-throughput experimentation, ?big-data?, and machine learning to advance discovery in the chemical sciences.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a general synthetic platform to ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) through the advancement of novel cross electrophile coupling reactions. Key to this approach is the development of novel stereoselective C(sp2)?C(sp3) coupling reactions for unactivated secondary alkyl halides, which will forge the predominant class of crosslinks found in these RiPP natural products. Methods to access the required beta-bromo amino acids will also be developed, primarily through biocatalysis. The coupling partners developed will be made broadly available and the methods are targeted for applicability to solid phase peptide synthesis. Total syntheses of representative natural products, streptide, ryptide, and the tryglysins will be developed. These syntheses will result in stereochemical determinations for two of the three natural products and provide a road map for others to synthesize emerging members of this natural product family. These RiPP natural products are often linked to quorum sensing pathways, and in many cases exhibit antimicrobial activity, highlighting them as important targets as we face the growing threat of antibiotic resistant pathogens. This research will advance our ability to access both the natural products, and functionalized analogues for SAR and chemical biology studies, facilitating both basic and translational research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Still, the land and the stream are often studied in isolation, which can lead to fundamental misunderstandings of how changes in one system impact one or both systems. Globally, salinization is a current major change in both terrestrial soil and freshwater systems. Salinization can change water quality and drinking water suitability, carbon storage and quality, and plant productivity. Freshwater salinization often begins through terrestrial salinization from human activities like urbanization, agricultural practices, and road salting. Yet, predicting how salinization alters carbon inputs across riparian-stream boundaries is not yet possible. This research will quantify how salinization, which can both subsidize and stress organisms, alters carbon processing across terrestrial-aquatic boundaries, through field work and experiments. The project will also examine the relationship between terrestrial and aquatic salinity in part from the collaborations of crowd-sourced k-12 teacher data. This project will also support three female PIs, mentorship of three graduate and four undergraduate students, support three REU students, and incorporate public participation and awareness through citizen science.<br/><br/>This research will identify fundamental principles about how aquatic and terrestrial systems will respond to increased salinization. This project will quantify how sodium chloride inputs to riparian zones and streams interact to alter decomposition, secondary production, gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem production in both terrestrial riparian and aquatic stream ecosystems using experimentally paired riparian-stream mesocosms and a field decomposition study across a sodium gradient. The responses are expected to follow a subsidy-stress model. Sodium chloride (NaCl) should act as a subsidy and increase these processes up to some optimal threshold because Na is a biologically essential nutrient. After which, these processes should decrease as Na becomes a stressor at sub-lethal levels and a toxicant at higher levels. The primary objectives are to 1) measure and quantify field terrestrial-stream relationships using a decomposition study that concurrently measures soil and stream chemistry across a large salinization gradient (electrical conductance ranging from 30-1200 micro Siemens per centimeter), 2) experimentally determine how soil salinization impacts terrestrial-aquatic carbon exchange across a gradient of salinization in novel paired terrestrial riparian-stream mesocosms, and 3) quantify the field-mesocosm relationship to determine the congruence of experimental mesocosm- and field-measured decomposition rates across a salinity gradient. Using a combined terrestrial-aquatic approach is essential to understanding, predicting, and ultimately mitigating negative salinization impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem structure and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geometric machine learning provides an effective approach for analyzing unstructured data and has become indispensable for computer graphics and vision, bioinformatics, social network analysis, protein folding, and many other areas. Partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in mathematical modeling, and their numerical solution enables the simulation of real-world phenomena in engineering design, medical analysis, and material sciences, to name a few. A unified study of both fields exposes many potential synergies, which the project will seize to improve the efficiency of algorithms in both areas. The first goal is to improve the scalability of geometric machine learning approaches based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to accommodate growing datasets with millions of nodes using insights and ideas from numerical PDEs. The second goal is to accelerate numerical PDE simulations by enhancing numerical solvers on unstructured meshes with GNN components. Through these improvements in computational efficiency, the project will enable more accurate data analysis and PDE simulations for high-impact applications across the sciences, engineering, and industry. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be integrated into this research as part of their professional training. <br/><br/>This project will develop computational algorithms that improve the efficiency and scalability of GNNs and create new approaches for GNNs for solving nonlinear PDEs on unstructured meshes. To improve the scalability of GNNs to graphs with millions of nodes, the research team will develop spatial smoothing operators, coarsening operators, and multilevel training schemes. To accelerate PDE simulations on unstructured meshes, the team will train GNNs to produce effective prolongation, restriction, and coarse mesh operators in multigrid methods and preconditioners in Krylov methods. The team will demonstrate that the resulting hybrid schemes accelerate computations and are provably convergent. To show the broad applicability of the schemes, the team will consider challenging PDE problems in computational fluid dynamics and test the scalable GNNs on established geometric learning benchmark tasks such as shape and node classification.

Chemists have made great strides in molecular photovoltaics using so called dye-sensitized solar cells, and in photoredox catalysis for more efficient production of medicines. Currently, both technologies rely heavily on rare precious metals such as Ru and Ir. Due to rarity and expense of these metals, the development of molecules with similar photon-capturing capability but based on earth abundant metals such as Fe and Co is highly desirable. However, most compounds based on earth abundant metals lose the captured solar energy (so called excited state) before converting it into electricity or using it to promote a reaction. Professor Ren and his team will extend the lifetimes of excited states by using a new family of macrocycles to support Fe and Co containing molecules, and hence improve the efficiency of solar energy utilization. Professor Ren and his team will work with the Purdue College of Science K-12 Outreach team, especially in introducing new teaching modules that reflect the heightened interest in sustainable chemistry. The PI and his coworkers will also play a proactive role in the Superheroes of Science, a program of Purdue College of Science K-12 Outreach, which develops a variety of science content for educators, including virtual labs for high school students.<br/><br/>Organometallic chemistry of metal tetra-aza macrocycle complexes is a vibrant and evolving field.

Cyclobutadiene is an exceptionally reactive species that has seen significant applications in the construction of small molecules and materials. Despite this, chemists have continued to use the same technologies for its production that were developed over 50 years ago. These outdated processes involve numerous chemical reactions, hazardous heavy metals, and costly starting materials. This funding will allow the Burns research group to develop new reagents that can be efficiently produced in multigram quantities without the use of toxic heavy metal reagents. These reagents are designed to controllably release cyclobutadiene under environmentally benign conditions and allow for the synthesis of cyclobutadienes that have not been previously explored. This work is expected to have significant impacts in the field of organic synthesis and the broader chemical sciences as it will not only advance our understanding of fundamental chemical processes involved in making and using the new reagents but also pave the way for practical applications towards naturally occurring molecules, the synthesis of biologically active compounds, the creation of novel materials, and the production of energy-dense assemblies. Broader impacts of this work include cultivating an interdisciplinary training environment as well as outreach efforts aimed at attracting younger students to a future in STEM. This funding will also help support underrepresented students who have not yet had access to R1 university resources by providing them with research opportunities at Stanford.<br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to establish diazabicyclohexene dicarbamates as robust, metal-free precursors to reactive cyclobutadiene species. These novel reagents can be synthesized reliably and on large scale from simple, inexpensive starting materials. Upon hydrolysis and treatment with a mild oxidant, they can be triggered to extrude carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas, releasing reactive cyclobutadienes. Initial studies in the Burns group have successfully validated this approach, demonstrating its facile ability to produce and engage cyclobutadiene with electron-deficient dienophiles in Diels?Alder cycloadditions under an ambient atmosphere and in the presence of water ? conditions that were not possible with previous metal-based cyclobutadiene reagents. As opposed to heavy metal waste produced with earlier methods, this reaction produces only innocuous organic byproducts. Future research efforts will be aimed at synthesizing a broader library of substituted cyclobutadiene precursors bearing previously inaccessible substitution patterns including halogen atoms and heteroatom functionalities. Complementary computational studies will guide the rational design of these reagents and provide insights into the associated reaction mechanisms and origins of selectivity. Synthetic applications that will be pursued include the total synthesis of (poly)cyclobutane-containing natural products, the synthesis of strained hydrocarbon targets, and the assembly of mechanochemically responsive ladder polymers. This research program has the potential to establish a new paradigm for cyclobutadiene generation and promises to expand the pool of molecular structures and materials that are synthetically accessible via cyclobutadiene cycloaddition pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oligosaccharides are comprised of several monosaccharide, or simple sugar, building blocks and possess structural complexities unique from the other biological polymers/oligomers (e.g., protein, DNA, RNA). In particular, the selective construction and linkage of these monosaccharide units remains a significant challenge, creating the need for lengthy synthetic sequences and often limiting access to potentially valuable unnatural derivatives. These synthetic challenges have made it more difficult to study the role of oligosaccharides in biology and medicine. The O?Doherty group will explore novel synthetic methods designed to mimic the reactivity of natural enzymatic systems to prepare both the individual sugar building blocks as well as selectively assemble them into biologically relevant oligomers. The students who will be conducting this research are diverse in terms of training (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral) and cultural backgrounds with significant participation of women and under-represented students from the US and around the world. A major focus of the student?s research efforts is on overall synthetic efficiency, which both benefits the environment (green chemistry) as well as better enables future biological and medicinal chemistry studies. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop new synthetic methods for the efficient asymmetric syntheses of oligosaccharide motifs with novel regio-chemical and stereo-chemical connectivity. The oligosaccharide structures that are targeted are based upon naturally occurring motifs, however, the approach will enable access to unnatural oligosaccharide variants with novel stereochemistry and substitution. Access to these unnatural motifs will enable future biological and medicinal chemistry studies that are currently viewed as impractical.  Central to this effort will be the study of a recently discovered bimetallic B/Pd-catalyzed glycosylation reaction. This B/Pd-catalyzed glycosylation can be viewed as an abiotic mimic of glycosyltransferases with the boron portion being the site of nucleophilic catalysis and the Pd-site being the site of electrophilic catalysis, with an ionic bond replacing the peptide backbone that holds the two sites together. The B/Pd-glycosylation is the key coupling reaction that enables the synthetically efficient de novo asymmetric synthesis of oligosaccharides, where the efficiency can be seen in the low number of synthetic transformations and protecting groups used. In the end, this synthetic chemistry project aims to fundamentally change the way oligosaccharides are synthesized which will have the downstream effect of enabling the application of carbohydrate chemistry to real-world problems in science and medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mercury is a problem because it is toxic to humans and other animals. Once in the environment, mercury may find its way into soils, where it can be released or stored for a long time. How much mercury gets into the soil and how much stays there depends on things like what kind of landcover is present (for example, forests, croplands, or deserts), but the exact effect of landcover is not very well known for most landcover types. For this reason, it is important to better understand how soils of different landcover types take-up mercury. This study will test the mercury signature of soils from 100 sites across the United States, focusing on different landcover types. This information will help show how mercury came to be in these soils and how much mercury is moving through them. Knowing how mercury moves through soils will help control mercury pollution in the United States and clarify the long-term impacts of mercury release.<br/><br/>Mercury is introduced to soils through several input pathways and may be sequestered there or released to the atmosphere and downstream aquatic ecosystems. The transport and fate of mercury in soils, therefore, depends on the relative contribution of various input pathways and the degree to which soil mercury is processed through the soil profile. Due to the strong association of mercury with organic matter, efforts to elucidate soil Hg cycling have largely focused on regions of high local emissions (i.e., developed systems) or areas with more abundant precipitation and elevated levels of organic carbon (i.e., forests, wetlands). In contrast, other land cover types (e.g., shrublands, grasslands, barren) have received relatively little attention with regards to soil mercury. This bias has important implications, as much of our understanding of soil Hg and its biogeochemical cycle is based on observations from land cover types which together constitute less than 40% of the conterminous United States. This project proposes sampling archived soils representative of the landcover distribution of the United States from a national-scale soil survey for analysis of mercury stable isotopes. This study aims to quantify 1) the relative importance of different mercury input pathways to soils by land cover type; and 2) the difference between isotopic signature of surface and subsoils across land cover types. Together, these findings will clarify the relative importance of deposition and mineralogical processes on mercury cycling through soils. The results from the isotopic analysis will be compared to simulations from biogeochemical mercury models to determine how well non-forest soil processes are currently represented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These particles, made under certain fire conditions, can get into the air we breathe, the soil, and the water, causing serious health and environmental problems. This project aims to study how different wildfire conditions and soil types affect the creation and properties of these toxic particles. We are especially interested in very small particles, less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) ? for comparison, a human hair is about 50-70 micrometers thick, so PM2.5 particles are about 20 to 30 times smaller than a human hair. These small particles can be very harmful to health because they can easily get into our lungs when we breathe. By studying these processes, the research will help reduce the health risks from wildfire smoke and improve air quality. This study will add to our scientific understanding and help find ways to protect public health during wildfires. The results of this research will benefit society by finding solutions to reduce respiratory exposure risks for farm workers, firefighters, restoration and fire-safety workers, recreationalists, and local communities. This research will also support education by involving students and working with local communities to raise awareness and inform policy decisions about the health risks of toxic particles from wildfires.<br/><br/>Wildfires are major contributors to the formation of toxic metal-containing nanoparticles, which pose significant health risks. Fire conditions and their influence on soils determine the nature of these nanoparticles and their chemical-physical properties, which are largely unknown. The proposed project aims to: 1) determine how temperature and the composition of combustible materials, combined with soil composition, control fine particulate metal chemistry; 2) identify the mineralogy, metal associations, and morphology of particles; and 3) determine how geology and vegetation influence the metal chemistry and mineralogy of nanoparticles in soil, ash, and wildfire smoke. The Fellow will conduct lab burning experiments and prescribed burns. The particles formed during burning and soil heating experiments will be collected and analyzed using advanced techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS). By linking lab experiments with field measurements, this study aims to understand how fire conditions and soil properties affect the formation, transformation, and reactivity of fire-generated nanoparticles and to evaluate their health impacts.

This traffic is therefore unsolicited?a sort of pollution?and is constituted of an evolving mix of diverse traffic components originating from across the whole Internet. For more than two decades, network telescope instrumentation has enabled research breakthroughs by allowing global visibility into a wide range of Internet phenomena: from the automated spread of malicious software such as Internet viruses to Internet blackouts. Measurement and analysis of such macroscopic phenomena are of key relevance for the security and reliability of the Internet infrastructure but also provide data and inspire progress in interdisciplinary studies. However, due to the increasing scarcity of IPv4 address space, the size of telescopes has been progressively eroding over the years, to the point that some organizations stopped operating them or reduced their size, which lessens their research and educational utility. Another new issue with this research infrastructure is that malicious actors have been learning to ?blacklist? network telescopes and can avoid them when scanning the Internet. <br/><br/>A novel methodology, called dynamic network telescopes, overcomes these issues. A dynamic telescope is based on deploying programmable switches at the border of the organization?s network to continuously discover utilization of internal space and adaptively adjust the scope of traffic capture.

This transition is vital for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Even so, infrastructure from the fossil fuel past will remain on the land long-term. The mountaintop removal coal mines in Central Appalachia have an uncertain future in terms of how they will erode, potentially causing hazardous conditions for property, people, and animals. This research project will address this problem by developing a way to automatically detect landslides and other forms of erosion, giving the first regional understanding of the degradation of former mountaintop removal coal mines. Also, for the first time, this research project seeks to understand whether these former mined lands are eroding more quickly than unmined areas in the same region, which is an important consideration for both stream habitats and downstream infrastructure. Not only will the project answer these questions of regional interest but advance the techniques scientists use to study the long-term impacts of human disturbance on the environment. The programming code associated with this project will be shared through the CodeWV program, which provides high-quality training and curriculum materials to secondary-school teachers and students in underserved communities in West Virginia. Also, through the WVUteach network, the research will be shared in secondary-school classrooms, highlighting the connection between Earth science and computer science.<br/><br/>In the United States, the geomorphic impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining (MTR) and the resulting ?reclaimed? landscapes have garnered limited scientific attention from within the surface processes community despite the area impacted (~5900 km2), encompassing portions of West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee. These anthropogenic landscapes can degrade over time via natural processes, such as gullying and landsliding, overtaking and incorporating designed drainage systems. This research project will document geomorphic impacts at both the process and regional scale through leveraging big data repositories of high-resolution, multi-temporal, lidar-derived topographic data. The first task will be the regional-scale topographic differencing of lidar data for MTR-impacted areas to observe process-scale erosion and deposition. The second task will be to leverage these observations for the training of deep-learning models which will be applied to MTR-impacted areas with only a single generation of lidar coverage. The third task will be a field campaign to obtain cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations in stream sediments from mined and unmined catchments to understand the alteration in sediment dynamics and to parameterize long-term landscape evolution models. As similar engineering practices used to design reclaimed MTR landscapes will most likely be utilized when reclaiming surface mines generated during the anticipated boom in critical minerals used for the transition to renewable energy, the methods employed in this work and the resultant insights could be applied to these future anthropogenic landscapes. More generally, the project could lead to fundamental insights on optimal deep-learning inputs and architectures with regards to automated geomorphic mapping.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop 1) a novel multimodal representation learning approach combining machine learning and graph mining to learn the text-enriched embedding of the traffic events from heterogenous social/news media and transportation networks, 2) novel spatiotemporal data mining and transformer-based graph neural network methods to detect transportation events and their cascading impacts on heterogeneous transportation networks, 3) a new physics-informed machine learning solution to model the cascading impacts with the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and inject model interpretability while forecasting the traffic events in specific scenarios. The proposed physics-informed machine learning solutions could decouple the model's dependencies on large datasets so that the transportation systems in less represented/rural areas could swiftly infer accurate future statuses when failure happens. These advancements will make significant contributions to the fields of explainable graph mining, physics-informed machine learning, and spatiotemporal event analysis. The expected outcomes will enrich the understanding of the nature of traffic events in complex transportation networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies highlight emotional factors contributing to these disparities, with goal orientation being a significant factor influencing academic performance and persistence. Goal orientation refers to students? reasons for engaging within a learning environment. Within chemistry courses, there is limited understanding of how goal orientation specifically relates to students? performance and persistence. Therefore, this project aims to characterize chemistry-specific academic goals and develop a measure of chemistry students? goal orientation. Once developed, the Chemistry-specific Goal Orientation (CGO) measure will inform instructor understanding of the impact of pedagogies and course structure on student goals; subsequently allowing for evidence-based support for effective goal behaviors in chemistry classrooms. The CGO measure would also allow instructors to quantify and evaluate changes in students? goal orientation and relate them to other student outcomes such as their learning, persistence, or emotions. Thus, it is likely that efforts towards improving these outcomes would lead to the retention of more STEM majors. <br/><br/>Goal orientation can be conceptualized as ?mastery? or ?performance? based, with mastery-goals being more predictive of interest and continued motivation leading to positive relations with persistence and positive emotions. On the other hand, performance-goals are related to negative outcomes like low self-efficacy, anxiety, avoidance of help-seeking, self-handicapping strategies, and low performance. Within the field of chemistry education, there is currently sparse work investigating the role of students? goal orientation on achievement outcomes. The few studies that do investigate goal orientation focus on use of the Academic Goal Questionnaire (AGQ) and its different versions, to measure goal orientation. However, these studies find mixed results regarding the psychometric evidence that supports the data generated with the AGQ. To better understand goal orientation, this project first seeks to recontextualize the construct within chemistry. This starts with interviews that discuss how students engage with learning tasks in the chemistry course. A qualitative content analysis will be conducted to extract a model of chemistry students? goal orientation. From there, an iterative instrument development process will begin with item writing, cognitive interviewing, item editing, and psychometric evaluation until a final version of the CGO measure has been developed. The outcomes of this project will provide instructors and researchers the ability to produce data about students? goal orientations that is supported by substantial evidence of validity and reliability.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF?s STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) Program.

Insects, the most diverse organisms on Earth, are particularly vulnerable to water loss due to their small body size and high metabolic rates. To mitigate the risks of desiccation, insects are equipped with various physiological strategies, such as producing a waterproof barrier on their body surface, altering breathing patterns, and reducing water excretion. However, there is limited understanding of the extent of flexibility in their physiology over their lifetime to cope with changing environments, and even less is known about species living underground that play vital ecological roles. Subterranean termites are widespread wood decomposers, yet some species are serious structural pests, making them an ecologically and economically important group. This study explores how subterranean termites adjust their physiological responses to alterations in soil moisture and temperature, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying this flexibility, by examining six termite species inhabiting different climate regions across the United States. This understanding carries significant implications for predicting the resilience and susceptibility of termites to climate change and human impacts, thereby informing conservation and management strategies. The research findings will be disseminated through a workshop for the pest control industry and through the development of educational materials for the public. Termites cause billions of dollars of damage in the US each year, thus the work has strong implications for advancing knowledge related to the bio-economy. Furthermore, this project will support underrepresented undergraduate students in conducting summer research projects, while also offering interdisciplinary training opportunities for junior scientists.<br/><br/>Determining the acclimation capacity and the mechanisms for organisms to adjust to environmental shifts is critical for understanding the ecological consequences of climate change. While diverse habitats are projected to be affected by droughts and temperature increases, little is known about either the desiccation physiology or the acclimation responses of organisms in subterranean ecosystems. The overall goal of this project is to characterize the acclimation capacity for desiccation resistance and the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms in subterranean termites. Driven by the hypothesis that greater plasticity in desiccation physiology allows species to better acclimate to drier environments, this research will examine the acclimation responses of six subterranean termite species that represent different phylogenetic statuses and climate adaptation types. Upon acclimation to different soil moisture and temperature conditions, termites will be analyzed for their phenotypic responses to desiccation stress and for physiological changes in desiccation resistance traits, including cuticular hydrocarbon profile, spiracle respiration pattern, and body water reservoir. This study will further investigate their transcriptomic plasticity and the molecular mechanisms underlying the acclimation responses. The results will uncover the conserved and divergent mechanisms governing plasticity in termite desiccation physiology, and will facilitate future proximate and evolutionary investigations of species across taxa and ecological niches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the U.S., Black men are 1.7 times as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than twice as likely to die from the disease than white men. If caught early enough, a surgeon can remove the area around the tumor site, or more commonly, the entire prostate. Once metastasized, (i.e., spread to other parts of the body), more invasive options may be considered which all have their own side effects. A newer class of cancer therapy that has shown great promise is targeted therapy. While traditional chemotherapy drugs can be harsh on the normal healthy cells leading to considerable side effects, targeted therapy aims to selectively attack the cancer cells based on specific environmental characteristics, thus lowering toxicity to healthy cells. This project explores the preparation of an emerging class of porous materials called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which can be used to deliver chemotherapy drugs to precise targets. The overarching goal of this project is to determine how specific structure/property/interactions of MOFs affect their performance in targeted therapies for cancer and related diseases. Curcumin, a natural product derived from the rhizomes of the herb Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, will be the therapeutic drug of focus. Preclinical studies of curcumin have revealed therapeutic properties in a broad range of cancer types. Curcumin-encapsulated MOFs will be decorated with folic acid, which has been shown to target specific cancer cells. Complementary to this work, there will be a focus on engaging undergraduate students of color in research and STEM-focused initiatives that promote social and psychological well-being as well as career and graduate school preparedness.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate structure-function relationships of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as drug delivery vehicles to inform the rational design of new targeted therapies for cancer and related diseases. While traditional chemotherapy drugs can also be harmful to healthy cells, targeted therapy aims to selectively attack the cancer cells based on specific environmental characteristics, lowering toxicity to healthy cells. These nanomaterials typically consist of at least three components, which are (1) the drug or primary mode of therapy, (2) a vehicle for delivery to targeted sites, and (3) a targeting moiety for selective binding. Curcumin, a naturally derived compound which has demonstrated promising anticancer activity will be explored as the drug of focus. However, it has shown some limitation in clinical efficacy due to low bioavailability and cellular uptake. Encapsulation into porous MOFs will be explored as a mechanism to allow curcumin to selectively pass through the cellular membrane of cancer cells, which based on preclinical data, should significantly increase its efficacy. Due to its discriminate targeting abilities toward folate receptors and prostate-specific membrane antigen, PSMA (receptors upregulated in cancer cells), folic acid will be explored as the targeting agent for the proposed investigation. The main objectives of the project are to (1) investigate the relative curcumin absorption and release behaviors of a highly stable, biocompatible MOF, UiO-66, and a series of its structural analogs and (2) evaluate folic acid-functionalized, curcumin-doped UiO-66 and analogous systems for improved cellular uptake and therapeutic efficacy in prostate cancer cells. Complementary to this work, there will be a focus on engaging undergraduate students of color in research and STEM-focused initiatives. This includes a student mentorship program for first and second-year chemistry students to promoting self-efficacy, career and graduate school preparedness and culturally reflective activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Struvite, a common wastewater valorization product, contains essential plant nutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen. Utilized as a fertilizer, its low solubility microcrystals exhibit slow-release properties, providing a gradual nutrient release in line with plant uptake rates. Because of the unique composition of struvite and typically present iron impurities, struvite can catalyze environmental chemistry reactions, facilitating the transformation and remediation of organic pollutants and dissolved organic matter (DOM). This project will advance fundamental environmental chemistry knowledge concerning the under-studied colloidal struvite-organic mixtures, which in turn will be transformative to advance broader research on the complex multi-phase environmental aquatic mixtures. It will lay the foundation for the fundamental understanding of processes underlying practical use of the environmentally friendly slow-release struvite fertilizers. The broader impact of the project extends to providing quantitative predictions of the composition and physical properties of struvite microcrystals, a common wastewater valorization product, and their its environmental impact when used as a fertilizer. Project results will inform decisions regarding engineering, process design, and management controls for practical utilization of environmentally friendly struvite fertilizers, enhancing their performance and value, while aligning with the needs of environmental protection and sustainability. The interdisciplinary nature of this project creates a unique educational opportunity for students, offering hands-on experience with advanced synthesis techniques and state-of-the-art analytical methodologies. <br/><br/>This experimental project investigates the chemical composition, physical properties, and catalytic behavior of laboratory-synthesized struvite with varying and tailored iron content. Given struvite's potential to serve as a sustainable alternative to conventional fertilizers and mitigate environmental issues such as water eutrophication and tropospheric pollution, this project fills critical knowledge gaps necessary for a predictive understanding of struvite's environmental implications. The project will investigate the chemical transformations of representative laboratory proxies of DOM catalyzed by synthesized struvite colloids with varying iron content. These experiments will yield fundamental insights into the multiphase reaction chemistry of struvite microcrystals and their impact on DOM in aquatic environments.

Search Engines can often return extraneous or irrelevant information when queries for mathematical concepts are posed. Inherently, mathematical concepts usually have many aspects, layers, and nuances that search engine users fail to qualify appropriately.  For instance, a search for 'complete graphs' may have various intentions, such as seeking definitions or exploring applications. This project aims to address this issue by developing MathMex, a conversational math search engine. With MathMex if a user's query is ambiguous, the system will engage in a dialogue, asking clarifying questions to better understand the user's intent and deliver more accurate search results. Additionally, MathMex will offer suggestions for related information, drawing from a diverse dataset comprising annotated mathematical resources, including proofs, applications, and definitions. New language processing approaches and algorithms for resolving ambiguities and making suggestion will be designed and tested as part of this research. Furthermore, the project will introduce innovative methods for automatically extracting relevant information and generating clarifying questions. The potential societal benefits of MathMex are particularly high for educators and students, who will gain access to a more efficient tool for finding information and solving math problems. Importantly, MathMex's approach will differ from existing models like ChatGPT, focusing on facilitating information retrieval rather than providing direct problem solutions, thus removing the risk of misinformation. Moreover, this project will contribute to the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence and Information Retrieval lab at the University of Southern Maine, helping further advancements in these critical fields.<br/><br/>The research will involve four key steps: 1) developing a labeled mathematical dataset, 2) linking different information regarding mathematical concepts, 3) developing language processing techniques for resolving ambiguity for math, and 4) evaluating the proposed techniques. Initially, the team of researchers will focus on training BERT-based classifiers to effectively extract various types of information about mathematical concepts from extensive textual and formulaic sources. These classifiers will enable annotating text based on the category of information about the mathematical concept, such as definition, proof, or application. Subsequently, efforts will be directed towards developing models that establish connections between different mathematical concepts, drawing upon linked data sources such as Wikipedia and Math Stack Exchange. This phase will involve exploring techniques to quantify and measure the relatedness of mathematical concepts to enhance the comprehensiveness of search results. Additionally, the project will investigate the generation and utilization of clarifying questions in response to user queries, particularly when ambiguity is detected. This will entail the development of algorithms and strategies for dynamically generating relevant clarifying questions to refine the search process. Finally, comprehensive evaluations of the approach will be conducted using established math search test collections and a newly created dataset for conversational math search. Through these activities, the project aims to advance the state-of-the-art in mathematical information retrieval, with potential applications across various scientific disciplines, such as chemistry and physics. Moreover, the research will pave the way for further exploration into alternative data types, such as images and videos, in mathematical search tasks, as well as innovations in math problem-solving methodologies. The expected outcomes include improved retrieval performance, enhanced user satisfaction, and advancements in natural language processing and information retrieval. This research will answer questions on design considerations for conversational math search and will raise new research questions on using other data types such as images and video searches and improved math problem-solving.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Still, the land and the stream are often studied in isolation, which can lead to fundamental misunderstandings of how changes in one system impact one or both systems. Globally, salinization is a current major change in both terrestrial soil and freshwater systems. Salinization can change water quality and drinking water suitability, carbon storage and quality, and plant productivity. Freshwater salinization often begins through terrestrial salinization from human activities like urbanization, agricultural practices, and road salting. Yet, predicting how salinization alters carbon inputs across riparian-stream boundaries is not yet possible. This research will quantify how salinization, which can both subsidize and stress organisms, alters carbon processing across terrestrial-aquatic boundaries, through field work and experiments. The project will also examine the relationship between terrestrial and aquatic salinity in part from the collaborations of crowd-sourced k-12 teacher data. This project will also support three female PIs, mentorship of three graduate and four undergraduate students, support three REU students, and incorporate public participation and awareness through citizen science.<br/><br/>This research will identify fundamental principles about how aquatic and terrestrial systems will respond to increased salinization. This project will quantify how sodium chloride inputs to riparian zones and streams interact to alter decomposition, secondary production, gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem production in both terrestrial riparian and aquatic stream ecosystems using experimentally paired riparian-stream mesocosms and a field decomposition study across a sodium gradient. The responses are expected to follow a subsidy-stress model. Sodium chloride (NaCl) should act as a subsidy and increase these processes up to some optimal threshold because Na is a biologically essential nutrient. After which, these processes should decrease as Na becomes a stressor at sub-lethal levels and a toxicant at higher levels. The primary objectives are to 1) measure and quantify field terrestrial-stream relationships using a decomposition study that concurrently measures soil and stream chemistry across a large salinization gradient (electrical conductance ranging from 30-1200 micro Siemens per centimeter), 2) experimentally determine how soil salinization impacts terrestrial-aquatic carbon exchange across a gradient of salinization in novel paired terrestrial riparian-stream mesocosms, and 3) quantify the field-mesocosm relationship to determine the congruence of experimental mesocosm- and field-measured decomposition rates across a salinity gradient. Using a combined terrestrial-aquatic approach is essential to understanding, predicting, and ultimately mitigating negative salinization impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem structure and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When students are more interested in mathematics, they are more likely to continue to want to learn mathematics as they advance from secondary school to college and the workplace. Rough draft mathematics is an engaging and motivating set of teaching practices that can reduce students? fears so that they participate and experience positive emotions while learning mathematics. The teaching approach gives students the opportunity to revise their thinking so they can receive support for making new connections between mathematics ideas and concepts. The study will explore how teachers' use rough draft mathematics approaches and the influence on students' engagement with mathematics. Three different school districts in Delaware, Washington, and Virginia will participate in the study to understand how teachers use different teaching practices.<br/><br/>The project will (1) identify the presence and degree of mathematics teaching practices that promote engaging in rough drafting and revising in 24-32 middle school classrooms, (2) study middle school students? engagement (participation and emotions) in the moment of a lesson, and (3) examine changes in students? motivation over time (self-efficacy, mastery goals, growth mindset, and sense of belonging in math) in these instructional contexts. A major goal of this study is to capture how variations in teachers? enactments of rough drafting and revising have differential impacts on students? engagement and motivation. Data will come from classroom videos, an observation rubric, and teachers' self-report data in the form of surveys and teaching diaries.  The teacher data will gather their plans for teaching and reflections after the class. From students, the data gathered will include experience sampling surveys to capture their engagement during the lesson and surveys about their motivations, goals, and self-efficacy. Students may also participate in focus group interviews about their experience in mathematics class. Findings from the study will help inform how specific mathematics teaching practices might engage students and influence their motivation to learn mathematics.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program.

Animal behavior differs greatly across species, but our knowledge of how brains evolve to produce new behaviors is limited. Fruit flies offer a valuable opportunity to study how brains generate different behaviors due to their species-specific courtship songs. In many fly species, the males sing to the female and females use these songs to make mating decisions. The research project will involve a species of fruit fly where females sing back to males during courtship duets. Taking advantage of this behavioral difference between species, the fellow will investigate how the brain evolves with communication strategies. Results from this study will offer insight about the demands of rapid information exchanges between individuals. The fellow will provide research opportunities to undergraduate students and teach students about sensory biology and animal communication. The fellow will also educate students from grade school through high school via STEM education programs and lead a book club to explore topics at the interface of science and social justice.<br/><br/>Acoustic duetting is widespread across taxa, but it is not yet understood how neural circuits control the production of such a tightly coordinated behavior. The male-specific P1 neurons in Drosophila species with male-only songs integrate external stimuli with internal mating drive to produce a complex repertoire of species-specific courtship behaviors, including song. The project involves building genetic tools in Drosophila virilis as a new model for investigating the role of P1 neurons in acoustic duetting. The fellow will learn state-of-the art techniques for probing neural function, including calcium imaging, optogenetics, and new behavioral assays to make important contributions to understanding acoustic communication. By using numerically simple and experimentally tractable Drosophila brains, the fellow will reveal how neural circuitry controlling mating behaviors evolves with the additional sensory and motor demands accompanying acoustic duetting. The research, training, and outreach initiatives that are included in this project will provide the fellow with the necessary tools and experience to continue on an academic career path committed to teaching and training students in the field of neurobiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports the research and training of the fellow who will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Understanding the origin and evolution of novel traits is a major challenge in biology. A powerful way to test the mechanisms that generate new biological functions is to combine information about the genetic source code underlying traits with information about the form and function of traits across species. The goal of this project is to combine whole-genome analyses with anatomical data from high-resolution CT scans to test hypotheses about the evolution of predation in the group of venomous snakes called vipers, which include rattlesnakes and cottonmouths. These snakes have evolved an impressive arsenal of novel traits for hunting their prey, and this project will quantify how traits like venom and vision change through time in coordination with one another across molecular and anatomical landscapes. Additionally, this work will provide student training and public engagement opportunities across a variety of educational settings, including public-facing natural history museums. Overall, this work will position one of the most universally feared groups of organisms as a powerful model for understanding correlated trait evolution.<br/><br/>This research investigates organismal biology across multiple scales of life, examining trait evolution using DNA sequences to model gene/protein evolution, employing soft-tissue CT scanning to capture physiological investment at the micron scale, and evaluating trait integration across lineages at macroevolutionary scales in response to changing prey and habitat preferences. The 3D reconstructions provided by the CT scans also allow for modeling real-world sensory capabilities, including visual fields and depth perception, both from the eyes and from the bi-directional thermal-sensing pit organs found exclusively in pitvipers. This research will compare the head anatomy between pitvipers and non-pitted vipers to investigate how the evolutionary emergence of a brand-new sensory mode is manifested across other predatory phenotypes and how this change is reflected in their ecology and evolution. This project also offers several benefits to society, including open-source software for high-throughput tissue segmentation of CT scans and free public outreach, including a hands-on museum exhibit. The fellow will work alongside expert biologists at the University of Michigan & Museum of Zoology (UMMZ) to master the skillsets needed to interpret the complex anatomical data generated through CT scans of museum specimens.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the laboratory, tiny nucleus-sized droplets of quark-gluon plasma have been produced briefly by colliding large atomic nuclei at extremely high energy.  The droplets live too briefly to study directly and must instead be studied from the high-energy signatures of the collisions.  For instance, some collisions produce additional pairs of extremely high-energy constituents that lose energy by flying through the quark-gluon plasma droplet. So, one way to study properties of quark-gluon plasmas is from measurements related to the amount of such energy loss and its comparison to theoretical calculations.  This project tests the validity and self-consistency of methods typically used in theoretical calculations by calculating how thoroughly quantum mechanical corrections influence the energy loss.  In addition to studying the theory of probing quark-gluon plasmas, the PI will mentor students engaged in this research and will refine and make publicly available educational materials designed to excite advanced undergraduates and early graduate students into a first exploration of quantum field theory, a fundamental approach to theoretical particle physics.<br/><br/>High-energy particles traveling through matter lose energy mainly by showering via splitting processes like bremsstrahlung and pair production, similar to a cosmic ray shower in the atmosphere.  In the case here, typical splittings are induced by glancing collisions of the high-energy particle with the constituents of the quark-gluon plasma.  In principle, each collision offers a chance for a high-energy particle to split.  However, the quantum mechanical duration of that splitting, known as the formation time for the splitting, turns out to grow with energy.  At high enough energies, it grows so much that multiple collisions with the plasma occur within the formation time.  This causes a large suppression of the splitting rate known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect, worked out in the 1950s for electromagnetic interactions (quantum electrodynamics, QED) and the 1990s for the strong interactions (quantum chromodynamics, QCD).  This project will study whether formation times can become so large that there is also quantum interference between successive splittings of the shower.  This question bears on whether such showers can really be modeled as a growing collection of well-defined numbers of high-energy particles -- a question the project addresses by improving and extending calculations of such quantum interference effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of the nitrogen in our modern society is derived from fossil fuels via chemical synthesis, which causes environmental degradation. The BNERC seeks to develop personnel, technologies, and infrastructure pioneering in South Dakota. These developments will replace the chemo-nitrogen economy with a sustainable bio-nitrogen economy by using solar-powered cyanobacteria to convert atmospheric dinitrogen gas into ammonia. To accomplish this, South Dakota State University, Oglala Lakota College, the University of South Dakota, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and Houdek (industry) will partner in four synergistic research areas. The team will study nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in natural ecosystems; explore the  mechanisms of  solar-powered, oxic nitrogen-fixation using machine-learning driven comparative multi-omics; (3) bio-manufacture fuels and value-added products using nitrogen, and (4) engineer nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria as a step toward developing nitrogen-fixing crops.  BNERC will employ a vertically integrated strategy to boost K-12 students' interest in nitrogen fixation and train a new South Dakota workforce in nitrogen-driven bio-manufacturing. Exchange visits among the BNERC partners and industry engagement in the project has potential to enrich the education of the student participants. <br/><br/>Dinitrogen (N2) gas is ?2,000-fold more abundant than CO2 in Earth?s atmosphere.  However, the practical application of biologically converting N2 gas into bioavailable forms such as ammonia has been little exploited due to a historically ?chemo-nitrogen? economy based on hydrocarbons and the Haber-Bosch process.  To pioneer a green economy derived from sunlight, N2 and CO2, a transdisciplinary team of South Dakota researchers will leverage data science and establish the BioNitrogen Economy Research Center (BNERC) to build jurisdictional research capacity in biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and its practical applications.  As an agricultural state with a large Native American population, South Dakota is uniquely positioned to develop sustainable BNF research infrastructure by partnering academic institutions with industry to develop the workforce and promote economic growth in the region while increasing participation and representation of Native Americans in the state STEM enterprise. BNERC?s vision is to make South Dakota a national leader in use-inspired, machine learning-driven research in BNF.  This will be accomplished by incubating four research areas and developing a diverse BNF workforce. A critical research goal of the project is to obtain an ML-driven systematic understanding of genomics and mechanisms associated with oxic N2-fixation in cyanobacteria and enable application in sustainable agriculture and industries. BNERC envisions a transition from the current fossil fuel-based chemo-nitrogen economy to a greener economic system in which bioproducts (N-rich and C-rich) are produced mainly by N2-fixing cyanobacteria and/or genetically engineered crops. This transition will alleviate the environmental issues resulting from our hydrocarbon-based economy and reliance on synthetic N2-fixation to support agriculture.

In modern manufacturing sectors, comprehensive data analytics is critical for detecting anomalies, diagnosing faults, predicting the failure times of key assets, and optimizing operational decisions. The effectiveness of these data analytics models relies heavily on the amount of historical data available for model training. Unfortunately, individual manufacturing facilities often lack sufficient historical data on anomalies, faults, and failures to independently train effective monitoring and decision-making models. This research addresses this challenge with a novel solution that enables multiple geographically distributed manufacturing systems to collaboratively utilize their collective data to construct condition monitoring and decision-making models while keeping each system?s data local and confidential. By facilitating this collaboration, the project aims to overcome the limited data availability challenge and enhance the overall performance and reliability of manufacturing systems. This research helps enhance national economic competitiveness by improving manufacturing efficiency and reliability, aligning with the National Science Foundation's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national health, prosperity, and welfare.<br/><br/>The project plans to develop a federated learning framework comprising four primary components: data curation, feature engineering, analytics and decision-making, and verification and deployment. This approach represents the first systematic solution for privacy-preserving collaborative condition monitoring and decision-making within the industrial asset management sphere. Techniques such as robust low-rank statistical learning for data curation, supervised dimension reduction for joint feature engineering, classification-based anomaly detection, regularization-based fault diagnosis, parametric statistical learning for prognostics, and federated optimization algorithms for operational decision-making will be developed. These techniques are designed to handle diverse data formats prevalent in manufacturing systems, such as time series, profiles, and image streams. Successful implementation of these methods will significantly advance the fields of federated learning, statistical learning, and industrial data analytics, providing substantial benefits across manufacturing and service industries by improving equipment reliability, reducing costs, and preventing failures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Many species that are vulnerable to extinction live in small, fragmented habitats where individuals are often highly related to each other and share similar genes. This is a problem because genetic variation is required for populations to adapt to a changing environment. One way to restore beneficial genetic variation is to introduce individuals from a healthy population into small, declining populations. When successful, these introductions lead to the ?genetic rescue? of vulnerable populations. This project will use data from an experiment with Trinidadian guppies to better understand the long-term effects of genetic rescue attempts. The fellow will also conduct activities to broaden participation in field biology by collaborating with community college directors, field station managers, research faculty, and other postdoctoral fellows across the United States to provide field-based research experiences to students from diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>In a previous field experiment, small, inbred guppy populations received gene flow from a genetically divergent source population. After several generations, these recipient populations increased in size, harbored more genetic diversity, and showed evidence of sustained hybrid vigor, providing strong evidence for genetic rescue. However, the genomic basis and evolutionary response to genetic rescue in these populations is not known. This work will combine population genomics and quantitative genetics to identify ecologically important traits that contributed to genetic rescue, isolate genomic regions associated with these traits, and quantify the adaptive potential of recipient populations through time. Adaptive potential is used to predict how organisms will respond to a changing environment and can be harnessed by conservation biologists to improve management plans. The fellow will also lead a summer field course for undergraduates at Michigan State University?s W.K. Kellogg Biological Station. Hands on experience in nature is extremely beneficial for retention in the life sciences. The fellow will recruit students from local community colleges and minority programs to partake in this summer course.

One of the major mysteries of sociolinguistic variation and change is how young speakers first acquire and then subsequently use sociolinguistic variation in such a way that generational change is pushed forward. Answering this question is important because it illuminates how broader community level linguistic patterns intersect and are influenced by an individual?s linguistic patterns. Leveraging a novel audio diary method developed by the investigator, a large corpus of adolescent speech is created for an educational cohort of students. Acoustic analysis of this corpus is performed to test hypotheses regarding language change, including whether expansion of linguistic patterns is a feature of all speakers in a cohort or whether it is driven by a handful of socially influential speakers. The project supports education by connecting middle- and high-school students to the field of linguistics through partnerships with teachers and through their inclusion in the longitudinal corpus. Lesson plans about linguistics for adolescents are developed and undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees receive training in linguistic analysis. This project also benefits society by addressing the increasing need for language scientists in fields like generative artificial intelligence and the broader social concern of implicit linguistic discrimination. Further, the project provides substantial community outreach in the context of ongoing documentation of language and life, and it creates a publicly available data archive.<br/><br/>Previous research has shown that community-level language change proceeds like a logistic curve, where, as birth year increases, so does a speaker?s rate of the new variant. In addition, apparent-time research has shown that the most advanced speakers at any given point in time are late-adolescents, meaning that while children acquire their parents? production, their production begins to deviate in the pre-teen and teenage years, as teenagers incrementally use new variants. It is theorized that pre- and early-adolescents accomplish this incrementation by unconsciously modeling the distribution of variants from their surrounding speech community, calibrating an age-based vector from it, and then leveraging these different variants in their own stylistic practice to enact older teenagerhood. To test this hypothesis, this project leverages an existing longitudinal initiative that has collected self-recorded audio diaries for many years and expands it to obtain data from speakers spanning the range of adolescence. In doing so, this project provides one of the first comprehensive data sets consisting of regular, longitudinal data across an entire cohort of speakers. Acoustic analysis of the corpus, focusing on formant values from vowels, is used to test the hypotheses regarding individual- and community-level language change, thus advancing sociolinguistic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent introduction of a class of artificial intelligence (AI) methods known as deep learning has drastically advanced vision-based environment perception. However, the applicability of these methods is significantly limited by their reliance on vast amounts of 3D annotations for training, which are expensive, unnatural, and often unobtainable. Acquiring 3D annotations necessitates specialized data captured by 3D sensors rather than utilizing abundant and readily available images or videos. Moreover, it requires a controlled environment or compromises with inaccurate subjective labeling. This project aims to address real-time environment perception in a very challenging, largely unexplored, yet highly practical setting, where only 2D annotations are available during training, by modeling and learning rich space-time structures of the environment. The outcomes of this project will significantly impact cyber-physical systems and facilitate a wide range of applications, from robots in manufacturing and personal services to autonomous vehicles that enhance people?s mobility and safety. Furthermore, this project will tightly integrate research and education at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), which is a Minority Serving Institution (MSI), through curriculum development, research training for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and community outreach.<br/><br/>This project will address real-time environment perception when only 2D annotations are available during training by systematically pursuing a novel approach that decomposes the complex physical environment into geometry and motion substructures in 3D space and models their rich space-time interactions. From streaming video, the trained system will not only recognize objects and scene layouts in the environment but also estimate their 3D geometry and 3D motion in real time. This project is focused on (1) establishing a self-supervised framework for lifting 2D objects to 3D, by bridging geometry and motion, brightness constancy, and differentiable depth rendering, (2) scaling 2D-to-3D lifting of individual objects to perceiving the entire environment, by modeling and learning short-term and long-term dynamics of the environment, and (3) achieving flexible and generalizable environment perception by handling articulated motion and out-of-distribution environments. The new approach is expected to be efficient in terms of the amount of annotations required for training, scalable to a wide range of objects, and robust to the complexity and diversity of real-world environments. This project will advance and enrich the fundamental research of visual sensing, perception, and learning. Moreover, this project will demonstrate the usability and robustness of the proposed approach in real cyber-physical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum materials are promising for applications in computing, power storage and transfer, and low power electronics. In quantum materials, the electrons interact strongly with each other giving rise to new forms of matter. Simulating the physics of these materials is important for designing their properties. However, studying large quantum systems with computer simulations is an extremely difficult computational problem. The PI and his team will instead use programmable simulators based on vapors of atoms and molecules cooled to very low temperatures and trapped in a vacuum chamber using interfering laser beams. This approach, known as quantum simulation, has already provided valuable insights into the physics of quantum materials, enabling the exploration of microscopic processes that give rise to their unusual properties. In this project, the research team will focus on studying quantum systems that are ?frustrated?. In such systems, there are competing constraints that make it difficult to reach the lowest energy configuration. The investigators will explore new phases of matter that appear in frustrated systems such as magnets that are robust to very high temperatures. The main outcome of the project will be to advance our fundamental understanding of the microscopic physics of frustrated quantum systems. Additionally, the project will train graduate and undergraduate students in techniques of atomic and molecular physics and prepare them for careers in the emerging quantum industry, academia and national labs.<br/><br/>Technical audience abstract: Frustrated systems are a frontier research area in quantum many-body physics. In such systems, various contributions to the energy cannot be simultaneously minimized. This leads to novel ordered states of matter and exotic phases such as quantum spin liquids. The PI and his students will use ultracold gases of atoms and molecules to perform microscopic studies of various phenomena in frustrated systems, exploring two different kinds of frustration: geometric and exchange frustration. In one line of experiments, they will study doped fermionic Mott insulators in a geometrically frustrated triangular lattice, where they have previously observed kinetic magnetism resulting from the formation of a novel magnetic polaron. The team will perform a spectroscopic study of this system to test theoretical predictions of particularly large binding energies for such polarons. They will also search for related polarons with more complex internal structure which may facilitate hole-pairing at high temperatures. They will study manifestations of spin frustration in the equation of state of the triangular Hubbard model, looking for signatures of a Pomeranchuk effect near half-filling. In another line of experiments, the investigators will develop a platform to study frustrated magnetism with polar molecules induced by their dipolar interactions, even in the absence of geometric frustration. Long-term impacts of the proposed work include: the identification of potential new routes to high-temperature superconductivity in kinetically frustrated materials, advancing polar molecules as a platform for quantum computation and understanding spin liquid states which may be used as robust quantum memories with a high degree of immunity to environmental noise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the microbes in and on the human body number in the trillions, outnumbering our own cells. Sea turtles, whales, dolphins, and manatees represent some of our most cherished marine megafauna, and these, too, are covered in diverse microbes. These microbial communities are essential to protecting these animals from infections and disease and include bacteria and diatoms, a group of microscopic algae that produces 20% of Earth?s oxygen. Microbes represent most of Earth?s biodiversity, but most of these species are yet to be discovered. This project will document the diatom and bacterial species living on marine megafauna, describing and naming many new diatom species for the first time. Genome sequencing and characterization of the chemical environments will show how the diatoms are related to one another, how they move between host animals, and how they interact with bacteria to use the unique resources offered by their hosts. Since many of these diatoms reside only on threatened or endangered animal species, the fates of these microbial communities are tied to their hosts. The discoveries made through this project may allow researchers to grow these diatoms in the lab, creating a permanent living record should their hosts suffer extinction. The project will provide cross-disciplinary training for students, preparing them for jobs in industry or academia. A documentary film will introduce the complex microbial communities studied in this project to a general audience.<br/><br/>Through this project, an estimated 50 diatom species will be documented and described, doubling the number of known epizoic diatom species. Genome sequencing of cultivable and uncultivable species will be used to place epizoic diatoms onto the broader diatom phylogeny, which will provide a framework to: (1) infer how many times free-living ancestors have colonized and diversified on animal hosts, (2) reveal patterns of host switching to discern epizoic generalist and specialist diatom species, and (3) characterize mechanisms of host specialization in one model lineage that speciated and underwent a radical trophic shift following a host transition. The broad phylogenomic framework, combined with complementary metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic profiles will reveal the role of host skin microbiome in shaping trophic strategies and other adaptive changes by diatoms, factors that likely combine to facilitate or constrain host switching and speciation on evolutionary timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The students who leave STEM programs are disproportionately women, persons traditionally excluded because of their ethnicity or race, and non-traditional students. This affects scientific and technological progress not only by limiting the number of skilled candidates, but also in limiting diversity in the workforce. Diversity in teams has many benefits including being better able to solve complex problems. As such, it is essential to assess the issues affecting retention and work toward improvement. Supporting students? well-being early in college has been shown to increase student success and is particularly important for those who identify as members of groups that have been marginalized in the sciences. This project assesses whether early intervention programs affect student success by helping support well-being. Specifically, this project seeks to (A) develop a peer mentorship program to accompany a first-year seminar, and (B) investigate the impacts of these early intervention programs on student success and well-being with specific focus on comparing traditional to non-traditional students. This project seeks to contribute to establishing and improving first-year seminars and STEM-specific mentorship programs nationwide.<br/><br/>The United States economy depends on a workforce that is strong in STEM making it imperative to examine the issues affecting retention in STEM and work toward improvement. More than half of STEM students leave their selected program before graduation, and less than a third of individuals who obtain degrees remain in STEM careers post-graduation. A disproportionate number of individuals leaving STEM programs are women, persons traditionally excluded because of their ethnicity or race and non-traditional students. Engaging students early in their academic careers has been shown to increase retention and other metrics of student success. Many programs have recognized that improved student success was mediated through psychosocial factors. Supporting students? psychosocial well-being is particularly important for those who identify as members of groups that have been marginalized in the sciences. This project will investigate whether and how early intervention and mentorship affects student success in the unique context of an R2 regional comprehensive university with a large commuter and transfer student population. A peer mentor program will be developed to accompany the ?Introduction to the Biology Major? seminar at Northern Illinois University (NIU). Early intervention programs will be assessed in terms of improved outcomes of student success and how specific psychosocial factors may mediate those effects using a mixed-methods approach. Measurable outcomes of student success are equitable increases in retention, persistence, and graduation rates within the major. Metrics of student well-being are the psychosocial factors of sense of community and belonging, self-efficacy, and science identity. This project has the potential to contribute to immediate impacts on biology students at NIU and the reproducibility of research on psychosocial factors mediating the improvement of student success while informing institutional reforms on established first-year seminars and the implementation of discipline-specific mentorship programs.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF?s STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) Program.

Humans do this by recombining pieces of sentences that have been heard before in new ways to express new meanings. But among the multitude of ways that humans can make new sentences, there are still some constraints. For example, speakers need to know what is allowed in their language and what is not in addition to knowing detailed statistics of how words and sentence structures are typically used. Deciding how to say a new sentence therefore requires searching through many ways to recombine known words and phrases to express a message in a way that is both clear and natural sounding. Understanding how language users sort through these possibilities to express new ideas has been a challenge for a scientific understanding of the human mind. This project combines tools from linguistics, psychology, and computational approaches to advance an understanding of language processing in the mind. Advances in this area contribute to improved diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, improvements in second language instruction, and improvements in teaching other language-related skills such as programming. This project supports education by training students in quantitative skills including experimental methods, programming, and statistics. Teaching these quantitative skills in the context of linguistics provides an opportunity to reach more diverse audiences, such as women and underrepresented minorities, who are better represented in linguistics compared to some other disciplines. The project also creates publicly available corpora of naturally occurring instances of verb usages that are manually annotated. These corpora enable future research on a wide variety of questions in linguistics by researchers with fewer resources for data annotation.<br/><br/>This project focuses on how speakers use different types of knowledge when deciding what to say. For example, many verbs in English (such as ?give? or ?send?) can be used in two structures: (1) I gave the man a book, and (2) I gave a book to the man. Whether a speaker prefers one structure versus the other depends in part on the verb. For example, speakers prefer to use ?give? in structure (1) but ?send? in structure (2). Preference also depends in part on other properties of the sentence. For example, speakers prefer to use structure (1) when the receiver is short (e.g., ?I gave him a book?) and structure (2) when the receiver is long (e.g., ?I gave a book to the old man who I met at the grocery store?). These other properties are more generalizable in that they apply to all verbs, unlike the idiosyncratic verb-specific preferences. This project examines how speakers make use of both the generalizable constraints and the verb-specific preferences when deciding in real time which structure to use for a sentence. This project first builds computational models of how the mind integrates these two different types of knowledge. Then, these models are tested using controlled experiments. Finally, further computational models of how language changes over time are built. Each generation of speakers must learn the existing language, but each generation also subtly re-shapes the language, creating a situation in which speaker preferences and the language itself are simultaneously co-evolving. Computational models are used to investigate how human capacity for language and the structure of the languages become jointly optimized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NN scattering has been studied for decades in laboratories, however there are many such scattering processes that are inaccessible in laboratories.   Nucleon interactions in neutron stars, heavy ions, dense matter and many astrophysical areas can?t be probed in labs and thus theoretical calculations are critical.       The most reliable calculations come from Lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD).     Unfortunately, these calculations have significant challenges resulting from signal to noise issues to discrepancies using different methods.    The PI proposes to use a new robust tool for calculating these processes as an alternative to the usual method.     Undergraduate students will be recruited and engaged in numerical simulation, data analysis and LQCD calculations of the simple two-pion system.

These technologies are essential for making crops more sustainable and productive, especially as the global population grows and environmental conditions worsen. There is also an urgent need to accelerate the production of plant-based nutrition and health products. However, current plant genome editing faces challenges due to inefficient gene delivery and expression systems. The process involves complex tissue culture and plant transformation methods that are time consuming and work on a limited number of plant varieties, thus limiting the scope and scalability. To address these issues, the project aims to develop unique synthetic circular DNAs designed to be self-replicating but not integrated into the main genome of the plant cell. Similar systems have been tested successfully in animal systems to study genetic components in a cell that modulate function of genes and biological processes associated with diseases and health conditions. This advancement and application in plants could provide more efficient tools in the hands of plant researchers working on studying gene function, climate resilience, and help identify native candidate genes for improving yield and stress tolerance in crops.<br/><br/>Nano-enabled genome editing offers a promising solution for addressing the limitations inherent in conventional plant genetic transformation, essential for genome editing and engineering. Despite its potential, the efficiency of nano-enabled transformation remains lower than that of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Both methods have additional limitations including diminishing levels of transgene expression for a desired duration in a plant, and limited varieties of plants that can be transformed. The proposed research focuses on the development of SYNthetic PLAnt epiSOMES (SYNPLASOMES) that are engineered to self-replicate, assist in the selection of transformants and do not integrate into the native genome. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of various plant-specific combinations of origins of replication and matrix attachment regions in enhancing both the level and the duration of transgene expression through nano-enabled genetic transformation. These SYNPLASOMES, synthesized, assembled, and delivered using D-R9 cell-penetrating peptides, will be tested in several model plants and crop species, including tobacco, canola, soybean, and poplar. Anticipated result from this research is the development of an efficient, persistent, self-replicating, and integration-free plant genetic transformation system. Such a system has the potential for breakthrough application across a diverse array of plant species, significantly benefiting biotechnological endeavors in plant and agricultural sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, recent research indicates that different researchers, because they analyze the data in different ways, can sometimes draw different conclusions from the same data, which could influence how people ultimately act upon those findings. The purpose of this study is to identify the situations in which different researchers may be more or less likely to come to different conclusions when analyzing the same data. To accomplish this goal, the project leaders will provide the same datasets and research questions to large numbers of researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology. At the end of this study, project leaders will hold workshops at major conferences to share their results and to start conversations within the scientific community about how data analysis practices should or should not change. Undergraduates in Biology, Math and Statistics, and Computer Science will gain research skills, and teaching modules for an ecology lab and a statistical modeling class will be generated. <br/><br/>To assess the importance of potential drivers of heterogeneity among analysis outcomes, the project will use two data sets--one from avian ecology, one from plant ecology. Potential drivers of analytical heterogeneity, and how they will be studied include:<br/>a.	Features of datasets: volunteers will be provided alternate versions of the same data and asked to provide different analyses for each version. Versions will differ in the strength of the main effect, the strength of covariate relationships, and the presence of categorical variables that can be used to divide data into subsets. <br/>b.

Maine-FOREST will deliver a diverse, sustainable, and statewide research, education, and innovation incubator that builds strategic research and development (R&D) capacity. This will fuel the dramatic growth of the state?s forest-based economy and the rural communities it supports. Four interconnected research themes in the project reflect strengths and opportunities within the jurisdiction that align with the state?s science and technology, climate action, and economic development strategic plans. The project also will leverage prior investments in Maine?s research infrastructure, including federal awards and philanthropic gifts, and relationships with national laboratories and industry. Novel participatory and inclusive approaches will nurture community resilience and strengthen the capacity of diverse groups of natural resource-dependent rural and Indigenous communities to respond to current and future socio-ecological threats and opportunities. This new, partnership-based infrastructure will help to create a far more inclusive approach to promoting sustainable improvements in Maine?s forest-based research infrastructure, R&D capacity, and national competitiveness. Innovative approaches to STEM education and workforce development will reinforce the research themes in the project while also connecting with project activities in a companion EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems RII award (OIA-2412130).<br/><br/>Maine-FOREST?s four convergent incubator themes include Environmental AI & Informatics, Cellulosic Nanofiber (CNF) Bioproducts, Rural & Tribal Resilience, and Smart Rural Development. Statewide incubator teams associated with each theme aim to close key knowledge gaps. Maine-FOREST will advance one's ability to characterize and utilize CNF within an advanced manufacturing context. New AI/ML-driven technologies will be applied to assess core ecosystem attributes across broad spatial-temporal scales. Innovative, culturally inclusive approaches will be applied to participatory systems dynamics modeling to better leverage stakeholder networks. Research on the program?s collaborative culture and processes, including a cohort-based approach to student engagement, will yield new information regarding convergent science. Deliverables from Maine-FOREST include, in addition to typical scientific outputs, increased research capacity with support for 20 early-career faculty, a new forest sector business development faculty position, and an actionable dashboard of metrics related to forest, economy, and workforce capacity. Maine-FOREST is led by the University of Maine. Project partners include an emerging research institution (the University of Southern Maine), two public, primarily undergraduate institutions, two private colleges (Colby and Bates), and strategic non-profits across the state (the Maine Development Foundation, Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, Maine TREE, the Rural Aspirations). Maine-FOREST will directly support at least 45 faculty (45% early-career), 85 undergraduate students, 10 graduate students, and 4 postdocs. The project will potentially benefit 200 K-12 educators and nearly 2,000 students in 15 schools will directly benefit. Ten diverse rural and economically distressed Maine communities, and a Tribal Nation, will also be directly engaged. This project is funded by the NSF EPSCoR Research Incubators for STEM Excellence (E-RISE) Research Infrastructure Improvement Program. The E-RISE RII Program supports the development and implementation of sustainable broad networks of individuals, institutions, and organizations that will transform the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research capacity and competitiveness in a jurisdiction within a field of research aligned with the jurisdiction's science and technology priorities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these simulations are hampered by the limitations of currently available numerical methodologies. Specifically, complex systems are driven by multiple simultaneous physical processes with different dynamic characteristics, e.g., atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric transport. Consequently, different components evolve at different rates, some very fast (e.g., concentrations of chemical tracers) and some very slow (e.g., ocean temperature). Traditional numerical methods are ill-suited to solve complex systems with multiple scales and multiple dynamics.  This project develops new numerical algorithms that solve different complex system components with different discretizations and different time steps. This new approach will allow accurate and efficient simulations of complex systems and will positively impact many fields in science and engineering.<br/><br/>A novel hybrid time integration framework will be constructed to co-simulate complex systems governed by time-dependent partial differential equations. The particular innovation of the hybrid methodology is that it combines discrete and continuous internal stages during each integration step. The mathematical framework offers local truncation error estimates (unlike operator splitting), and provides solutions that do not depend on the convergence of an outer iteration process (unlike relaxation). It allows us to build methods with a higher order of accuracy than current co-simulation methodologies.  The developed hybrid methods will have higher orders of accuracy than current co-simulation methodologies while offering tremendous implementation flexibility. High-quality implementations of the new methods will be made available to the community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predicting time-advanced states of dynamical systems is a challenging problem in STEM disciplines due to their nonlinear and complex nature. This project will utilize data-driven methods and analyze state-space dynamical systems to predict and understand future states, surpassing classical techniques. In addition, the PI team will (i) guide students to obtain cross-discipline PhD/Master's degrees, (ii) guide students to work in a peer-learning environment, and (iii) educate a diverse group of undergraduates.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project will utilize state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms to efficiently analyze and predict information within data matrices and tensor computations with low-complexity algorithms. Single-dimensional ML models are not efficient at extracting hidden semantic information in the time and space domains. As a result, it becomes challenging to simultaneously capture multi-dimensional spatiotemporal data in state-space dynamical systems. Using efficient ML algorithms to recover multi-dimensional spatiotemporal data simultaneously offers a breakthrough in understanding the chaotic behavior of dynamical systems. This project will (i) utilize ML to predict future states of dynamical systems based on high-dimensional data matrices captured at different time stamps, (ii) realize state-space controllable and observable systems via low-complexity algorithms to simultaneously analyze multiple states of the systems, (iii) analyze noise in state-space systems for uncertainty quantification, predict patterns in real-time states, generate counter-resonance states to suppress them, and optimize performance and stability, (iv) study system resilience via multiple state predictors and perturbations to assess performance and adaptation to disturbances and anomalies, and finally (v) optimize spacecraft trajectories, avoid impact, and use low-complexity algorithms to understand spacecraft launch dynamics on the space coast and support ERAU's mission in aeronautical research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even when cooperation seems the obvious outcome?as in mutualisms, interactions between species where cooperation results in benefits to each party?huge variation is seen in the outcome of an interaction. However, there are major knowledge gaps in our understanding of why this variation exists. This project explores these knowledge gaps in cleaning mutualisms in which cleaner shrimp, which live in groups at ?cleaning stations,? remove and eat parasites from their reef fish ?clients.? Specifically, Biological Market Theory (BMT) is used as a framework for understanding variation in cleaning mutualisms based on economic principles from human marketplaces. In both mutualisms and marketplaces, individuals exchange goods or services (in an economic marketplace, goods are exchanged for cash; in a mutualistic marketplace, parasite removal services are exchanged for food), and interactions can be positive, neutral, or negative for either party depending on supply and demand, and the costs and benefits of cooperating. This project combines field and lab experiments, behavioral observations, and mathematical modeling to explore several factors related to supply, demand, and the costs and benefits of interacting, and how they affect the decisions of cleaners and clients to interact cooperatively with one another. This project will provide research experiences to a postdoctoral researcher, scientific dive certifications and fieldwork experience to two undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds in marine science, and outreach to the public through community events and a podcast series. <br/><br/>This project enhances our understanding of context-dependency in mutualism by focusing on how three aspects of the context in which a cleaning interaction occurs?the ?intragroup context,? the composition of the cleaner group, the ?interspecific context,? the presence or behaviors of third-party species not directly involved in the mutualism, and the ?spatial context,? the density and distribution of cleaning stations?link to extensive observed variation in interaction outcome, cleaning service quality, and decisions by cleaners and clients. Specifically, BMT predicts that (1) service quality should vary depending on contextual factors that affect supply and demand, and (2) individuals in mutualisms should assess potential partners and choose to interact only with those that provide the highest service quality. This work will combine non-invasive camera-based observations and experimental manipulations in nature with behavioral experiments in the lab and a spatially-explicit mathematical model of cleaning station distribution. Understanding how does the broader biotic (e.g., group or interspecific) or abiotic (e.g. spatial) context affect these crucial interactions, and what ecological and behavioral factors correlate with variation in mutualistic interaction outcome is important, since variation in the outcome of species interactions affects both the ecology of communities (e.g., variation in population growth and stability), and the evolution of species (e.g., the strength of selection on certain traits). Answers to these questions are currently lacking, especially in nature, but promise to significantly deepen our understanding of how mutualisms evolve, persist, and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process of developing software involves not only writing code, but designing and maintaining code over longer time scales as its users, developers, stakeholders, requirements, and underlying technologies change. Thus, in the professional practice of engineering, there is a need to not only learn programming (writing code), but software engineering practices and tools (SEPTs), which include concepts such as writing software tests to maintain code correctness across updates, or using tools to manage the installation and update of a project's software dependencies. This project will study the use of these SEPTs among undergraduate students and industry practitioners in three different engineering disciplines (mechanical, electrical, and civil), with the aim of understanding (1) what SEPTs are currently being used in the teaching and practice of these disciplines, (2) the factors that lead students to adopt these SEPTs, and (3) the extent to which students and practitioners agree on how they value these SEPTs in their work. The insights from this project will shed light on how students develop their professional skills and identities as engineers, particularly how they view software engineering within the context of their own disciplines. Comparing the ways in which students and practitioners value these skills will also illuminate the shifts that occur as students develop in their disciplines and careers. Finally, the understanding from this project may help us identify opportunities to improve the way we teach SEPTs in engineering, and better articulate the impact that these improvements will have in the professional formation of engineering students.<br/><br/>Specifically, in this project, we will conduct an explanatory mixed methods study to answer the following research questions: (1) What software engineering practices and tools do undergraduate engineering students and practitioners currently use in their work? (2) What factors influence undergraduate engineering students' adoption of SEPTs, and to what extent? (3) In what ways do student perceptions of the value of software engineering practices and tools align with those of practitioners in their field? To answer Q1, we will develop a survey to assess the SEPTs currently used by students and practitioners, identifying differences in SEPT use by factors such as student/practitioner status, discipline, or previous computing experience. Our survey will adapt instruments from prior research, and will be grounded in professional and educational standards in software engineering, namely, the Software Engineering Book of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Guide and the SE2014 Curricular Guidelines. To answer Q2 and Q3, we will then select SEPTs of particular interest identified in the survey (e.g., those widely used by practitioners but rarely used by students within a discipline), and conduct follow-up interviews with students and practitioners. Specifically, our interview protocol will be grounded in Expectancy-Value Theory and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology frameworks (UTAUT/UTAUT2). In answering Q2, we will focus on the factors motivating students to adopt (or not adopt) certain SEPTs, while in answering Q3, we will focus on value perceptions of a SEPT and how these differ among students and practitioners. We expect our findings to result in a list of SEPTs that can be assessed across different engineering disciplines, as well as a revised model of factors (e.g., usefulness for engineering tasks, contribution to professional engineering identity) affecting the adoption of SEPTs. In addition to laying groundwork for further research in the above topics, our project will also inform the development of new interventions to better teach SEPTs in their relevant engineering contexts at the undergraduate level, shaping the software development skills of future professional engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A rapidly growing sector of AgTech is soilless plant production, encompassing hydroponics (which uses synthetic fertilizer) and aquaponics (which uses fish waste as fertilizer).  The ""Driving AgTech Research and Education in Kentucky (DARE KY)"" project will increase Kentucky?s capacity to support soilless AgTech growth through research, workforce development, and instructional initiatives. Soilless agriculture is becoming increasingly important as it can be implemented in areas with poor soil quality or adverse climate conditions, and in those areas lacking access to fresh food. DARE KY seeks to mitigate the high cost of treating agricultural nutrient waste, reduce operating costs, and ease the environmental impacts of soilless agriculture. DARE KY research will investigate the science of plant culture using nutrient waste from aquaculture and assess the food safety and sustainability of these systems. Led by Kentucky State University (KSU), Kentucky?s 1890 Land Grant University, DARE KY will create a statewide network of institutions including Bluegrass Community and Technical College, University of Pikeville, other Kentucky universities and colleges, non-profits, and industry partners. The project will enhance workforce development in Kentucky by creating new curricula, integrating research into student learning, and developing new work-and-learn opportunities.  Building on KSU?s substantial capacity to conduct cutting-edge research in agriculture, DARE KY will integrate a multi-institutional and cross-disciplinary network capable of advancing research in this field and removing barriers that limit non-traditional and underrepresented students from obtaining degrees in STEM.<br/><br/>The DARE KY project will conduct use-inspired research that answers central research questions with a high potential for transformative impacts across society, to include: Can bioremediation of aquaculture effluent provide a sustainable fertilizer for soilless plant production?  DARE KY research will use metatranscriptomic and proteomic approaches to characterize the activity of microorganisms in these systems at any given time, their response to environmental factors, and their relationship within the microbiome community as a whole. Essential nutrient flow through the various aquaponic system configurations will be studied, as will system productivity and sustainability. Food safety of soilless agriculture production will also be investigated, and pathogen monitoring technologies developed. Soilless systems have been assessed with a focus on the presence of foodborne pathogens; but information on the control of these pathogens is limited to preventing entry through facility biosecurity and decontamination of produce strategies, and systems in place to monitor these pathogens are often absent. A life cycle assessment for soilless AgTech systems will provide a sustainability index, allowing the assessment of potential negative environmental impacts. DARE KY will improve nutrient management, food safety, and sustainability of soilless agriculture while integrating multiple disciplines, including engineering, chemistry, biology, and computer science, and creating a more diverse and inclusive STEM research and innovation ecosystem to enhance Kentucky?s research competitiveness.

This project works to discover more efficient ways of using energy to mitigate global climate change and to promote U.S. national security through greater energy independence. The project targets the optimization of energy consumption in data centers, which currently consume ~ 2% of the U.S.'s energy use and is projected to grow substantially. The project?s objectives are to develop techniques to improve the energy efficiency of software, so that less energy is spent in data centers. The scientific innovation of the project is in the application of an emerging technology, Large Language Models (LLMs), to this task. Additionally, the principal investigators will use a systems thinking conceptual framework to identify patterns and understand interconnections needed to develop new educational material related to this topic. This material will be presented at a workshop in the second year of the project and made freely available online. More generally, the possible contribution is to catalyze a shift toward effective energy-efficient computing, both in software engineering practices and in STEM education.<br/><br/>With funding from an EAGER award through the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative, this project investigates approaches to improve the energy efficiency of software and fill two gaps in the current energy-aware toolkit - energy-aware tools to support software implementation, especially for data center software, and energy-focused educational material for university students and workforce development. Toward the first goal, the project studies the application of LLMs in developing energy-efficient software solutions for data centers. The principal investigators evaluate the hypothesis that LLMs can significantly improve software energy efficiency with targeted prompting and feedback from modeled and real energy data. Toward the second goal, the project assesses the effectiveness of systems thinking as a conceptual framework for energy efficiency. They hypothesize that systems thinking, with its emphasis on holistic reasoning across levels of abstraction and timescales, is a better basis than the prior conceptual frameworks. To validate these hypotheses, the project is structured around three thrusts: measuring the efficacy of LLMs in fostering energy-efficient programming, creating pedagogical materials, and disseminating our insights through a workshop. The research specifically contributes (1) a framework for automated energy-optimization of software, including a catalog of energy-efficiency LLM prompts combined with a hierarchy of energy measures; (2) empirical data on the effectiveness of LLMs in developing energy-efficient software for use in data centers; and (3) educational materials on energy efficiency for software in data centers, including the first incorporation of LLMs and of systems thinking into this line of pedagogy. If successful, the project will advance the state of the art in energy-aware software engineering and pedagogy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our survey will adapt instruments from prior research, and will be grounded in professional and educational standards in software engineering, namely, the Software Engineering Book of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Guide and the SE2014 Curricular Guidelines. To answer Q2 and Q3, we will then select SEPTs of particular interest identified in the survey (e.g., those widely used by practitioners but rarely used by students within a discipline), and conduct follow-up interviews with students and practitioners. Specifically, our interview protocol will be grounded in Expectancy-Value Theory and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology frameworks (UTAUT/UTAUT2). In answering Q2, we will focus on the factors motivating students to adopt (or not adopt) certain SEPTs, while in answering Q3, we will focus on value perceptions of a SEPT and how these differ among students and practitioners. We expect our findings to result in a list of SEPTs that can be assessed across different engineering disciplines, as well as a revised model of factors (e.g., usefulness for engineering tasks, contribution to professional engineering identity) affecting the adoption of SEPTs. In addition to laying groundwork for further research in the above topics, our project will also inform the development of new interventions to better teach SEPTs in their relevant engineering contexts at the undergraduate level, shaping the software development skills of future professional engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In biology, for instance, the shapes of biological components are pivotal in understanding patterns of normal behavior and growth; a notable example is protein shape, which contributes to our understanding of protein function and classification. This project, led by a team of investigators from the USA and the UK, will develop ways of modeling how biological and other shapes change with time, using formal statistical frameworks that capture not only the changes themselves, but how these changes vary across objects and populations. This will enable the study of the link between form and function in all its variability. As example applications, the project will develop models for changes in cell morphology and topology during motility and division, and changes in human posture during various activities, facilitating the exploration of scientific questions such as how and why cell division fails, or how to improve human postures in factory tasks. These are proofs of concept, but the methods themselves will have much wider applicability. This project will thus not only progress the science of shape analysis and the specific applications studied; it will have broader downstream impacts on a range of scientific application domains, providing practitioners with general and useful tools.<br/> <br/>While there are several approaches for representing and analyzing static shapes, encompassing curves, surfaces, and complex structures like trees and shape graphs, the statistical modeling and analysis of dynamic shapes has received limited attention. Mathematically, shapes are elements of quotient spaces of nonlinear manifolds, and shape changes can be modeled as stochastic processes, termed shape processes, on these complex spaces. The primary challenges lie in adapting classical modeling concepts to the nonlinear geometry of shape spaces and in developing efficient statistical tools for computation and inference in such very high-dimensional, nonlinear settings. The project consists of three thrust areas, dealing with combinations of discrete and continuous time, and discrete and continuous representations of shape, with a particular emphasis on the issues raised by topology changes. The key idea is to integrate spatiotemporal registration of objects and their evolution into the statistical formulation, rather than treating them as pre-processing steps. This project will specifically add to the current state-of-the-art in topic areas such as stochastic differential equations on shape manifolds, time series models for shapes, shape-based functional data analysis, and modeling and inference on infinite-dimensional shape spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study examines the extent to which this dramatic decline in battery prices is due to learning-by-doing in battery production. It also evaluates the impact of two types of government actions?EV consumer subsidies and preferential treatments for domestic battery suppliers?on learning in battery production, EV industry dynamics, and the spillover of subsidy effects across countries. China implemented these preferential treatments through an action known as the ""whitelist,"" and more recently, the US has adopted similar measures with local content requirements in battery production. The outcomes of this research are crucial for understanding the broader impacts of consumer subsidies and other actions in the global EV industry, thereby informing future decisions to foster sustainable transportation solutions and energy transition.<br/><br/>This study compiles the most comprehensive data encompassing model-level sales, prices, and attributes of EV models from the 13 leading EV markets, which collectively account for over 90% of global sales. It also integrates detailed information on battery suppliers and battery characteristics. The empirical framework develops a structural model of the global EV industry, which characterizes consumer vehicle choices, pricing decisions by EV manufacturers, and bilateral bargaining between EV manufacturers and battery suppliers over battery prices. By estimating the model-implied battery costs, the project assesses how these costs evolve with the accumulated production experience of battery suppliers. The identification strategy for learning-by-doing leverages variations in EV subsidies across vehicle models and differences in battery supply networks caused by preferential treatments for domestic battery suppliers. With the model parameter estimates, including the magnitude of learning-by-doing, counterfactual simulations are conducted to examine the impacts of consumer subsidies and local content requirements, as well as how learning-by-doing interacts with these actions. The research makes two important contributions. First, it provides the first causal estimate on the size and scope of learning-by-doing in the global EV battery industry. Second, the study contributes to our understanding of the impacts of two classes of government actions in the EV industry?subsidies for EV purchases and preferential treatment of domestic production?on global EV diffusion, firm market share dynamics, and social welfare while taking learning-by-doing into account. Learning-by-doing can have important implications for the impacts and ultimately the advisability of these actions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

POMs are viewed as the missing link between the single-molecule and the nanoparticular (or indeed the bulk material) scales. Metal oxide nanoparticles have many important uses in the biomedical field, catalysis and energy storage. One factor that remains a major impediment vis--vis wider utilization of these entities in modern technology is the lack of robust and versatile analytical tools that can be used to characterize their structure and behavior at the atomic level. This gap proved difficult to address due to the dramatic increase in size and complexity upon transitioning from the single-molecule scale to the nano-objects. Professor Kaltashov and his team target metal oxide molecular entities that are sufficiently large to resemble nanoparticles and share many of their traits, and at the same time are sufficiently small to be chemically defined. The structure and stability of these objects are probed with a new technique that uses stable isotope exchange and state-of-the-art spectroscopic tools. The project also provides opportunities for undergraduate students to (i) be involved in research focusing on the role of metal oxide-based materials in fighting the H. pylori infection, and (ii) increase the awareness of this frequently asymptomatic disease within the communities that are particularly hard-hit by it and its consequences.<br/><br/>The new experimental tool will utilize stable isotope exchange in solution followed by mass spectrometric (MS) detection to probe the structure and dynamic behavior of both chemically defined metal oxide particles (such as POMs) and the macroscopic objects (such as metal oxide surfaces). At the initial stage, oxygen exchange (18O/16O) in solution will be used to detect and characterize transient dynamic events affecting decavanadate, a paradigmatic member of the POM family. This will be followed by developing SIX(n) - Simultaneous Isotope eXchange in solution (e.g., 18O/16O, 17O/16O and 15N/14N) with high-resolution MS detection - to study transient dynamic events affecting the structure of POM-based nanocages and elucidate their role in the cargo capture/release processes. Further modification of this experimental strategy shall expand the scope of inquiry to include dynamic processes at the surface of metal oxide materials. Successful development of these novel experimental tools will undoubtedly catalyze progress in many branches of material science where the metal oxides behavior is one of the major contributors to the materials quality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cyanobacteria increased the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere from nearly none to over 10% of modern levels through the process of oxygenic photosynthesis. This oxygen-rich atmosphere allowed for the evolution of aerobic respiration and complex life forms. However, tracing the early evolution of cyanobacteria has been challenging because cyanobacteria rarely ever form fossils. In addition, most modern cyanobacteria are Phycobacteria, and their sister lineage, Gloeobacteria, are very rare ? until 2020 we only knew of two species. The poor representation of Gloeobacteria has made it difficult to determine if their unique features were ancestral or results of specific evolutionary paths. Recent discoveries, however, have revealed a much greater diversity within Gloeobacteria than previously recognized, especially in high-latitude and high-altitude habitats. This project aims to comprehensively characterize the hidden diversity of Gloeobacteria, which will shed new light on the early evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that fundamentally shifted the trajectories of life on Earth.<br/><br/>The first aim involves isolating new Gloeobacteria cultures through targeted fieldwork and real-time nanopore sequencing. These cultures will be characterized in the second aim based on their genomic, phylogenetic, morphological, and physiological traits, leading to detailed taxonomic descriptions. The third aim focuses on fostering interdisciplinary research by organizing a workshop to unite experts from various fields. This study is crucial for comprehending the evolution of cyanobacteria, as Gloeobacteria hold key insights into the origins of oxygenic photosynthesis. The project plans to increase the number of known Gloeobacteria strains tenfold and significantly expand the number of described species, bridging hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history. Further, given that polar regions are disproportionately threatened by climate change, this work will help document and conserve key microbial diversity before these habitats disappear.

The resulting reduction in computational complexity will also help enable the use of AI in real-time applications and on devices with limited resources, further expanding this critical technology's reach. Thus, the expected scientific outcome is the development of robust, efficient, practical algorithms that are also backed by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Moreover, we anticipate that the theoretical tools we develop in order to analyze these algorithms will find broader use in other application areas. The project also emphasizes the importance of education and academic community involvement. By integrating research findings into university courses and involving students from potentially diverse backgrounds, the project will help prepare the next generation of mathematicians and engineers. Additionally, it aims to share breakthroughs with broader communities through journal publications, workshops, and conferences, while also connecting students with real-world industry applications.<br/><br/>As previously stated, the project aims to address the challenge of compressing large neural networks, which are pivotal in modern AI applications but are resource-intensive. Thus, the research will focus on developing algorithms that reduce the computational demands of these networks by minimizing the memory and power needed without compromising their performance. Our approach involves three main strategies, quantization, pruning, and low-rank approximation. Among these, quantization transforms neural network parameters into formats that require fewer bits, thus reducing memory usage and computational intensity. Meanwhile, pruning selectively removes less important parameters from the network to streamline computations. Finally, low-rank approximation replaces large matrices representing the weights in the network with products of smaller matrices, in a way that retains essential information while requiring less memory and computation.  We will develop algorithmic approaches for quantization, pruning, and low-rank approximation that are underpinned by rigorous mathematical theories to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the compressed models. In our analysis, we will utilize stochastic process theory, geometric functional analysis, discrete geometry, discrepancy theory, optimization theory, compressed sensing, and dimensionality reduction, to name a few.

This Research Advanced by Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RAISE) award is made in response to Dear Colleague Letter 23-109, as part of the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative. Offshore wind power has the potential to play a crucial role in the United States' transition to a clean energy future. Higher and more consistent offshore wind speeds provide a more constant supply of energy than many onshore wind farms, and offshore wind farms can be located closer to larger population centers, thereby increasing impact and availability of renewable energy generation. However, operating offshore systems at scale introduce numerous challenges, ranging from battery design to novel control systems to integration with the onshore power grid. This project, composed of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in material science, electrical engineering, and computer science, undertakes an integrated approach to address four key challenges limiting the expansion of offshore wind farms and their connection to onshore grids. These challenges include the development of rare earth-free magnets that remove supply chain limitations, the development of novel control systems that provide more stable turbine operations, regional-scale wind modeling and forecasting to assist with grid operations and planning, and the design of novel high voltage AC/DC hybrid networks that are needed for integrating offshore energy production (transmitted over direct current) with AC-based onshore power grids.  The project also devotes significant effort to undergraduate and graduate student education through the integration of the proposed research into capstone and ?flipped classroom? course work at the investigators? universities. Through participation in the Pre-University committee (chaired by the project?s principal investigator) of the IEEE Power & Energy Society, the project will undertake outreach to high-school and community college students to increase their knowledge of clean energy technologies and recruit them to join advanced training and research programs. <br/> <br/>The main objectives of this project are to advance offshore wind technologies from the level of individual wind turbines to their integration to the system level of an offshore wind farm. The first goal is to develop magnets that do not rely on rare-earth materials. By doing so, the project seeks to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign suppliers for rare-earth materials in offshore wind turbines. The second goal is to design an AI-driven control system at the MW scale that can overcome the unstable operations of individual permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbines that have been reported in the literature and by the industry in offshore applications. The third goal aims to develop temporal and spatial models that can be used to manage highly distributed offshore wind turbines and wind farms over a large geographic area.

Nanoparticles are solids consisting of a small number of atoms, in such a way that at least one of the three dimensions is of the order of a few nanometers (1nm=10-9 m). Quantum dots, for example, are a type of nanoparticle that emits light in different colors depending on their size. Over the last decade a new paradigm for materials engineering has emerged, where instead of directly assembling atoms or molecules into materials, first nanoparticles are made, and then, the nanoparticles themselves are assembled into functional materials. This allows an unprecedented level of control, but also, the ability to design materials with new functions, with potential for game changing applications in energy harvesting technologies, quantum information, new display devices, as well as medical imaging, just to name a few.<br/><br/>This project aims at providing a robust platform for designing nanoparticle based materials. Driven by the ability to synthesize large numbers of nanoparticles with diverse sizes, composition and the implementation of a broad range of strategies to assemble them in actual materials, the field has had an extraordinary experimental progress over the last decade. What is needed to accelerate this process of discovery is a comprehensive computational/theoretical framework that will identify what combination of design parameters will lead to materials with new functions. The project aims to fill this gap by developing a general framework (mean-field model), complemented with numerical simulations that will enable the prediction of structure and in this way, a rational exploration of the optimal parameters for designing new materials. The developed framework will be made available through a software package for the benefit of the entire community.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the proposed research will continue and strengthen a collaboration with the SUCCESS program in the Des Moines school district, which identifies kids transitioning into middle school that are at risk of dropping out of school. It also includes developing material for teaching nanoscience with a strong emphasis involving undergraduates in research, as well as engagement by the project personnel in graduate and undergraduate training in theoretical and computational nanoscience. Theoretically-oriented students will be exposed to broader soft materials disciplines through a close coupling with experimental groups at Indiana University and ETH-Zurich in Switzerland, as well as with the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theory and computation, and education to advance structure prediction in functional nanomaterials. The project aims to develop a comprehensive mean field model, complemented with simulations that will provide a first principles prediction of structure. Preliminary results have shown that the proposed approach successfully predicts the known phenomenology in single component systems consisting of spherical-like nanocrystals functionalized with simple alkane ligands, so the framework will be extended to other nanoparticle shapes, multicomponent systems and more general ligands, and will be made available to the broader community, with the expectation that it will become a routine tool for structure prediction similarly as density functional has become for atom based materials. Collaboration with the group of Mario Tagliazucchi at University of Buenos Aires in Argentina will enhance the capabilities of the mean field model. Experimental work in the group of Xingchen Ye at Indiana and Maksym Kovalenko at ETH Zurich will be specifically developed to rigorously verify the theory. <br/><br/>The main broader impact activity of the proposed research will consist in developing activities for the SUCCESS program of the Des Moines School district transitioning from 5th grade into middle school. The students will make regular visits to the Iowa State Campus, and attend hands-on lectures on nanoscience through the year, thus making them familiar with the subject and equally important, get to experience a college campus. The program also includes extensive participation of undergrads in research, an area where the PI has had major success over the last decade. The PI will also develop course materials to enhance the knowledge and potential of nanotechnology. All participants will contribute to the vibrant education and outreach programs at Iowa State and the national and international collaborations that will result from this project.<br/><br/><br/>STATEMENT OF MERIT REVIEW<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Mitchell and his undergraduate students study important reactions called cycloadditions in the laboratory and Professor Tantillo and his students use high-powered computer technology to aid in understanding the inner workings of each molecule involved. In addition, they collaborate with Professor Corey Stephenson and his students at University of Michigan who study reactions that are promoted by visible light, which is an important and sustainable alternative to environmentally detrimental chemicals. These reactions enable the selective transformation of two dimensional flat molecules into three-dimensional building blocks, which resemble a number of biologically active compounds and medicines. Although new reaction discoveries are fascinating, the Mitchell and Tantillo groups are equally passionate about training next generation scientists, many of whom are from underrepresented groups, to ask important questions within an organic chemistry CORE (Collaboration, Outreach, Research, Education) curriculum. Collaboration invites students to work with other established scientists and scientists in training. Deep understanding of these reactions is obtained by creativity, teamwork, communication, and characterization of new compounds, skills that are often caught more than taught. For example, students learn to think on their feet and engage in nuanced scientific discussions during lab work and group meetings. Outreach provides opportunities for local high school students to hear stories about historical and current science. Research in the undergraduate environment opens the door for greater sophistication through mentorship, critical reasoning, and exposure to state-of-the-art instrumentation at Illinois State and beyond. <br/><br/>Oxidopyrylium-based [5+2] cycloadditions are exceptionally useful reactions that result in the construction of important heterocyclic small molecules. The Mitchell group has demonstrated that this reaction can lead to previously undiscovered scaffolds but that the reaction suffers from regioselectivity issues. To overcome this problem, they have chosen to employ nitrogen as a traceless tether as a means of controlling the reaction?s regioselectivity.  Synthetic and mechanistic studies in collaboration with the Tantillo and Stephenson labs will expand these experiments, establish the use of traceless tethers as a means of controlling the reaction, and explore the photochemical activation of the reactions to discover new pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, water quality predictions for an aquifer requires collection of samples at different locations and times; this process is expensive and cannot be repeated frequently. This project, which aligns well with the Central State University's Land Grant mission, will develop novel and computationally efficient multiscale and statistical strategies for sampling subsurface properties that can be effectively used to predict water quality. In addition, the framework can be used to guide field engineers in determining the location of monitoring wells such that the uncertainty in predictive analysis of contamination is minimized. This project will involve several undergraduate students from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Central State University (CSU), which is the only public Historically Black University in Ohio. The project will provide an outstanding experiential learning environment for CSU students.  During the project period, CSU undergraduate students will work with graduate students at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). The synergy developed between CSU and UTD on this project will be a catalyst for CSU students to consider graduate studies at UTD.<br/><br/>This project builds up on the Multiscale Sampling Method (MSM) for subsurface characterization previously introduced by the investigators. Numerical simulations established that the method is very effective in speeding-up the convergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, a long-standing challenge in science and engineering applications. As a proof-of-concept model problem, second order elliptic equations had been considered to show the effectiveness of MSM. This project will consider inverse problems associated with the transport of contaminants in groundwater (single-phase flow problems). The project will investigate the scalability of MSM for single phase flow problems. In investigating overlapping domain decompositions for MSM, the project will assess convergence of MCMC chains locally at subdomain level. This study can be used to decide the locations for additional monitoring wells that need to be drilled in the field to reduce the overall uncertainty in the predictive simulation of the single-phase problem.

Most of the nitrogen in our modern society is derived from fossil fuels via chemical synthesis, which causes environmental degradation. The BNERC seeks to develop personnel, technologies, and infrastructure pioneering in South Dakota. These developments will replace the chemo-nitrogen economy with a sustainable bio-nitrogen economy by using solar-powered cyanobacteria to convert atmospheric dinitrogen gas into ammonia. To accomplish this, South Dakota State University, Oglala Lakota College, the University of South Dakota, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and Houdek (industry) will partner in four synergistic research areas. The team will study nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in natural ecosystems; explore the  mechanisms of  solar-powered, oxic nitrogen-fixation using machine-learning driven comparative multi-omics; (3) bio-manufacture fuels and value-added products using nitrogen, and (4) engineer nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria as a step toward developing nitrogen-fixing crops.  BNERC will employ a vertically integrated strategy to boost K-12 students' interest in nitrogen fixation and train a new South Dakota workforce in nitrogen-driven bio-manufacturing. Exchange visits among the BNERC partners and industry engagement in the project has potential to enrich the education of the student participants. <br/><br/>Dinitrogen (N2) gas is ?2,000-fold more abundant than CO2 in Earth?s atmosphere.  However, the practical application of biologically converting N2 gas into bioavailable forms such as ammonia has been little exploited due to a historically ?chemo-nitrogen? economy based on hydrocarbons and the Haber-Bosch process.  To pioneer a green economy derived from sunlight, N2 and CO2, a transdisciplinary team of South Dakota researchers will leverage data science and establish the BioNitrogen Economy Research Center (BNERC) to build jurisdictional research capacity in biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and its practical applications.  As an agricultural state with a large Native American population, South Dakota is uniquely positioned to develop sustainable BNF research infrastructure by partnering academic institutions with industry to develop the workforce and promote economic growth in the region while increasing participation and representation of Native Americans in the state STEM enterprise. BNERC?s vision is to make South Dakota a national leader in use-inspired, machine learning-driven research in BNF.  This will be accomplished by incubating four research areas and developing a diverse BNF workforce. A critical research goal of the project is to obtain an ML-driven systematic understanding of genomics and mechanisms associated with oxic N2-fixation in cyanobacteria and enable application in sustainable agriculture and industries. BNERC envisions a transition from the current fossil fuel-based chemo-nitrogen economy to a greener economic system in which bioproducts (N-rich and C-rich) are produced mainly by N2-fixing cyanobacteria and/or genetically engineered crops. This transition will alleviate the environmental issues resulting from our hydrocarbon-based economy and reliance on synthetic N2-fixation to support agriculture.

Lipid mediators are involved in both starting and ending inflammation, and are important for the movement of immune cells in the body, both for the regulation of body temperature, and for the detection of pain.  By understanding how such mediators are produced, we might one day be able to guide the development of therapies which promote the resolution of inflammation.  In the course of pursuing these research goals, this project will uncover new knowledge to advance the field, develop techniques which can be adopted by any scientist interested in conducting lipid mediator research, and to  provide enriching and effective training and research experiences for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research aims to understand the molecular basis for NOD2-dependent lipid mediator production.  Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain-Containing Protein 2 (NOD2) is a receptor that responds to bacterial peptidoglycan to promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides important in mediating host defense.  While the intracellular signaling pathways downstream of NOD2 leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine production have been extensively studied, there is little known about the mechanisms underlying NOD2-dependent lipid mediator production.  Preliminary data in the investigator's laboratory demonstrates that agonism of NOD2 leads to the production of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolution lipid mediators.  Mechanistically, the investigator finds that Receptor-Interacting Serine/threonine Protein Kinase 2 (RIP2), the kinase downstream of NOD2, can promote the modification and activation of 5-lipoxygenase (5LO), an enzyme with well-known roles in lipid mediator production.  To verify the findings and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying NOD2-dependent lipid mediator production, the investigator proposes to:  (1) Determine whether endogenous stimulation of NOD2 also results in RIP2-dependent phosphorylation and activation of 5LO; (2) Determine the molecular features of RIP2 which are important for 5LO activity and for lipid mediator production, and; (3) Develop a Group Effort in Applied Research (GEAR) course designed to engage students and provide them with a quality Undergraduate Research Experience (URE).<br/><br/>This award is funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plant resistance responses against these pathogens are complex and governed by diverse classes of immunity receptors including wall-associated kinases (WAKs).  The PI?s ongoing research program aims to identify the signaling mechanism mediated by WAK genes using the barley-spot blotch model to broaden our understanding of its complex immune signaling components and its subsequent utilization in crop breeding programs as translational science.  Incorporating undergraduate participation in basic science components of the project focusing on female undergraduate students will be pivotal to building STEM workforce in the region and increasing institutional capacity on high-impact research and training.  These efforts are of paramount importance for South Dakota as the state?s female population is underrepresented in STEM careers.  The outreach activities on disease management on agricultural crops designed for female students at middle school will inspire young minds to the field of science through hands-on workshops.  The broader impact of these activities will be increased exposure to the effort of scientific communities in the SDSU and nation on plant research and inspire them to incline towards higher degrees in STEM education.<br/><br/>rcs5 (resistance to Cochliobolus sativus 5) spot blotch susceptibility locus in barley harbors two dominant susceptibility genes Sbs1 and Sbs2 belonging to the WAK protein class of immunity receptors.  WAKs have recently been identified as an immunity receptor in plants, and function both as susceptibility and resistance factors, yet their immune signaling components are largely unknown. The goal of the funded research is to identify the signaling mechanism mediated by WAK genes with specific objectives to:  1) Determine the physical interaction and subcellular localization of Sbs1 and Sbs2 proteins; 2) Determine the signaling pathway of Sbs1 and Sbs2 wall-associated kinases, and; 3) Broaden student awareness and participation in plant pathology research.  The research plans to attain the objectives include heterologous protein interaction, co-localization assays, and identification of novel interaction partners through yeast two-hybrid interaction screen for functional characterization using a carbon nanotube mediated transgene overexpression system.  This project will knit training components on the above-mentioned basic science experiments by providing training to undergraduate students and developing outreach workshops.  Findings from this project will be applied to achieve a broader application of deployment of genetic host resistance in crop plants such as wheat, corn, and barley.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, numerous scientific, engineering, and industry applications use these formats for storing and analyzing their data. With many critical fields using self-describing formats, these data as well as their corresponding data management software libraries have become critical cyberinfrastructure that must be secured to perform accurate and reproducible science. Unfortunately, existing data management software libraries were designed decades ago, before cybersecurity was a major concern, so there has never been a targeted testing and evaluation of the trustworthiness, integrity, and resilience of these libraries. This project is exploring strategies to integrate both well-known and advanced security algorithms into prominent data management libraries. The research performed in in this project will be a foundational step towards building next generation secure data management cyberinfrastructure for the rapidly changing landscape of science and AI, where security, privacy, and trustworthiness are critically required. <br/><br/>This project will apply comprehensive testing, evaluation, issue identification, hardening, and validation to correct security deficiencies in self-describing file formats and libraries. The specific R&D tasks include: (1) assessing and fixing file format vulnerabilities, (2) protecting data access libraries, (3) exploring security solutions for metadata and data, and (4) constructing a security framework, called S2-D2.

This Research Advanced by Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RAISE) award is made in response to Dear Colleague Letter 23-109, as part of the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative. Geological processes in the earth's crust create underground deposits of hydrogen gas, which could be a major untapped clean energy resource for the U.S. and the world. However, little is known about how this hydrogen is produced, how it migrates, and whether it accumulates in big enough deposits to be used for clean energy. Because hydrogen is a gas, it escapes the subsurface with ease and does not accumulate underground in the exact same way as water and petroleum, which are far better understood. It also reacts chemically with rocks, soil, and water, and it can be consumed or created by bacteria. The team will conduct a multi-pronged study to better understand subsurface hydrogen in Nebraska, at locations where geologic hydrogen has been found in the past. They will collect water, soil, and rock samples, perform laboratory tests on these materials, and do calculations to better understand how hydrogen moves through the subsurface; and how effectively it can be stored underground. The team will also use DNA testing to identify bacteria in subsurface materials; and will perform calculations based on physics, chemistry, and biology to see whether these bacteria promote or hinder hydrogen storage, and whether they cause hydrogen to be lost as it migrates underground. Outcomes from this project will help with discovery, assessment, and use of naturally occurring hydrogen in Nebraska and elsewhere in the world. Furthermore, a better understanding of fundamental processes along with preliminary evaluations of the natural H2 potential will be coupled with future field-based research and the development of large-scale hydrogen hub projects associated with the research team?s jurisdiction. In addition to the research, the proposed study will contribute to enhancing the education capacity at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln via several proposed activities.<br/><br/>The underlying central hypothesis of this project is that specific geomechanical and biogeochemical conditions exist limiting the loss and consumption of naturally generated H2, which in turn, can lead to geologically trapped H2 at an economically meaningful scale in the mid-continent subsurface. The overall objective of this study is to advance understanding of geological hydrogen (natural and engineered systems) in the midcontinent deep subsurface to understand both biological and abiotic processes that contribute to seepage, trapping, and production or loss. To achieve the overall objective, the scope of the research objectives is as follows: (1) Elucidate the transport and accumulation of natural hydrogen in soils and rocks via laboratory tests and field monitoring at the study site near the Midcontinent Rift (in Nebraska), (2) Identify geochemistry of the subsurface fluids and minerals that can support microbial life including hydrogenotrophs, living in the deep subsurface environment, and (3) Integrate two salient phenomena, hydrogen transport and abiotic/biotic reactions, to upscale the study via numerical modeling. In doing so, the project will yield understanding of the flow and interaction of geologic hydrogen with surroundings via the combined efforts of laboratory tests, numerical studies, and field monitoring, and thus will test the project?s central hypothesis. Eventually, this study will establish a strong foundation to make predictions about sources of natural H2, and thus achieve the long-term goal of producing natural H2 at economically viable scales from the Midcontinent Rift system in the USA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will fuel the dramatic growth of the state?s forest-based economy and the rural communities it supports. Four interconnected research themes in the project reflect strengths and opportunities within the jurisdiction that align with the state?s science and technology, climate action, and economic development strategic plans. The project also will leverage prior investments in Maine?s research infrastructure, including federal awards and philanthropic gifts, and relationships with national laboratories and industry. Novel participatory and inclusive approaches will nurture community resilience and strengthen the capacity of diverse groups of natural resource-dependent rural and Indigenous communities to respond to current and future socio-ecological threats and opportunities. This new, partnership-based infrastructure will help to create a far more inclusive approach to promoting sustainable improvements in Maine?s forest-based research infrastructure, R&D capacity, and national competitiveness. Innovative approaches to STEM education and workforce development will reinforce the research themes in the project while also connecting with project activities in a companion EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems RII award (OIA-2412130).<br/><br/>Maine-FOREST?s four convergent incubator themes include Environmental AI & Informatics, Cellulosic Nanofiber (CNF) Bioproducts, Rural & Tribal Resilience, and Smart Rural Development. Statewide incubator teams associated with each theme aim to close key knowledge gaps. Maine-FOREST will advance one's ability to characterize and utilize CNF within an advanced manufacturing context. New AI/ML-driven technologies will be applied to assess core ecosystem attributes across broad spatial-temporal scales. Innovative, culturally inclusive approaches will be applied to participatory systems dynamics modeling to better leverage stakeholder networks. Research on the program?s collaborative culture and processes, including a cohort-based approach to student engagement, will yield new information regarding convergent science. Deliverables from Maine-FOREST include, in addition to typical scientific outputs, increased research capacity with support for 20 early-career faculty, a new forest sector business development faculty position, and an actionable dashboard of metrics related to forest, economy, and workforce capacity.

This project seeks to serve the national interest by describing the prevalence of humanized content in undergraduate biology contexts and measuring the impact of humanized content on student outcomes including content knowledge and intent to persist in science. This project will provide evidence to educators about how and when to incorporate humanized content most effectively, a potentially crucial aspect to increasing persistence in undergraduate science.<br/><br/>Humanized content will be used to integrate the science and society core competency into biology courses. Humanizing content allows students to view science in a social context and grapple with real-world problems of social justice within the field of biology. The central objectives of this study are to: Aim 1. assess the extent to which humanized content is prioritized by national societies, education initiatives, and national assessments; Aim 2. describe the extent to which biology instructors humanize content when covering topics related to the environment and genetics; and Aim 3. assess the impact of humanized content on undergraduate learning and motivation-related affective outcomes. This study is guided by culturally relevant pedagogy to develop humanized content and expectancy violations theory to understand the impact of humanization on undergraduate biology students' learning and affective gains. The investigator will assess the presence (or lack) of humanized content in national standards (Aim 1) and a national sample of course materials from introductory biology courses (Aim 2) to illustrate the current prioritization and implementation of humanized content. Through two randomized controlled trials (Aim 3), the project will experimentally manipulate whether students receive humanized content or not and measure learning and affective outcomes such as intent to persist in science and engagement-related emotions.

Quantifying the causal effect of a variable on another one is of fundamental importance in science because it allows for the understanding of what happens if a certain action is taken, e.g., if a drug is prescribed to a patient. When randomized experiments are not feasible, e.g., because of costs or ethical concerns, quantifying the effect of a treatment on an outcome can be very challenging. Roughly, this is because the analysis must ensure that the treated and untreated units are ?comparable,? a condition implied by proper randomization. In these settings, the analyst typically proceeds in two steps: 1) they introduce the key assumptions needed to identify the causal effect, and 2) they specify a model for the distribution of the data, often nonparametric, to accommodate modern, complex datasets, as well as the appropriate estimation strategy. One key difficulty in non-randomized studies is that estimating causal effects typically requires estimating nuisance components of the data distribution that are not of direct interest and that can be potentially quite hard to estimate. Focused on the second part of the analysis, this project aims to design optimal methods for estimating causal effects in different settings. Informally, an optimal estimator converges to the true causal effect ?as quickly as possible? as a function of the sample size and thus leads to the most precise inferences. Establishing optimality has thus two fundamental benefits: 1) it leads to procedures that make the most efficient use of the available data, and 2) it serves as a benchmark against which future methods can be evaluated. In this respect, the theoretical and methodological contributions of this project are expected to lead to substantial improvements in the analysis of data from many domains, such as medicine and the social sciences. The project also aims to offer opportunities for training and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>For certain estimands and data structures, the principles of semiparametric efficiency theory can be used to derive optimal estimators. However, they are not directly applicable to causal parameters that are ?non-smooth? or for which the nuisance parts of the data distribution can only be estimated at such slow rates that root-n convergence of the causal effect estimator is not attainable. As part of this project, the Principal Investigator aims to study the optimal estimation of prominent examples of non-smooth parameters, such as causal effects defined by continuous treatments. Furthermore, this project will consider optimal estimation of ?smooth? parameters, such as certain average causal effects, in newer nonparametric models for which relatively fast rates of convergence are possible, even if certain components of the data distribution can only be estimated at very slow rates. In doing so, the project aims to propose new techniques for reducing the detrimental effect of the nuisance estimators? bias on the quality of the causal effect estimator. It also aims to design and implement inferential procedures for the challenging settings considered, thereby enhancing the adoption of the methods proposed in practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The combining of new biotechnological and bioanalytical approaches will lead to the creation of these novel bioanalytical systems. The interest of the proposed study is enhanced by the possibility of its simple and easily exchangeable adaptation to numerous amino acids as human health biomarkers. The primary project focus is on the diagnostics of Maple Syrup Urine Disease, a rare and severe genetic disorder impacting the processing of branched-chain amino acids including leucine. The early detection and continuous monitoring of leucine levels in the bloodstream are crucial for a timely diagnosis of such disorders in infants and young children. Thus, the project has not only scientific but also high practical importance, providing a new easy-to-use point-of-care biosensor system for end-users. The educational project?s impacts include the participation of undergraduate researchers as well as PhD students. Special attention is given to the recruitment of junior researchers at all levels, including those from underrepresented groups and war-affected countries. The mentoring by experts in the field will stimulate student achievement recognized via media coverage and high-level student-coauthored publications. The involvement in this multidisciplinary project will ignite interest in science improving the student?s education, and experience resulting in increasing chances for their successful professional career growth in the future.<br/><br/>The present proposal aims to develop a new biotechnological/bioanalytical platform based on unique genetic-engineered chimera enzymes for biosensor use. The chimeric enzymes will be constructed by fusing ultraselective enzymes to specific amino acids ? aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (RSs) with pyrroloquinoline-quinone glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) as a reporter. The fused chimera enzymes will be characterized by a high selectivity toward the target amino acid and, simultaneously, by an ability to efficiently direct electron transfer to the physical transducer. The proposed platform is quite universal, as it is easy to modify the sensor's amino acid specificity by changing the specific RS domain of the fused chimera enzyme. To simplify the purification of the split parts of the chimera enzyme, the His6-tag will be integrated into the domains? structure. Moreover, modifying the chimera by His6-tag makes it possible to control the immobilization of the fused chimeric enzyme on the surface of the physical transducer. The use of His6-tag affinity materials/chemicals (e.g., copper-formed nanoparticles or pyrene-NTA) will provide an appropriate orientation of the PQQ-GDH-consisting domains in a well-organized self-assembled layer close to the electrode surface. Such an approach ensures an efficient direct electron transfer from the PQQH2 reduced active center resulting in an increase in the signal amplification factor. Also, the controlled orientation will prevent the chimeric enzyme inhibition during its conformational changes in the immobilized state. The specific output from the immobilized chimeric enzymes will be analyzed by electrochemical and optical readouts (using a PQQ-specific fluorescent probe and a smartphone camera).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current brain-machine interfaces, however, are severely limited by power consumption, data acquisition capabilities, and real-time processing constraints. These limitations in turn limit our ability to study brain function and develop treatments for neurological disorders. The NeuroFlex project aims to address these challenges by creating a powerful yet energy-efficient neural interface platform. By combining innovative memory devices optimized for efficient data storage, programmable circuits for high-density neural signal acquisition, and specialized processors for low-power computation, this research could revolutionize our understanding of the brain. The insights gained from this advanced neural interface technology have the potential to unlock new therapies for conditions like epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological disorders that affect millions worldwide. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of this project, spanning device engineering, circuit design, and tensor accelerators, will advance these fields and inspire new avenues of research. The project will also develop new tools and educational initiatives. The researchers will organize a workshop on computing with emerging technologies, develop curriculum modules on system-on-chip design, and engage K-12 students through outreach activities aimed at encouraging participation in STEM fields, with a focus on underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The NeuroFlex project will develop an implantable neural interface platform that integrates three key innovations: 1) optimized resistive RAM memory for efficient data storage, 2) programmable analog front-end circuits for high-density neural signal acquisition, and 3) specialized processors for energy-efficient computation of both dense and sparse neural network operations.

Still, the land and the stream are often studied in isolation, which can lead to fundamental misunderstandings of how changes in one system impact one or both systems. Globally, salinization is a current major change in both terrestrial soil and freshwater systems. Salinization can change water quality and drinking water suitability, carbon storage and quality, and plant productivity. Freshwater salinization often begins through terrestrial salinization from human activities like urbanization, agricultural practices, and road salting. Yet, predicting how salinization alters carbon inputs across riparian-stream boundaries is not yet possible. This research will quantify how salinization, which can both subsidize and stress organisms, alters carbon processing across terrestrial-aquatic boundaries, through field work and experiments. The project will also examine the relationship between terrestrial and aquatic salinity in part from the collaborations of crowd-sourced k-12 teacher data. This project will also support three female PIs, mentorship of three graduate and four undergraduate students, support three REU students, and incorporate public participation and awareness through citizen science.<br/><br/>This research will identify fundamental principles about how aquatic and terrestrial systems will respond to increased salinization. This project will quantify how sodium chloride inputs to riparian zones and streams interact to alter decomposition, secondary production, gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem production in both terrestrial riparian and aquatic stream ecosystems using experimentally paired riparian-stream mesocosms and a field decomposition study across a sodium gradient. The responses are expected to follow a subsidy-stress model. Sodium chloride (NaCl) should act as a subsidy and increase these processes up to some optimal threshold because Na is a biologically essential nutrient. After which, these processes should decrease as Na becomes a stressor at sub-lethal levels and a toxicant at higher levels. The primary objectives are to 1) measure and quantify field terrestrial-stream relationships using a decomposition study that concurrently measures soil and stream chemistry across a large salinization gradient (electrical conductance ranging from 30-1200 micro Siemens per centimeter), 2) experimentally determine how soil salinization impacts terrestrial-aquatic carbon exchange across a gradient of salinization in novel paired terrestrial riparian-stream mesocosms, and 3) quantify the field-mesocosm relationship to determine the congruence of experimental mesocosm- and field-measured decomposition rates across a salinity gradient. Using a combined terrestrial-aquatic approach is essential to understanding, predicting, and ultimately mitigating negative salinization impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem structure and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nucleons are not elementary particles but rather complicated bound states of quarks and gluons (collectively denoted as partons), whose interaction is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  The parton structure of the nucleon is encoded in different parton distributions and quark-gluon correlations.  Both parton distributions and quark-gluon correlations can, in principle, be studied through high-energy (hard) scattering processes at particle accelerators, including the future Electron-Ion Collider in the USA.  However, for quark-gluon correlations this is very difficult, and therefore these quantities are presently largely unexplored.  The first goal of the project is to develop and apply an improved theoretical framework for extracting the nucleon transversity, one of the least explored parton distributions, from data on high-energy processes.  Along with that goes a state-of-the-art extraction of the tensor charge, one of the fundamental properties of the nucleon.  The second goal is to develop a formalism which allows for the calculation of quark-gluon correlations numerically in QCD, thus circumventing the lack of information from experiment.  The project integrates research and teaching of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as educational outreach.<br/><br/>The work on the transversity parton distributions and the tensor charge extends our previous studies in this area.  A special focus is on enhancing the QCD formalism for the analysis of data on di-hadron production by computing next-to-leading-order perturbative corrections.  This framework then serves as a key ingredient of a novel extraction of the transversity and tensor charge of the nucleon, which uses all pertinent data on di-hadron (and single-hadron) production.  A major goal of this study is the comparison of the nucleon tensor charge based on experimental data with benchmark results obtained from first-principles calculations in lattice-QCD.  The study of the quark-gluon correlations exploits a new class of Euclidean parton correlators that can be computed in lattice-QCD.  While these correlators do not directly provide the QCGs of interest, the two types of quantities can be related through calculations in perturbative QCD.  Developing the required formalism, which presently is in its infancies, is a key objective of the project.  Close interaction is foreseen with researchers performing numerical calculations in lattice-QCD, to ensure that the new theoretical framework can be readily put into practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This affects how bacteria evolve, their roles in the ecosystem, and their interactions with humans and other organisms. The most readily transferable genes come from plasmid DNA, which replicates separately from the bacterial genome and is therefore more portable. Current understanding of how bacteria actively take up plasmids, a process called plasmid natural transformation (PNT), is limited. This project will investigate plasmid natural transformation in the bacterium Vibrio natriegens, the fastest growing microbe known and a promising model for synthetic biology, and help establish that organism as a model system for such studies. The research will examine whether plasmids with particular sequences or genes transfer more efficiently. This will illuminate how plasmids spread in the natural world and how they could be adapted for bioengineering purposes. Work will be carried out exclusively by undergraduate students, supporting their scientific development. To build the many necessary test plasmids, the investigator?s group will use and develop their ?CloneCoordinate? software platform. This tracks and manages the many steps of DNA construction so they can be done collectively and at scale by participants with varying experience levels. CloneCoordinate will be shared broadly as an open-source resource to promote DNA building across diverse settings.<br/><br/>PNT is unique among horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanisms in that it operates on naked DNA, is conducted by the recipient cell, and is not constrained by genome homology. Because the mechanism of plasmid establishment remains uncertain, PNT?s plasmid and organismal scope are not known and its potentially important contributions to overall HGT must be clarified. This work will investigate the effects on PNT efficiency of plasmid sequence parameters such as size, genetic cargo, origin of replication, and presence of single-strand origin sequences that may promote double-stranded DNA synthesis during establishment. Systematic study of PNT has been inhibited by the difficulty of preparing plasmid multimers and the limited plasmid repertoire for well-characterized Gram positive model organisms. The research will establish quantitatively reproducible and convenient procedures for measuring PNT efficiency using the tractable, Gram negative V. natriegens, using multimers generated through in vitro rolling circle amplification. It will support leveraging of PNT for in vivo library generation and directed evolution of highly transformable plasmids through serial passage through PNT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Future engineers will need to tackle energy and climate issues in a wide range of sectors as nations work towards decarbonization. College students show their interest in addressing climate issues, but most undergraduates, even engineering students, have never engaged with real-life power-producing systems. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to investigate the longitudinal learning and development of undergraduate engineering students as they work in long term research experiences on six different research areas centered on decarbonization. Each of the individual projects answers fundamental issues associated with net-zero fuels and seamlessly integrates in the context of combined heat and power (CHP) decarbonization. In addition, undergraduate students will be both researchers and participants in educational research and be studied over five years as they engage in long-term situated work environments. The Broader Impacts of this proposal relate to both decarbonization technologies and the development of an energy-literate future engineering workforce along three major themes: broadening participation; curricular reform; and integration of research, industry, and campus operations.<br/><br/>In this project, rigorous research focuses on both the technical engineering decarbonization research thrusts as well as the education components. The two convergent research questions this project addresses are: How do we overcome key challenges in the implementation of renewable natural gas (RNG) in district CHP systems to achieve potentially negative carbon emissions? How do engineering undergraduate students co-develop energy literacy and domain-specific engineering identity in highly situated learning environments over time? This project uniquely leverages university infrastructure for undergraduate students to co-develop energy literacy and domain-specific engineering identities that will aid in their retention into the future workforce. Undergraduate students will conduct long-term, embedded, fundamental research related to CHP decarbonization in six areas: (1) capture and filtration of RNG from agricultural sources; (2) capture and filtration of RNG from water treatment; (3) impact of RNG composition on flame stability in gas turbines; (4) impact of RNG on turbine efficiency; (5) impact of RNG on turbine cooling; and (6) trigeneration for CHP efficiency improvements. The educational research plan proposes longitudinal phenomenological multiple-case study methods, employing multiple quantitative and qualitative methods throughout the five years of the grant. This novel integrated approach addresses both the technology as well as the human capital sides of decarbonization. The Intellectual Merit of the decarbonization research lies in the integrated approach of using life cycle analysis (LCA) to drive component-specific research directions, maximizing the impact on decarbonization. Each of the individual projects answer fundamental issues associated with net-zero fuels and seamlessly integrate in the context of CHP decarbonization. The Intellectual Merit of the educational research is a transformation of overarching theories of academic literacy and engineering identity development to be domain-specific with attention to highly situated learning environments, yielding impactful advances in theory and understanding of the formation of energy-literate engineers. By turning attention toward the deeply situated learning processes of these scholars, the field will gain a transformative understanding of the disciplinary aspects of both energy literacy and of domain-specific identity development. This novel approach to using university infrastructure as an educational environment may be extended to other universities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rotational spectroscopy, when applied to small molecular clusters, provides molecular-level detail about molecular structure and dynamics. However, high resolution spectroscopic studies of proton transfer in small molecular clusters remain largely hindered by the requirement of microsolvent molecules to stabilize the resulting charge separation. Professor Leopold and his students will use superacids to effectively increase the available range of acidities and thus drive proton transfer in clusters that are small enough to study by high resolution Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. Their studies could provide a better understanding of the interactions that enable chemical reactions in small clusters and could deepen our understanding of solvation, which critically influences thermodynamics and reactivity in solution. This work will have broader impact through the training of students, its potential implications for atmospheric chemistry, climate research, and its exemplification of the value of fundamental research through public outreach.<br/><br/>By varying cluster size, as well as the acidity and basicity of the interacting moieties, this work will explore the factors that allow (or disallow) proton transfer in small, jet-cooled acid-base adducts. By using superacids to minimize the microsolvation requirements for proton transfer, the full spectrum of interactions between hydrogen bonding and ion pair formation can be realized within a cluster size range amenable to rotational spectroscopy. Experiments will employ both the older, cavity-style microwave technique of Flygare as well as the newer chirped-pulse method of Pate. The determination of rotational constants, nuclear quadrupole coupling constants, tunneling energies, and internal rotation barriers will provide detailed information about the interactions within the clusters studied. High level computational methods will play a strong supporting role, as they aid in identification of carrier of an observed spectrum and, moreover, provide information such as binding energies and potential surface topology, which cannot be directly determined in these experiments. Thus, theory and experiment are used synergistically to elicit a deeper understanding than either could provide independently.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Until 2003, all hadrons appeared as compounds of a quark and an antiparticle quark (mesons) or three-quark compounds (baryons, like protons and neutrons).  Since then, scores of ""exotic"" 4-quark or 5-quark hadrons have been discovered, but no simple picture has yet been developed that describes how they are assembled.  This project continues the development of a promising universal model of exotic hadrons, the dynamical diquark model (DDM), which has successfully described a number of exotic hadrons as compounds in which the components themselves are bound two-quark subunits (diquarks). Recent work on this model has been to combine the diquark compounds with effects caused by the presence of two-meson components with which they can mix (the DDM diabatic extension). In this project the PI and his students will develop diabatic techniques for precise predictions of measurable properties for the full spectrum of exotic hadrons, including predictions of yet-unseen exotics.<br/><br/>This project addresses three major scientific lines of inquiry and one of intense public interest: First, the project will build on prior work to describe the exotics sector using the diabatic dynamical diquark mode (DDM)l.  Second, the PI will mentor a PhD student on including effects from two-meson states mixing that depend upon those states' spin quantum numbers, thus creating the most advanced model of exotics to date.  Third, the PI will apply the diabatic DDM to study open-heavy-flavor exotics such as the recently observed doubly-charmed T_cc meson that contains two charm -- and no anti-charm -- quarks.  In addition, this project will help address a critical shortage of high-school physics teachers in Arizona by leveraging the establishment of Arizona State University's first-in-the-nation online Bachelor of Science in Physics degree program. Under the PI's guidance an established Arizona high-school science teacher will have the opportunity to gains the skills necessary for physics teaching certification in Arizona.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compared to steel and non-ferrous alloys, ductile iron castings are inexpensive to manufacture, and are easily recycled. Ductile iron castings are commonly found in automotive, agriculture, mining, municipal water/sewerage, defense, and other industries. However, defects such as porosity can form in ductile iron castings when the processing conditions are not optimal. This research is aimed at understanding the complex nature of porosity formation in ductile iron castings by studying the effects of graphite formation and casting wall movement via simulation and experiment. The knowledge gained from this work leads to empirical models that can be applied to make sound, defect-free ductile iron castings. The research outcomes are advanced process control, improved casting quality, and reduced scrap resulting in energy and material savings and economic benefits for the U.S. foundry industry. This research involves several disciplines including metallurgy, materials science, and manufacturing. The multi-disciplinary approach helps broaden participation of women and underrepresented students in research and positively impacts engineering education.<br/><br/>Liquid metal shrinks as it solidifies in a casting mold causing shrinkage porosities in the last-to-freeze regions of the casting. Metal casting foundries try to minimize porosity formation in ductile iron castings through better mold cavity and riser design and alloy chemistry modification. However, excessive casting wall movement due to graphite precipitation and inadequate mold strength during solidification as the root cause of porosity is often overlooked. This research aims to corelate porosity formation in ductile iron castings to graphitization and casting wall movement via experiment and simulation. For the experiments, graphitization is controlled by different inoculation treatments, and casting wall movement is varied with molds of different strengths. This research plans to develop a novel experimental apparatus for in-situ multi-axis measurement of casting wall movement during ductile iron solidification and cooling using high-accuracy displacement sensors. Coupling displacement data and cooling curves acquired with thermocouples, the technique provides insights into the thermo-mechanical behavior of the solidifying casting. Size distribution of graphite and porosity in the final castings are statistically characterized with X-ray radiography and automated scanning electron microscopy. Empirical models that correlate porosity formation and casting distortion with graphitization and casting wall movement are developed via numerical simulation using commercially available metal casting simulation software. This fundamental research is generalizable and could be applied to understand porosity formation in other cast engineering alloys such as steel, aluminum, copper, and titanium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Parallel educational efforts will focus on professional development to benefit graduate and undergraduate students as well as high school and elementary school students in USC?s neighborhood community, which has a high population of historically underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the investigation of structures and structural dynamics at the atomic and molecular levels. However, because of intrinsically low sensitivity, NMR often requires samples of relatively large volume.  By exploiting the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, NMR sensitivity can be improved dramatically, down to the level of a single spin. NV-Detected NMR spectroscopy at high magnetic fields can provide significant advantages in investigations that benefit from fine spectral resolution, high signal sensitivity, and detection of nuclear spins with small gyromagnetic ratios. Under this award, the Takahashi group will use high-field NV-NMR to probe surface chemistry and nanoscale spin dynamics.  If successful, this approach will provide a new way for analytical chemists to enhance sensitivity in NMR experiments, with potential broad long term scientific impacts on focused molecular experiments and on magnetic resonance imaging methods, as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the vast majority are not associated with disease, roughly 300 fungal species are known as human pathogens, and an even greater number are plant pathogens. In both cases, such pathogens pose major risks to human health via morbidity and mortality, and potentially devastating effects on agriculture, including both livestock and crops. While several models have developed for human fungal pathogens, important  understanding of the fundamental biology and mechanisms of pathogenesis have come from plant pathogenic models, especially the group known as ?smuts,? which can serve as a model for study of 1) nerve development; 2) DNA repair mechanisms similar to those of the BRCA2 human gene, strongly associated with risk for breast and ovarian cancers (absent from traditional yeast models); 3) mitochondrial dysfunction; and 4) evolution of disease mechanisms, with potential to predict emerging infectious disease via host shifts. This last point is the focus of the funded research project and explores genetic differences in plants and their responses to different fungal pathogens. The work has broad implications for society, especially by providing a better understanding of why some plants are more susceptible to severe infections, while others are better able to fight off the same pathogens while displaying no or milder symptoms. Moreover, this project will expand the pool of trained scientists at all levels (undergraduate, graduate student, Postdoctoral), thereby providing the next generation(s) of individuals prepared to address new threats to human health and agricultural security.<br/><br/>The smut fungi are a large, diverse, and non-monophyletic group of plant pathogens. Among these are fungi with agricultural importance, and whose prominence has expanded due to (1) their facility of manipulation and extensive molecular genetic toolkits, or (2) their economic and international diplomatic impacts. By contrast, the Microbotryum violaceum complex of fungal plant pathogens continues to be important in ecological/population genetics/evolutionary studies and, more recently, has become a useful model of emerging infectious diseases through host shifts. Each fungal species in this complex of ?anther smuts? is limited to successful infection of one or a limited number of host species in the Caryophyllaceae (Pinks). However, some Microbotryum species (e.g., on Dianthus hosts or Lychnis hosts) are more ?Generalists,? having a broader range of host plant species. In this project, comparison is made between infections of host plants by specialist Microbotryum species on preferred vs. non-hosts; similar comparisons will be made with generalist Microbotryum infections on different host plants as well. Data will be collected throughout the lifecycle of the fungus/plant interaction via microscopy (Confocal fluorescence, SEM), proteomics of fungal/host protein complexes, transcriptomics, and analysis of RNA editing of fungal transcripts. Cases of blocked infection may suggest a switch to enodphytism, particularly when presence of the fungus has been confirmed in stem and flower bud stages. In such cases, co-infection of plants with better-adapted pathogenic Microbotryum species and ?endophytic? Microbotryum species in the same host will test whether any protection to the host is provided by the endophyte.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite moving within the proton at nearly the speed of light, quarks are confined to the microscopic interior of the proton by the strong force, the most powerful of the four known fundamental interactions in nature, as described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A key challenge in modern nuclear physics is to provide a quantitative understanding of hadron properties through the internal dynamics of quarks within the framework of QCD. The research supported by this project seeks to establish the foundations for describing the structure of hadrons theoretically. The outcomes of this research project will advance knowledge of hadron structure theory and will provide theoretical support for ongoing science programs at state-of-the-art experimental facilities, as well as for future projects such as the future Electron-Ion Collider at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The broader impacts of this project include the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Additionally, it supports a summer bridge program providing research opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the physics department at the University of Connecticut.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to advance the current understanding of the nonperturbative properties of hadrons in QCD, as described in terms of form factors, parton distribution functions, generalized parton distributions, transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions, and transverse momentum dependent generalized parton distributions. The latter provide an attractive overarching umbrella concept that unifies all the aforementioned hadron properties. These functions serve as powerful tools for describing high-energy processes within QCD factorization frameworks and provide access to a multitude of previously unexplored nucleon properties, such as proton mass and spin decompositions, as well as distributions of energy, internal forces, and orbital angular momentum within the proton. The theoretical research supported by this project focuses on investigating the nonperturbative properties of these functions, including studies of polarized helicity sea quark distribution functions, exploration of chiral symmetry breaking effects in nucleon structure, and analyses of generalized transverse momentum dependent distribution functions within effective field theoretic approaches. The methods employed in this project encompass phenomenological studies, investigations in effective theories and QCD-inspired models. Additionally, the formulation of quasi parton distributions is explored to provide complementary insights and support ongoing lattice QCD studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Little is known about how wetlands function, especially in the tropics. With changing climate, it is expected that tropical wetlands, especially seasonal ones, may shift between carbon consumption and release of carbon. Methane, which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, is typically produced under flooded conditions, although some evidence suggests that shifts between wet and dry conditions also lead to its release. Savannas (Cerrado) in Brazil have a range of grassland types including ever-wet peatlands, seasonally wet grasslands, and dry grasslands that are never flooded, with the seasonal wetlands shifting in water levels between dry and wet seasons. It is expected that these ecosystems will become hotter and drier in the future. Brazilian savannas have been understudied and under protected; they are also at risk of conversion for example to agribusiness and urban development. They are the source of the headwaters for river systems such as the Amazon, meaning they are important for providing clean water and other resources to the people and other organisms dependent on them. Understanding Brazilian savanna carbon dynamics now and under future environmental conditions is critical for the region. They can also be used as models to understand tropical savannas around the globe. This proposal makes use of the natural gradient, from ever-wet peatlands to dry grasslands, and seasonal shifts through time to collect data on the amount and frequency of greenhouse gases emitted today and the changing extents of wetlands seasonally. Researchers will use these data to predict how savannas may store and release carbon under future warming and drying climates. As part of this project, student biologists will be trained, including in classes on savanna field ecology and workshops on using field data to predict changes in greenhouse gas release in the future. Biologists and indigenous artists will also collaborate on artwork to demonstrate the importance of savanna systems for and to public audiences. <br/><br/>This proposal will answer three questions: Q1. What are the drivers of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in carbon storage and flux across saturation gradients? Q2. How do saturation extents (areas and perimeters) in tropical grasslands change over seasonal and decadal scales? Q3. How will rates and forms of carbon emissions from tropical grasslands change under future climates? To test Q1, spatially distributed measurements will be coupled with high-temporal resolution measurements to understand greenhouse gas, soil, and vegetation carbon dynamics across the saturation gradient. Greenhouse gas variability will be measured spatially and temporally with chambers. Site changes through time will be determined by initial soil characterization, combined with seasonal measurements of plant phenology, stomatal conductance, porewater chemistry, environmental and groundwater measures. To test Q2, high resolution remote sensing and field reference data will be combined to map wetland extent seasonally. Carbon and lead isotope dating will be used to understand wetlands extent changes at decadal scales. To test Q3, data from Q1 and Q2 will be utilized in Earth system models. Estimates of carbon sequestration patterns and greenhouse gas emissions will be spatially simulated with projections of carbon balance changes and greenhouse gas with expected shifts in regional climate and hydrology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In biology, for instance, the shapes of biological components are pivotal in understanding patterns of normal behavior and growth; a notable example is protein shape, which contributes to our understanding of protein function and classification. This project, led by a team of investigators from the USA and the UK, will develop ways of modeling how biological and other shapes change with time, using formal statistical frameworks that capture not only the changes themselves, but how these changes vary across objects and populations. This will enable the study of the link between form and function in all its variability. As example applications, the project will develop models for changes in cell morphology and topology during motility and division, and changes in human posture during various activities, facilitating the exploration of scientific questions such as how and why cell division fails, or how to improve human postures in factory tasks. These are proofs of concept, but the methods themselves will have much wider applicability. This project will thus not only progress the science of shape analysis and the specific applications studied; it will have broader downstream impacts on a range of scientific application domains, providing practitioners with general and useful tools.<br/> <br/>While there are several approaches for representing and analyzing static shapes, encompassing curves, surfaces, and complex structures like trees and shape graphs, the statistical modeling and analysis of dynamic shapes has received limited attention. Mathematically, shapes are elements of quotient spaces of nonlinear manifolds, and shape changes can be modeled as stochastic processes, termed shape processes, on these complex spaces. The primary challenges lie in adapting classical modeling concepts to the nonlinear geometry of shape spaces and in developing efficient statistical tools for computation and inference in such very high-dimensional, nonlinear settings. The project consists of three thrust areas, dealing with combinations of discrete and continuous time, and discrete and continuous representations of shape, with a particular emphasis on the issues raised by topology changes. The key idea is to integrate spatiotemporal registration of objects and their evolution into the statistical formulation, rather than treating them as pre-processing steps. This project will specifically add to the current state-of-the-art in topic areas such as stochastic differential equations on shape manifolds, time series models for shapes, shape-based functional data analysis, and modeling and inference on infinite-dimensional shape spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new concepts, methodology, and tool sets developed in this research will not only create new knowledge in fundamental mechanics, but also will bring broad technical revolutions to leverage the fast advancements of mechanical metamaterials, additive manufacturing, and material science. The potential applications for new FMMs include protective materials, energy materials, soft robotics, actuators, dampers, adhesives, seismic engineering, and biomedical engineering.

The education and outreach activities will focus on attracting and retaining students from underrepresented groups by promoting new design concepts for achieving unusual material properties and behaviors based off traditional mechanical engineering topics.<br/><br/>This project will make fundamental contributions to the mechanics of materials and structures in theoretical, experimental, and numerical aspects by bridging the frontiers of the fields of mechanics, materials, mechanical metamaterials, and advanced additive manufacturing at both macro- and micro/nano- scales. For conventional materials, resilience and hysteresis often conflict with each other. The FMMs provide a platform to achieve both properties simultaneously. To amplify energy dissipation efficiency, auxeticity is utilized to promote internal friction in multiple directions, and chirality is employed to generate coupled sliding and rotational friction. Under the general goal, three specific objectives are planned: Objective I: To advance fundamental mechanics of friction under complicated conditions; Objective II: To explore mechanical behaviors of various engaging key-channel pairs; Objective III: To generate internal friction in multiple directions via auxeticity.

The continuous problem is well-posed. The numerical schemes are well-posed, parameter-robust, and convergent. It is even possible to prove convergence rates. However, the situation is more precarious for modern, complex systems of equations. Oftentimes, the uniqueness of solutions is not known. Even when there is uniqueness, the theory is far from complete, and so besides (weak) convergence of numerical solutions, little can be said about their behavior. In these scenarios, one must settle for simpler yet still relevant goals. An important goal in this front is that of structure preservation. The study of structure preservation in numerical methods is not new. Geometric numerical integration, many methods for electromagnetism, the finite element exterior calculus, and some novel approaches to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, have this goal in mind: geometric, algebraic, or differential constraints must be preserved. This project does not focus on the problems mentioned above. Instead, it studies structure preservation in some evolution problems that have, possibly degenerate, diffusive behavior. This class of problems remains a largely unexplored topic when it comes to numerical discretizations. Bridging this gap will enhance modeling and prediction capabilities since diffusive models can be found in every aspect of scientific inquiry.<br/><br/>This project is focused on a class of diffusive problems in which stability of the solution cannot be obtained by standard energy arguments, in other words, by testing the equation with the solution to assert that certain space-time norms are under control. Norms are always convex. Structure preservation may then be a generalization of the approach given above. Instead of norms being under control, a (family of) convex functional(s) evaluated at the solution behave predictably during the evolution. The project aims to develop numerical schemes that mimic this in the discrete setting. While this is a largely unexplored topic, at the same time, many of the problems under consideration can be used to describe a wide range of phenomena. In particular, the project will develop new numerical schemes for an emerging theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, active scalar equations, and a class of problems in hyperbolic geometry. These models have a very rich intrinsic structure and a wide range of applications, and the developments of this project will serve as a stepping stone to bring these tools to the numerical treatment of more general problems.

Predicting the flow of carbon, water, and energy between plants and the atmosphere (i.e., ecosystem functioning) requires describing leaf traits and how leaves are arranged within a canopy. Leaves are not isolated units on a canopy, but rather, they interact with thousands of other leaves. Much of that interaction, and therefore ecosystem functioning, is determined by the position and orientation of leaves within the canopy. This project will leverage a new technology to map canopy details in three dimensions in forests in the eastern United States. The mapping effort will provide the position and orientation (angle relative to the horizontal plane) of every leaf in a canopy. The work will reveal how plant traits influence tree growth and resource use, deepening our understanding of how forest trees compete for water and light. The broader impacts of this project include creating virtual reality forests for eight National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites. The use of virtual reality will provide an accessible and equitable experience for people who cannot visit forests in person. Researchers will work with collaborators at local schools to include these virtual forest galleries in their programs. The project will also support new class modules for field remote sensing courses at the University of Virginia.<br/><br/>The research bridges the leaf and ecosystem scales, thus bringing the whole canopy perspective to studies of functional traits. The overarching question this project seeks to answer is: To what extent do canopy structural traits and leaf traits converge at the ecosystem scale? With new technology and algorithm development, this project will bring novel insight into the role of canopy structure metrics in the functional trait spectrum. These metrics include the statistical distribution of leaf angles, leaf area, and leaf clumping. Researchers will focus on eight forest NEON sites in the eastern United States. They will investigate the relationship between canopy structural metrics and leaf traits estimated by the trait maps generated from imaging spectroscopy data. Researchers will map canopy structural traits (leaf angle and clumping) using algorithms calibrated by co-located NEON Airborne Observation Platform canopy reflectance and Terrestrial Lidar Scanning data. The second part of this project focuses on three sites to assess the extent to which canopy structural traits optimize canopy photosynthesis. Testing the extent of optimization of canopy structural traits along the vertical gradient will shed light on how plants optimize (or not) photosynthesis, given the constraint of water and competition for light. Canopy structural trait maps and the vertical trait data set generated will provide durable benefits to the scientific community. In addition, valuable canopy structural information will be extracted from the Terrestrial Lidar Scanning data, such as branching patterns and biomass, providing essential datasets for forest ecologists.

Maine-FOREST will deliver a diverse, sustainable, and statewide research, education, and innovation incubator that builds strategic research and development (R&D) capacity. This will fuel the dramatic growth of the state?s forest-based economy and the rural communities it supports. Four interconnected research themes in the project reflect strengths and opportunities within the jurisdiction that align with the state?s science and technology, climate action, and economic development strategic plans. The project also will leverage prior investments in Maine?s research infrastructure, including federal awards and philanthropic gifts, and relationships with national laboratories and industry. Novel participatory and inclusive approaches will nurture community resilience and strengthen the capacity of diverse groups of natural resource-dependent rural and Indigenous communities to respond to current and future socio-ecological threats and opportunities. This new, partnership-based infrastructure will help to create a far more inclusive approach to promoting sustainable improvements in Maine?s forest-based research infrastructure, R&D capacity, and national competitiveness. Innovative approaches to STEM education and workforce development will reinforce the research themes in the project while also connecting with project activities in a companion EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems RII award (OIA-2412130).<br/><br/>Maine-FOREST?s four convergent incubator themes include Environmental AI & Informatics, Cellulosic Nanofiber (CNF) Bioproducts, Rural & Tribal Resilience, and Smart Rural Development. Statewide incubator teams associated with each theme aim to close key knowledge gaps. Maine-FOREST will advance one's ability to characterize and utilize CNF within an advanced manufacturing context. New AI/ML-driven technologies will be applied to assess core ecosystem attributes across broad spatial-temporal scales. Innovative, culturally inclusive approaches will be applied to participatory systems dynamics modeling to better leverage stakeholder networks. Research on the program?s collaborative culture and processes, including a cohort-based approach to student engagement, will yield new information regarding convergent science. Deliverables from Maine-FOREST include, in addition to typical scientific outputs, increased research capacity with support for 20 early-career faculty, a new forest sector business development faculty position, and an actionable dashboard of metrics related to forest, economy, and workforce capacity. Maine-FOREST is led by the University of Maine. Project partners include an emerging research institution (the University of Southern Maine), two public, primarily undergraduate institutions, two private colleges (Colby and Bates), and strategic non-profits across the state (the Maine Development Foundation, Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, Maine TREE, the Rural Aspirations). Maine-FOREST will directly support at least 45 faculty (45% early-career), 85 undergraduate students, 10 graduate students, and 4 postdocs. The project will potentially benefit 200 K-12 educators and nearly 2,000 students in 15 schools will directly benefit. Ten diverse rural and economically distressed Maine communities, and a Tribal Nation, will also be directly engaged. This project is funded by the NSF EPSCoR Research Incubators for STEM Excellence (E-RISE) Research Infrastructure Improvement Program. The E-RISE RII Program supports the development and implementation of sustainable broad networks of individuals, institutions, and organizations that will transform the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research capacity and competitiveness in a jurisdiction within a field of research aligned with the jurisdiction's science and technology priorities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the key factors to help the nucleic acid nanotechnology field to unlock its full potential and realize more complex designs at the nanoscale is the need of sophisticated modeling tools available to experimental laboratories. Manufacturing of modern-day machinery, such as cars, planes, and processors, relies on computer design and simulation testing (such as flow of air around airplane) as an essential part of the design process, using computer-aided design software. The oxDNA ecosystems comprises simulation models and design tools aimed at computer-based testing and validation of nucleic acid nanostructures that can aid experimentalists in testing their structures as well as in designing complex behavior that would be otherwise impossible to achieve without efficient modeling tools. The oxDNA software has now reached a maturity, and this project transitions it toward an open-source ecosystem, where academic researchers as well as the biotechnology industry contribute towards its development and together identify new functionalities that need to be added to push the frontier of the complexity of devices that can be manufactured at nanoscale. Together, these efforts unlock development and realization of the next generation of bionanotechnology devices.<br/><br/>The oxDNA software is a set of tools, coarse-grained models, and associated web-based services to model DNA and RNA nanodevices, as well as DNA/RNA-protein hybrid nanostructures. To efficiently model the system sizes and timescales associated with assembly and operation of these devices, it coarse-grains the representation of nucleic acids while retaining the main properties of the molecules that are relevant to the nanostructure operation. The associated ecosystem of tools helps design these nanostructures, provides webservers to run the simulations and libraries to evaluate the simulation results, and redesigns the nanostructures to perform desired function. All tools are developed under GNU Public License and are freely accessible along with their source code. This project deploys new simulation servers, improves the usability of the GUI to make the tools more accessible to a broader user community, creates a network of developers by organizing in-person as well as online training workshops, and establishes the oxDNA ecosystem as an online resource for crowd-sourcing real-world design challenges for practical applications of DNA and RNA nanotechnology. The ecosystem has the potential for transformative impact on the nucleic acid nanotechnology field and associated biotech industry by enabling researchers to perform a large fraction of design in silico to create novel complex architectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Policy makers, such as Central bankers, fiscal authorities, and foreign currency dealers, make decisions in rapidly changing environments in which they often have to learn and adapt on-the-fly. However, economists do not currently have methods that can effectively guide policy makers in these changing environments. This research will build on methods in statistical decision theory, frameworks for establishing causation from data, and research in machine learning to develop new methods to inform evidence-based policy choices while accounting for uncertainty about the environment. The results of this project will make important contributions to economic science by offering new methods to guide policymakers. The results will improve the quality of policy making, increase efficiency, productivity, and economic growth hence improve the living standards of citizens.  <br/><br/>There are many challenges inherent in studying optimal policy choices in dynamic environments, including nonstationary dynamic causal effects, non-iid observations, ensuring external validity, and agents' reactions to changes in policy rules. This award funds research that builds on recent development in time-series, statistical decision theory, and machine learning to develop new econometric methods for policy analyses in dynamic environments. The first part studies short-run policy choice problems where reactions to policy choices by agents and long-run equilibrium spillovers are ruled out. The second part focuses on learning in a long-run policy rule considering agents? reactions to changes in policy (i.e. robust to Lucas critique). The third part considers an unsupervised learning setting where the policymaker interacts with agents and the environment over time to collect data, learn about parameters governing the causal structure and data generating process, and chooses policy to maximize welfare. The results establish foundations for statistical decision theory and policy learning in dynamic settings and provide new methods to guide policy making in a wide range of empirical contexts.

The workshop centers on a series of long-standing conjectures that appear in parallel in two major fields of mathematics. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers from these two fields to discuss recent advances on these conjectures. Another goal is to train more researchers to work on these important problems and help them build connections between the two fields. The overarching goal of this award would be to increase US participation in this highly active area of research, and to foster collaborations between US mathematicians and those from other countries. The funding is aimed especially at postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, as well as participants who do not have independent funding, to attend this workshop, and it will also be used to encourage participation by individuals from underrepresented groups in mathematics. A recent workshop held in Banff, Canada in 2022 initiated this goal, and funding for this event would cement the connections already made and build new ones for younger participants. The bridges we are building will not only connect researchers located in different countries but also between those working in different areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Algebra and topology are thriving branches of mathematics that are well represented in most math departments. Commutative algebra, as the algebraic underpinnings of algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology, with its strong focus on homology and homotopy, have occasional significant overlap in both methods and aims. The goal is to create a strong working alliance between the groups working on these conjectures and related problems, and also to get younger researchers involved in these problems. In fact, total Betti numbers appear in related, decades-old rank conjectures in commutative algebra and equivariant topology. On the topological side, Halperin and Carlsson conjectured that the total Betti number of a compact space with a free torus action or p-torus action of rank r is bounded below by 2r, which has inspired much research on the topological side of spaces with a group action. On the algebraic side, Avramov conjectured a similar lower bound for the total Betti number of finite length modules over a local ring. Recent work of Walker and VandeBogert-Walker resolves this conjecture positively for rings of prime characteristic, whereas counterexamples to a stronger conjecture show the subtlety of the questions.

The fellowship supports the research and training of the fellow who will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Understanding how new species arise and evolve to become different from each other is an essential question of evolution, both to understand how biodiversity was generated in the past and how we can protect species in our changing world. This is especially important on islands, as their isolation and small size mean the species that live there are both unique and often at the greatest risk of extinction. This project aims to understand how these island species form using a group of brightly colored birds: the whistlers. This will not only improve the understanding of how species form in these isolated islands but also better inform the conservation of these unique species. This research will also serve as training for undergraduate students whom the fellow will mentor in techniques used in fieldwork, computation, and scientific writing. The fellow will also perform outreach events based in natural history museums to show the public the importance of these amazing resources and the output of the research conducted there.<br/><br/>This project uses a classic system for understanding island evolution, the Fiji Whistler. The applicant chose this species because they are one of the few island systems that display a hybrid zone, a staple in understanding how speciation occurs. This archipelago radiation is also part of a broader phenotypically diverse geographic radiation, which displays little ecological divergence despite high plumage evolution. This project seeks to understand why this phenomenon of island radiations has high plumage divergence and low secondary sympatry. First, it will examine Fiji Whistler?s contact zone to determine the genetic underpinnings of a plumage pattern that varies across the contact zone and genus. It will then take that knowledge to address what rules govern plumage evolution and the outcomes of secondary contact. For the former, comparative genomics will be used to determine if the genes at play in the island contact zone drive plumage evolution broadly in the genus. For the latter, a series of genetic simulations will be used to replicate and modify the observed geographic and genomic patterns to see the conditions necessary to produce successful secondary sympatry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project works to discover more efficient ways of using energy, to mitigate global climate change and to promote U.S. national security through greater energy independence. The project targets the optimization of energy consumption in data centers, which currently consume ~ 2% of the U.S.'s energy use and is projected to grow substantially. The project?s objectives are to develop techniques to improve the energy efficiency of software, so that less energy is spent in data centers. The scientific innovation of the project is in the application of an emerging technology, Large Language Models (LLMs), to this task. Additionally, the principal investigators will use a systems thinking conceptual framework to identify patterns and understand interconnections needed to develop new educational material related to this topic. This material will be presented at a workshop in the second year of the project and made freely available online. More generally, the possible contribution is to catalyze a shift toward effective energy-efficient computing, both in software engineering practices and in STEM education.<br/><br/>With funding from an EAGER award through the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative, the project investigates approaches to improve the energy efficiency of software and fill two gaps in the current energy-aware toolkit: energy-aware tools to support software implementation, especially for data center software; and energy-focused educational material for university students and workforce development. Towards the first goal, the project studies the application of LLMs in developing energy-efficient software solutions for data centers. The principal investigators evaluate the hypothesis that LLMs can significantly improve software energy efficiency with targeted prompting and feedback from modeled and real energy data. Towards the second goal, the project assesses the effectiveness of systems thinking as a conceptual framework for energy efficiency. They hypothesize that systems thinking, with its emphasis on holistic reasoning across levels of abstraction and timescales, is a better basis than the prior conceptual frameworks. To validate these hypotheses, the project is structured around three thrusts: measuring the efficacy of LLMs in fostering energy-efficient programming, creating pedagogical materials, and disseminating our insights through a workshop. The research specifically contributes (1) a framework for automated energy-optimization of software, including a catalog of energy-efficiency LLM prompts combined with a hierarchy of energy measures; (2) empirical data on the effectiveness of LLMs in developing energy-efficient software for use in data centers; and (3) educational materials on energy efficiency for software in data centers, including the first incorporation of LLMs and of systems thinking into this line of pedagogy. If successful, the project will advance the state of the art in energy-aware software engineering and pedagogy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This enhancement can impact aviation, maritime, and military communication systems and global navigation systems. However, our understanding of the flare-to-flare variations in the upper atmosphere is still illusive and thus prohibits forecasting capabilities. The results of this project will significantly deepen our understanding of flare-to-flare variations in the upper atmosphere and improve our predictability of the global upper atmosphere during solar flares. As Solar Cycle 25 is approaching its maximum accompanied by more frequent and intense solar flares, it is timely to carry out the research that will investigate the solar flares? impact on the upper atmosphere in detail. This project will be valuable in mitigating the impact of solar flares on aviation, maritime, and military communication systems and global navigation systems, which are critical for both everyday life and national security.<br/><br/>The overarching science goal is to investigate the evolutions of the global ionospheric total electron contents (TEC) during solar flares and to improve our ability to predict the responses of the global TEC to solar flares. Specific science questions that this project aims to address include: 1. What is the temporal evolution of the global TEC during solar flares? 2. How do the different phases of solar flares (e.g., coronal dimming and EUV late phase) impact the responses of the global TEC? 3. How can we predict the response of global TEC to solar flares using machine learning (ML) models? To address these SQs, the research team plans to utilize TEC data from the worldwide GNSS receivers, perform detailed analysis with an aim to investigate its responses to solar flares. The solar spectral irradiance during such events will be from empirical models (e.g., FISM2) or observations (e.g., SDO EVE). The investigation will use state-of-the-art physics-based numerical models (e.g., GITM) to investigate the responses of the TEC during different phases of solar flares, especially the EUV late phase and coronal dimming. The project plans to develop ML models to predict the global TEC responses to solar flares. To carry out the tasks, a team including experts in ground-based observations, numerical modeling, and machine learning would be involved in the research. The outcome of this project can help mitigate the impact of solar flares on our technological society.

Little is known about how wetlands function, especially in the tropics. With changing climate, it is expected that tropical wetlands, especially seasonal ones, may shift between carbon consumption and release of carbon. Methane, which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, is typically produced under flooded conditions, although some evidence suggests that shifts between wet and dry conditions also lead to its release. Savannas (Cerrado) in Brazil have a range of grassland types including ever-wet peatlands, seasonally wet grasslands, and dry grasslands that are never flooded, with the seasonal wetlands shifting in water levels between dry and wet seasons. It is expected that these ecosystems will become hotter and drier in the future. Brazilian savannas have been understudied and under protected; they are also at risk of conversion for example to agribusiness and urban development. They are the source of the headwaters for river systems such as the Amazon, meaning they are important for providing clean water and other resources to the people and other organisms dependent on them. Understanding Brazilian savanna carbon dynamics now and under future environmental conditions is critical for the region. They can also be used as models to understand tropical savannas around the globe. This proposal makes use of the natural gradient, from ever-wet peatlands to dry grasslands, and seasonal shifts through time to collect data on the amount and frequency of greenhouse gases emitted today and the changing extents of wetlands seasonally. Researchers will use these data to predict how savannas may store and release carbon under future warming and drying climates. As part of this project, student biologists will be trained, including in classes on savanna field ecology and workshops on using field data to predict changes in greenhouse gas release in the future. Biologists and indigenous artists will also collaborate on artwork to demonstrate the importance of savanna systems for and to public audiences. <br/><br/>This proposal will answer three questions: Q1. What are the drivers of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in carbon storage and flux across saturation gradients? Q2. How do saturation extents (areas and perimeters) in tropical grasslands change over seasonal and decadal scales? Q3. How will rates and forms of carbon emissions from tropical grasslands change under future climates? To test Q1, spatially distributed measurements will be coupled with high-temporal resolution measurements to understand greenhouse gas, soil, and vegetation carbon dynamics across the saturation gradient. Greenhouse gas variability will be measured spatially and temporally with chambers. Site changes through time will be determined by initial soil characterization, combined with seasonal measurements of plant phenology, stomatal conductance, porewater chemistry, environmental and groundwater measures. To test Q2, high resolution remote sensing and field reference data will be combined to map wetland extent seasonally. Carbon and lead isotope dating will be used to understand wetlands extent changes at decadal scales. To test Q3, data from Q1 and Q2 will be utilized in Earth system models. Estimates of carbon sequestration patterns and greenhouse gas emissions will be spatially simulated with projections of carbon balance changes and greenhouse gas with expected shifts in regional climate and hydrology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

STEM teacher shortages affect capacity to prepare students to succeed academically and pursue STEM careers. Increasing diversity in the STEM education workforce attends to the well-documented benefits for students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM when their teachers also are members of these groups. Lenoir-Rhyne University (LR) will respond by establishing partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in North Carolina to recruit and prepare STEM graduates to earn master?s degrees and teach in high-need classrooms. The proposed one-year Master of Arts in STEM Teaching (MAST) program includes a focus on culturally responsive teaching (CRT) practices so completers enter the STEM teaching field prepared to excel in culturally diverse schools. Scholars will benefit from LR faculty mentors, teaching supervisors, and clinical experiences in high-need schools. LR will support completers through professional development and teaching methods. Expected outcomes include CRT preparation of diverse STEM educators prepared to meet the needs of high-need STEM classrooms. This program has potential to improve student outcomes in communities in North Carolina and across the United States that are experiencing STEM teacher shortages and lack of diversity in the STEM teaching workforce. <br/><br/>This project at LR includes partnerships with high-need school districts Hickory City Schools, Asheville City Schools, and Newton-Conover City Schools, along with HBCUs Elizabeth City State University, Livingstone College, St. Augustine's University, and Johnson C. Smith University. Project goals include the following: (1) 35 STEM degree recipients will enroll from HBCUs and LR over five years; (2) 90% (31) of these enrollees will complete the MAST degree; (3) each MAST recipient will be placed in a high-need school; and (4) each MAST recipient will serve at least two years as a culturally responsive STEM teacher. LR will recruit candidates with STEM degrees in any high-need content area as the MAST program will support content knowledge with pedagogical knowledge infused with culturally responsive teaching practices. The project will employ a unique recruitment plan that spans North Carolina in partnership with HBCUs, an online format that facilitates the professional development, and the integration of CRT throughout pedagogical coursework. The proposed project aims to generate new knowledge by testing a recruitment pipeline consisting of students from groups underrepresented in STEM who are transitioning from HBCUs to LR's MAST program and into high-need classrooms. The evaluation plan will guide project learning and test how mentorship interacts with an accelerated 12-month program to provide participants with retention support and STEM content. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce).

Maine-FOREST will deliver a diverse, sustainable, and statewide research, education, and innovation incubator that builds strategic research and development (R&D) capacity. This will fuel the dramatic growth of the state?s forest-based economy and the rural communities it supports. Four interconnected research themes in the project reflect strengths and opportunities within the jurisdiction that align with the state?s science and technology, climate action, and economic development strategic plans. The project also will leverage prior investments in Maine?s research infrastructure, including federal awards and philanthropic gifts, and relationships with national laboratories and industry. Novel participatory and inclusive approaches will nurture community resilience and strengthen the capacity of diverse groups of natural resource-dependent rural and Indigenous communities to respond to current and future socio-ecological threats and opportunities. This new, partnership-based infrastructure will help to create a far more inclusive approach to promoting sustainable improvements in Maine?s forest-based research infrastructure, R&D capacity, and national competitiveness. Innovative approaches to STEM education and workforce development will reinforce the research themes in the project while also connecting with project activities in a companion EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems RII award (OIA-2412130).<br/><br/>Maine-FOREST?s four convergent incubator themes include Environmental AI & Informatics, Cellulosic Nanofiber (CNF) Bioproducts, Rural & Tribal Resilience, and Smart Rural Development. Statewide incubator teams associated with each theme aim to close key knowledge gaps. Maine-FOREST will advance one's ability to characterize and utilize CNF within an advanced manufacturing context. New AI/ML-driven technologies will be applied to assess core ecosystem attributes across broad spatial-temporal scales. Innovative, culturally inclusive approaches will be applied to participatory systems dynamics modeling to better leverage stakeholder networks. Research on the program?s collaborative culture and processes, including a cohort-based approach to student engagement, will yield new information regarding convergent science. Deliverables from Maine-FOREST include, in addition to typical scientific outputs, increased research capacity with support for 20 early-career faculty, a new forest sector business development faculty position, and an actionable dashboard of metrics related to forest, economy, and workforce capacity. Maine-FOREST is led by the University of Maine. Project partners include an emerging research institution (the University of Southern Maine), two public, primarily undergraduate institutions, two private colleges (Colby and Bates), and strategic non-profits across the state (the Maine Development Foundation, Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, Maine TREE, the Rural Aspirations). Maine-FOREST will directly support at least 45 faculty (45% early-career), 85 undergraduate students, 10 graduate students, and 4 postdocs.

Recently, we?ve seen the cost of cross-cultural conflict as exemplified by protests against the construction of the Thirty-Meter Telescope in Hawaii, the Keystone XL (KXL) pipeline project, and elsewhere. As big science and commercial endeavors require more robust collaborations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups, we must find ways of understanding, working and communicating across cultures and ways of knowing. Cosmovisions will deeply explore Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge building using a participatory design approach.  This will include a 3-day Gathering and preparation where participants engage in deep conversations about differing approaches to research questions and scenarios, network building activities, and presentations that uncover the similarities and differences in approaches to knowledge building across Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultures. The strategic objectives for work proposed to be delivered in a post-Gathering report include: Identifying priority opportunities for Indigenous - non-Indigenous collaboration, developing recommendations that will help guide successful Indigenous and non- Indigenous collaboration, and developing and initial network of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, educators, knowledge holders and others who are committed to collaboration across cultures and ways of knowing.<br/><br/>The Cosmovisions Gathering agenda will be developed based on a formalized framework which are centered around empowerment, reframing, engaging critically, allowing Indigenous people to set the agenda, and integrating ways of knowing. This project is intentionally and deeply interdisciplinary. As ?cosmovisions? are worldviews by which various individuals and cultures connect with the universe around them, the workshop will have a co-created structure going into the Gathering, but allow for flexibility and generative outcomes. Cosmovisions will create a space where through authentic collaboration, Indigenous persons can more fully engage, benefit, and engage with non-Indigenous STEM practitioners. In addition, through dissemination efforts including potential future gatherings and a post-Gathering report, the broader STEM community and society more generally, will come to understand and benefit from the ?two-eyed? seeing approach to knowledge building.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This enhancement can impact aviation, maritime, and military communication systems and global navigation systems. However, our understanding of the flare-to-flare variations in the upper atmosphere is still illusive and thus prohibits forecasting capabilities. The results of this project will significantly deepen our understanding of flare-to-flare variations in the upper atmosphere and improve our predictability of the global upper atmosphere during solar flares. As Solar Cycle 25 is approaching its maximum accompanied by more frequent and intense solar flares, it is timely to carry out the research that will investigate the solar flares? impact on the upper atmosphere in detail. This project will be valuable in mitigating the impact of solar flares on aviation, maritime, and military communication systems and global navigation systems, which are critical for both everyday life and national security.<br/><br/>The overarching science goal is to investigate the evolutions of the global ionospheric total electron contents (TEC) during solar flares and to improve our ability to predict the responses of the global TEC to solar flares. Specific science questions that this project aims to address include: 1. What is the temporal evolution of the global TEC during solar flares? 2. How do the different phases of solar flares (e.g., coronal dimming and EUV late phase) impact the responses of the global TEC? 3. How can we predict the response of global TEC to solar flares using machine learning (ML) models? To address these SQs, the research team plans to utilize TEC data from the worldwide GNSS receivers, perform detailed analysis with an aim to investigate its responses to solar flares. The solar spectral irradiance during such events will be from empirical models (e.g., FISM2) or observations (e.g., SDO EVE). The investigation will use state-of-the-art physics-based numerical models (e.g., GITM) to investigate the responses of the TEC during different phases of solar flares, especially the EUV late phase and coronal dimming. The project plans to develop ML models to predict the global TEC responses to solar flares. To carry out the tasks, a team including experts in ground-based observations, numerical modeling, and machine learning would be involved in the research. The outcome of this project can help mitigate the impact of solar flares on our technological society. The project will support an early career researcher and promote integration of research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Perspective-taking is a critical skill for engineers because it allows them to approach problems and challenges from multiple viewpoints. This skill will be developed through a guided observation of inherently ambiguous non-science-themed art, known as Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS). VTS encourages students to observe, present their ideas, actively listen, think critically, and communicate with one another. The research will explore how learning to dissect the themes in artwork in a group helps students see a situation or challenge from another?s point of view and measure how this impacts subsequent engineering design problem-solving. The outcomes of this research will contribute to evidence-based practices for developing students? abilities to approach engineering problems in new ways. This project aligns with NSF?s initiative to develop engineers that are better equipped to address diverse, and complex challenges of the future.<br/><br/>This mixed-method research aims to provide an evidence-based approach to enhance engineering students? perspective-taking. First-year civil and environmental engineering students will attend two Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) sessions at an on-campus art museum. Students will then work through an engineering design problem relevant to their coursework. The project will measure the effect of VTS on engineering students? perspective-taking and its influence on how students approach their design problems. Measurement includes a pre-validated perspective-taking scale, an assessment of students? design approach, and semi-structured interviews. These multiple measures will help to determine the influence of VTS on perspective-taking and engineering design problem-solving among engineering students. This project applies theories of constructivism and phenomenology by exploring how students create meaning from the VTS experience and how this experience shapes their approach to engineering design. This project will also contribute a new understanding of how the arts-based observation technique of VTS can be effectively integrated into engineering curricula.

These bacteria contain proteins that have high affinity to these metal ions, and in the presence of these metal ions initiate the generation of other proteins that rapidly remove the metal ion,  convert them to less toxic redox states, or initiate other regulatory processes. This project will generate a holistic understanding of this sensing and transcription mechanism of a copper regulator in pathogenic bacterial cells. An understanding of the microscopic structural details of function is challenging given the absolute need to measure structural constraints and conformational changes that result upon interaction with metal ions as well as DNA. Measurement of such processes are often inaccessible to traditional structural techniques due to size of the full complexes, timescales of conformational changes, low solubility of the protein-DNA complex in the presence of metal ions, and the need to examine conformations at different ratios of the components (protein, DNA, and metal ions). This project will develop spin labeling strategies to be used in Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy to shed light on the atomic level details of the conformational and structural adaptation that leads to protein function. Understanding the mechanistic details at an atomic-level detail enhances our ability to reduce this protective function in the cell, and thereby providing a new way to destroy pathogenic bacteria. Another centrally innovative aspect of this project is that the work will provide the wider biophysical community with new approaches to measure structural constraints. The project will train a diverse team of students at the interdisciplinary interface of Chemistry and Biophysics, promote access to EPR to four-year colleges, and create career awareness opportunities for K-12 students. <br/><br/>More specifically, this NSF-BSF project will develop experimental EPR methodology and associated simulation methodology to elucidate the sensing and transcription mechanism of copper-inducible repressor, CopY. The CopY protein is a transcriptional regulator found in gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus and Streptococcus. CopY represses the transcription of metal regulatory proteins by binding to a specific DNA operon sequence. In the presence of Cu(I), the protein unbinds from DNA, thereby allowing RNA polymerase to access the promoter region to express proteins that remove toxic Cu(I) from the cell. Thus, the protein plays a crucial role in protecting the bacteria from toxic metal stress. The project will develop methods to improve the sensitivity of pulsed EPR distance measurement methods and generate orthogonal labeling schemes based on a novel site-directed spin label pioneered by the PI?s group; and elucidate the amplitude and nature of conformational changes in both protein and DNA that lead to the initiation of transcription.

These microbial communities are essential to protecting these animals from infections and disease and include bacteria and diatoms, a group of microscopic algae that produces 20% of Earth?s oxygen. Microbes represent most of Earth?s biodiversity, but most of these species are yet to be discovered. This project will document the diatom and bacterial species living on marine megafauna, describing and naming many new diatom species for the first time. Genome sequencing and characterization of the chemical environments will show how the diatoms are related to one another, how they move between host animals, and how they interact with bacteria to use the unique resources offered by their hosts. Since many of these diatoms reside only on threatened or endangered animal species, the fates of these microbial communities are tied to their hosts. The discoveries made through this project may allow researchers to grow these diatoms in the lab, creating a permanent living record should their hosts suffer extinction. The project will provide cross-disciplinary training for students, preparing them for jobs in industry or academia. A documentary film will introduce the complex microbial communities studied in this project to a general audience.<br/><br/>Through this project, an estimated 50 diatom species will be documented and described, doubling the number of known epizoic diatom species. Genome sequencing of cultivable and uncultivable species will be used to place epizoic diatoms onto the broader diatom phylogeny, which will provide a framework to: (1) infer how many times free-living ancestors have colonized and diversified on animal hosts, (2) reveal patterns of host switching to discern epizoic generalist and specialist diatom species, and (3) characterize mechanisms of host specialization in one model lineage that speciated and underwent a radical trophic shift following a host transition. The broad phylogenomic framework, combined with complementary metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic profiles will reveal the role of host skin microbiome in shaping trophic strategies and other adaptive changes by diatoms, factors that likely combine to facilitate or constrain host switching and speciation on evolutionary timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although much of the world?s CO2 is stored in plants, plants are carbon limited, particularly C3 plants which include many food and biofuel crops. This project will develop a simplified version of one of the alternative carbon-fixing pathways, the reductive TCA cycle, with the idea of introducing it into biofuel crops to increase CO2 fixation and plant productivity. Two of the enzymes that fix CO2 in this cycle are derived from thermophilic organisms that live at over 90 C in hot springs and deep ocean vents. Enzymes active at high temperatures are less flexible at room temperature than related enzymes active at lower temperature. This project will develop an application of single particle cryoEM to analyze enzyme flexibility, where the PI will study cryoEM at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The PI will create a computational model of the simplified reductive TCA cycle that will then be used to characterize the cycle as a whole and predict how it will function in plants. In addition to training undergraduates, workshops will be held at North Carolina State University and at local minority-serving universities, expanding access to cryoEM. Finally, the PI will develop a capstone class for Biochemistry seniors, with an emphasis in combating global warming. <br/><br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to increase the yield of C3 plants by supplementing carbon fixation by Rubisco in the Calvin Cycle. The investigators will optimize a synthetic version of the reductive TCA cycle developed by researchers at NCSU composed of just five enzymes. The slow step of the cycle is catalyzed by two thermophilic enzymes: 2-Oxoglutarate Carboxylase (OGC) and Oxalosuccinate Reductase (OSR), enzymes that utilize ATP to capture bicarbonate from solution and carboxylate and reduce 2-oxoglutarate to isocitrate. An integral component of the research strategy is based on comparing the temperature dependent activity and dynamics of thermophilic and related mesophilic enzymes. Thermophilic enzymes are typically stable at room temperature but not very active due to reduced dynamics. The PI will develop a protocol to analyze enzyme dynamics by variable temperature single-particle cryoEM during a six-month sabbatical at NIEHS. Samples will be vitrified from different temperatures, between 4-50 C, with the Leica vitrobot at NIEHS, capturing multiple conformations that reflect the dynamics at that temperature. The dynamics will be modeled by Molecular Dynamics simulation. Variable temperature techniques will be applied to OGC and OSR. In addition, the rate-limiting step of these enzymes will be identified via a series of enzyme assays. Predicted temperature-associated residues will be tested through mutagenesis. The PI will develop a high temperature vitrification protocol using a Linkham cryostage, where the vitrified sample is heated with a laser under liquid nitrogen vapor, then rapidly refrozen. Finally, the team will develop a computational flux model of the synthetic rTCA cycle, in collaboration with Megan Matthews at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The computational model will provide perspective for the future optimization of the crTCA cycle and its application in plant hosts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their wide use, ionic liquids exhibit a number of properties that are not well understood.  It was discovered recently that ionic liquids exhibit the piezoelectric effect, which is the ability to produce electric charge when exposed to mechanical force.  This effect was seen only in solids until this discovery, and the ability to use liquids to produce electric charge creates many opportunities for advances in technologies such as passive or wearable energy generation, and sensors.  To realize such advances, it is essential to understand the fundamental physical and chemical basis for charge generation in ionic liquids.  The goals of this project are to understand the size scale over which charge is generated in these materials, and how charge generation can be controlled and optimized based on the chemical structures and physical properties of ionic liquids.  The work will be carried out by graduate students spanning the disciplinary areas of chemistry, physics and materials science.  The training of scientists who can work at the interfaces between disciplinary areas is essential to the creation of a flexible workforce for science and technology that are in the National interest.  <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Room Temperature Ionic Liquids have found use in a variety of practical applications, but many fundamental issues remain to be resolved in understanding dynamics, structural order, and the response of these materials to external forces.  RTILs exhibit the direct and converse piezoelectric effects.  RTILs produce a potential upon the application of force and exhibit a free charge density gradient with a spatial extent of 50 micrometers when in contact with a charged surface.  The existence of these effects in a fluid medium is without precedent and the reasons for these phenomena require a fundamental understanding.  Experimental and theoretical investigations of RTILs have revealed organization of some type over a variety of length scales, but the ?organization? is not well-defined.  The existence of any type of organization over such distances is highly unusual for a liquid.  Achieving a deeper understanding of this phenomenon and the recently-discovered direct piezoelectric effect in RTILs is essential to understanding how to utilize these materials.  The goals of the proposed work are to establish a physical basis for the existence of the direct converse piezoelectric effects in RTILs, and to connect these effects to structural organization in RTILs.  The primary goals of this project are to characterize the dependence and operative length scale of the piezoelectric effect on RTIL molecular structure and physical properties through a series of optical and electro-mechanical experiments, and to gain control over the magnitude of the piezoelectric effect in RTILs by deliberately inducing order through surface templating.  This work is transformative because it will provide a new conceptual framework in which to understand ionic liquids and related materials, enabling technological advances in areas such as liquid phase, electronically tunable linear and nonlinear optical devices, and passive and wearable power generation.  The larger purpose of this research project is to educate a diverse student cohort at the cutting edge of interdisciplinary science.  It is imperative that the United States train students to be globally competitive for careers in science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The characteristics of these materials provide robust shapes when pressed and pulled under operating conditions. However, these same characteristics lead to waste disposal problems at the end of their useful life. Although re-processable analogs that could be recyclable have been reported, a significant challenge is maintaining the robust shape fidelity of traditional materials. This proposal seeks to overcome this challenge through controlling how the particles in the recyclable materials are arranged. It is hypothesized that the chemistry of the particles can be used to manipulate how they are organized within the re-processable rubber and that string-like, rigid assemblies could act as struts to limit undesired shape changes in the material during operation, but also that these could then be re-processed into new products at higher temperature. The fundamental insights developed from the proposed work could enable a transformational change in the waste management of rubber-based products to enable re-use and recycling that reduces crude oil required for their manufacture. The concepts associated with the work will be included within a recycling class that is aimed to arm future scientists and engineers with the knowledge required to design plastic products with recyclability in mind.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL:<br/><br/>The morphology of nanocomposites is controlled by a balance of intermolecular forces between components and the entropy associated with chain conformations available in the nanocomposite relative to the neat melt.

The proposed research will establish the fundamental science needed for nanocomposite design principles of covalently adaptive network elastomers through the physiochemical characteristics (molecular mass, composition) of the matrix and brushes grafted on the filler to translate design characteristics of the vitrimer and the nanoparticle brush to the morphology and mechanical performance of the nanocomposite. This structural control at multiple length scales provides an opportunity to overcome the limitation of creep in vitrimer materials through the filler topology developed from assembly that limits the large-scale reorganization of the network that leads to substantial permanent deformation. In these cases, controlled aggregation into string-like fractals is hypothesized to increase the activation energy for flow. Additionally, the ability to control these structures through the particle functionalization also offer opportunities to better understand fatigue mechanisms in thermoset composites.

The potential for rare-earth ions in dielectric crystals to generate and amplify light in photonic devices has made it a highly promising field of research. This project focuses on unlocking the full potential of optical transitions of rare-earth ions in the perovskite oxide barium titanate, a highly versatile materials platform for a wide range of optical applications. Using novel materials design and state-of-the-art synthesis and characterization techniques to advance future manufacturing processes, this program integrates the versatile functional properties of complex transition metal oxides into photonic integrated circuits. The focus of this study is the erbium ion system hosted by perovskite barium titanate, which combines the optical transitions of erbium with the functional benefits of barium titanate, including low insertion loss, electrically switchable birefringence, non-linear optical properties, and compatibility with conventional semiconductor substrates. The research addresses fundamental questions surrounding the impact of crystal phase and orientation, structural and stoichiometric defects, and dimensionality of the host barium titanate crystal on the optical transitions of rare-earth erbium, while also investigating the effect of erbium doping on the linear and higher order electric susceptibilities, refractive index, and electrooptic response of barium titanate. Achieving this goal requires atomic-precision synthesis of erbium doped barium titanate thin films and modification of the chemical and structural properties through epitaxial strain and interface effects to improve their functional properties for classical photonic applications. The resulting properties will be comprehensively characterized using state-of-the-art synchrotron diffraction and spectroscopic measurements, and their impact on optical and electro-optical properties will be measured through photoluminescence spectroscopy.

This lack of order, however, does not preclude the applicability or scientific impact of amorphous materials; plastics, silicate glasses, and amorphous silicon photovoltaics are examples pertinent to daily life, industry, and technologies, and superconducting amorphous materials changed how we understand superconductivity. Intriguingly, there exists the notion of an ""ideal glass"", which while remaining disordered, lacks imperfections in that disorder and thus approaches the uniqueness of a crystal, including reproducibility and predictability of its properties. While glasses are traditionally made by liquid quenching, in recent years materials made as thin films by vapor deposition can, under select circumstances, come closer to the ideal glass state than any liquid quenched material.  This result is important to understand both because it reveals a hidden order within the structural disorder of a glass and because these glasses without imperfections have properties that are more desirable than the traditional glass. The project will fabricate and measure a class of semiconductor alloys known as chalcogenides that are important to several technologies particularly opto-electronic switches and memories, and potentially for superconducting qubits and coatings for gravitational wave detectors. By varying their composition and growth conditions and studying their structure and properties, the research team will determine how the degree of order affects the properties.  The research enables understanding and control of the properties of technologically important amorphous materials and increases our understanding of the fundamental science of amorphous materials, which remains elusive despite decades of study. The project also educates and trains students and helps to increase diversity participation in science; the principal investigator and her students actively engage in efforts to make physics accessible to underrepresented STEM ethnic and socioeconomic minorities. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Researchers prepare and study the structure and tunneling two-level states (TLS) of amorphous chalcogenide alloys with a designed range of compositions grown by physical vapor deposition at temperatures below but near their respective glass transition temperatures under conditions that cause them to lie on a range of thermodynamic and kinetic stability, reflecting a range of enthalpy and entropy. The alloys are phase change materials important to technology including opto-electronic switches and memories, and potentially superconducting qubits and gravitational wave detector mirror coatings.  Recent experiments suggest that two extremely different vapor deposited materials (indomethacin and silicon) can form ultrastable glasses with enthalpy near the corresponding crystal and with a low density of TLS, suggestive that these materials are close to ideal glasses, in which the entropy of the glass is very close to that of a crystal, indicating hidden order within their disorder.  The research tests the hypothesis that low TLS is achieved by vapor deposition when growth is done near the Kauzmann temperature TK, at which the ideal glass is theoretically produced, if there is sufficient surface atomic mobility at that temperature. The distinction between fragile and strong glass formers is hypothesized to be critical: TK is high for fragile glasses, meaning that high surface mobility is likely near TK, so they grow in a low entropy, near-ideal state, whereas for strong glasses, the opposite is true. The chalcogenides range from fragile to strong as a function of composition, enabling testing of these hypotheses and creation of near-ideal low TLS glasses, providing insight into the intriguing ideal glass state.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cyanobacteria increased the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere from nearly none to over 10% of modern levels through the process of oxygenic photosynthesis. This oxygen-rich atmosphere allowed for the evolution of aerobic respiration and complex life forms. However, tracing the early evolution of cyanobacteria has been challenging because cyanobacteria rarely ever form fossils. In addition, most modern cyanobacteria are Phycobacteria, and their sister lineage, Gloeobacteria, are very rare ? until 2020 we only knew of two species. The poor representation of Gloeobacteria has made it difficult to determine if their unique features were ancestral or results of specific evolutionary paths. Recent discoveries, however, have revealed a much greater diversity within Gloeobacteria than previously recognized, especially in high-latitude and high-altitude habitats. This project aims to comprehensively characterize the hidden diversity of Gloeobacteria, which will shed new light on the early evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that fundamentally shifted the trajectories of life on Earth.<br/><br/>The first aim involves isolating new Gloeobacteria cultures through targeted fieldwork and real-time nanopore sequencing.

To do so, this project will employ a multi-case study methodology using institutions as the unit of analysis to longitudinally study the experiences of engineering doctoral students at two different types of engineering institutions: the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagez, a research-emerging engineering institution, and Arizona State University, an R1. This project will leverage trusted site coordinators in each institution?s College of Engineering to recruit students in the first year of their engineering Ph.D. and follow them over a four-year period via monthly prompts to understand their Ph.D. experiences. This project will also involve graduate education stakeholders at these institutions via periodic interviews to understand the institutional factors that impact doctoral students? experiences at their institutions. The collected data will be analyzed alongside institutional data and documents relating to the support efforts at each university to contextualize the participants? perspectives. By triangulating these data sources, this work will uncover the connection between doctoral student experiences as a function of the structures for ?support.? The methods will be guided via two frameworks: (1) Garcia, Nez, and Sansone?s framework for support and (2) the Graduate Student Socialization framework. Combining these two frameworks will address two vantage points in the analyses?one from the students? development in institutions and a second from the institutions? impact on students.

This project will advance fundamental environmental chemistry knowledge concerning the under-studied colloidal struvite-organic mixtures, which in turn will be transformative to advance broader research on the complex multi-phase environmental aquatic mixtures. It will lay the foundation for the fundamental understanding of processes underlying practical use of the environmentally friendly slow-release struvite fertilizers. The broader impact of the project extends to providing quantitative predictions of the composition and physical properties of struvite microcrystals, a common wastewater valorization product, and their its environmental impact when used as a fertilizer. Project results will inform decisions regarding engineering, process design, and management controls for practical utilization of environmentally friendly struvite fertilizers, enhancing their performance and value, while aligning with the needs of environmental protection and sustainability. The interdisciplinary nature of this project creates a unique educational opportunity for students, offering hands-on experience with advanced synthesis techniques and state-of-the-art analytical methodologies. <br/><br/>This experimental project investigates the chemical composition, physical properties, and catalytic behavior of laboratory-synthesized struvite with varying and tailored iron content. Given struvite's potential to serve as a sustainable alternative to conventional fertilizers and mitigate environmental issues such as water eutrophication and tropospheric pollution, this project fills critical knowledge gaps necessary for a predictive understanding of struvite's environmental implications. The project will investigate the chemical transformations of representative laboratory proxies of DOM catalyzed by synthesized struvite colloids with varying iron content. These experiments will yield fundamental insights into the multiphase reaction chemistry of struvite microcrystals and their impact on DOM in aquatic environments. Ultimately, this research will delineate struvite?s role in the complex multi-phase chemistry of terrestrial and atmospheric water systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They adorn proteins of all types. Some viruses use glycans to enhance the probability of infection. Some tumors hide from the immune system by using ?stealth? glycoproteins on their surfaces. Most of the top drugs by revenue are glycoproteins, and their glycans affect drug safety and efficacy. This places a premium on making sure that their glycans are well-characterized and carefully managed. The complexity of glycan structures makes it difficult to control their structure on therapeutic drugs. Conventional glycan characterization methods have steadily advanced, but many challenges continue to hinder efforts to study and engineer these critical molecules. Here, an approach is being developed to rapidly and inexpensively sequence and quantify glycan structures. It will be first applied to accelerate the characterization and design of critical glycans required in biotherapeutics. A high-school outreach program on biological machine learning will introduce high school students to concepts underlying data science and its application to biological and biomedical questions.   <br/><br/>State-of-the-art technologies for glycan sequencing remain limited in their throughput and accessibility. They rely on methods with expensive, specialized equipment (e.g., mass spectrometry, NMR) or complex biochemistry (e.g., lectin arrays, exoglycosidase treatment). This research project aims to develop Glycosequencing, a technology that determines glycan structures using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. Using NGS to sequence and quantify DNA-barcoded lectins, Glycosequencing will measure a wide array of glycan features. The mapping of lectin binding patterns to glycan structures will be predicted using AI, trained on a large panel of recombinant glycoproteins with well-defined glycosylation patterns. This project will first identify the optimal set of lectins and biochemically characterize them. The lectin barcoding will be prepared, and lectin pooling will be optimized for NGS. To improve the AI accuracy, a training dataset will be built using 5 different recombinant proteins, transiently produced in a panel of >30 glycoengineered Chinese hamster ovary cell lines. To demonstrate the power of this technology, it will first be deployed to rapidly determine the structure of glycans on recombinant protein drugs. It will also be used to simultaneously profile glycans and the mRNA of the mammalian production host cells when cultured on 92 different media. This will allow the rapid characterization of the impact of culture conditions on protein glycosylation of monoclonal antibody drugs and a candidate hepatitis C vaccine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate-driven soil degradation is an especially urgent problem in drylands, which have unique soil microbial communities that include surface biological soil crusts that reduce erosion. Drylands generate feedback to climate change because they account for ~? of global soil organic carbon and make the largest contributions to interannual carbon fluxes of any terrestrial biome. Despite the importance of microbes to dryland soil health, little is known about how individual dryland soil microbes respond to climate change. The project aims to discover microbial solutions that promote soil health in hotter, drier climates. Research activities characterize the climate resistance of common dryland microbe species exposed to heat and drought, discover how to assemble communities of these species that maximally resist heat and drought, and seek use-inspired solutions that inoculate climate-ready microbes into soils of the Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico, USA. Ecologists and microbiologists work collaboratively on activities that leverage prior NSF-funded infrastructure and biological collections. Synergistic broader impacts include an innovative program for high school teachers to bring contemporary research into underserved K-12 classrooms, a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience for a gateway majors course, summer REU students, a new community science photography project to raise public awareness of the ecological services of biocrusts, annual workshops for park personnel, volunteers, land managers, retirees, school teachers, and students with Joshua Tree National Park Association, and a schoolyard Data Jam with students from Nevada, Florida, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico.<br/><br/>Climate change can accelerate soil degradation through changes to soil microbes. Vegetation-poor drylands are soil microbe-driven ecosystems with unique microbiomes that influence soil health. Ecologists and microbiologists work collaboratively on soil health solutions that leverage prior NSF-funded infrastructure and biological collections, including collaboration with Sevilleta LTER. The integration of knowledge in a hierarchical framework that spans the individual organism to the ecosystem has high potential to improve predictions (theory) and solutions (use-inspired applications) for improved soil health. At the individual-population level, lab experiments characterize heat and desiccation resistance and traits for 30 species of dryland Cyanobacteria and Fungi and molecular mechanisms of resistance. At the population-community level, greenhouse experiments test how heat and drought alter microbe interactions, and, in turn, how microbial composition affects resistance to heat and drought. At the community-ecosystem level, field research applies climate-ready microbial assemblages to reverse long-term soil degradation. This project builds the first comprehensive database on dryland microbe physiological resistance to heat and drought. Trait-based work seeks generalizable rules on microbial climate resistance, tests whether conservative traits confer greater stress-resistance than acquisitive traits, and evaluates the novel hypothesis that cross-domain assemblages composed of bacteria and fungi maximize the resistance of soil health to heat and drought. Altogether, research activities have high potential to generate novel predictions and solutions that maximize the resistance of drylands to soil degradation under climate change. Broader impacts span K12 classrooms to graduate training and build new collaboration with regional managers of soil health. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Integrative Ecological Physiology (IOS/IEP) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photocatalysts can absorb sunlight to initiate valuable reactions for energy production and environmental remediation, such as the reduction of carbon dioxide into a fuel source like methanol. Single-atom photocatalysts are a relatively new type of photocatalyst consisting of individually dispersed metal atoms on a semiconductor support. Single-atom photocatalysts have potential advantages over other types of photocatalysts, including increased activity compared with nanoparticles for fuel-forming reactions. However, it is currently very challenging to monitor how the structures of single-atom photocatalysts may change over time, and how those changes impact their efficiency. Professor Sadtler and his students will use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to image individual catalytic reactions on the surface of single-atom photocatalysts; this technique will enable them to visualize whether the distribution of metal atoms changes over time. By identifying whether individual metal atoms or small clusters of atoms are more catalytically active, Sadtler and his team aim to design more efficient and stable single-atom photocatalysts to produce chemical fuels in a carbon-neutral manner. To broaden participation in these research activities, Professor Sadtler will host high-school teachers in his laboratory during the summer to conduct research on catalyst synthesis and characterization. <br/><br/>Current synthetic methods used to make single-atom catalysts typically result in significant variations in the distribution of metal atoms and their coordination to the surface of the support; this structural heterogeneity produces different types of active sites and makes it difficult to elucidate structure/activity relationships based on ensemble measurements of catalytic activity. This project will use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy with chemically activated fluorogenic probes to quantify differences in photocatalytic activity at the nanoscale for dispersed metal atoms that are supported on semiconductor metal oxides. These studies can provide new insights into how heterogeneity of the nanoscale distribution of supported metal atoms controls the regions of the particle that are photocatalytically active. The utility of these experiments will be assessed by applying observations made at the single-molecule and single-particle levels to rationalize and predict structure/activity relationships measured at the ensemble level for the reduction of carbon dioxide using single-atom photocatalysts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research will study how humans and other animals? sensors perceive pressure, heat, and sound, and then send signals that enable one to feel pain, hear, and sense when muscles are moving, lungs are filling, and even when stomachs are full. The perception of force and heat at the atomic level is a complicated process. Our sensors are proteins that are embedded in the outer layer, or membrane, of a cell. How these sensors and other membrane-imbedded proteins respond to external stimuli provides information on how they move and function. Computer simulations are an integral part of modern biological research as they augment many experimental studies and provide a test bed for our ideas on how biological molecules function. The goal of the research is to produce computational tools that have the detail, flexibility, and accuracy to conduct realistic simulations of sensory membrane proteins. This project will enhance the training of a diverse STEM workforce, including graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, and extend our nation?s leadership in biophysics.<br/><br/>Ideally, a computational tool should exist to simulate dynamics and predict structure. The sequence-to-structure challenge has largely been solved by AlphaFold2. However, simulating dynamics, especially for large membrane proteins involved in sensing of force and heat, remains a challenge. The research will produce a fast and easy-to-use tool called Upside that has the accuracy to simulate realistic conformational changes in membrane proteins. Upside fills an important niche in the ?simulation biosphere?. The model uses 5 atoms and has a multi-position side chain center, and authentic H-bonds. Upside can be used to investigate the dynamics of large membrane proteins for long times with near-atomic resolution. This enables a variety of studies including those on environmental sensing, ion channels and protein folding. Our development of methods to integrate hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX) data with simulations will be beneficial to the computational and experimental communities. Accuracy will be assessed using our validation protocols and the HDX-MS data. These data identify which parts of the protein are most stable making an excellent complement and method to validate simulations. Upside also is an excellent complement to many other computational studies as it can rapidly sample the energy surface and identify regions for exploration by more detailed methods. In addition to experimental validation, Upside will be compared to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists have long looked to these and other biological materials for inspiration to create new materials for society. However, these synthetic materials often lack many desirable features of biological materials such as the ability to grow, replicate, or self-regulate. This project seeks to impart some of these active functions found in biology to synthetic materials. This work aims to understand how the consumption of chemical fuel by biosynthetic materials impacts the material properties and function as well as how the material properties impact the consumption of chemical fuel. This will be done in model materials that contain enzymes, or nature?s catalysts, and polymers, or plastics. The impact of both external and internal chemical fuel driven changes on materials will be studied experimentally and using simple models. The goals of this work are both to create new functional, responsive materials and to understand how natural systems couple materials properties and active processes. These research objectives will be coupled with educational activities that provide interdisciplinary training for students from middle through graduate school. This will be achieved through complementary activities including a graduate student presentation series, outreach activities with middle school students, and summer research experience for high school students. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>The project aims to create ?metabolic? droplets in which chemical activity serves to alter and ultimately control material properties. This work is inspired by the capabilities of biomolecular condensates where phase separation of biopolymers creates the membraneless organelle and is often linked to biochemical reactions that occur in the organelle creating feedback loops that serve to modulate reaction rates. By coupling enzymatic activity to phase separation in vitro, we seek to animate equilibrium materials to create active, dynamic materials that capture life-like properties. This will be done in model complex coacervate droplets composed of the enzyme glucose oxidase and a cationic polymer. The composition and rheology of coacervate drops will first be characterized at equilibrium as a function of pH and initial composition. The system will then be pushed out of equilibrium triggering a variety of responses that include changes in drop rheology, formation of internal compartments (vacuoles), osmotic swelling and rupture, and size-dependent dissolution. This activity will be induced with pH changes that are initiated on the exterior or interior of the drops via addition of acid or glucose, respectively. With this work, we aim to understand how the rate of reaction-induced changes to pH compares to the rate of various relaxation mechanisms in coacervate drops to create new material structures and features that recapitulate features of living materials. In addition to these research goals, the project aims to provide educational and training opportunities for a diverse range of students. This will be achieved by (1) expanding a multidisciplinary student seminar series for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, (2) implementing hands-on experiences on matter out-of-equilibrium for middle school students, and (3) offering summer research experiences for high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This so-called developmental plasticity allows an organism to adjust in response to environmental factors experienced during early stages of development or even to the parental environment. For example, it has been shown that the metabolic state of the parents at conception can influence embryo development and subsequently affect the characteristics of their offspring. The mechanisms by which the next generation retains a memory of the parental environment, however, are not yet clear. The aim of this award is to gain an understanding of how maternal metabolic state - excess, normal, and reduced long term calorie intake - alters the development and traits of their children. In this study, the researchers use fruit flies as a model. Fruit flies are ideal for this research because, once the mother lays the eggs, they develop on their own without any further input from the mother, unlike in mammals. This allows the researchers to directly address the impact of the maternal environment before conception on embryo development. They will utilize a novel methodology to determine how embryonic metabolism and gene expression changes in response to maternal metabolic state and perform experiments to understand how these molecular changes influence developmental outcomes to trigger life-long changes. Additionally, a new hands-on teaching module for a K-12 afterschool program will be developed and turned into digital lessons to be distributed to educators across the country in collaboration with the Van Andel Education Institute.<br/><br/>How parental metabolic states translate into distinct developmental trajectories and adult phenotypes remains unclear. This study will investigate the matrilineal effects of metabolic state on offspring development. The objectives are to determine the impact of maternal metabolic state on metabolic and transcriptional processes and epigenomic profiles in offspring embryos and link the maternal intergenerational signal to offspring reprogramming events and phenotypes. Technical limitations, due to the fast progression of development and small amount of material available during the early embryonic time window, have been barriers to studying developmental plasticity. This group recently reported a new single embryo RNA-sequencing methodology that overcomes these limitations. Using this methodology they will generate a time-resolved, integrated transcriptomic and metabolic dataset of reprogramming events, triggered by maternal metabolic state, during early (10 min?3h) Drosophila embryogenesis. They will determine how these metabolite and transcriptome changes translate into differences in chromatin associated histone marks by assessing their genome wide distribution at different developmental timepoints. To test if substrate availability and/or enzymes involved in histone modifications are a driver of the intergenerational phenotype, two different approaches will be employed 1) shRNA-knockdown (KD) experiments in the oocyte and zygote and 2) dietary supplementation. The combination of newly developed tools with traditional epigenomic and shRNA knock-down analysis will facilitate the identification of the earliest reprogramming signatures and allow the tracking of those signatures through to specific developmental programs and adult phenotypes. The Broader Impact activities include development of an educational module on epigenetics and the impact of external forces on embryonic development for K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An increasing number of stakeholders are coming to view the relationship between human translation and machine translation as symbiotic, not adversarial. Tech giants are investing vast amounts of capital into translation technologies. They are also becoming increasingly interested in specialists who combine technical training with a background in the humanities.

While typical techniques for studying such waves rely on visual inspection or the application of automated algorithms, this team explores sonification techniques (listening to the data rather than looking at it) to better identify and study the complex wave environment in near-Earth space.  Sonification has several benefits for analyzing large data sets, many of which still need to be fully realized.  The focus of this proposal is very much on the new scientific knowledge to be gained by studying electromagnetic waves through sound, but potential applications to expand upon this work for citizen science projects, education, and outreach are numerous.  This project also aims to broaden the pool of people included in heliophysics research (e.g., visually impaired, musicians or artists, non-STEM students, etc.)<br/><br/>Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, plasma emissions generated by unstable distributions of hot ions, have long been observed in Earth's magnetosphere.  These waves have been shown to interact with multiple particle populations in the inner magnetosphere resonantly.  They are an important loss process for ring current ions and radiation belt electrons.  EMIC waves exhibit several different characteristics, and characterization of their frequency-time structure is critical for understanding wave generation mechanisms and geoeffective impacts.  This proposal aims to explore the application of sonification techniques (listening to the data rather than looking at it) specifically for the identification and study of different types of EMIC waves.  The team suggested to apply sonification techniques to study EMIC waves in the GOES and Van Allen Probe data sets.  The application of this technique for EMIC wave study has not been made before, and there exist both targeted science questions to be answered through these studies (e.g., How often, where, and when do long duration EMIC waves occur?  What is the distribution of pearl-type EMIC waves?) as well as discovery level science to be found (e.g., Are there categories or types of EMIC waves that are yet unknown?).  Sonification techniques will also enable long-duration historical data sets (e.g., GOES) to be mined in a way that hasn't been possible with current visual inspection analysis approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The combination of fluidity and orientational order makes them highly responsive to external electromagnetic fields, a property that revolutionized the industry of informational displays. For more than 100 years, research and applications focused on nematics with a nonpolar orientational order that does not distinguish between the heads and tails of the molecules.  It was established that the fluid properties of these non-polar nematics are incredibly complex, with five different viscosity coefficients and a variety of flow regimes, such as flow-aligning, tumbling, logrolling, kayaking, back-flowing, etc. Prior studies uncovered how one can control the flows to enable useful functionalities, such as optical contrast switching in liquid crystal displays or production of highly ordered Kevlar polymers with a high tensile strength. The project explores flows in newly discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, in which the orientational order is polar, with all the molecules pointing in the same direction, thus building a macroscopic electric polarization. The activity?s broader significance and importance in research and education is that it establishes how the hydrodynamic flows of ferroelectric nematic fluids are triggered by externally applied shear and by the application of electric field. Understanding flows of ferroelectric fluids has the potential for enormous societal benefits in the technologies of the future, which exploit the unique sensitivity of the ferroelectric nematics to weak electric fields. The data form an important background for the development of miniature machines and actuators. The research provides an excellent platform to educate students in materials science, out-of-equilibrium phenomena, hydrodynamics, electrokinetics, and advanced microscopy. The activity educates a new generation of scientists with fundamental and technological expertise in advanced soft materials. The research involves high schoolers, undergraduate students, and graduate students.<br/><br/>Technical abstract: <br/>Exploration of ferroelectric nematic fluids, which started only a few years ago, is an explosively growing fascinating area. The project answers fundamental questions of how the electric polarization of ferroelectric nematic behaves under shear, how surface anchoring patterning shapes electro-osmotic flows, and what are the mechanisms of electrophoresis of colloids in the ferroelectric fluid environment and ferroelectric droplets in isotropic electrolytes. The intellectual merit is in unveiling new physics of fluid ferroelectrics and advancing the knowledge of mechanisms by which the uniform and spatially varying predesigned polarization field can command the dynamics in response to the external electric field. The research unveils the remarkable potential of ferroelectric nematics to convert the energy of the environment into systematic and controlled directional movement at the microscale. The dynamics of ferroelectric nematics is an important part of the science of out-of-equilibrium phenomena. The experiments combine precision shear-producing and shear-characterizing rheometers with state-of-the-art modern optics techniques such as polarizing microscopy, second harmonic generation microscopy, fluorescence confocal polarizing microscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without the tunneling of nuclei, the sun will not produce energy. Electrons in atoms and molecules can also tunnel under the influence of a strong laser field. This process has enabled the development of a remarkable technology: attosecond spectroscopy, which enables one to make a movie of atoms and electrons with a shutter speed of 10^(-17) seconds (with 16 zeros after the decimal point). This technology will allow us to finally understand and control chemical reactions, which will potentially solve many practical problems, such as making new molecules as cures for diseases. However, because the tunneling process is complex and the efficiency is low, a deeper understanding and further technical improvements are needed. In this project, Professor Li at Wayne State University will use a new technique developed in his group to study the tunneling process and answer the critical question of whether tunneling is instantaneous. Additional benefits of this project include developing new detector technologies and training the next generation of chemists and physicists.<br/><br/>In this project, the nonadiabaticity and tunneling delay in the process of strong-field ionization will be investigated. It has been challenging to study tunneling dynamics when electrons are under the barrier because the motion is complex, containing both real and imaginary components. Tunneling delay is a good example. After more than a decade of intensive research, the delay observed in attoclock optical tunneling experiments is still under intense debate. This project represents a new direction in addressing this long-standing issue by adopting a new scheme that can separate various compounding factors in interpreting attoclock measurements. This can lead to a definitive answer to the tunneling delay question and the tunneling nonadiabaticity question. Specifically, Prof. Li and his students will employ a novel attoclock approach, which combines a three-dimensional (3D) electron-momentum imaging technique with high-performing ion-electron coincidence/covariance techniques, coupled with phase-tagged few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses (<5 fs). The study will provide new insights into the issue of the tunneling delay and reveal whether and how electronic structures of atoms and molecules impact electronic dynamics under the barrier. Furthermore, a multi-hit 3D electron momentum imaging system will be developed to facilitate the proposed research and many other research efforts in the AMO and Chemical Physics communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The novel data-driven AI solutions rely on identifying the stochastic patterns in existing legal data instead of encoded rules. For this reason, the conventions of AI-powered legal reasoning may deviate from human standards. Thus, large language models, such as ChatGPT, may significantly impact how specialized information is created and disseminated and how people access and make sense of it. While this project focuses on legal practice, its findings also contribute to developing a more profound, generalizable understating of the interactions between AI and established forms of expertise, informing legislative and policy-making efforts in the area of AI?s safety and its impact on various professions. Along with the training of graduate student, this project contributes to raising technology literacy around generative AI usage, especially in the context of the legal system.<br/><br/>During a year of ethnographic fieldwork, the doctoral student examines how three groups of people interact with legal AI tools: (1) technical and legal experts developing legal AI; (2) legal professionals using AI at work; and (3) laypeople who may use AI while seeking legal advice. This allows the researcher to learn (1) what kinds of knowledge and expertise inform legal AI development and how the developers conceptualize successful legal AI tools; (2) what qualifies as legal work in the age of generative AI and who can perform it; and (3) how interactions with AI shape people? expectations and strategies for engagement with the legal system. By answering these questions, this project contributes to the anthropological and socio-legal discussions around automation?s impact on labor and expertise, as well as technologies? potential role in public governance.

The one commonality amongst all of these reproductive structures is the sporangium where the genetic material is halved. The transition to sporangium initiation and its subsequent development are essential for the production of plant genetic diversity, the completion of the plant life cycle, and the production of seeds. The evolution and development of sporangia are key to the success of land plants. Although the molecular genetics of sporangium development have been well studied in flowering plants, there is little comparative data across land plants. This project will investigate the molecular genetics of sporangium development in the model fern Ceratopteris. This research will allow us to understand the evolution of sporangia across plants and will fill a gap in our knowledge about plant reproduction. Furthermore, this knowledge may provide new insight in crop improvement as seed and fruit production is a major aspect of agriculture. This interdisciplinary collaborative project will train participants from high school students to postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>Technical Paragraph: The sporangium is the fundamental reproductive structure common to all land plants. The evolution and development of sporangia have been key to the reproductive success and diversity of land plants. The evolution of distinct sporangia evolved three times independently and was a necessary innovation for the evolution of the seed. The evolution of smaller sporangia with an effective dehiscence mechanism is key to the reproductive success of leptosporangiate ferns, the largest group of ferns. Therefore, elucidating a core sporangia development network will provide insights into not only the reproductive structure common to all plants but also the evolution and development of structures that are key to agriculture. Despite its fundamental importance, a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary developmental genetics of the reproductive transition and concomitant sporangia development across land plants is lacking. This project will leverage the unique advantages of the model fern Ceratopteris with a combination of established and emerging technologies to address this major knowledge gap. This project will use a multi-pronged approach combining analyses of candidate gene evolution with phylogenetic, expression, and functional analyses as well as discovering new genes and the genetic network in the model fern Ceratopteris using in situ transcriptomics and LCM RNAseq. In addition, living collections will be leveraged to study the morphological diversity of reproductive structures across ferns. The collaborative project brings together unique skill sets from botany and developmental genetics to plant biotechnology. This project will further develop Ceratopteris as a model species for plant biology studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research will study how humans and other animals? sensors perceive pressure, heat, and sound, and then send signals that enable one to feel pain, hear, and sense when muscles are moving, lungs are filling, and even when stomachs are full. The perception of force and heat at the atomic level is a complicated process. Our sensors are proteins that are embedded in the outer layer, or membrane, of a cell. How these sensors and other membrane-imbedded proteins respond to external stimuli provides information on how they move and function. Computer simulations are an integral part of modern biological research as they augment many experimental studies and provide a test bed for our ideas on how biological molecules function. The goal of the research is to produce computational tools that have the detail, flexibility, and accuracy to conduct realistic simulations of sensory membrane proteins. This project will enhance the training of a diverse STEM workforce, including graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, and extend our nation?s leadership in biophysics.<br/><br/>Ideally, a computational tool should exist to simulate dynamics and predict structure. The sequence-to-structure challenge has largely been solved by AlphaFold2. However, simulating dynamics, especially for large membrane proteins involved in sensing of force and heat, remains a challenge. The research will produce a fast and easy-to-use tool called Upside that has the accuracy to simulate realistic conformational changes in membrane proteins. Upside fills an important niche in the ?simulation biosphere?. The model uses 5 atoms and has a multi-position side chain center, and authentic H-bonds. Upside can be used to investigate the dynamics of large membrane proteins for long times with near-atomic resolution. This enables a variety of studies including those on environmental sensing, ion channels and protein folding. Our development of methods to integrate hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX) data with simulations will be beneficial to the computational and experimental communities. Accuracy will be assessed using our validation protocols and the HDX-MS data. These data identify which parts of the protein are most stable making an excellent complement and method to validate simulations. Upside also is an excellent complement to many other computational studies as it can rapidly sample the energy surface and identify regions for exploration by more detailed methods. In addition to experimental validation, Upside will be compared to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These outreach efforts are designed to promote careers in STEM disciplines, increase public scientific literacy and engagement, improve educator development at the graduate and undergraduate student levels, and develop a more competitive scientific workforce.<br/><br/>Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become an important resource in biological research (e.g., in proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics) due to the high level of specificity afforded by fragmenting compounds of interest and then analyzing the product masses. However, severe deficiencies remain in the ability to identify and differentiate small molecules and their isomers. Work in the Prentice laboratory aims to develop gas-phase reactions to enable rapid differentiation of metabolic isomers in complex biological samples. The approach entails novel use of gas-phase kinetics to determine and exploit the unique thermochemical properties of each isomer. Dissociation kinetics of analyte/reagent ion complexes generated using either ion/ion or ion/molecule gas-phase reaction chemistries are probed using infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) to measure isomer activation energies (Ea). These workflows are being tested for applicability to multiple analyte classes, including isomers of sugars, glycolipids, gangliosides, and glycerophospholipids. The experimental data is complemented with computational experiments to improve understanding of the fundamental energy surfaces, chemical structures, and dissociation kinetics responsible for the observed gas-phase behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The one commonality amongst all of these reproductive structures is the sporangium where the genetic material is halved. The transition to sporangium initiation and its subsequent development are essential for the production of plant genetic diversity, the completion of the plant life cycle, and the production of seeds. The evolution and development of sporangia are key to the success of land plants. Although the molecular genetics of sporangium development have been well studied in flowering plants, there is little comparative data across land plants. This project will investigate the molecular genetics of sporangium development in the model fern Ceratopteris. This research will allow us to understand the evolution of sporangia across plants and will fill a gap in our knowledge about plant reproduction. Furthermore, this knowledge may provide new insight in crop improvement as seed and fruit production is a major aspect of agriculture. This interdisciplinary collaborative project will train participants from high school students to postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>Technical Paragraph: The sporangium is the fundamental reproductive structure common to all land plants. The evolution and development of sporangia have been key to the reproductive success and diversity of land plants. The evolution of distinct sporangia evolved three times independently and was a necessary innovation for the evolution of the seed. The evolution of smaller sporangia with an effective dehiscence mechanism is key to the reproductive success of leptosporangiate ferns, the largest group of ferns. Therefore, elucidating a core sporangia development network will provide insights into not only the reproductive structure common to all plants but also the evolution and development of structures that are key to agriculture. Despite its fundamental importance, a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary developmental genetics of the reproductive transition and concomitant sporangia development across land plants is lacking. This project will leverage the unique advantages of the model fern Ceratopteris with a combination of established and emerging technologies to address this major knowledge gap. This project will use a multi-pronged approach combining analyses of candidate gene evolution with phylogenetic, expression, and functional analyses as well as discovering new genes and the genetic network in the model fern Ceratopteris using in situ transcriptomics and LCM RNAseq. In addition, living collections will be leveraged to study the morphological diversity of reproductive structures across ferns. The collaborative project brings together unique skill sets from botany and developmental genetics to plant biotechnology. This project will further develop Ceratopteris as a model species for plant biology studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enhanced BAM activity has been linked to extreme weather events, such as heat waves and cold outbreaks, and an increase in the frequency of blocking events. The researcher has found that rainfall variability associated with the BAM is isolated to the south Pacific, suggesting the BAM may be a source of predictability for rainfall in this region, while its prominence in the hemispheric mean storm activity suggests it plays an important role in shaping the large-scale circulation and hydrological cycle of the southern hemisphere as a whole. The dynamical linkages between the BAM and extreme weather and blocking events are not well understood. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also identified the future projections of large-scale coherent atmospheric modes like the BAM as highly uncertain. This project will investigate the gap in knowledge linking the BAM to extreme weather events and blocking, as well as a hypothesis for how BAM activity might be expected to change in a warming climate. The improved understanding of the BAM and its physical links to extreme weather and blocking will then be extended to other internal midlatitude modes of variability on subseasonal to seasonal time scales around the globe. This project has the potential to advance knowledge at the weather-climate interface in an area with high relevance to society. The strong focus on K-12 education is also a priority for increasing the future participation in STEM.<br/><br/>The project will use a hierarchy of modeling studies, climate model output, and gridded data sets to carry out the research. Three hypotheses will be tested:<br/>1)	Certain BAM states are more conducive to blocking;<br/>2)	The BAM increases the frequency of blocking through synoptic eddy feedbacks;<br/>3)	Enhanced diabatic heating with global warming will enhance the BAM and blocking.<br/>Tasks include building a quantitative relationship between synoptic eddies, blocking patterns, and BAM states using a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model that can simulate key dynamical processes with limited interference from other atmospheric processes. The aim is to use two types of atmospheric general circulation models to investigate the role of climatological basic states and diabatic heating in determining the BAM and blocking. In a warming climate, the intensity of the BAM has been projected to increase. Given the dynamical connection identified in the PI?s preliminary results, in a warming climate, following an enhanced high BAM state, a more regular cluster of blocking events is expected, which has important implications for mitigating disasters for regions in the mid-latitudes. In combination, this project will enable the development of improved subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction and will also provide guidance to improve the ability of dynamical models to simulate extreme weather events. The researcher will support and mentor one undergraduate and one graduate student.

These materials feature robust and exotic electronic modes at their surfaces, hinges (edges), and even corners, protected by the topological properties and symmetries of their bulk. This research project investigates quantum materials with a strong interplay between antiferromagnetism, electronic correlations, and non-trivial topology. Specifically, the focus is on studying the axion insulator state and the emergent hinge and corner modes in three-dimensional antiferromagnetic topological matter. To achieve this, the research team employs spectroscopic imaging with the scanning tunneling microscope, an ideal tool for directly visualizing localized boundary modes at or near atomic steps, as well as their energy-momentum structure and non-trivial topology. This research also has broader impacts through outreach activities designed to captivate and inspire K-12 students. These activities include live demonstrations and hands-on experiments, such as cryogenic cooling and superconducting levitation, conducted during major soccer tournaments. Additionally, the principal investigator plans to write a scientific article for non-specialists about magnetic topological materials from the perspective of scanning tunneling microscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, Professor Meek is tackling these challenges by developing complexity-building protocols that efficiently and selectively assemble multiple chemical components in a single operation. These protocols leverage readily available unsaturated hydrocarbons and common chemical groups with reactions driven by catalysts (additives that make reactions more efficient and/or faster) made from nickel.

Molecular assembly is catalyzed by phosphine-nickel complexes that display high reactivity and selectivity, characteristics essential to efficient and economical manufacture of important functionalized acyclic and cyclic molecular scaffolds. Fundamentally, these reactions leverage the diverse chemical reactivity of organonickel intermediates with an array of nucleophilic coupling partners.

Public bus fleets, including transit and school buses, represent a prime opportunity for transportation electrification, and associated improvements in environmental quality and health benefits in impacted communities. Widespread adoption of electric buses has been hindered by an array of complex and interrelated planning, operational, and managerial challenges. Some major ones are range limits, long charging time, high capital expenses, low bus utilization ratios, equipment downtime, underdeveloped workforce, and diverse stakeholder interests and priorities. To overcome these hurdles, this project adopts a holistic approach by integrating intelligent technology development with community needs, while prioritizing environmental justice (EJ) and transportation justice (TJ) in research and solution design. A suite of intelligent decision support tools will be developed and deployed to support a scalable, transferable, and sustainable path for electric bus transition. This project will also assess collaborative governance in public bus fleet electrification planning and policymaking. An advisory council consisting of key stakeholders in public bus fleet electrification will be established to guide all stages of the project. In collaboration with industry and community partners, this project will further contribute to the development of the workforce to facilitate a sustainable future for electrified public bus transportation. Outputs from this project will include a report and clearinghouse on lessons learned, resources and best practices to guide other public transit agencies and school systems in their fleet electrification efforts, thereby accelerating the nationwide transition to electric buses. The project outcomes will advance EJ and TJ, benefiting marginalized communities that have long been harmed by diesel-exhaust pollution. <br/><br/>The overarching research goal of this award is to tackle interrelated challenges that arise in the planning, operations, and management of public bus fleet electrification. The project will be conducted in close collaboration with local transit agencies, public schools, local municipalities, utility companies, electric bus distributor and maintenance service providers, and national laboratories. The multidisciplinary team will devise innovative technologies to support analytical and practical needs of community partners. Strategic planning for electric bus fleets differs fundamentally from conventional fleet planning because decisions such as charging capacity and charger locations profoundly influence fleet performance due to the much-reduced range and longer refueling time. A holistic approach is thus devised to integrate operations into the strategic planning for bus fleet electrification. It will develop an integrated strategic and operational planning framework guided by EJ and TJ. Innovations in graph machine learning and learning-enabled stochastic optimization will enable stakeholders to address the complexity, nonlinearity, uncertainty, and data scarcity challenges associated with bus electrification. Daily operations of electric bus fleets present hurdles to achieving high utilization of electric buses and chargers while maintaining optimal state of charge ranges, all without compromising the reliability of bus services. Adaptive operations decision support capabilities will be developed to address those operational challenges. Those include new smart predict-then-optimize, digital twin-based real-time decision making, and transfer learning algorithms to dynamically optimize fleet charging, incident response, and maintenance, thereby achieving the overarching goal of high vehicle utilization and competitive total ownership cost. The project will culminate in a pilot program to deploy CREATE Suite, a set of intelligent decision support tools, to facilitate public bus fleet electrification efforts at the project?s public transit systems and school districts partners. At the conclusion of this project, an electric bus clearinghouse will be established as a centralized platform to support bus electrification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet much debate exists about whether species will be able to respond to global change ? and if so, how will they do it? Many animals living in temperate climates, like those across the northern U.S., already harbor the capacity to cope with temperature changes: they do so every time the seasons turn, and they even do so on shorter time scales, like from day to night. The birds at the local bird feeder are a great example of this. On a cold winter day, they turn up their internal engines to produce more heat, and they visit the feeder more often to fuel their engines. When the temperature warms up, they turn those internal heaters down to save energy. The ability to make these changes to their physiology may be especially beneficial when the weather turns rapidly, like when a winter storm hits, for example. But are some individuals better at changing this internal physiology than others? And if so, how do they do this? And what does this mean for their ability to withstand temperature changes? Using automated birdfeeders to track birds across the winter season, this project will make connections between an individual?s ability to change its physiology in response to temperature, its genetics, and its survival. These findings will then be incorporated into the National Audubon Society?s models with the goal of improving predicted responses to climatic change and informing conservation action. <br/><br/>Accurately documenting the capacity for natural populations to respond to environmental variation is a core challenge of biology. When environmental fluctuations occur on short temporal scales relative to the lifetime of an individual, the ability to reversibly modify trait values can allow individuals to optimally match their phenotype to the environment. Determining the causes and consequences of variation in this phenotypic flexibility is critical to our understanding of individuals? capacity to cope with accelerating global change and for realistic projections of species? viabilities in the future. This pursuit necessarily requires linking genotype to phenotype to fitness, though such connections remain rare. Existing empirical evidence demonstrates that temperature variability drives spatial patterns of variation in physiological flexibility across the range of a small songbird, the Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis). This project will now quantify: (1) patterns of variation in junco physiological flexibility across a thermal variability gradient; (2) energetic costs of flexible phenotypic changes; (3) selection on physiological flexibility in the wild; and (4) spatial and temporal changes in allele frequencies for loci associated with physiological flexibility.

The very large sample size allows researchers to have sufficient data to study state electorates as well as the entire nation.  The survey is used to study who votes and why, and what explains the choices that voters make.   Since its inception, the CES has involved more than 100 different research teams and hundreds of faculty and student researchers, and it has conducted interviews with more than half a million American adults. The data from this project are used widely by researchers, journalists, and members of the public to understand American elections and public opinion. Few, if any, data infrastructure ventures in the discipline can boast participation from as many institutions and scholars as CES has facilitated. The survey helps to create and sustain a network of researchers interested in state and national elections, survey design, and public opinion. <br/> <br/>The 2024 CES survey is developed by a consortium of research teams.   Each research team that wishes to be involved in the project purchases a 1,000-person sample survey from the same firm.   Each individual team determines half of the questions on its survey. The other half of the content (Common Content) is created by the PIs in collaboration with scholars from the participating teams.  Common Content consists of questions that every team would like to measure or questions that are of broad interest and require a very large sample.  The project, thus, fields as many surveys as there are teams and also produces a single large sample survey that consists of the Common Content.   The survey will be fielded over the Internet, with samples constructed to be nationally representative.  Each team will receive the data from its own 1,000-person survey and a dataset consisting of the 50,000+ observations from the Common Content survey.  Survey data are validated using voter validation and through comparisons of state level election results to the survey results from the subsamples for each state.

Time-domain terahertz imaging systems provide time-resolved and multispectral amplitude and phase information of an imaged object. However, existing time-domain terahertz imaging systems are slow, bulky, and complex, due to their single-pixel nature, which has prevented the use of these systems in practical applications. This project aims to investigate and develop computational imaging frameworks based on diffractive neural networks to augment the unique functionalities of a newly introduced terahertz focal-plane array (THz-FPA) based on plasmonic nanoantenna arrays. By digitally increasing the space-bandwidth product of the THz-FPA, real-time, Mega-pixel, multispectral, 3D terahertz cameras could be realized for the first time. In addition to advancing terahertz imaging science, the proposed research on computational imaging algorithms based on diffractive neural networks could potentially create ubiquitous and low-power systems at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be realized using relatively simple and compact imagers. This research will be integrated with the education and training of cross-disciplinary and diverse graduate and undergraduate students through access to resources and knowledge in computational imaging, machine learning, terahertz devices and imaging systems, as well as new course development. Public outreach activities through organizing workshops and symposia, public interviews and articles in news media and the internet, and high school seminars will complement the research activities.<br/><br/>The proposed effort aims to explore the use of diffractive optical networks to create a spatial encoder to form a super-resolution terahertz imaging system benefiting from diffractive visual processing. This will be based on the joint optimization of a passive diffractive optical network composed of transmissive layers placed before the THz-FPA, followed by a shallow electronic neural network that post-processes the THz-FPA output.

However, relatively few cases make it to the Court. In any given year, the Court receives thousands of petitions asking it to review lower court decisions, of which less than one hundred are granted review, or writ of certiorari. The discretionary authority to choose its cases endows the Court with substantial influence in shaping national public policy. Given the statistical rarity of a case receiving a formal decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the unrepresentative nature of the petitions that justices choose among, it is critical to understand not just the decisions the Court makes on the merit, but also the density and diversity of issues and interests competing for the Court?s consideration. How does the supply of certiorari petitions shape the justices? behaviors? How do external actors, such as interest groups and the media, shape the Court?s docket? How does the Court?s selection of petitions granted review represent the plurality of public interests? To answer these and related questions, the research project endeavors to collect, categorize and analyze a host of important features in the writ of certiorari process. Recognizing the seminal importance of the agenda-setting stage, the research intends to provide a better understanding of judicial decision-making and judicial processes as well as the essential role of courts in American democracy.<br/><br/>The research enhances existing theories of judicial behavior, with a specific focus on the early stage of decision-making in the United States Supreme Court: the decision to grant review, or writ of certiorari. The research collects and analyzes case features from all writ of certiorari petitions? that is, all lower court cases where the losing party, dissatisfied with the outcome, appeals to the US Supreme Court. The study catalogs?for the first time?the geographic origin, temporal distribution, and issue areas of cases the Court is asked to review. It also examines the role played by external actors in shaping the Court?s agenda, including the media and interest groups, as well as the extent to which the Court?s final selection of cases is consistent with the expectations of the plurality of interests in society. This multifaceted investigation inquires into how these factors collectively impact the decision-making process of the justices, leading to both empirical and theoretical contributions in the study of judicial decision-making. First, it provides new data on writs of certiorari petitions that are comprehensive over time and space, and across issues. Second, the project presents a unique perspective on the courts more generally by contributing to theories that are built around informational cues, and by using computational social science methods to test how the selection of cases impacts judicial outcomes. Third, it seeks to refine and extend machine learning algorithms for legal text analysis of cert petitions and external actors, potentially paving the way and setting new standards for data-driven research in judicial politics. Finally, it supplements the quantitative analyses with interviews of former Supreme Court clerks and amicus-filing entities to provide a richer perspective on how the justices sort through the large number of petitions received every year, and how the Court selects the final set of cases to review. Through the research, and, importantly, the creation of a dataset that categorizes a host of features of all cert petitions to the Court, this project will provide judicial, interest group, media scholars and the public with new insights on the workings of the judicial system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is already among the most valuable attributes of the STEM workforce, especially in engineering which requires generating and evaluating novel solutions to complex problems. It is projected to become even more vital in the innovation economy of the near future. Nonetheless, creativity is not generally integrated into engineering coursework nor is the explicit assessment of it a common part of student evaluation. Indeed, it has proven to be difficult to define and measure. More effectively integrating creativity into undergraduate engineering education requires knowing which dimensions of creativity contribute most to students? future STEM success. In this project, researchers will parse creative cognition among engineering undergraduate students along core dimensions, including visual vs. verbal creativity and generative vs. evaluative creativity, and, in a longitudinal study, examine the relationships between creativity and engineering success during and after college. The substantial time, effort, and cost required for humans to score creativity limits the integration of such measurement into STEM classrooms and other educational and professional contexts. The researchers will use emerging computational approaches to transform the measurement of creativity, seeking to open new avenues for researchers to capture creativity in STEM on a large scale and in efficient and valid ways.

It is already among the most valuable attributes of the STEM workforce, especially in engineering which requires generating and evaluating novel solutions to complex problems. It is projected to become even more vital in the innovation economy of the near future. Nonetheless, creativity is not generally integrated into engineering coursework nor is the explicit assessment of it a common part of student evaluation. Indeed, it has proven to be difficult to define and measure. More effectively integrating creativity into undergraduate engineering education requires knowing which dimensions of creativity contribute most to students? future STEM success. In this project, researchers will parse creative cognition among engineering undergraduate students along core dimensions, including visual vs. verbal creativity and generative vs. evaluative creativity, and, in a longitudinal study, examine the relationships between creativity and engineering success during and after college. The substantial time, effort, and cost required for humans to score creativity limits the integration of such measurement into STEM classrooms and other educational and professional contexts. The researchers will use emerging computational approaches to transform the measurement of creativity, seeking to open new avenues for researchers to capture creativity in STEM on a large scale and in efficient and valid ways.

Although metal nanoparticles efficiently absorb light, most of the absorbed energy is converted into heat. On the other hand, metal oxide semiconductors can store light energy for much longer times than metals making them useful for applications such as photodetection. However, metal oxide semiconductors do not absorb as strongly or often only at specific wavelengths, while metal nanoparticle can be designed to strongly interact with light of any color. This project overcomes these limitations by combining the high absorption of metal nanoparticles with the longer lifetimes of the absorbed light energy in metal oxide semiconductors. The principal investigator uses techniques that allow him to study how the light energy absorbed by a metal nanoparticle is transferred to an adjacent metal oxide semiconductor layer. These experiments are carried out for one nanoparticle at a time to resolve heterogeneities that arise from materials synthesis. In addition, the PI is continuing his longstanding participation in Rice University?s Civic Scientist Program and Research Experience for Teachers, allowing him to educate K-12 students about nanotechnology and inspire them to pursue scientific careers as well as to provide teachers with experience to in turn help students in those pursuits.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The goal of this project is to understand and maximize plasmon decay into charge separated states between a metal nanoparticle and an adjacent metal oxide semiconductor via direct charge transfer following plasmon excitation. The principal investigator will accomplish this goal by addressing the following objectives: 1) Design and fabricate plasmonic metal?semiconductor heterostructures and establish a correlation with interface induced plasmon decay via changes to the homogeneous plasmon linewidth; 2) Quantitatively determine charge injection into semiconductors surrounding plasmonic nanostructures using single particle ultrafast spectroscopy and correlate with efficiencies obtained from plasmon damping; 3) Apply Stokes and anti-Stokes emission spectroscopy to independently follow interfacial charge transfer through emission quenching under both one- and multi-photon excitation conditions. These proposed studies will elucidate the mechanism of interfacial charge transfer in plasmonic heterostructures and the underlying material parameters that determine efficiencies with a focus on excess energy as determined by the plasmon resonance and the relative band alignment including Schottky barrier height. Such detailed mechanistic information would be impossible to obtain without single-particle techniques due to the heterogeneity of plasmonic nanoparticle sizes and local environments. The proposed studies will potentially have a transformative impact on developing efficient photovoltaic devices based on plasmonic metal-semiconductor heterostructures taking advantage of a wide wavelength sensitivity, large absorption cross section, and long hot carrier lifetime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dynamic structures play pivotal roles in fundamental processes such as growth, development, and stress responses. Currently, the standard approach for investigating biomolecular condensation involves microscopy-based techniques extensively applied in individual cells and in vitro settings. However, tools are lacking to explore condensates within the complex environments of tissues, organs, and whole organisms. The goal of this EAGER project is to develop innovative biosensors to probe condensate dynamics with expanded spatiotemporal resolution in multicellular plants at the organismal level. The success of this innovative tool will greatly extend the timescale of detecting condensates from minutes to several days, providing a more comprehensive understanding of condensate dynamics over longer periods. The broader impacts of this interdisciplinary research extend to education, diversity and science communication. The project will also contribute to the training of scientists at the undergraduate, doctoral, and postdoctoral levels.<br/><br/>Cellular compartmentalization is a fundamental process in all living systems to control biochemical reactions in space and time. In addition to the canonical membrane-enclosed organelles, biomolecular condensates assembled through phase transitions create another layer of cellular compartments without biological membranes. To date, cell-based assays have been extensively employed to understand the function of condensates. Significant knowledge gaps exist in delineating the contribution of condensates to physiologically relevant processes in vivo, particularly in multicellular organisms such as plants and mammals. This gap is in part due to a dearth of tools to detect biomolecular condensation at the organismal level. Microscopy-based methods are powerful to monitor condensates? behavior in individual cells but do not support the throughput and sensitivity in organs, tissues, and organisms. This work is guided by a recent discovery by the PI of a new LLPS-mediated host defense mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana, wherein plants assemble biomolecular condensates mobilized by a group of immune GTPases, Guanylate-Binding Protein-Like (GBPLs) proteins, to combat infection. This project aims to develop novel genetically encoded biosensors as a proxy for GBPL condensate formation at the organismal level over a long period of time. The successful development of the tool will benefit both plant and animal research communities and holds significant promise in uncovering more fascinating insights into how these membraneless compartments contribute to cellular dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, relatively few cases make it to the Court. In any given year, the Court receives thousands of petitions asking it to review lower court decisions, of which less than one hundred are granted review, or writ of certiorari. The discretionary authority to choose its cases endows the Court with substantial influence in shaping national public policy. Given the statistical rarity of a case receiving a formal decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the unrepresentative nature of the petitions that justices choose among, it is critical to understand not just the decisions the Court makes on the merit, but also the density and diversity of issues and interests competing for the Court?s consideration. How does the supply of certiorari petitions shape the justices? behaviors? How do external actors, such as interest groups and the media, shape the Court?s docket? How does the Court?s selection of petitions granted review represent the plurality of public interests? To answer these and related questions, the research project endeavors to collect, categorize and analyze a host of important features in the writ of certiorari process. Recognizing the seminal importance of the agenda-setting stage, the research intends to provide a better understanding of judicial decision-making and judicial processes as well as the essential role of courts in American democracy.<br/><br/>The research enhances existing theories of judicial behavior, with a specific focus on the early stage of decision-making in the United States Supreme Court: the decision to grant review, or writ of certiorari. The research collects and analyzes case features from all writ of certiorari petitions? that is, all lower court cases where the losing party, dissatisfied with the outcome, appeals to the US Supreme Court. The study catalogs?for the first time?the geographic origin, temporal distribution, and issue areas of cases the Court is asked to review. It also examines the role played by external actors in shaping the Court?s agenda, including the media and interest groups, as well as the extent to which the Court?s final selection of cases is consistent with the expectations of the plurality of interests in society. This multifaceted investigation inquires into how these factors collectively impact the decision-making process of the justices, leading to both empirical and theoretical contributions in the study of judicial decision-making. First, it provides new data on writs of certiorari petitions that are comprehensive over time and space, and across issues. Second, the project presents a unique perspective on the courts more generally by contributing to theories that are built around informational cues, and by using computational social science methods to test how the selection of cases impacts judicial outcomes. Third, it seeks to refine and extend machine learning algorithms for legal text analysis of cert petitions and external actors, potentially paving the way and setting new standards for data-driven research in judicial politics. Finally, it supplements the quantitative analyses with interviews of former Supreme Court clerks and amicus-filing entities to provide a richer perspective on how the justices sort through the large number of petitions received every year, and how the Court selects the final set of cases to review. Through the research, and, importantly, the creation of a dataset that categorizes a host of features of all cert petitions to the Court, this project will provide judicial, interest group, media scholars and the public with new insights on the workings of the judicial system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of these systems include distributed cloud computing and mobile cellular networks. To enhance real-time decision-making, reduce latency, and address growing privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a paradigm for implementing artificial intelligence (AI) models at the edge. FL enables edge devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, the FL framework encounters critical challenges: (1) the varied computational capabilities of edge devices cause inconsistent training convergence and potential latency issues; (2) the diverse data distributions across devices introduce biases, adversely affecting model accuracy; and (3) although raw data is not shared, model updates communicated among edge devices are still vulnerable to privacy breaches. This project aims to develop an innovative privacy-preserving FL framework suitable for heterogeneous edge devices without compromising performance. The anticipated outcomes of this project promise significant societal benefits by enabling new applications in various domains, such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity, where data privacy is paramount. Additionally, the investigator is committed to promoting educational diversity and empowering underrepresented groups in science and engineering fields. This commitment extends to fostering a multidisciplinary research environment for college students and broadening the interest of secondary school students in AI-related subjects.<br/><br/>To address the three challenges mentioned, the proposed FL framework is divided into three phases: local training, data transmission, and server-based global model training. (1) During the local training phase, instead of deploying identical models to all edge devices, tailored device-specific models are locally trained. These local models are adaptive to the diverse computational capabilities and data distributions to mitigate biases and enhance model performance. (2) In the data transmission phase, differential privacy technology is utilized to protect data privacy on edge devices to prevent inference attacks. (3) The global training phase leverages the underutilized computational resources of the server, aiming to significantly improve the efficiency and performance of the global model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the accuracy and reliability of age estimation methods based on the human skeleton have limitations resulting from biases in the age, ancestry and sex composition of the collections originally used to develop them. This project advances research on an alternative skeletal age-estimation method based on the analysis of chemical changes that occur in human DNA as we age and can be preserved in the skeleton. To date, applications of such epigenetic methods have been primarily limited to blood and cheek DNA sources. This study advances epigenetic methods that use DNA extractions obtained from bone. Workshops to learn the theory and application of this new method are open to students, faculty and other researchers. Engagement and outreach opportunities are offered through Ohio State University?s Anthropology Outreach Program. These opportunities introduce participants to epigenetic methods as applied to studies of human variation, and aging and health in the past. A high-quality short film about the anthropology of aging and the epigenetic clock is made freely accessible to other researchers and the public.  <br/><br/>This study develops a new method for biological age estimation from the human skeleton, using a genome-wide age-associated DNA methylation approach tailored to damaged/degraded DNA.

Statistics is the backbone of AI algorithms and is often overlooked in education. TAMIU engineering and math students have low retention and success rates in introductory statistics courses and often have difficulty persisting in their overall course of study. With these challenges, the project will enhance the curriculum in two statistics courses offered in our engineering and mathematics programs. Specifically, visual learning, data visualization methods, and gamification (e.g. point scoring, competition with others, etc.) will be applied to real-world industry-based AI projects. It is expected that using AI to enhance the introductory statistics courses for engineering and math students will lead to increased retention rates and prepare them for interesting AI career opportunities in a variety of industries. <br/><br/>The specific aim of the project is to equip students with statistical literacy to excel in AI-related fields or careers by integrating AI concepts and methods into statistics curricula. The research method to be used is an in-situ longitudinal intervention that uses a randomized control trial to select the cohorts and, through comparison of the cohort with intervention and without intervention, creates a body of knowledge and an opportunity to understand the combined application of these two tools in enhancing engineering education in AI. The interdisciplinary mix of team members will allow the researchers to hybridize pedagogical principles and strategies and apply these in the research design for creating high-impact, hands-on engineering enhancement activities in the Statistics courses. Additionally, the effectiveness of gender matched mentoring on student retention and success will be studied. Expected results include the products and techniques developed through this project that can readily be scaled and exported to other STEM disciplines, such as chemistry and physics. New knowledge will be gained about improving undergraduate education in AI and statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such barriers are growing across work, social, and political settings in both the Global North and Global South, alongside growth in women?s contributions to economic and political innovation. In some instances, however, political, economic, and social systems effectively foster women?s agency and voice toward gender equality. This project explores the conditions under which gender equality becomes more likely and identifies women?s solidarity as playing a key role. The project seeks answers to these and related questions: When do political, economic, and social systems support women?s solidarity? How, if at all, can women?s solidarity facilitate gender equality and universal societal improvements? This CAREER project advances a path-breaking research and educational program that leverages scientific innovation to facilitate inclusive development, social welfare, and gender equality.<br/><br/>This project advances the theoretical and analytic bases for understanding the dynamics of women?s empowerment. The project aims to: 1) harness multi-method data generation to document the scope of gendered agency and women?s solidarity across space and time; 2) develop a theoretical of the dynamics of gendered agency and women?s solidarity to explain global variation in gender equality; 3) leverage ?as-if random? changes in women?s rights and initiate field experiments to test theories of gendered agency, solidarity, and levels of equality; and 4) implement a multi-faceted educational program to establish an Open Database Project. The database element includes a replicable system of data collection, processing, digital infrastructure construction, and data analysis that is based on four core study cases. With the aim of deploying data science to analyze geospatial patterns of gendered agency in relation to rights, resources, networks, and power, the Open Database Project coincides with an interdisciplinary educational program that involves students from multiple disciplines (e.g., social science, law, gender studies, and computing and data science) in hands-on research.

In Nebraska, approximately 76% of school districts have opted to incorporate Geoscience topics into existing physical science and/or biology courses rather than offering a dedicated Earth and Space Science (ESS) course. This trend underscores a challenge: the dearth of resources available to effectively integrate Earth System Science into other science disciplines, leaving teachers to grapple with this issue independently. Unfortunately, this challenge is often exacerbated by teachers' limited knowledge of Earth System Science content. Furthermore, there is a notable gap in teachers' awareness of Geoscience career pathways. Given that educators play a pivotal role in shaping students' career aspirations, this knowledge deficit has the potential to impede the influx of students into the Geosciences. The GeoNet project endeavors to address these multifaceted challenges through an intensive professional development program tailored to secondary teachers.<br/><br/>The goals of 'GeoNet' are as follows: (1) Establish a robust network of engaged secondary teachers across various science disciplines. (2) Provide guidance to teachers in crafting new curricula infused with integrated geoscience themes and Nebraska-specific geoscience phenomena. (3) Facilitate the ongoing incorporation of geoscience content within a NGSS framework across diverse science subjects. (4) Enhance the foundational knowledge and teaching efficacy of educators in the realm of geosciences. (5) Heighten teacher awareness and perception of geoscience career opportunities and pathways. To realize these goals, the team proposes the establishment of a geoscience learning community and network (GeoNet) comprised of a set of master teacher leaders who will collaborate closely with the principal investigators to nurture additional cohorts of secondary science educators. Through sustained professional development, exposure to field-based geological phenomena, integration with local experts and resources, and community-building events, teachers? enhanced knowledge and exposure to geosciences will aid their collaborative professional development and implementation of innovative curricula integrating geoscience themes.

However, relatively few cases make it to the Court. In any given year, the Court receives thousands of petitions asking it to review lower court decisions, of which less than one hundred are granted review, or writ of certiorari. The discretionary authority to choose its cases endows the Court with substantial influence in shaping national public policy. Given the statistical rarity of a case receiving a formal decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the unrepresentative nature of the petitions that justices choose among, it is critical to understand not just the decisions the Court makes on the merit, but also the density and diversity of issues and interests competing for the Court?s consideration. How does the supply of certiorari petitions shape the justices? behaviors? How do external actors, such as interest groups and the media, shape the Court?s docket? How does the Court?s selection of petitions granted review represent the plurality of public interests? To answer these and related questions, the research project endeavors to collect, categorize and analyze a host of important features in the writ of certiorari process. Recognizing the seminal importance of the agenda-setting stage, the research intends to provide a better understanding of judicial decision-making and judicial processes as well as the essential role of courts in American democracy.<br/><br/>The research enhances existing theories of judicial behavior, with a specific focus on the early stage of decision-making in the United States Supreme Court: the decision to grant review, or writ of certiorari. The research collects and analyzes case features from all writ of certiorari petitions? that is, all lower court cases where the losing party, dissatisfied with the outcome, appeals to the US Supreme Court. The study catalogs?for the first time?the geographic origin, temporal distribution, and issue areas of cases the Court is asked to review. It also examines the role played by external actors in shaping the Court?s agenda, including the media and interest groups, as well as the extent to which the Court?s final selection of cases is consistent with the expectations of the plurality of interests in society. This multifaceted investigation inquires into how these factors collectively impact the decision-making process of the justices, leading to both empirical and theoretical contributions in the study of judicial decision-making. First, it provides new data on writs of certiorari petitions that are comprehensive over time and space, and across issues. Second, the project presents a unique perspective on the courts more generally by contributing to theories that are built around informational cues, and by using computational social science methods to test how the selection of cases impacts judicial outcomes. Third, it seeks to refine and extend machine learning algorithms for legal text analysis of cert petitions and external actors, potentially paving the way and setting new standards for data-driven research in judicial politics. Finally, it supplements the quantitative analyses with interviews of former Supreme Court clerks and amicus-filing entities to provide a richer perspective on how the justices sort through the large number of petitions received every year, and how the Court selects the final set of cases to review. Through the research, and, importantly, the creation of a dataset that categorizes a host of features of all cert petitions to the Court, this project will provide judicial, interest group, media scholars and the public with new insights on the workings of the judicial system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The world is losing much of its animal biodiversity, and populations of large-bodied mammals are declining at an alarming rate. Their decline has serious consequences because large mammals have important roles within ecosystems, which are not replicated by smaller-bodied animals. Not surprisingly, a major focus of conservation, biology, and wildlife management efforts today are geared towards developing an understanding of how this biodiversity loss may impact contemporary ecosystems, and what we can do about it. The consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem function can take decades or even centuries to manifest, and so this is where a paleontological, or longer time, perspective can help. The migration of humans into the Americas at the terminal Pleistocene (~13,000 years ago) led to the extinction of >150 species of the largest mammals on the continents, including mammoths, llamas, horses, camels, giant ground sloths, the cave lion, and saber-toothed cats. Examining the role of these extinct mammals, and what happened to the surviving mammals after their extinction, can help us understand what might happen following biodiversity extinction in the future. Thus, this project provides critical baseline information for conservation efforts, as well as insights into the functioning of modern mammal communities.  Broader impacts of this work include educational and public outreach, student training, and contributions to scientific infrastructure from the identification and accessioning of fossil materials. <br/><br/>The research team will quantify the ecological legacy of the terminal Pleistocene megafaunal extinction on mammal communities in the Edward?s Plateau region of Texas. Building on an unparalleled late Quaternary fossil record of extinct and surviving mammals compiled by the researchers, diet (through stable isotope analysis of preserved collagen in bones), morphology (through 2D and 3D imaging), and ecological interactions (through modeling and simulations) will be characterized at eight key time intervals spanning the past 20,000 years. The overall aim is to characterize the consequences of species extinction on communities, on earth systems, and on surviving animals. Further, the research team will quantify if and how communities recovered, and investigate whether these patterns were influenced by changing climates or by the acceleration and expansion of human impacts over the late Holocene.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising platform for implementing a qubit is as an individual atomic defect in diamond, known as a nitrogen-vacancy center. The magnetic property of these defects ? the spin ? has robust quantum coherence, even at room temperature. Already, these defect spin qubits have found application as versatile quantum sensors in a solid-state platform. However, one of the most significant challenges facing this qubit platform is the lack of an efficient, scalable means to address and couple high density arrays of multiple qubits. Most significantly, controlled coupling between qubits is essential to realize the true promise of quantum technology through quantum entanglement. This project is working to forge a path to overcome this challenge, using nanometer-scale magnetic structures to provide strong, local, controllable magnetic fringe fields for addressing and coupling spin qubits. A primary challenge is that the same features that make a magnetic material or structure desirable often also lead to increased magnetic field noise that causes degraded qubit performance. This project is working to understand this trade-off of coupling for enhanced functionality vs. degraded coherence, and how materials and structures can be designed to optimize that trade-off.

The research team is using nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond coupled to permalloy magnetic disks, magnetized into a vortex state, as a flexible test-bed system. With knowledge gained from this test-bed system, other materials and structures are being explored to optimize addressability and coupling vs. decoherence. For example, materials with different Gilbert damping coefficient have different magnetic noise characteristics due to the fluctuation dissipation theorem, and different nano-structures allow tuning of magnetic fringe fields and the spectrum of magnetic excitations. In particular, artificial spin ice structures provide a magnetic metamaterial platform with rich opportunities for tailoring fringe fields and magnon dynamics.

This process has been recognized only in the last two decades and is not yet fully understood, especially when compared to more conventional strengthening methods, such as precipitate strengthening, which involves growing hard particles in alloys to make them stronger. In this work, Mg alloys are selected as the model system. The goal of this research is to understand when and why the nanoscale clustering of solute atoms can work better than other strengthening mechanisms. It is anticipated that certain types of solute clusters, based on their chemical compositions and spatial arrangements, can be particularly potent at blocking the movement of dislocations, which are line defects in alloys that accommodate plastic deformation. Via a combination of advanced experimental characterization and computer simulation techniques, the research will be carried out in the following steps: first, to understand the structure and spatial dispersion of solute clusters; next, to elucidate how these solute clusters interact with dislocations at the nanometer scale; and finally, to quantify how much stronger these solute clusters can make the metal macroscopically. This research could lead to a new theory to quantitatively predict metal strength based on the presence of these solute clusters. The significance of this research lies in its potential to advance our knowledge of alloy strengthening, which could result in the development of stronger and lighter metallic materials for everything from cars to planes. It also includes educational outreach, such as engaging students of various age groups and the public with materials science and creating new learning opportunities in the field.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Recognizing solute cluster strengthening as a novel strengthening mechanism, the goal of the project is to address the knowledge gap in quantitatively modeling and understanding the interactions between solute clusters and dislocations at the atomistic level and the subsequent macroscopic yield strength enhancement. Using Mg as the model system, the project's objective is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underpinning solute cluster strengthening through a multiscale approach and to develop a quantitative predictive model of the associated strengthening stress. One key scientific question to be tackled is why solute clustering is more effective than traditional precipitate strengthening under certain conditions. The hypothesis is that specific solute cluster configurations and chemistries offer superior strengthening effects compared to both a superposition of individual solute atoms in a randomized solid solution and precipitates containing an equivalent number of solute atoms. To validate this hypothesis, the following research activities are proposed: atomic-scale prediction and identification of solute cluster chemistry and structure; nanometer-scale modeling and characterization of dislocation-cluster interactions; and continuum-scale prediction and measurement of the critical resolved shear stress enhancement due to solute clusters across different slip systems. By integrating computational simulations with experimental validation, the proposed research seeks to develop a transformative multiscale model that integrates the intricate atomic-level details of cluster-dislocation interactions for quantitative modeling of dislocation slip mechanics and prediction of flow stress. Moreover, this research will offer insights into the specific scenarios wherein solute cluster strengthening outperforms conventional precipitate hardening. The anticipated outcome is a new physical model that complements existing alloy strengthening theories, advancing the field of materials science and the development of alloys with enhanced mechanical performance.

Synthetic ecology is a bottoms-up approach in which defined microbial communities are assembled and studied in controlled laboratory conditions. This type of study provides a powerful paradigm for elucidating the factors underlying community dynamics, stability, and outputs. However, the potential of this approach is constrained by a key technological barrier: the inability to conduct experiments under physiologically relevant conditions (continuous culture) at scale (multiple experimental conditions in parallel), and with control of the atmospheric gas composition. This project addresses such constraints by developing a low-cost bioreactor system for precise generation and simultaneously delivery of headspace gas mixtures across individual culture vessels in various cultures. This system is used to investigate a model synthetic community, comprised of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, to understand how variations in oxygen drive community microbial composition in environments like the Human gut microbiome. Elements of this research are incorporated into educational activities for undergraduate and high school students. This research also supports the establishment of an iGEM team at Northeastern University, a new K-12 curriculum, and workshops designed to enhance interactions between synthetic biologists and audiences in the arts and humanities.<br/><br/>Low-cost technology that provides precise, temporal control of the gas composition across individual cultures would be groundbreaking for studying microbial consortia. In particular, those that comprise both aerobes and anaerobes, or those that use gaseous substrates like CO2 and H2 for growth would significantly benefit from such technology. This project develops a system for precise generation and delivery of headspace gas mixtures (atmostat), coupling it with the eVOLVER which is a parallel mini-bioreactor platform, to generate a first-in-class benchtop bioreactor technology.  The system is capable of scalable, automated exploration of microbial consortia in continuous culture with control of atmospheric gas composition. The eVOLVER-atmostat system is used to study a novel synthetic community consisting of the aerobic heterotroph E. Coli and the anaerobic model acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii. The first study examines the impact of O2 and H2 levels on community dynamics and global transcription and investigates how community dynamics are affected by heterologous expression of O2 detoxification mechanisms. The second study focuses on elucidating and engineering novel syntrophic metabolic cross-feeding interactions that can occur exclusively in a community combining aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DAOs, which leverage distributed ledger technologies, allow for participatory decision-making and coordination without a centralized authority, something that enables new business collaborations amongst trusted and untrusted entities alike. This innovative structure can potentially enhance multiple sectors of society, paving the way for novel commercial applications. DAOs offer a dynamic and adaptable approach that can benefit various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and more. This project aims to investigate the application of DAOs initially in the high-value field of voluntary carbon credits, which is anticipated to reach up to $40B in 2030. It will rely on commercial transactions across a wide range of participants of varying levels of trust who need to be able to verify the credits and their chain of custody and continuity, integrated from a wide range of external data sources. Moreover, the DAO platform, a core product of this initiative, will be a versatile commercial ""sandbox"" adaptable to developing commercial products for various markets that demand decentralized participation. This will include input and transactability across varying DAO participants, including commercial partners, expert networks, customers, regulators, and broader stakeholders, such as water rights allocation, healthcare, carbon credit marketplaces, and more. By leveraging the power of DAOs, it may be possible to enhance operational efficiency, drive the growth of new technologies, and create more collaborative and participatory systems.<br/> <br/>This SBIR Phase I project aims to pioneer the development of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) as a platform for value creation in various sectors, starting with carbon credits. The research will investigate the innovative integration of off-chain data consensus protocols within DAOs, a largely unexplored and complex area. The proposed R&D involves deploying smart contracts for trustless verification of off-chain data via on-chain incentives, a process that demands a sophisticated blend of cryptographic techniques, game-theoretic mechanisms, and decentralized network design. This design has to be robust against malicious actors, ensuring fairness, incentive compatibility, and resilience to Sybil attacks. Crafting a decentralized smart contract for off-chain consensus requires balancing fairness, compensation, sufficient thresholds, and ground truth comparisons. This equilibrium mitigates malicious influences in adversarial environments. Despite these significant technical challenges, this work represents an innovative stride toward understanding the future potential of DAO technology across a broad range of sectors. In addition to exploring the benefits and successes of DAOs, it will also enable the identification of key risks and potential failure modes across various use cases to allow exploration and development of improved future alternatives and DAO designs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include crashes in stock markets, flurries of activity on social media following news events,  and changes in animal migratory patterns, among countless others.  Reliable detection and statistical analysis of shock events is crucial in applications, as shock inference can provide scientists deeper understanding of large systems of time-dependent variables, helping to mitigate risk and manage uncertainty.  When large systems of time-dependent variables are observed at high sampling frequencies, information at fine timescales can reveal hidden connections and provide insights into the collective uncertainty shared by an entire system.  High-frequency observations of such systems appear in econometrics, climatology, statistical physics, and many other areas of empirical science that can benefit from reliable inference of shock events.  This project will develop new statistical techniques for both the detection and analysis of shocks in large systems of time-dependent variables observed at high temporal sampling frequencies. The project will also involve mentoring students and organizing workshops.  <br/><br/>The investigators will study shock inference problems in a variety of settings in high dimensions.  Special focus will be paid to semi-parametric high-frequency models that display a factor structure.

These initiatives are often focused in rural areas where available natural resources support energy transition technologies. However, such efforts rarely account for the community and cultural threats that energy transitions pose to existing economies and social fabrics. This project directly acknowledges these tensions and opportunities in rural Maine by co-designing and implementing?alongside educators, students, policy leaders, and community workers involved in and affected by energy transitions?a middle school place-based learning experience aligned with state energy transition goals. The project develops and tests a culturally sustaining and standards-aligned approach to including energy transition topics in a middle school mathematics classroom. It also includes the participation of community members throughout?culminating in student-led community roundtable discussions. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This Developing and Testing Innovations (DTI) project involves 48 middle-school teachers in 12 rural schools across Maine, with the potential to impact 720 students. Together, they are co-developing a place-based technology-mediated mathematical modeling learning experience. This initiative includes the active participation of local energy workforce mentors, policymakers, and community experts, all working together to enhance the educational experience and opportunities for these students. Students use mathematical modeling and statistical reasoning through co-designed Decision Support System technology to illustrate the breadth and complexity of local energy transition issues. Student models include data from policy and workforce sources as well as local knowledge from community and family members. Research associated with this work uses surveys, interviews, and observations to identify instructional and curricular supports that contribute to (a) gains in students? mathematical modeling and data science competencies; (b) awareness and appreciation of local knowledge and expertise in energy transitions; and (c) awareness and appreciation of local career opportunities in energy transitions. The project also assesses community engagement in school efforts through caregiver surveys and observation of community events. Insights gained from this project advance energy transition education by promoting place-based learning models that directly engage students with local expertise, fostering a deeper understanding of complex socio-scientific issues related to energy transitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, it has been shown that the variability in the interior layers (internal variability) of the Arctic plays a central role in its processes. However, to date, there is no comprehensive comparison of this variability in the Arctic Ocean for the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). This project will examine Arctic Ocean variability in CMIP6 models. The results will serve as a baseline for future studies of Arctic Ocean internal variability. Key results could also contribute to determining when and where future observational campaigns will be most beneficial for detecting and monitoring Arctic Ocean change.<br/><br/>The proposed work aims to better understand present and future Arctic Ocean internal variability by comparing CMIP6 models with multiple ensemble members. The project will answer the following questions: How does internal variability in Arctic-wide upper ocean temperature, salinity, and stratification, as well as volume transports through the Arctic gateways compare across CMIP6 models? Do trends in these same variables shift and emerge during the 21st century in CMIP6 models, and if so, do the models agree on the timing? Are the timing of shift and emergence dependent on the future forcing scenario? A combination of observations, models, and an ocean state estimate (ECCO) will be used. Major outcomes will include an improved understanding of Arctic Ocean internal variability, the first assessment of this variability across the most recent suite of state-of-the-art climate models participating in CMIP6, and demonstration of the utility of the synthetic ensemble technique for Arctic Ocean variables in models, observations, and ECCO.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the preschool years, teachers contribute to children?s language development by engaging in conversations with them. However, it is not clear how often preschool teachers have language interactions with children, or if every child in the class receives opportunities to talk with teachers. This project uses innovative sensing technology tools to examine teachers? language interactions with preschoolers over the course of a school year. The project employs advanced speech processing algorithms that automatically analyze language data, providing a more detailed understanding of how language is used in the classroom than has previously been possible. The results provide insights into how preschool language experiences shape language development and whether children?s language experiences differ based on their background characteristics, such as their standardized English language skills, temperament, or gender. The eventual goal of this work is to provide teachers with concrete, actionable data on how to enrich language experiences in preschool and lay a strong foundation for future reading success.<br/><br/>The study seeks to answer the following research questions: How often do teacher language interactions occur in preschool classrooms? Which children in a classroom are involved in fewer or briefer teacher language interactions, as compared to their peers? Do teacher language interactions change over the course of the year? Are teacher language interactions associated with growth in children?s English language skills? Monthly data are collected in preschool classrooms using sensing technology tools to address these questions. These sensing technology tools allow for the identification of language interactions, or moments when a teacher and child are in proximity to each other and are talking. Information is also collected on children?s language skills, temperament, teacher-child relationships, and demographic information.

These new polymers will be synthesized using a highly efficient and controllable ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The new polymer will be designed to degrade easily in acidic or basic water (hydrolysis). This polymer can be safely degraded in the natural environment, and if collected, these degraded fragments could serve as raw materials for synthesizing the original polymer. The new polymer will promote environmental sustainability by incorporating the conveniently and fully degradable new functional group into the polymer backbone. This research project will enhance education for minority K-12 students, undergraduate students, and graduate students in the field of polymers. For local minority K-12 students, a three-phase program will be implemented in collaboration with the College, University, and a regional science center. Underrepresented undergraduate students will have access to summer research programs in real-world laboratories. Targeted education for graduate students will empower them to achieve exemplary Ph.D. outcomes, serving as inspiration for other minority students.<br/><br/>The pressing issue of plastic waste has sparked a study aimed at developing degradable polymers by integrating heteroatom-based, carefully designed cleavage sites into the polymer backbone. This research utilizes sulfur to design and synthesize monomers and polymers containing unexplored functional groups.

First is the Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (SWAA) which will collect detailed WFH information for around 8,000 working Americans a month aged 20 to 64 on current practices, intentions and impacts on lifestyle, productivity and living arrangements. This provides detailed monthly data on exactly the working patterns across regions, industries and occupations across the US. Second, the project will also develop an employee-employer dataset from a leading US payroll processing firm to examine where people live and work pre and post pandemic. Payroll data usually has accurate home and work location data, and by examining a panel of employees and individuals it is possible to examine impacts of WFH on locational choice and infer WFH patterns. Third, the team will examine the impact of working from home on aggregate US productivity and worker welfare using a general equilibrium model. This aim will provide results on individual workers? relative productivity while working from home and then enable counterfactual exercises to see how economy-wide welfare and productivity would differ if, for example, we forced working from home back to the low levels from before the pandemic.

To mitigate this problem, many large-enrollment engineering courses employ undergraduate students who have previously taken the course to mentor student teams. It is important to coach undergraduate student mentors to identify and respond to team conflicts. This work will first document the common reasons behind student team conflicts in a large introductory engineering course with approximately 650 students. It will then use a simulated classroom environment to understand how undergraduate student mentors respond to various team conflict scenarios. Through this, we will identify the essential features of a coaching program that enables undergraduate students to become effective mentors of student teams and help them better navigate such conflicts. By developing strategies to promote persistence and professional skills for teamwork in the first year, we will empower all engineering students, including student mentors, to successfully navigate future team experiences in both future courses and professional life.<br/><br/>Many students in engineering programs are assigned their first team-based design project in first-semester introductory engineering courses. Interpersonal conflict with teammates is a common challenge for students. Responding to team conflict in a timely manner is a logistical challenge in introductory engineering courses that typically have large enrollments. We are focused on developing scalable strategies for enabling first-year engineering students to navigate team conflicts successfully with the help of near-peer mentors (NPMs)?undergraduate students who have previously completed the course. This project seeks to develop a coaching program for NPMs to promote strategies for identifying and responding to conflicts that arise during team-based design projects. This project will focus on three key research questions: (1) What are the root causes and common characteristics of engagement-related team conflicts in introductory engineering courses? (2) Given a mixed-reality simulation of engagement-related team conflict, how do NPMs facilitate discussions that aim to diagnose and intervene in instances of team conflicts? (3) What features of a coaching program are essential to improve the efficacy of NPMs in responding to reports of disengaged team members with strategies that promote persistence and develop professional habits for all team members? This study will produce knowledge about the underlying causes of these team conflicts and how NPMs use pedagogical strategies to identify and remedy them. The research will be conducted using a mixed methods approach to collecting, analyzing, and integrating both qualitative and quantitative data sources. We will use a novel mixed-reality simulation environment to collect data from NPMs. The simulation scenarios will be informed by interdisciplinary research in education and organizational behavior. It will be a first step toward a capacity-building strategy for addressing the problem in large-enrollment introductory engineering courses. Overall, this study promotes the professional formation of engineers through the development of professional skills necessary for effective collaboration on teams early in the undergraduate engineering curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Timely and early intervention that improves the well-being of those who are experiencing homelessness significantly improves their outcomes, reduces time spent in homelessness, and prevents persistent homelessness. However, because of the dynamic movements of unhoused persons (due to clearing of encampments, weather, safety, etc.) coupled with a reluctance to provide information to the authorities, it is difficult for existing programs to determine the magnitude and location of service needs and to ensure that well-intentioned programs do not inadvertently reduce overall wellbeing. The project will support research that will measure neighborhood conditions and factors that impact the wellbeing of homeless populations through cameras, noise, and environmental sensors mounted on cars driving throughout the city of San Jose. This data will help determine neighborhood conditions at a granular level and the localized need of the homeless population and to optimize the services they receive (e.g., meal delivery, trash and waste removal, and toilets) through our partners including the City of San Jose, Loaves & Fishes, and Feed My Lamb.<br/><br/>The project has four main technical research steps to achieve the goal of understanding neighborhood wellbeing and the local needs of the homeless population: (1) developing a community-driven vehicular and mobile crowdsensing system to measure neighborhood conditions, (2) designing clustered federated learning algorithms to reconstruct city-wide maps of neighborhood environments and service needs, (3) modeling the causal relationships between neighborhood environments and wellbeing across different communities, and (4) developing methods to optimize services to improve and reduce inequality in wellbeing. The research project involves three types of community partners: local food pantries, local residents, and the city government of San Jose. Through collaboration with these partners, the project will have immediate impact to provide localized actionable needs relating to food, trash, and toilets, and to improve the wellbeing of vulnerable populations in San Jose, CA.

This project advances research on an alternative skeletal age-estimation method based on the analysis of chemical changes that occur in human DNA as we age and can be preserved in the skeleton. To date, applications of such epigenetic methods have been primarily limited to blood and cheek DNA sources. This study advances epigenetic methods that use DNA extractions obtained from bone. Workshops to learn the theory and application of this new method are open to students, faculty and other researchers.

This project will explore new error-correcting codes for in-memory computing in next-generation AI systems. The codes can be integrated with AI systems that directly use analog values for computing, which will help AI achieve much higher efficiency. The codes will focus on the correction of significant errors in computing that are most likely to affect the performance of AI, thus help AI systems achieve an optimal tradeoff between efficiency and reliability. By making in-memory computing more reliable, the project can help AI systems overcome the ""von Neumann bottleneck"" and become more scalable.

However, there is a significant gap between fundamental laboratory demonstrations and the fabrication of quantum devices that can be built into instrumentation such as computers, clocks, navigation tools, and optical networks. Simply put, we do not yet know how to build the manufacturable quantum devices of the future, and particularly those that will harness quantum particles like atoms and photons. These quantum building blocks are fundamentally small and new fabrication techniques at the nanoscale will be critical to realize the desired advances in these fields. The National Quantum Nanofab (NQN) at the University of Colorado Boulder will address this shortcoming by developing advanced nanofabrication approaches required to build, control, and connect quantum devices with their supporting infrastructure. In the broader quantum landscape, the focus of NQN will be on the nanoscale fabrication of devices based on atoms and photons with the goal of transitioning quantum discoveries into functioning quantum devices.  Importantly, NQN will be an open-access national facility for academic, government and industrial users.  It will also be an inclusive hub of education, training, and outreach for diverse populations ranging from K-12 to undergraduate, graduate and community college students. Together, these multiple aspects of NQN will accelerate the scientific breakthroughs, nanofabrication techniques, and workforce development that will strengthen US leadership in quantum science, engineering, and technology.  <br/><br/><br/>The team will build and implement a facility and essential nanofabrication instrumentation that will comprise the National Quantum Nanofab (NQN) at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Such atomic-photonic quantum devices are of significant interest to fundamental and applied researchers and are critical to broad reaching technologies such as quantum computing, atomic clocks, electric and magnetic field sensors, and inertial sensors. NQN will address critical nanofabrication needs including those for chip-integrated narrow linewidth lasers, visible wavelength integrated photonics, integrated modulators and frequency shifters, nonlinear integrated optics, metasurfaces and grating structures, integrated photon detectors, and many more. The fabrication requirements for such quantum devices are unconventional, involving materials beyond silicon and complex heterogeneous processes to produce devices that must integrate with atomic systems in high vacuum, and in some cases, at cryogenic temperatures.  With its open-access model for academic, industrial, and government partners, NQN will accelerate co-design and development of atomic-photonic quantum devices, positioning the US to lead in this area.

Systems using Emotion AI are becoming more commonly used to assess people in everyday life contexts from work and education to medicine and criminal justice. However, Emotion AI algorithms pose risks because even the best systems often make errors; algorithms may also be systematically biased if they are built using datasets that have biases in the amount or types of data they contain about different groups of people, or in the labels attached to that data. This projec's goal is to bring everyday people, particularly those who might be most vulnerable to errors and biases, into the conversation about when, and how, it is appropriate to use Emotion AI techniques. To do this the team will conduct a series of workshops and design activities with diverse teens and young adults, as well as technology workers, that will (a) inform designers of Emotion AI-based systems about what people expect and fear, and (b) increase AI literacy for both the workshop participants and their communities. This project will document the opinions, hopes, fears, and future visions that workshop participants share about Emotion AI. Through the research, the project aims to support education, diversity, and helping change the future of Emotion AI to benefit society.<br/><br/>This reimagining of the use of Emotion AI will be driven by two main methodological approaches: critical AI literacy and design futuring. Critical AI literacy is a set of skills that enables people to effectively use AI while also considering AI's benefits and risks. Design futuring is a method for critically considering ethics and unanticipated consequences of technology through creating alternative futures in which the technology has different, and not necessarily positive, effects on society. The project team will host workshops with culturally diverse teens and young adults in the Atlanta area to develop a library of both critical AI literacy materials and Emotion AI design futures, grounded specifically in approaches to Emotion AI based on Facial Expression Analysis, in which computer vision techniques are used to identify faces and apply the Facial Action Coding System approach that analyzes facial sub-expressions to infer emotions. These materials will then be used as prompts for discussions with developers that create Emotion AI-based systems about how they weigh benefits and risks in their work. The work will advance both the area of Emotion AI by integrating more diverse perspectives about it, as well as the underlying methods of design futuring by developing approaches to making futuring more diverse and participatory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(2) Fidelity of Implementation: What is the fidelity with which teachers implement the intervention, what aspects do they implement with high or low fidelity, and how do variations in teachers? fidelity of implementation relate to variations in students? performance? The 3-year longitudinal study will be implemented across Grades K?2, with randomization at the school level. Student assessment data will be collected using proximal and distal measures of algebraic knowledge and general mathematical knowledge. Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to assess effects of the intervention on student performance and to assess whether the effects vary by student characteristics. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from treatment group teachers through classroom observations, interviews, and surveys to assess fidelity of implementation. Comparison group teaching practices and regular curricula will be analyzed through document analysis and descriptive statistics to understand how early algebra treatment differs between treatment and control schools. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) is an applied research program that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers.

The ongoing fourth observing (O4) run of NSF's Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), Virgo, and KAGRA detectors has brought a significant increase in the detection rate of compact binary coalescences, reaching approximately 0.5/day, compared to 1.5/week in the previous run. This award responds to the data analysis needs of O4 with two projects: ensuring that our measurements are robust against contamination from detector artifacts known as glitches and studying the spins of black holes detected with gravitational waves. The award will support the training of students in STEM areas.<br/><br/>The award targets two areas of study under gravitational wave data analysis. The first area concerns the spins of black holes in binaries. Black hole spins carry important information about the astrophysical properties of compact binaries, including the question of whether binaries form through dynamical processes in dense environments or through isolated evolution in the field. The project will constrain the astrophysical distribution of black hole spins in binaries using the few hundreds of events expected from O4. The second area addresses challenges in obtaining robust estimates of the binary parameters in the presence of data quality issues. Previous work led to a method for mitigating detector glitches (non-Gaussian detector noise) that coincide with signals by simultaneously modeling the signal and the glitch and subtracting the latter. The project will apply this method to O4 candidates to obtain robust estimates for the binary properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While PEMFCs produce electricity cleanly, their reliance on costly platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, particularly for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode with a structural degradation, poses a challenge. The primary goal of this project is to enhance the durability of ORR catalysts while maintaining advanced levels of efficiency and affordability. Focusing on the state-of-the-art Pt3Ni nano-octahedral catalyst, this project employs specialized design and techniques to improve its durability through surface manipulation. By introducing additional metal dopants and adjusting the atomic arrangement on the surface layer, a more enduring catalyst is anticipated. The process involves deliberate design, synthesis, and thorough analysis to comprehend catalyst functionality. Through the development of robust Pt3Ni-based electrocatalysts with lasting efficacy, success in this endeavor could significantly enhance energy conversion processes, benefiting both the environment and society at large. Furthermore, this project has broader implications. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, it offers research opportunities to junior researchers and aims to disseminate findings to the public. By advancing green energy technologies, it seeks to foster a more sustainable future for all.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Green energy solutions, exemplified by proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), hold promise for transforming electricity generation. Recent advancements suggest that enhancing the efficiency and resilience of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can be achieved through techniques such as foreign atom doping or the creation of Pt(111) skin layers on Pt3Ni {111} facets, which are exclusive surfaces of Pt3Ni nano-octahedra. Based on these insights, this project aims to redefine ORR electrocatalysts. Integrating a specific transition metal (M) into Pt3Ni nano-octahedra, along with tailored Pt(111) skins, is anticipated to provide unparalleled ORR electrochemical stability with high activity - the project endeavors to develop catalysts that strike a balance between efficiency and durability by amalgamating these techniques. The approach centers on advancing the M-doped Pt3Ni octahedral nanostructure through surface manipulation. Employing customized synthesis methods and CO-based surface engineering to create Pt(111) skin at an atomic level, the research seeks to identify the optimal foreign element dopant (M) and Pt-skin thickness. Additionally, the project strives to elucidate the dissolution/deposition mechanism on the Pt3Ni(111)@Pt(111) reaction platform when incorporating various dopants. Objectives also include amplifying ORR efficiency, validating durability, and understanding electrochemical degradation. Central to the research is the focus on devising an innovative strategy to mitigate catalyst degradation, potentially setting new benchmarks for catalyst activity and longevity. With these objectives and four work packages (i.e., crafting M-doped Pt3Ni nano-octahedra, assessing ORR performance, understanding surface structure dynamics and ORR degradation processes, and developing cost-effective catalyst analogs), this project is expected to deliver more efficient ORR catalysts, expanding the horizons of electrocatalysis and driving innovation in energy conversion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, low participation in graduate school by women and students from certain races and ethnicities (i.e., Black, Hispanic, indigenous) continues to create disparities in the STEM workforce. Graduate preparation programs can help undergraduate students from marginalized groups enroll and succeed in STEM graduate degree programs. These programs can serve students in many ways, from providing mentorship, financial support, peer groups, or through combining multiple support structures. Understanding how students from these marginalized groups are supported in preparing for graduate programs in STEM fields is crucial to support and retain marginalized students in STEM fields, diversify the STEM workforce, and promote equity in STEM education and professions. This project will examine existing studies that focus on STEM graduate preparation programs to explore the approaches that help students apply for graduate school, enroll in a master's or doctoral program, and eventually graduate with an advanced degree. <br/><br/>Drawing from the theoretical foundations of intersectionality and critical capital theory, this project includes a systematic review and meta-analysis of quantitative studies that examine graduate preparation program interventions to increase preparation for, enrollment in, and completion of STEM graduate-level degree programs among marginalized groups. The project will (1) determine the overall effect of participation in graduate preparation programs on marginalized students' STEM graduate school preparation, enrollment, or degree completion; (2) identify which program components best support marginalized students' STEM graduate school preparation, enrollment, or degree completion; and (3) uncover which student identity groups do and do not have research on their participation in a graduate school preparation program. Multivariate models with robust variance estimation will be employed.

Stylianou and his team at Oregon State University will investigate the fundamental mechanisms of metal-organic framework (MOF)-based photocatalysis. Photocatalysis offers significant advantages over conventional catalysis by using renewable sunlight as an energy source. However, challenges exist, including limited material diversity, catalyst stability, product separation difficulties, sustainable light utilization, and achieving high specificity in complex reactions. Therefore, the development of highly specific and robust heterogenous photocatalysts synthesized from abundant starting materials is of great interest. MOFs are candidates for photocatalysts as their internal porous structures and high surface areas can lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Although MOFs have showcased their potential as photocatalysts, there is still a pressing need to develop a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms and the factors that dictate their efficiency and selectivity. Professor Stylianou?s team will investigate hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) isotope exchange using photoactive MOFs to aid in the identification of structure-activity relationships and to assess how MOF properties influence photocatalytic activity. In terms of broader impacts, this research will develop new catalysts which are appealing particularly to the pharmaceutical industry, where highly selective and sustainable catalysts can lead to breakthroughs in the development of medications. Additionally, Dr. Stylianou is actively engaged in outreach programs to educate and engage the public in science. He strives to spark interest in STEM among young students by exposing them to research and nurturing scientific qualities such as autonomy, skillset development, critical thinking, inclusivity, teamwork, and community involvement. These efforts include presentations and workshops at elementary and high schools focused on increasing awareness of materials? impact and sponsoring his graduate students to participate in Oregon Museum of Science and Industry Science (OMSI) communication fellowships, where they communicate science to children and the general public. <br/><br/>This work supported by the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry is expected to elucidate the fundamental structure-activity relationships that govern MOF photocatalysis and lead to the development of sustainable and highly selective photocatalysts for application in chemical feedstock and pharmaceutical industries. H/D exchange is sensitive to hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and single electron transfer (SET) reactions. Monitoring the extent and kinetics of H/D exchange through in-situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) can provide insights into the occurrence and rates of HAT and SET reactions in MOFs, providing a vital mechanistic perspective. Dr. Stylianou hypothesizes that the extent and kinetics of MOF photocatalyzed H/D exchange delineate the influence of MOF chemical and optoelectronic properties, ultimately dictating their propensity to initiate HAT and/or SET processes. This investigation will establish photoactive MOFs as a unique platform for conducting H/D exchange reactions in a single step on both labile (i.e, formyl C?H) and stable (i.e., C(sp3)?H) bonds, and elucidate design principles for novel MOFs capable of facilitating stereospecific H/D exchange at chiral centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, some genes and chromosomes can cheat to get more than their fair share of copies in eggs and sperm, a process known as drive. Centromeres, which guide chromosomes through cell division (mitosis and meiosis), can selfishly drive to gain unfair access to the sole egg cell in females. By disrupting fair transmission, such drive can damage the health and fertility of plants and animals. Scientists must study drive in action to understand how and when centromeres cheat, whether linked fertility costs are inevitable, and if resistance is possible. This project studies a driving centromere found in the model plant yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus). It investigates how genes and other DNA sequences work together to cause drive, how some plants resist drive, and whether the same processes cause seed and pollen loss. The research will increase knowledge key for maintaining human and crop health, train diverse scientists in modern genomic methods, and create shared resources. An integrated course immerses college students in real genetics research and a summer camp activity for middle school students supports hands-on learning about plants and genes.<br/><br/>A collaborative scientific team from a large research institution and a small liberal arts college builds on new chromosome-scale genome assemblies in yellow monkeyflowers to explore the mechanisms and consequences of selfish centromere evolution.

Project 2 examines drive through the lens of the losers, using known and predicted variation in resistance to explore the functional mechanisms of drive and its multiple effects on fitness in natural populations. Project 3 asks what forces shape the spread of a driving centromere across complex landscapes and enhances undergraduate education via course-embedded and summer research on drive?s interactions with environmental factors.

These electric fields drive electric currents that can flow through technological infrastructure in the form of geomagnetically induced currents and potentially damage power grids, pipelines, and other infrastructure.  This project aims to understand the temporal and spatial development of significant changes in the magnetic field associated with both the equivalent ionospheric and telluric currents during GMDs and the source of these GMDs.  Understanding the causes of GMDs is crucial in developing and validating models that aim to accurately and reliably predict the variations of electric fields and GICs, and they are one of the objectives of the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan.  <br/><br/>Typically, GMDs are associated with just ionospheric current enhancements.  However, ionospheric currents can induce telluric currents that contribute to GMDs.

This research will yield new theoretical insights for economists and statisticians as well as develop new methods for applied research in economics, statistics, other social sciences, biostatistics, epidemiology, and medicine.  In addition to theoretical advances, the research will also produce statistical software that will implement the new methods, thus allowing applied researchers to use these new methods in their research.  Results from this research will provide new and improved  methods that increases efficient decision making in social, behavioral, and medical sciences.  The research results will improve efficiency, increase productivity, economics growth, and wellbeing of citizens not only in the US but also around the globe.<br/><br/>This award supports research that focuses on two leading classes of identification-robust inference problems in econometrics: inference robust to weak and partial identification.  The current econometrics literature has only developed identification-robust subvector inference methods that are either specific to a small number of models or produce tests and confidence sets that are uninformative and computationally costly for applied researchers.  This research will develop a generally applicable reparameterization procedure that allows informative identification-robust subvector inference by allowing researchers to plug estimates of nuisance parameters into test statistics, rather than projecting over them.  Additionally, current econometrics literature on partial identification-robust inference  lacks tools for inference on treatments or policies chosen by estimating the identified set of best-performing treatments or policies.  The proposed research will develop new methods of producing valid confidence intervals for how well one can expect chosen treatments or policies to perform in these settings.  The results of this research will provide improved and innovative methods for  decision making in social, behavioral, and medical sciences.  The research results will improve efficiency in decision making and improve the wellbeing of citizens not only in the US but also around the globe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While such wireless XR experience has potentially many applications in training, education, and entertainment, delivering such high-resolution digital XR experience requires tremendous data rates that necessitate aggressive use of multiple antennas so that the required data rates can be achieved by means of parallel data streams, but in turn, the dimension of matrices involved in the MIMO decoding process increases substantially. In particular, linear-detection-based MIMO decoding approaches require the inversion of channel matrices, estimated by the base station, at a timescale fast enough to accurately capture rapidly changing channel conditions. Unfortunately, the matrix inversion problem in this decoding process has cubic complexity in the worst case with the number of users, who need to be served simultaneously, making the performance of conventional digital electronics approaches a key limiting factor to the future scaling of massive MIMO systems. The vision of this project is to raise the creation of new, much faster, and efficient linear-algebra accelerators possessing immediate capabilities to advance massive MIMO systems, enable many more simultaneous users, support much more rapidly changing channel conditions, and benefit numerous existing and evolving applications that are limited by linear-algebra computations, including signal processing, image processing, and machine learning. The execution of this project can directly provide and develop scientific training for students at both graduate and undergraduate levels in the fields of optical communication and computation, while continue expending hands-on classes to students engaged in STEM.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to formulate a computation-efficient matrix-inversion (MI) algorithm for realizing an energy/area-efficient hybrid photonic-electronic integrated accelerator, which can support the unprecedented computation workload of the massive MIMO channel decoding process. To realize this goal, the following objectives will be carried out: (I) co-design of the MI algorithm and hybrid photonic-electronic architecture; (II) co-design of photonic devices and electronic circuits to implement a system-on-chip (SoC) MI computation accelerator fabricated in a monolithic silicon-photonics (M-SiPh) semiconductor process technology (GlobalFoundries 45SPCLO); (III) the SoC prototyping and tape-out execution of the M-SiPh accelerator containing computation capabilities of high-dimensional matrix-vector multiplications, matrix-matrix multiplications, and MIs for massive MIMO channel decoding process; (IV) testing, characterizations, validations, and demonstrations of the fabricated M-SiPh accelerator; (V) rapid prototyping performed at UC San Diego Nano-3 facility for risk mitigations. Overall, the project scope is transformative in nature as it will significantly expand the speed and energy efficiency of next-generation massive MIMO systems, develop a fundamental understanding of performance metrics for hybrid photonic-electronic SoCs, and broaden the current notions of both photonic and electronic functionalities for future tech-transfers from research laboratories to commercial foundries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental questions about the resolution of singularities, initial conditions of the universe, and the emergence of space and time from the Big Bang have remained open for many decades. Answering these questions requires a union of gravity and quantum theory, which is one of the fundamental problems in theoretical physics. In recent years, progress in applying techniques of loop quantum gravity has allowed us to concretely answer these questions in various cosmological and black hole spacetimes. This award aims to explore quantum gravity effects in various spacetimes to understand how to resolve problems of singularities, how to extract new physics beyond Einstein?s General Relativity, and how to potentially test this new physics using cosmic microwave background experiments. Progress in answering these long-standing fundamental questions will not only benefit the wider community but also scientists engaged in research in classical and quantum aspects of gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics. Graduate students will be trained in solving complex problems using rigorous analytical and computational techniques. <br/> <br/>The main goal of this research is to explore new physics emerging from the quantization of gravity using non-perturbative techniques employed in loop quantum gravity. In the last decade, loop quantization of various cosmological and black hole spacetimes has provided important insights into the resolution of singularities and potential signatures in the cosmic microwave background. This award aims to answer multiple fundamental questions in this approach. The goals include: (i) Understanding the way quantum gravity effects affect the Mixmaster dynamics and singularities in anisotropic models and the fate of singularities in inhomogeneous spacetimes, such as Gowdy models; (ii) The way different regularization and quantization ambiguities affect the physics at the Planck scale, and how one can phenomenologically constrain these ambiguities; (iii) Exploring the consequences of polymer matter in loop quantized spacetimes; (iv) Loop quantization of black hole spacetimes; and (v) Addressing foundational issues in quantum cosmology such as quantum to classical transition and quantum probabilities. This research is expected to significantly broaden and advance our understanding of the physical implications of quantum gravity and lead to insights into the nature of spacetime beyond Einstein?s theory of General Relativity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study also aims to improve children's ability to think critically and analyze information, encourage healthier eating habits through family cooking activities, and contribute to a more diverse workforce in STEM fields. This project offers an engaging approach to promoting STEM education for underrepresented children by utilizing the power of family and familiar activities. The project is designed for the postdoctoral researcher to develop a deeper understanding of STEM education while enhancing skills in research, communication, leadership, and management. <br/><br/>Diversity within the STEM workforce is essential for a wide range of ideas and viewpoints that foster innovation and productivity within organizations. However, minoritized groups, including Latinos, are significantly underrepresented in STEM. The goal of this study is to better understand the development of STEM identities of Latino youth by way of exploration, inquiry, and mastery of STEM related skills through a culturally driven STEM program for Latino families. By way of a quasi-experimental design, over a 5-week period, the project is designed to evaluate the effects of culturally affirming, at-home, co-cooking activities on children?s STEM identity, career aspirations, and diet quality. The goal of utilizing STEM tools, a family activity guide, and a reflective journal for children is to incorporate STEM concepts into the weekly co-cooking activities which are planned to highlight specific scientific phenomena during the cooking process. In addition, this study intends to capture caregivers? and children?s lived experiences pertaining to cultural family cooking routines, family STEM conversations, and caregiver perceptions of children?s STEM identity through semi-structured interviews and audiovisual data collected through recordings of co-cooking experiences.

The data involves changes in the structure of local governments that allowed some members to be appointed while others were democratically elected. These changes in the composition of local governments allows the researchers to use modern economic methods to establish causality between democratic governance and public service provision and long-term economic growth.

Traditional methods of sampling are often time-consuming and ineffective at isolating tiny microplastics (<100 micrometers), which in fact constitute the majority of microplastics in the oceans. Moreover, while vibration spectroscopy has proven effective in microplastic identification, interpreting results through traditional library matching heavily relies on expert knowledge due to significant spectral variations caused by plastic degradation. Given the pressing need to enhance microplastic monitoring down to sizes as small as 1 micrometer in both sampling and identification aspects, this project aims to develop new methodologies for effectively monitoring small-sized microplastics in seawater in a label-free and reliable manner. The outcomes of this research have significant implications for environmental and ecological monitoring, including abundance assessments, source tracking, and analysis of microplastic degradation in the seas. These findings will also drive participation from researchers, engineers, and other stakeholders, heightening public awareness about these global issues. Ultimately, the data from microplastic monitoring will contribute to restoring the safety of our waters, allowing aquatic ecosystems to thrive again.<br/>To meet these goals, this project aims to develop a microfluidic microplastic monitoring tool that leverages both acoustofluidic particle manipulation and machine learning-assisted Raman spectral identification. The microfluidic device will provide a streamlined monitoring process capable of sampling, concentrating, and sorting microplastics in seawater down to 1 micrometer by adjusting the frequency and layout of surface acoustic waves, while also identifying seawater microplastics regardless of their degradation status through machine learning classification coupled with Raman spectroscopy. Specifically, this project will explore the use of both traveling and standing surface acoustic waves for sampling and sorting microplastics in microfluidic chips. The samples will include pristine microplastics, artificially degraded variants, and environmental microplastics, with a focus on those sourced from surface seawater in Rhode Island. A microfluidic particle trapping component will also be developed to trap microplastics at predetermined locations in a microfluidic chip, enhancing the reliability of Raman spectra acquisition by facilitating an automated process. Lastly, machine learning classification will be employed to interpret the Raman spectral data of seawater microplastics, even when they are agglomerated. The results from this project will contribute fundamental knowledge towards addressing the global challenge of plastic pollution, strengthening collaboration among academia, industry, and fisheries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One such response involves the control of gene expression via a process known as alternative polyadenylation (APA). APA is known to impact plant development and to affect the responses of plants to conditions such as elevated temperature or infection by pathogens. However, many questions remain concerning the connections between the cue (developmental or stress) and the protein machinery (the polyadenylation complex) that mediates and regulates APA. This project focuses on where and when in the plant these connections are made, and how these connections affect the composition of the machinery that mediates the process. To this end, a spectrum of tools will be brought to bear ? the activity of the complex will be assayed at the single cell and sub-cellular levels, and the composition of this complex will be studied in mutants of the model plant Arabidopsis that lack strategic protein subunits.  This research will lead to a better understanding of the growth and development of crop plants, and their responses to various stresses, the results of which will benefit crop breeding in the future.  This project will also provide training opportunities for postdoctoral scientists, undergraduate students, and faculty from a range of post-secondary institutions.  <br/><br/>Eukaryotic messenger RNA polyadenylation is mediated by a large complex (the PolyAdenylation Complex, or PAC). This project will test the model that variability in subunit composition is a key mechanism by which the plant PAC is regulated.  Three aims will be pursued.  One will test the hypothesis that the activity of the PAC varies in specific cells and tissues.  The second will test the hypothesis that the composition of the plant PAC determines its RNA substrate specificity.  The third will test the hypothesis that the composition of the functional plant PAC can vary. A diverse range of experimental approaches will be used.  The activity of the PAC will be assayed in different root cells using single cell transcriptomics approaches. The RNA specificity of the PAC will be assayed in nuclear extracts from cells lacking PAC subunits.  The compositions of complexes affinity-purified from different mutants will be determined by mass spectrometry.  This research will provide new insights into an evolutionarily-conserved complex and will impact fields of study beyond plant science.

As such, their study is important not only in physics but also in many other disciplines. With the development of quantum technologies, it has become possible to precisely engineer and measure these processes in quantum systems. Ultracold quantum gases, which consist of millions of particles cooled down to almost zero temperature, are one of the most powerful systems to study dynamical quantum effects due to their high controllability. This project aims to explore a variety of nonequilibrium processes in ultracold quantum gases. It is expected that the outcomes of the project will not only increase our understanding of these systems, but also contribute to other areas of quantum research, including quantum optics, nonlinear optics, and quantum information science. Moreover, the project involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students, contributing to the development of the next-generation workforce in quantum science and economy. The project will be tailored and expanded for potential REU students and local high school students. The PI will actively collaborate with students from under-represented groups, such as women and minority students.<br/><br/>The project aims to investigate a range of beyond-mean-field physics including scattering, dynamical instabilities, critical behavior near quantum phase transitions, and quantum fluctuations near resonances in dynamical Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs).

The PI and graduate students will develop theoretical frameworks and numerical tools to characterize the quantum and thermal fluctuation effects on the collision and thermalization of cold atoms, quantum phase transitions like the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and the performance of the spinor quantum simulator and sensor.

By implementing evidence-based teaching practices in engineering design courses from first year (cornerstone) to final senior design projects (capstone), the project aims to improve sense of belonging and retention of engineers, particularly those from historically excluded and marginalized populations.  While more individuals from these communities are enrolling in engineering programs, students often face unwelcoming academic environments. As such, this project seeks to address a critical need in the engineering community: developing and validating scalable inclusive teaming models that foster a sense of belonging in undergraduate engineering communities for all students. <br/><br/>In order to achieve the project goals, three aims are proposed: 1) identify the impact of INTEGRAL (Inclusive Teamwork for Engineering Advancement and Learning) training materials on students? sense of belonging in engineering and their ability to develop collaborative and inclusive teams across varying student demographics and university settings; 2) foster instructors? abilities to facilitate inclusive teaming through a validated train-the-trainer program, and; 3) increase sustainability and scale of inclusive teaming training by identifying what factors impede or enhance effective implementation in different university settings. The methods used in this project include both short-term (e.g. sense of belonging) and long-term (e.g. retention) components in collaboration with external evaluations. The mixed-methods approach is intended to lead to richly contextualized and generalizable data sets, transforming understanding of inclusive learning environments in STEM. The implementation and evaluation of the project's inclusive teaming educational practices seeks to impact 29,000 students and 140 faculty members across 12 campuses from two public universities. The systems focus (student, faculty, campus, and university lenses) are likely to lead to scientific advancements in how educators prepare, train, and implement inclusive teaming practices across different educational levels and institutions.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Dense biological aggregations, ranging from cellular to organismal, possess the remarkable capability to maintain favorable internal conditions despite fluctuations in the external environment. A striking example of this is observed in honeybee swarms. Consisting of a queen bee and thousands of workers, a honeybee swarm can withstand wind, rain, and temperature fluctuations by adjusting its structure as it hangs suspended from surfaces in nature for periods ranging from several hours to days. Using an integrated experimental-theoretical approach, this project will explore how the behavior of individual bees in response to their local environments collectively drives global, adaptive changes to the swarm?s structure to buffer against environmental fluctuations. Deciphering these rules could contribute to the development of self-assembling, self-optimizing adaptive materials or robotic swarms. Honeybee swarms are an accessible and engaging system for student researchers in a variety of disciplines intersecting with biology.  The interdisciplinary nature of this project will offer research opportunities to students with diverse backgrounds and interests.<br/><br/>Morphological adaptations in honeybee swarms observed in response to environmental perturbations have thus far been limited to the external surface. The internal architecture, where most of the bees reside, remains elusive. Furthermore, without a lens into the swarm?s interior, the topological and geometric changes in bee-bee connections that result in global, adaptive responses have not been characterized. The fellow will use x-ray computed tomography to visualize the dynamic internal swarm architecture in response to temperature changes and characterize the local topology and global morphology. Insights gained from experiments will inform the development of a hybrid continuum, agent-based model. This model will illuminate how honeybees utilize local information to adapt the global morphology of the swarm in response to environmental perturbations. Using this model, the fellow will explore fundamental questions about the multi-optimization of competing biological objectives in aggregations across the tree of life. The fellow will engage the local community in a project documenting the ambient environmental conditions surrounding feral swarms and observing their morphologies. Data from this community science project will be used to inform environmentally relevant conditions to prescribe in the lab experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transportation cost spaces, also known as Lipschitz-free spaces, Wasserstein spaces, Arens-Eals spaces,  and Earthmover spaces, have been used to model such problems. They can be viewed as a framework to study nonlinear metric spaces by embedding them isometrically and linearly densely into Banach spaces and provide powerful tools to study the nonlinear geometry of Banach spaces using well-known linear techniques for nonlinear problems. These spaces play a fundamental role in many areas of applied mathematics, engineering, physics, computer science, finance, and social sciences. Finding an optimal embedding is known to be a computationally hard problem and it has become a central problem in computer science to find low distortion embeddings. Using methods from the structure theory of Banach spaces and computational graph theory, the investigator?s goal is to achieve more precise estimates of these embeddings. He will obtain a deeper understanding of the structure of these spaces, which will result in several applications to the areas mentioned above. The principal investigator plans to organize conferences as well as mentor Ph.D. students as a part of this project. <br/><br/>A crucial connection exists between the L1-distortion of Transportation Cost Spaces and stochastic embeddings of the underlying metric space into trees.  The investigator will further study this connection to obtain lower and upper estimations on the distortion. The second part of the project  represents a contribution to Lindenstrauss?s program in determining Banach spaces that are primary, and that cannot be decomposed into essentially different subspaces.

This project will incorporate methods from the weather and climate fields (stochastic parameterization and ensemble modeling) to better model and predict the result of these wave-particle interactions. This project will expose the broader space physics community to these compelling tools from the weather and climate fields. This project will support a first-time early career PI.<br/><br/>Lightning-generated whistlers (LGWs) are one of the primary drivers of radiation belt electron precipitation within the plasmasphere. The primary objective of this project is to study the interaction of LGWs with radiation belt electrons using event-specific diffusion coefficients to more accurately capture the rate of pitch angle scattering and precipitation into the Earth?s atmosphere for eventual implementation into a stochastically parameterized diffusion model. Stochastic parameterization is a modeling scheme where the variables representing the sub grid physics (i.e., diffusion coefficients representing wave-particle interactions) are selected randomly from a distribution instead of using a deterministic average. This allows for explicit variance of the sub-grid physics and better error quantification through ensemble modeling. Quantifying and understanding the temporal and spatial scale sizes of the variability of each wave mode is a crucial first step in implementing a complete stochastically parameterized radiation belt diffusion model.

By focusing on high-voltage transmission lines the project investigates transmission lines as both a mechanism for achieving state targets and as objects of opposition to specific decarbonization plans. Transmission has been identified as critical for expanding renewable energy generation, facilitating electrification, and interconnecting regional grids to improve reliability. Transmission projects have been increasingly delayed or cancelled due to conflicts over siting and permitting, however, and this project therefore focuses attention on the politics of transmission development. By analyzing the determinants of opposition to this new infrastructure, this research informs processes of transmission planning, procurement, siting, and permitting, in turn contributing to the advancement of infrastructure projects with higher rates of public support. The project also contributes to the training of an early-career social scientist.<br/><br/>This study examines the extent to which prevailing explanations for resistance to low-carbon energy infrastructure adequately encompass the full range of variables that compel communities to challenge the implementation of transmission lines. Methodologically, the project considers the geographical scale at which projects are framed and contested while simultaneously focusing on the politicization of energy transitions alongside public participation in energy governance. The project has multiple objectives. First, the researchers study energy planners? justifications for transmissions lines, particularly as they contribute to regional energy transitions. Second, the research examines the perspectives of residents and other stakeholders and their respective understandings of the anticipated impacts of transmission development on environmental and energy landscapes. Third, the project considers the way in which members of the public contest plans for transmission development. Integrating interviews, document analysis, and participant observation, the project compares transmission projects in multiple locations. The research contributes to the subfield of political ecology by revealing the extent to which greater public participation in energy siting and permitting can potentially facilitate or impede energy transitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most intense light and x-ray sources are characterized by a high degree of coherence and have made tremendous contributions to the progress in science and technology.  This project investigates the coherence properties of radiation emitted in a collision of a strong laser field with a high-energy electron bunch, with the ultimate goal of producing coherent gamma rays, where a single photon has an energy higher than that of an electron at rest. Gamma-ray radiation can be used for producing matter-antimatter, for investigating nuclear material and handling nuclear waste, as well as for studying medical isotopes.  The project combines the theoretical expertise at the University of Rochester with the numerical and unique experimental capabilities at ELI Beamlines in the Czech Republic, strengthening ties between the US and Europe in the field of high-intensity lasers. The project will also contribute to maturing the science case for a potential future NSF OPAL high power laser user facility at the University of Rochester.<br/> <br/>This project will employ methods from strong-field Quantum Electrodynamics to investigate the radiation emission spectrum from an ultra-relativistic electron bunch colliding with a strong laser field.

Then, the more general case of several electrons emitting multiple photons will be treated. Methods to enhance coherence effects beyond x-ray frequencies will be developed by working in the full quantum realm and by manipulating the incoming electron beam at the microscopic level. The ultimate goal is to ascertain the feasibility of realizing a gamma-ray free electron laser (FEL), which is one of the most ambitious unrealized goals of the scientific community.

Bacteria, as simple forms of life, can adapt to various stresses and thrive in extreme conditions on Earth. This research will explore the adaptive bacterial response to two primary stressors: bacteriophage infection and the immense hydrostatic pressure faced by organisms in the deep ocean. Novel methods will be developed that will benefit the fields of fluorescence microscopy and extremophile biology. By observing wild-type and mutant bacterial cells over many generations, this project will increase understanding of life?s adaptations to phage infection and extreme environments, which can have an impact on biofuel engineering, biotechnology applications, and even in the search for extraterrestrial life. This fellowship will also support the development of a program for local high school students to gain research experience in biophysics, with a focus on engaging underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that cell membranes play essential roles in the cellular response to stresses from phage infection and high pressure. Genetic manipulation of model organisms Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and deep-sea organism Shewanella piezotolerans will be used to perturb cellular pathways hypothesized to be important in phage production and pressure adaptation. Cellular fitness will be quantified through time-resolved fluorescence microscopy of bacteria within microfluidic devices where cells are maintained in the exponential growth phase. Fluorescence reporters coupled to target mutations will quantify growth rate, cell size, and morphological integrity as a function of phage infection and exposure to high-hydrostatic pressure (HHP) up to 100 MPa. The development of this technique at HHP will contribute to the training of fellows who are passionate about the implementation of novel techniques. To characterize the mechanism of stress during phage infection, phage-infected cells will be compared with cells that produce only particular phage proteins, which are hypothesized to affect growth as they crowd the membrane space and affect biosynthetic flux across the membrane. For HHP experiments, wild-type cells will be compared with mutants of hydrostatic stress response components to determine the dominant response pathway.

The time lapse can be in a single, discrete time step or a continuous time flow. One natural way in which dynamical systems can be considered the same, called conjugacy, is through change of coordinates. That is, two dynamical systems are conjugate if there is an equivalence between the spaces which connects the way in which time steps are made. One of the central classification questions in dynamics is to classify dynamical systems up to conjugacy. This question has variations based on what it means for two systems to be equivalent, usually taking the forms of measurable, continuous and smooth equivalences. The goal of the proposal is to study the classification question from various perspectives, including generalizing the notion of a dynamical system to a group action, understanding possible values for conjugacy invariants and relaxing the notion of conjugacy to allow for time reparameterization. The proposal also includes work with students at various levels to deepen the collective understanding.<br/><br/>The proposal aims to capitalize on momentum in 3 key areas: smooth rigidity for actions of abelian groups and higher-rank semisimple Lie groups, Kakutani equivalence for flows and group actions, and flexibility for conjugacy invariants. Each of these questions is related to a classification question, the first working toward the Katok-Spatzier conjecture and Zimmer program, the second being an extension of results about Kakutani equivalence of parabolic flows to the setting of abelian group actions, and the third being a natural extension of the seminal work of Erchonko-Katok describing the possible values for topological and metric entropy for geodesic flows on surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Techniques currently used include the culturing of plant tissues, the insertion or editing of DNA, and the recovery of whole plants, but each of these steps poses challenges to the degree that they work reliably in relatively few species, and even then may not work well in all varieties of the species. To fill this gap, we propose that the parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta species) can be used to deliver gene editing molecules to a wide range of plants. Dodder plants live by attaching themselves to the stems of host plants and forming connections to withdraw water and nutrients. The organs that form the connections are called haustoria, and function somewhat similar to the way a mosquito taps into a vein to feed, and dodder is able to transmit a variety of large molecules, including proteins and RNAs, to their hosts. Another key feature of dodder is its ability to connect to an unusually wide range of host species, including the most important broadleaf crops. We will evaluate the ability of dodder to mobilize genome editing molecules into its hosts, with the goal of producing gene-edited seeds. Success in this activity would establish a novel vehicle for genetic modification of plants that is relatively simple, rapid, and broadly applicable.<br/><br/>The project will explore multiple possibilities for transferring Cas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) between dodder and hosts. Among the possibilities are the movement of these molecules from an easily transformed host, such as Arabidopsis, to result in transformed dodder, or the reverse from stably transformed dodder to result in a transformed host. Given success with these, we will explore the ability for dodder to serve as a bridge between a Cas9-sgRNA expressing donor host and a target host (e.g., tomato). The project has three major aims to achieve these outcomes, including: 1) the stable transformation of dodder (C. campestris) to be used in host gene editing, 2) the development of a dodder protoplast system for rapid screening of gene editing constructs, and 3) the development of a dodder-mediated gene editing system. Preliminary results indicate that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of dodder is possible, and the procedure will be optimized to enable generation of multiple lines bearing various transgene constructs. Other considerations include identifying promotors for the appropriate expression of gene constructs and optimized targeting for systemic trafficking of Cas9/sgRNA in the parasite-host system. For the outreach goal of this project, PIs will develop a program for refugee students to help them participate in project-related activities and develop their understanding of plant science at the University of Missouri. In summary, the project will leverage the intrinsically engaging topics of plant parasitism, RNA mobility, and genome editing to attract these students to plant science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in ML and FDA. While there have been efforts to integrate ML into the FDA field, these initiatives have predominantly concentrated on handling relatively straightforward formats of functional data. In addition, multiple student research training opportunities will be offered, and high-performance statistics software packages will be developed.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., with approximately 700,000 deaths annually from various heart conditions. Patients with coronary artery disease can suffer from unexpected heart attacks unless the blockages are removed or bypassed. Heart surgery carries significant costs for materials and tools that are currently used to harvest veins in the leg for coronary artery bypass surgery. Physician assistants and cardiothoracic surgeons have identified several issues using the current electrocautery devices on the market due to device failure during operation, added costs for the tool, added surgical time if bleeding occurs, and potential damage to the vein graft that can lead to poor outcomes after surgery. This solution has the potential to introduce a technology to reduce costs, surgical time, and damage to veins during harvesting.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a method to mechanically cut and clip veins during endovascular vein harvesting. To treat coronary artery disease patients, physicians perform a surgical procedure to replace a patient's damaged blood vessel with a suitable graft that is harvested from elsewhere in the body. The most common blood vessel used is the great saphenous vein in the leg. Harvesting is currently performed with electrocauterization tools that can cause unnecessary harm to the patient and result in poor patient outcomes. Electrocautery has been observed to fail to effectively seal the larger blood vessels while harvesting, damage tissue, and fail to cut through side vein branches. This technology is a purely mechanical tool that can cut through a blood vessel while clamping the side branches of veins shut. The tool is designed to provide physicians with a simpler, safer tool for harvesting procedures, which ultimately benefits the patients undergoing these procedures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Training activities will increase participation of underrepresented minorities and will focus on marketable skills that empower and help retain individuals in higher education and STEM jobs.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to launch a multi-annual research program investigating interactions between microbial plankton and deoxygenation in human-impacted coastal waters. The project will fill a key knowledge gap by simultaneously examining communities of bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes. Microbial processes lead to, and are influenced by, coastal hypoxia. This project will use the summer progression of deoxygenation in a eutrophic estuarine embayment as a ?natural laboratory? to quantify changes in microbial community structure and functioning in hypoxia versus normoxia. Methods will combine field work, cell counts (microscopy, flow cytometry), DNA sequencing (metabarcoding, shotgun metagenomics) and experimental quantifications of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton consumption by microeukaryotes. Environmental data, microbial abundances, taxonomic and functional genetic profiles, and prey consumption rates will be used to test hypotheses on changes in feeding interactions and metabolic potential as summer progresses. Results will improve the understanding of microbial effects on (and responses to) hypoxia, and will help predicting trophic and biogeochemical shifts under current and future dissolved oxygen levels in coastal waters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By developing an innovative volumetric carbon flux approach, this technology aims to provide a scalable and accurate method for quantifying the effectiveness of various ocean-based CDR strategies. Ocean carbon dioxide removal, capable of extracting up to 5 gigatons of CO2 annually from the atmosphere, is crucial for achieving the global imperative of removing 10 gigatons of atmospheric CO2 annually to limit warming to 1.5-2C. By introducing an accurate, scalable solution for measuring ocean carbon removals, the proposed technology has the potential to accelerate the expansion of the ocean CDR market to $25 billion by 2030 and up to $500 billion annually by mid-century. The successful implementation of this technology would significantly advance our scientific and technological understanding of carbon cycles, support environmental sustainability, and foster substantial economic growth in a sector critical for global climate mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to tackles the critical challenge inhibiting the ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) industry from achieving its potential to remove up to 5 gigatons of CO2 annually: the absence of precise measurement tools to accurately quantify ocean CO2 removal. The research objectives for this phase include developing and validating a mooring-based sensing grid capable of delivering three-dimensional carbonate chemistry data with the sensitivity necessary for continuous and direct measurement of net carbon removal in various ocean CDR projects. The proposed research entails designing, implementing, and testing the sensing grid to ensure it meets the stringent requirements necessary for effective deployment in ocean carbon dioxide removal environments. Anticipated technical results include achieving measurement sensitivity, accuracy, and reliability, necessary to continuously measure net carbon removals for a wide variety of ocean CDR methods. Successful completion of this phase will lay the groundwork for subsequent phases aimed at piloting and refining this technology with ocean CDR developers, potentially establishing the first direct measurement system for carbon removal efficacy in the ocean CDR sector.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Techniques currently used include the culturing of plant tissues, the insertion or editing of DNA, and the recovery of whole plants, but each of these steps poses challenges to the degree that they work reliably in relatively few species, and even then may not work well in all varieties of the species. To fill this gap, we propose that the parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta species) can be used to deliver gene editing molecules to a wide range of plants. Dodder plants live by attaching themselves to the stems of host plants and forming connections to withdraw water and nutrients. The organs that form the connections are called haustoria, and function somewhat similar to the way a mosquito taps into a vein to feed, and dodder is able to transmit a variety of large molecules, including proteins and RNAs, to their hosts. Another key feature of dodder is its ability to connect to an unusually wide range of host species, including the most important broadleaf crops. We will evaluate the ability of dodder to mobilize genome editing molecules into its hosts, with the goal of producing gene-edited seeds. Success in this activity would establish a novel vehicle for genetic modification of plants that is relatively simple, rapid, and broadly applicable.<br/><br/>The project will explore multiple possibilities for transferring Cas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) between dodder and hosts. Among the possibilities are the movement of these molecules from an easily transformed host, such as Arabidopsis, to result in transformed dodder, or the reverse from stably transformed dodder to result in a transformed host. Given success with these, we will explore the ability for dodder to serve as a bridge between a Cas9-sgRNA expressing donor host and a target host (e.g., tomato). The project has three major aims to achieve these outcomes, including: 1) the stable transformation of dodder (C. campestris) to be used in host gene editing, 2) the development of a dodder protoplast system for rapid screening of gene editing constructs, and 3) the development of a dodder-mediated gene editing system. Preliminary results indicate that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of dodder is possible, and the procedure will be optimized to enable generation of multiple lines bearing various transgene constructs. Other considerations include identifying promotors for the appropriate expression of gene constructs and optimized targeting for systemic trafficking of Cas9/sgRNA in the parasite-host system. For the outreach goal of this project, PIs will develop a program for refugee students to help them participate in project-related activities and develop their understanding of plant science at the University of Missouri. In summary, the project will leverage the intrinsically engaging topics of plant parasitism, RNA mobility, and genome editing to attract these students to plant science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is great public awareness of the importance of understanding how viruses infect animal hosts and spread throughout a community. However, host-pathogen interactions in plant systems are less well understood, despite the considerable impact of plants on our lives. This project focuses on Potato virus Y (PVY) that can cause an 80% loss in the yield of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), the fourth-most important crop worldwide. To improve understanding of how this virus circumvents host immunity and spreads through the host, the PI proposes to develop easy-to-use biochemical tools to detect and modify this plant pathogen and to better understand the molecular drivers of viral infectivity. Detecting viral spread will enable identifying early outbreaks of this plant disease to mitigate the impact on the associated agricultural industry. Understanding the molecular drivers of viral infectivity will aid in developing resistant commercial cultivars. The project also provides a framework for introducing undergraduates to viral biology using model organisms and to classic biochemistry techniques in the context of experiential learning.    <br/><br/>Building upon the PI?s prior work with plant models and investigating host-viral interaction, this project aims to develop and validate two biochemical tools to address two major hurdles to studying how PVY establishes infection in plant hosts: the inability to track the virus as it spreads through the host and the ability to identify the contributions of specific viral sequences to circumventing host immunity. The first tool, a synthetic PVY viral clone, will facilitate the targeted design of chimeric viruses, enabling the identification of the genetic determinants of viral infection. The second tool, an enzymatic reporter probe, will enable viral detection earlier in infection. Together, these tools will enable investigating the virus-host interactions PVY uses to hijack the host and spread throughout the plant. Understanding the protein- protein interactions that enable PVY to establish infection is essential to developing resistant cultivars. To build research capacity, the project will engage students in cross-disciplinary research as part of laboratory-based and course-based activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like many organizations in the private sector, state courts have begun to look closely at the potential for integrating AI technologies into their operations. There are many ways in which AI might improve court operations and enhance the courts? services to the public, including improving caseflow management, interfacing with court users and helping them navigate court systems, or aiding substantive legal decision making to improve case outcomes. However, the stakes involved in implementing new AI technologies in this sector are also high; courts have duties to safeguard the constitutional rights of court users, and the decisions they make can be life-altering. These high stakes make it vital that courts are involved in the selection and development of these technologies from the ground up. This project aims to contribute to the science of organizations by examining the effects of organizational and team attributes on AI integration potential. It also generates new knowledge and resources for the state courts: an interactive tool that visualizes multi-layered network models of the state court workforce and reports and resources that provide actionable guidance related to AI implementation in the courts. In the long run, facilitating the successful integration of AI into the state courts through organizational research has the potential to increase access to the courts for court users, make court workforces more diverse and employment outcomes more equitable, increase efficiency in case processing, and bolster public trust and confidence in the courts.<br/><br/>This three-year project brings researchers and court professionals together to 1) map the state court workforce using a multiteam systems approach and 2) identify points in the court workflow where AI integration might be more beneficial or detrimental to the courts? organizational goals. First, the project team uses an extensive workforce survey and social network analysis to map the court workforce and the roles of individuals and teams within it. The researchers examine the structure of the workforce; interrelations among different workers, tasks, activities, and skills; impacts of individual workers on the caseflow process; and workers? perspectives on the potential roles of AI in their work. Second, the project team uses these network models to predict potential impacts of AI at different points in the caseflow process. The researchers also identify AI applications with the greatest potential to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of these job-holders, promote job satisfaction and well-being, and align with the goals and purposes of the state courts in society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award will also support early career scientists and engineers attending the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) held during the two days before the GRC meeting at the same place. The goal of the 2024 GRC and GRS on Granular Matter is to significantly enhance the rate of progress in understanding granular materials in complex settings relevant to many disciplines. To do so, these meetings are designed to meet the following objectives: 1. Presentation and discussion of unpublished, novel findings from researchers of a wide range of backgrounds; 2. Cultivation and promotion of emerging junior researchers, particularly, those from underrepresented groups; 3. Provide opportunities for extended discussion periods and interaction among researchers of different disciplines, backgrounds, and professions whose paths do not normally overlap. This year?s invited sessions are cross populated by researchers with backgrounds in geoscience, physics, materials science, engineering, and applied mathematics. Various activities for diversifying the impact of the meeting are included, such as a career panel with participants from different sectors and a program on inclusion, equity, and professional development.<br/><br/>Granular matter, conglomerations of particles or of particles and fluids, is abundant in nature and industry, studied in multiple science and engineering disciplines. Much is now known about the dynamics of relatively simple particulate systems (e.g., narrow size distributions of spherical particles) at low solids concentrations, and inroads have been made into behaviors of denser systems. Yet, fundamental questions remain out of reach for more complex systems including: (1) angular/aspherical particles (2) widely dispersed in size and density, (3) interacting via complex forces (e.g., via interstitial fluids). To address these fundamental challenges requires efforts from scientists and engineers coordinated across research fields. The biannual GRC and GRS provide platforms for researchers to discuss and exchange recent developments in granular matter and unmet needs across disciplines. The meeting chairs and vice-chairs are experts in granular media at different career stages and work in complimentary disciplines. The meeting structure emphasizes presentations of new work, and discussion among researchers from disciplines that typically do not have intersecting platforms. The GRC/GRS provide time for: (1) formal discussion after every talk (guided by a discussion leader), (2) time in the afternoons for informal follow-on discussions and late afternoon poster sessions, and (3) shared meals, all of which maximize interactions between participants across backgrounds during the meeting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, face recognition systems have broadly proliferated across various industries, including commercial and governmental domains. Automated face recognition enables many applications including identifying individuals on social media, locating missing persons, assisting law enforcement and surveillance activities, and authenticating personal identities. Unfortunately, there are still significant concerns which prevent automated face recognition by smaller organizations. This technology makes face recognition systems both auditable and finely tunable. These properties can potentially mitigate many of the concerns that have prevented widespread deployment. Consequently, face recognition deployments, if used in conjunction with this technology, will become more acceptable while increasing efficacy and improving fairness properties.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a system to generate synthetic face data, to be used to audit and tune face recognition systems. This technology is based on generating synthetic face data though novel systematization of text-to-image generative image architectures. Users can synthesize high-quality faces for different text-specified facial semantics. These generated faces may be subsequently used to assess face recognition model performance or to tune under-performing systems. Synthetically generated faces have a high degree of utility when natural face images are too expensive or are otherwise impossible to collect. The recent literature shows that face recognition systems, in practice, exhibit hard-to-detect conditional failure modes. These failure modes imply that face recognition systems are not robust to changes in inputs and have demographic disparities. This solution debugs failures in current face recognition systems through well-curated synthetic data. The  approach to face recognition validation and tuning was preliminary verified by a human study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extracting biological knowledge regarding gene regulation mechanisms of cells from multiple sources of heterogeneous omics data is a significant computational challenge, which is critical for leveraging the data to address various biological problems such as how genes are regulated under different biological conditions and how genotypes (e.g., genetic mutations) cause phenotypes (e.g., physical features). The overarching goal of this project is to develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on transformers to infer gene regulatory relationships (i.e., gene regulatory networks) from omics data more accurately than before. The pretrained transformer tools can be broadly used to study gene regulation in various biological systems such as bacteria, plants, and animals. The publicly released course materials, web sites, videos, databases, software tools, tutorials, user manuals, and the online learning community on social networks will boost gene regulatory network modeling in bioinformatics and AI. The course modules and training activities will enrich both AI and bioinformatics education at middle/high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. The combination of AI and omics data analysis will promote the diversity in AI, computing, and bioinformatics by attracting and training underrepresented minority and women students. The project will engage the local public and the Missouri State Legislature to advocate for the importance of scientific research for the society and economy.<br/><br/>This project aims to achieve three specific objectives: (1) developing transformers to predict transcription factor binding sites on chromosomes/genomes from omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and protein sequence and structure data; (2) developing self-supervised graph transformers to infer gene regulatory networks by integrating omics data and transcription factor binding site predictions; and (3) develop graph transformers to infer gene regulatory networks from single-cell omics data via transfer learning. The first self-supervised learning-based transformers to tackle this problem will improve the accuracy of inferring gene regulatory networks over existing unsupervised methods. The self-supervised learning will overcome the weakness of existing supervised methods not effectively dealing with the problem of lacking labelled data.  The transformers can predict entire gene regulatory networks as graphs, leveraging the inter-dependence between multiple transcription factor-gene regulations that the current supervised methods of predicting the regulatory relationship for one pair of transcription factor and gene a time cannot. Moreover, the graph transformers use uniform graph representations to integrate multiple modalities of omics data under the same graph framework, which are more scalable and effective than the existing methods that use different ways to process different data. Furthermore, the transformers can predict gene regulatory networks from the data of both single cells and a population of cells (bulk cells) and use transfer learning to fine-tune the models pretrained on bulk-cell data to improve the highly challenging single-cell gene regulatory network inference for the first time, which is likely much more effective than the existing methods of separating the gene regulation inference from bulk-cell and single-cell omics data as two independent problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The last decade has seen rapid growth in satellite launches as well as space explosions which profoundly worsen the space debris environment, particularly in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Debris smaller than 5 cm is not detectable by current radar and optical techniques, remains in orbit for many years, travels at 5 miles per second and, therefore, poses serious collisional hazards to operational spacecraft and the inhabitants of the International Space Station (ISS). Ultimately, the concern is that the number of space objects beyond a certain threshold will trigger an unintended exponentially growing avalanche of fragments making LEO unusuable.The only option then is orbit maneuvering and it requires knowing the orbits of each of the debris pieces hours or days ahead of time. The proposed technology is a step toward a comprehensive space surveillance system to ensure sustainable use of the Earth?s orbits.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an optical solution for space debris detection using a small array of telescopes and algorithms implemented on GPU-based parallel computing platforms.

Also known as synthetic tracking, the technology has been successfully utilized to detect large numbers of near-Earth asteroids for planetary protection. The same method is likely to benefit detection of small objects in LEO. However, it is computationally more challenging because the LEO objects move across the camera view much more rapidly. This requires taking 100x more picture frames per second, requiring the analysis of petabytes of data. More importantly, processing of these many frames is computationally more demanding. On the other hand, the sensitivity gain is significantly more, potentially allowing the detection of sub-cm objects. In contrast to building massive and expensive radar and optical telescopes, this project aims to provide a sustainable and low-cost solution to track millions of particles to provide protection for space assets now and eventually for human inhabitation of space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past decade, several methods have emerged which first estimate a model from a range of choices, and then fit the estimated model to extract useful trends and predict future outcomes. However, predictive accuracy, on its own, has limited explanatory value and point estimators with high uncertainties may lead to poor replicability down the line.  Yet, most such models, supervised or unsupervised, lack uncertainties for the related estimators. This project introduces a new class of perturbation methods to quantify uncertainties in machine learning models, with various applications in regression, classification, and dimension reduction. The research plans have three main goals.  The first goal is to develop methods that can be used with different types of data and are not limited to specific models. The second goal is to ensure that the methods can be scaled and applied to decentralized datasets on multiple machines. The last goal is to create versatile methods that can be used with different estimation techniques. An overarching goal is to allow researchers to apply these techniques to various data types and forms, without being constrained by unrealistic assumptions or limited methods for model estimation. The project's educational and outreach plans are closely tied to its research plans. The project will help the PI conduct summer training programs with K-12 outreach, develop new curricula, and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the field.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop methods for attaching uncertainties to the outputs of model estimation methods. The research agenda is structured into three main aims. In the first aim, the project will introduce distribution-free methods that can quantify uncertainties in a flexible class of semiparametric models. In the second aim, the project will develop distributed methods that use decentralized data from a cluster of nodes to quantify uncertainties in an estimated model. These methods will need only basic, aggregated statistics from each node and will be accompanied by communication-efficient algorithms. In the third aim, the project will focus on developing perturbation methods as a versatile approach for uncertainty quantification that can be used in a wide range of model estimation algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised.  To achieve these aims, the project will use perturbation to exploit a link between the geometric properties of estimators and their underlying probability, and will employ an integrated approach using mathematical statistics, probability theory and optimization. Throughout the project and after its completion, the methodology and open-source software will be applied to improve biomedical decision-making and replication in health studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With technological advances in data collection, HD2 data occurs in medicine (from neuroscience to patient care), finance and economics, geosciences (such as earthquake data), marine science (fishing and shipping), and, of course, in internet data. This research project focuses on how to extract information from HD2 data, and how to turn this data into knowledge. As part of the process, the project develops cutting-edge mathematics and statistical methodology to uncover the dependence structure governing HD2 data.  In addition to developing a general theory, the project is concerned with applications to financial data, including risk management, forecasting, and portfolio management. More precise estimators, with improved margins of error, will be useful in all these areas of finance. The results will be of interest to main-street investors, regulators and policymakers, and the results will be entirely in the public domain. The project will also provide research training opportunities for students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the project will focus on four linked questions for HD2 data: contiguity, matrix decompositions, uncertainty quantification, and the estimation of spot quantities. The investigators will extend their contiguity theory to the common case where observations have noise, which also permits the use of longer local intervals. Under a contiguous probability, the structure of the observations is often more accessible (frequently Gaussian) in local neighborhoods, facilitating statistical analysis. This is achieved without altering the underlying models. Because the effect of the probability change is quite transparent, this approach also enables more direct uncertainty quantification. To model HD2 data, the investigators will explore time-varying matrix decompositions, including the development of a singular value decomposition (SVD) for high frequency data, as a more direct path to a factor model. Both SVD and principal component analysis (PCA) benefit from contiguity, which eases both the time-varying construction, and uncertainty quantification. The latter is of particular importance not only to set standard errors, but also to determine the trade-offs involved in estimation under longitudinal variation: for example, how many minutes or days are required to estimate a covariance matrix, or singular vectors? The investigators also plan to develop volatility matrices for the drift part of a financial process, and their PCAs. The work on matrix decompositions will also benefit from projected results on spot estimation, which also ties in with contiguity. It is expected that the consequences of the contiguity and the HD2 inference will be transformational, leading to more efficient estimators and better prediction, and that this approach will form a new paradigm for high frequency data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ultrasound, though, is portable and generally low cost. Recently, wireless ultrasound probes have revolutionized how and where ultrasound can be used, bringing the imaging method directly to the patient bedside. However, due to the complexity of the hardware, the data available from these wireless systems are limited and ultimately only represent a two-dimensional snapshot of a three-dimensional (3D) tumor. To address these challenges, the goal of this Engineering Research Initiation award is to develop a novel low-cost system capable of generating 3D ultrasound volumes at the patient bedside and quantitatively analyze images from this system to extract features that detect cancer. This award will also promote the development of a hands-on ultrasound curriculum at the undergraduate level as well as immersive and engaging ultrasound activities for elementary and middle school students, increasing awareness of ultrasound imaging and the role of engineers in the medical world.<br/><br/>This project aims to engineer a low-cost, point-of-care, 3D wireless ultrasound system and determine optimal quantitative biomarkers that can be extracted from this system to diagnose breast cancer. To undertake this interdisciplinary work, the research will be focused into two main objectives. The first objective will establish quantitative tools using both traditional signal processing and artificial intelligence to extract ultrasound-derived biomarkers from wireless ultrasound data and evaluate their ability to improve breast cancer diagnosis. The second objective will focus on the development of a robust calibration, registration, and sensor fusion protocol to create 3D tissue volumes using a wireless ultrasound probe and a low-cost commercial sensor. The results of these studies have the potential to establish a new foundation for future innovation in accessible ultrasound technologies and increase access to critical cancer screening tools in low-resource settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important vehicle for implementing AI frameworks is machine learning.  The most popular machine learning model is the artificial neural network.  It takes inspiration from the human brain. Despite the key role neural networks have played in the rapid AI advancements in the last decade, how they make decisions is not easily interpretable by humans.  This is a key shortcoming that prevents its wider use in some application domains, such as medical and legal, where understanding the reasoning behind decisions is very important.  This project offers a novel approach, called differentiable logic networks, to tackle this problem. In addition to being interpretable, these networks are also highly energy- and memory-efficient.  Thus, they can be placed on energy-constrained devices, such as smartwatches and smartphones, bringing AI closer to us. The project results will be transferred to the industry through various active engagements.  It will train a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in this emerging field. The research outcomes will be included in an undergraduate course on Machine Learning. This project also will provide education in microelectronics to high school students through the Princeton Laboratory Learning Program.  Broad dissemination of research to the academic and industrial communities will be achieved through published papers, posters, and seminars. In addition, various tools and models will be distributed online for the benefit of other researchers. <br/><br/>Differentiable logic networks consist of layers of logic operators trained through gradient-based optimization.  Their decisions are easily interpretable because of their reliance on logic rules. They primarily consist of a network of two-input neurons that perform binary logic operations. All the connections among neurons are single bit with unit weight. They achieve accuracies competitive with those of traditional neural networks. Differentiable logic networks differ from neural networks in three major ways: (i) they transform inputs into binary values, (ii) instead of matrix multiplications, they perform logic operations, and (iii) connections in network layers are very sparse, primarily because each neuron accepts only two inputs. They have two-fold training objectives: (i) determine which Boolean function each neuron should implement and (ii) establish how the neurons should be connected. Both problems are discrete, making direct use of common neural network training optimizers, like gradient descent, unsuitable for the task. This project will lead to synthesis methodologies that address this problem along various axes:  (i) relaxation of the discrete search space to make the synthesis approach continuous and differentiable, (ii) freeze, discretize, and prune network layers progressively from inputs to outputs to make the network very compact, (iii) tackling of the vanishing gradient problem, (iv) development of a new normalization method for such networks, and (v) efficient exploration of the design space.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) and Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK12) programs.

Cartilage damage in the knee inevitably leads to a painful condition known as osteoarthritis which affects over 20 million people in the United States. There is currently no cartilage repair method suitable to repair the tissue following injury, or to halt/prevent progression towards osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis affects 36% of athletic populations and 94.4% of military populations following injury. For patients who are under 45 years of age, this means there are extremely limited options to delay the progression of the debilitating joint disease. Currently, the only straightforward solution surgeons cite as truly successful is a knee replacement, but this is not recommended until a patient is over the age of 65 due to the lifetimes of knee replacements and complications associated with revision surgery. The novel material explored in this project can be implanted to heal tissue defects, improving quality of life and preventing progression of knee joint degeneration.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a natural, two-part material for cartilage repair. The first component is a tightly packed slurry of small particles which are composed of the complex proteins found in human cartilage. The second component is a soft gel, that, when mixed with the particles and introduced to the temperature of the body, becomes a strong cartilage-like structure. The novel material forms tissue that closely mimics the natural layered structure of cartilage and the underlying bone. Additionally, the material is ?flowable? to allow for easy delivery to the injury. Initial analysis of the material has shown that the natural structure integrates well with the tissue around the injury and performs similarly to cartilage under loading and sliding ? the key movements involved in the knee joint during everyday movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Radically new technological approaches are therefore needed to sustain rapid advances in computing and data storage capabilities across domains of science and technology ranging from financial modeling to bioinformatics, drug discovery, and data storage and encryption. The awarded molecular memory and computing framework based on programmable biological deoxyribonucleic (DNA) molecules offers an innovative, scalable approach to overcome fundamental limitations of current state-of-the-art computing and data storage approaches. Individual nanometer-scale DNA templates are investigated to test the limits of their data storage and computing capabilities. Unique spatial positioning of DNA data stores and compute nodes are patterned across large-scale wafers to facilitate rapid read-out, as well as enable interfacing with conventional electronic and optical data storage and computing media. Fundamental questions include the density of data that can be realized within individual DNA objects and their collections on-surface, the fidelity of data storage/read-out and computing that can be realized, and the parallelization of this storage and computing for eventual two-dimensional (2D) device applications to optical computing and data storage. This biological computing platform fabricated using DNA will engage students from disparate fields and disciplines that are typically isolated, including computer science, biological engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology. Under-represented groups in these disciplines including women will be engaged on campus and through summer programs to mentor them towards graduate and post-graduate careers. This project will therefore help train students for the next-generation workforce enabling a transition to the Bioeconomy, with sustainable materials engineering for next-generation computational and data storage devices.<br/><br/>Whereas DNA conventionally stores genetic information biologically, it also offers nanoscale patterning and control over materials for alternative data storage and computing approaches. Molecular computing as a field has harnessed this sequence-controlled, information containing property of DNA to perform intricate algorithmic operations and efficient data storage and retrieval. However, these systems generally operate in solution and are largely incompatible with surface-based optical and electronic storage and computing media. In the present project, nanometer-scale DNA origami assemblies are patterned on 2D silicon surfaces to ?display? data in a chip-like format. By leveraging the functionality of DNA origami templates, fluorescent barcodes and particles are displayed on the structure to provide optical readout that can be parallelized across large micron-to-millimeter scale substrates. Lithography is used to pattern DNA origami across the substrate with spatial and orientational control, and methods to uniquely identify each origami are explored to enable their use as individual data storage and computing units. Distinct DNA origami template shapes with lithographically patterned matching shapes enable heterogeneous placement on-surface, with parallel imaging offering unique identification of origami objects on the wafer-scale. Nanoparticle placement on origami units offers encoding of unique data stores on each DNA origami template. Incorporation of molecular qubits on these structural DNA origami templates offers optically based computing using quantum gates in a parallel manner that may in principle operate at room temperature. Altogether, transformative approaches to on-surface data storage and computing are explored that offer new strategies to overcome current limitations of conventional data storage and computing media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The United States is exceptional in that these tests are provided by private companies that earn revenues from fees paid by students who take the tests.  The Principal Investigator is studying how revenue generation shapes the design of these tests and in turn how the design impacts the admission prospects of students across the spectrum of economic and educational circumstances of American students.   Numerous distortions are engendered by the profit motive.  Tests are less informative about student ability than would be ideal.  Students with strong educational backgrounds are bunched into near-perfect scores making it impossible to further distinguish them.  Tests are designed to make it difficult for students with weaker educational backgrounds to achieve scores that show their true ability.  Policies like test-optional, regulatory intervention, or even a centralized publicly administered test are examined.<br/><br/>The research combines the frontier theoretical tools of information design and mechanism design to study the optimal design of a screening test.  Novel features of this screening environment create new challenges for the analysis.  For example, the problem fails the classical revenue equivalence framework necessitating an alternative approach for characterizing optimal menus.  Moreover, the pattern of binding incentive constraints at an optimum is dramatically different than the typical setting.  The research therefore brings a whole new set of analytical tools that will be useful for furthering the study of screening tests, for example in application to the variety of certification intermediaries like pharmaceutical testing, account auditors, insurance and underwriting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Addressing the needs of underserved disease communities presents both a societal imperative and a unique business opportunity. While repurposing allows companies to build off of existing safety and efficacy data for already approved drugs, companies frequently depend on external consultants to support such development, which can be slow, expensive, and error-prone. This project?s primary benefits would be: (1) enabling smaller, more streamlined teams to spearhead drug repurposing development, significantly reducing associated costs, and (2) catalyzing significant growth in the market for drugs targeting orphan diseases via the adoption of a more competitive cost structure. It could improve efficiency in the regulatory process by integrating knowledge across publicly available data sources, optimizing drug targets and candidates, and assembling this information into a coherent development plan with a high probability of scientific and regulatory success. Such increased efficiency may lead to a greater throughput of repurposing discovery, expansive growth of the market, and increased availability of repurposed drugs. <br/><br/>The proposed project addresses the problem that drug repurposing development plans mandated by the FDA require significant time and effort in searching multiple databases to mitigate biological, regulatory, and legal risks. Automating this process using software systems could accelerate drug discovery and reduce development costs but is complicated by the heterogeneity of the knowledge organization of data required to create such plans. This project proposes a tool which, given a drug target and the current list of FDA-approved drugs, will generate a repurposing development plan. The tools developed in this project are based on recent advances in automated reasoning and knowledge extraction using Natural Language Processing. The project will extend these advances in novel ways to make them radically more useful and trustworthy, and a natural fit to heterogeneous biological data. This includes ways to provide references in support of a given claim of knowledge made by the system across multiple knowledge sources and ways to create a cogent narrative from a list of claims and create a report from the narrative. The resulting tool will create referenced and cross-checked reports for drug candidates, ready for review and submission to the FDA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its focus is on the development of Bayesian methods for low-information settings.  Bayesian methods have proven to be tremendously successful in high-information settings where data is of high-quality, the scientific/business background that has generated the data is well-understood, and clear questions are asked.  This project will develop a suite of Bayesian methods designed for low-information settings, including those where (i) the data show particular types of deficiencies, such as a preponderance of outlying or ?bad data?, (ii) a limited conceptual understanding of the phenomenon under study leads to a model that leaves a substantial gap between model and reality, producing a misspecified model or a model that is not fully specified, and (iii) when there is a shortage of data, so that the model captures only a very simplified version of reality.  The new methods will expand the scope of Bayesian applications, with attention to problems in biomedical applications and psychology.  The project will provide training for the next generation of data scientists. <br/> <br/>This project has two main threads.  For the first, the project will develop diagnostics that allow the analyst to assess the adequacy of portions of a posited model.  Such assessments point the way toward elaborations that will bring the model closer to reality, improving the full collection of inferences.  These assessments will also highlight limitations of the model, enabling the analyst to know when to make a decision and when to refrain from making one.  The second thread will explore the use of sample-size adaptive loss functions for modelling and for inference.  Adaptive loss functions have been used by classical statisticians to improve inference by exploiting the bias-variance tradeoff.  This thread will blend adaptivity with Bayesian methods.  This will robustify inference by providing smoother likelihoods for small and moderate sample sizes and by relying on smoother inference functions when the sample size is limited.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, precision farming and soil testing for soil health management is limited by ?wet chemistry? laboratory testing methods that require extensive sample handling and produce chemical waste. This technology may offer commercial soil testing capabilities that use locally tailored calibration models made to service clientele from specific regions, with low labor demands and no chemical waste. The goal is to connect current soil testing services with ?big data? and remote sensing in agricultural systems. The use of this technology may allow the connection between precision farming and soil testing for soil health management to meet the growing demand for improved access to soil health measurements as well as data to inform policy and management decisions.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of soil spectral libraries (n > 3000 spectra) and predictive models for quantifying agronomically important soil properties. The technology uses mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy and an instrument that allows a seamless interface with the world?s largest MIR spectra library.  Other testing technologies are based on near-infrared (NIR) technology and rely on either local or undisclosed and unverifiable spectral libraries. In soil analyses, MIR regularly outperforms NIR because it captures fundamental vibrations with much higher resolution and provides superior measurement of soil properties. In addition, this technology can quantify multiple soil properties with a single scan, compared to traditional soil analyses that require lengthy procedures for each property of interest. In the future, the goal is to leverage both local and national spectral libraries and existing soils data from potential customers. This soil analysis tool may put more information into the hands of land managers leading to better decisions and positive ramifications for building soil health and sequestering carbon in soils.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With technological advances in data collection, HD2 data occurs in medicine (from neuroscience to patient care), finance and economics, geosciences (such as earthquake data), marine science (fishing and shipping), and, of course, in internet data. This research project focuses on how to extract information from HD2 data, and how to turn this data into knowledge. As part of the process, the project develops cutting-edge mathematics and statistical methodology to uncover the dependence structure governing HD2 data. It interfaces with concepts of artificial intelligence. In addition to developing a general theory, the project is concerned with applications to financial data, including risk management, forecasting, and portfolio management. More precise estimators, with improved margins of error, will be useful in all these areas of finance. The results are of interest to main-street investors, regulators and policymakers, and the results are entirely in the public domain. The project will also provide research training opportunities for students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the project will focus on four linked questions for HD2 data: contiguity, matrix decompositions, uncertainty quantification, and the estimation of spot quantities. The investigators will extend their contiguity theory to the common case where observations have noise, which also permits the use of longer local intervals. Under a contiguous probability, the structure of the observations is often more accessible (frequently Gaussian) in local neighborhoods, facilitating statistical analysis. This is achieved without altering the underlying models. Because the effect of the probability change is quite transparent, this approach also enables more direct uncertainty quantification. To model HD2 data, the investigators will explore time-varying matrix decompositions, including the development of a singular value decomposition (SVD) for high frequency data, as a more direct path to a factor model. Both SVD and principal component analysis (PCA) benefit from contiguity, which eases both the time-varying construction, and uncertainty quantification. The latter is of particular importance not only to set standard errors, but also to determine the trade-offs involved in estimation under longitudinal variation: for example, how many minutes or days are required to estimate a covariance matrix, or singular vectors? The investigators also plan to develop volatility matrices for the drift part of a financial process, and their PCAs. The work on matrix decompositions will also benefit from projected results on spot estimation, which also ties in with contiguity. It is expected that the consequences of the contiguity and the HD2 inference will be transformational, leading to more efficient estimators and better prediction, and that this approach will form a new paradigm for high frequency data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DNA is packaged into the nucleus in the form of chromatin, consisting of a complex between DNA and histone proteins. DNA wrapped in compacted histones is thought of as ?repressed? and ?inaccessible?, and thus chromatin compaction plays a critical role in regulating gene activity. Current chromatin modeling is based on polymer simulations at different levels of resolution. However, given the slow time scales of these processes of the order of minutes to hours, the size scales of the order of 5--10 um (typical size of nucleus) are not accessible using methods such as molecular or dissipative dynamics approaches. The objective of this project is to decode the quantitative relationship between the physical microenvironment, multiscale 3D genome organization, and transcriptional output. The project will employ a convergent research strategy that integrates super-resolution microscopy, genomics, biophysical modeling and simulation, and machine learning. The new tools developed in this project will impact many areas in biology, including normal and abnormal tissue development, tissue degeneration in disease, as well as tissue regeneration. The research team will educate future scientists and a diverse workforce with a collaborative expertise in interdisciplinary training. Additional outreach activities will include research experiences for undergraduate students and high school students.<br/><br/>Tissue-resident cells continuously sense changes in their chemo-physical environment and use this information to maintain their phenotype and tissue homeostasis. The project will develop a predictive framework of emergent epigenetic and transcriptional features of cells in response to changes in their physical environment. The project will develop new quantitative models for the distribution of heterochromatin domains in the interior of the nucleus as well as along the nuclear periphery. Specifically, a mathematical model will be developed to study the effect of rates of histone tail acetylation, methylation, and transcription on determining the distribution of heterochromatin domains in the interior of the nucleus. The project will further extend this model to include the formation of lamina-associated domains (LADs) by incorporating the energetic interactions between chromatin and the nuclear lamina via chromatin anchoring proteins. To verify the theoretical model, cells of fixed fate and fluid fate will be grown under varying micro-environments, and their whole genome organization at the nano- and micro-scale will be visualized and quantified through super-resolution microscopy. In addition, a machine learning framework leveraging novel deep neural operators will be developed for nonlinear inverse problems to extract the high-dimensional parameter fields implicitly and explicitly from noisy experimental images. To enhance the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of neural operators with small data, the project will endow neural operators with prior knowledge, physics, multifidelity data, and active learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will significantly advance the methods and theory for nonparametric learning in high-dimensional survival data analysis, with a specific focus on causal inference and sequential decision making problems. The study will be of interest to practitioners in various fields, particularly providing useful methods for medical researchers to discover relevant risk factors, assess causal treatment effects, and utilize personalized treatment strategies in contemporary health sciences.

The results are not only important for the understanding of the fundamental collision dynamics, but they also fulfill the urgent practical need for accurate atomic data to model the physics of stars, plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres. The short-pulse intense-laser part of the project requires accurate solutions of the time-dependent Schrdinger equation on a numerical space-time grid. With the rapid advances currently seen in computational resources, such studies can now be undertaken for realistic systems, as opposed to idealized models. This work is important to facilitate further developments in the imaging and control of submicroscopic reactions, which in turn are expected to have broad impact by reaching out from physics to chemistry and ultimately biology. Many experimental efforts worldwide are supported through the present project, which will also train a post-doctoral associate and several research students.<br/><br/>Most of the numerical calculations will be based upon the non-perturbative close-coupling method, with the goal of pushing the expansion to convergence by including a sufficient number of low-lying physical bound states as well as pseudo-states to account for the coupling to the remainder of the infinite Rydberg spectrum as well as the ionization continuum. The group has contributed to the development, and hence has access to, some of the most sophisticated all-electron codes currently available to provide accurate quantitative predictions. These include the highly flexible B-spline R-matrix (BSR) implementation with non-orthogonal orbital sets to solve the close-coupling equations (developed in the PI's group at Drake University) and the R-matrix with Time Dependence (RMT) suite of codes developed in Belfast. While BSR was originally designed for time-independent processes (atomic structure, electron collisions with atoms and ions, weak-field photoionization), the group will adapt the output (multi-electron Coulomb and dipole matrix elements) from BSR to serve as input for RMT. This interface is expected to result in an accurate and efficient time-propagation scheme for solving the time-dependent Schrdinger equation for the interaction of intense short-pulse lasers with complex atomic targets. To assist in the understanding of the complex processes involved, simpler models such as the popular single-active electron approximation (SAE) will also be used for comparison between the predictions and the experimental data obtained in several collaborating laboratories. Continued student involvement in testing the numerical methods and associated computer codes, as well as visualizing the results, is expected.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical field of dynamical systems concerns the evolution of systems over time, including real-world systems such as the weather, traffic patterns, and planetary systems.  Some of the most important examples exhibit chaotic behavior. Parabolic dynamics encompasses one class of dynamical systems with chaotic behavior, and renormalization is a powerful tool for uncovering its properties. This conference seeks to bring leading international researchers together to discuss systems that extend beyond parabolic systems and understand techniques that would expand the scope of renormalization and discover new techniques for studying such systems.<br/><br/>Examples of parabolic dynamical systems include horocycle flows on hyperbolic surfaces and, more generally, unipotent flows in homogeneous dynamics, smooth area-preserving flows on surfaces, and nilflows on nilmanifolds. If we allow for the presence of singularities, it also encompasses the study of interval exchange transformations (IETs) and translation flows. More recently, another example that has attracted a lot of attention is the horocycle flow in the moduli space of translation surfaces. Many important examples of parabolic flows also arise from models in mathematical physics, such as the Ehrenfest model of Lorentz gases, systems of Eaton lenses, and the Novikov model, leading to flows on Fermi energy level surfaces in solid-state physics. A key technique used to study parabolic systems is renormalization, an idea that originated from physics, entered dynamical systems decades ago, and has become an increasingly powerful tool for understanding the long-term behavior of many classes of parabolic dynamical systems. This conference seeks to bring together leading researchers from around the world to share their recent advances with the community, which would include US-based graduate students and postdocs.

That is, is it easier or harder to learn a new word that either sounds like or is similar in meaning to words the child already knows? Answering this question benefits parents and educators with information about how best to expose children to new words. Children are tested online and do not need to come to a university campus; therefore, this project expands knowledge on language development in children who come from a wide range of socioeconomic, educational, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. This research also provides opportunities for training two graduate students from groups traditionally underrepresented in science. These students are role models for students from similar backgrounds who make up a large proportion of the undergraduate student population where the research is conducted. Finally, this research involves many undergraduate student researchers (including from groups underrepresented in science), who gain important skills for career readiness in the workforce through their work on this project. The exposure that students get to young children also provides them with information about whether they would like a career working with or studying this population.<br/><br/>This project uses priming methods with 24-month-old children to ask if a newly learned word is affected if we ""prime"" children?s memory of it by preceding the new word with a word that the child already knows that shares either meaning or sound with the new word. Researchers teach children new words for objects from familiar categories, such as vehicles and animals, for which individual children produce many words. If a word for a new animal (e.g., raccoon) connects with a child?s existing knowledge of animals, then hearing a related word first (e.g., dog) should affect how much time it takes for children to identify a picture for a newly learned word (e.g., raccoon) compared to a picture of another newly learned word (e.g., carriage), relative to being primed with an unrelated word (e.g., cup). Similarly, if a new word (e.g., carriage) sounds like a word that the child already knows (e.g., cat which starts with the same sound), then seeing a picture of a cat before seeing a picture of the newly learned carriage should affect how much time it takes the child to identify the picture of the carriage vs. another newly learned word that starts with a different sound. This research not only asks how words that children already know affect how they learn new words but it also seeks to determine the time course of new words as they become connected with toddlers? existing vocabulary. Research has already shown that adults more readily connect new words with known words that share meaning or sound if they learn words through contrastive labeling (which is learning a new word in the context of a known word) compared to direct labeling (which is simply showing a new object and saying its name).  This project asks if toddlers are similar to adults in this regard, thereby providing a life-span view of language learning. Comparing these word teaching methods provides further information to parents and educators about how to expose young children to new words for greatest success in language learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plasma flows that change direction from one region to another are said to be unstable and spontaneously generate turbulence, which creates magnetic fields that are tangled instead of smooth.  In this project, computer simulations will be used to explore how magnetic fields are created in turbulent plasma systems and how these magnetic fields become smooth.  Examples of such systems include the generation of zonal flows observed in fusion plasma devices and are analogous to the bands that are seen in the atmosphere of Jupiter.  This project will also examine how the large magnetic field structures that are seen in these flows break up and re-form to understand when and why this happens.<br/> <br/>This award supports a study of the formation of large-scale anisotropic structures in three-dimensional (3D) magnetized plasma turbulence driven by a maintained unstable shear flow. The project builds on prior studies of two-dimensional (2D) magnetized plasma turbulence showing the sequestering of magnetic energy at large scales due to the excitation of a stable mode conjugate to the Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable mode. It also builds on analyses of 3D hydrodynamic turbulence, which have showed the generation of a zonal flow via a process involving the interaction of 2D unstable modes, weakly driven 3D unstable modes, and a conjugate stable mode.  A versatile numerical modeling code Dedalus will be used for the project, employing newly developed diagnostics to track spectral energy transfer within the system.

PTPs are a family of enzymes that play crucial roles in regulating cellular signaling processes. A characteristic feature of these enzymes is a flexible region that plays an important role in controlling catalytic activity. However, it is not well understood how the flexibility of this region is regulated. The proposed experiments will explore how these motions are achieved in archaeal PTPs and evolutionary ancestors. The proposed work will shed light on the role of enzyme dynamics in evolution, and will ultimately impact multiple fields from drug discovery to protein engineering. This pursuit allows graduate students to acquire specialized training in computational biophysics, structural biology, enzyme biochemistry, and NMR spectroscopy. The project includes outreach and mentorship activities to increase the participation of women and other underrepresented students in STEM. Further, the project endeavors to bring science to the general public through participation in festivals, lecture series, and radio broadcasts.<br/><br/>This research project seeks to quantitatively characterize the evolution of loop motion and allostery in archaeal protein tyrosine phosphatases, by using advanced biomolecular simulations, intimately coupled with X-ray crystallography, kinetic characterization, and NMR spectroscopy. This will be achieved through characterization of both several extant PTPs, as well as a range of ancestral archaeal PTPs predicted from ancestral sequence reconstruction. Comparison of these enzymes to human and bacterial PTPs will shed light into the factors governing loop motion in PTPs, and how it has changed over evolutionary time. This provides important fundamental insight into enzyme evolution more broadly, as well as identifying features that can be exploited for protein engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the protein and amino acid composition that has evolved to be most adaptive to the soybean itself is less than ideal for the nutrition of humans and their livestock. For example, most soybean seed storage proteins are poor in the essential, sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine. Attempts to modify the amino acid and protein content of the soybean seed by means of agricultural biotechnology have encountered a phenomenon termed 'rebalancing', where the plant compensates for the forced reduction of one type of seed storage protein by increasing expression of other proteins, such that the overall protein content and amino acid composition is maintained within tight margins. Rebalancing has been observed in many crop species including pulses, oilseeds, and cereals. This team of four investigators seeks to better understand how the plant genome guides the protein and amino acid composition of its seeds. To this end the gene expression will be measured over the time course of soybean seed development with a panel of complementary techniques. The data will be analyzed using a mathematical representation and machine learning techniques. The success of this project may allow molecular biologists and breeders to better predict which genetic changes can deliver the desired effects on the nutritional quality of seed crops.<br/><br/>The regulatory mechanism that underlies the rebalancing of the seed proteome is not well understood. The project is guided by the hypothesis that rebalancing is due to homeostatic constraints at multiple levels, including transcription and amino acid supply, but experimental data as well as theoretical considerations suggest that translational control deserves special attention. Using CRISPR gene editing, the Stacey lab recently engineered a new, genetically robust model system for rebalancing, with modifications in both a major soybean seed storage protein (beta-conglycinin) and amino acid synthesis (methionine). The project will collect multi-omic datasets over the developmental time course of soybean seed development. In Aim 1, data from the transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and metabolome will be compared between wild type and rebalanced seeds. Data will be integrated by mathematical modeling to identify potential drivers of rebalancing and their developmental timing. Aim 2 implements experiments and machine learning to pinpoint potential, nonintuitive mechanisms of rebalancing. This includes a novel test of the intellectually intriguing but controversial 'specialized ribosome' hypothesis, which states that translational control is exerted by biochemically distinct types of ribosomes. The broader impacts of this project include training of researchers in multi-omic data integration, including undergraduates participating in a program for deaf and hard-of-hearing students, a population underrepresented in science. The US is one of the two largest producers of soybeans in the world, and a deeper mechanistic understanding of seed storage protein production may increase its nutritional quality, sustainability of production, and diversity of uses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such tools have revolutionized the study of biochemistry and signaling in live mammalian cells, providing new insights into when and where cellular reactions occur. The biggest limitation of the existing toolkit is that most biosensors are made out of the same fluorescent proteins so multiple biosensors can?t be used simultaneously to different metabolites. This project will develop a new class of biosensors based on RNA. The biosensors will be comprised of a series of RNA modules that are like building blocks that can be mixed and matched to create different structures. Biosensors will be built for the two main metabolites in the methionine cycle of one-carbon metabolism. One-carbon metabolism is the main biochemical cycle that drives cellular growth. In this cycle, different nutrient inputs are used to power the synthesis of cellular building blocks, including DNA, polyamines, and amino acids. Biosensors for the two central metabolites of this cycle will enable researchers to study their dynamics and flux through the cycle in rapidly growing cells. Broader impacts of this project include the creation of a toolkit of fluorescent RNA biosensors available to the scientific community, recruitment of multiple undergraduate students and graduate students from diverse backgrounds and diverse disciplines, and the development of a research-based undergraduate class.  Additionally, the work has potential to reveal metabolic alterations in various disease states.<br/> <br/>This project will build a suite of fluorescent RNA-based biosensors for metabolites in the methionine cycle of one-carbon metabolism. One-carbon metabolism is a major pathway that regulates anabolic processes that drive growth of cells and organisms. The ability to monitor metabolic flux over time in live cells has the potential to transform understanding of fundamental biology. Over the past decade a handful of studies have established the proof-of-concept of monitoring metabolites in live cells using RNA-based sensors, however these biosensors have focused upon observing only a few metabolites and do not take advantage of the best fluorescent dyes in current use. This project will take this class of biosensors to the next level by designing and implementing a set of ?plug-and-play? modules, systematically defining design principles, standardizing the approach for generating biosensors and establishing a pipeline for validating and benchmarking sensors in mammalian cells. The project will leverage naturally occurring RNA riboswitches as the metabolite sensing domain and couple this domain to a fluorogenic RNA-aptamer that binds and turns on a fluorophore in the presence of the metabolite of interest. The project will generate sensors for the primary carbon donor in cells, S-adenosylmethionine, and its product form resulting from methyl group transfer, S-adenosylhomocysteine. The project will also develop a robust pipeline of design-test-validate in mammalian cells that can be used to expand the RNA biosensor toolkit in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experiential learning, a pedagogical approach that engages students in hands-on experiences, improves students? conceptual understanding of abstract concepts and enables them to connect theoretical knowledge learned in the classroom to real-world situations. In this IUSE Level 2 Engaged Student Learning project, experiential learning acquired through in-class physical experiments using low-cost desktop learning modules (LCDLMs) is compared with that acquired through web-based interactive digital experiments (WIDEs). Although both LCDLMs and WIDEs offer educational institutions a cost-effective, accessible way to provide high-quality laboratory experiences in engineering, this potentially transformative project seeks to directly compare the efficacy of LCDLMs and WIDEs. The main advantages of WIDEs are that they are inexpensive, highly scalable, easy to maintain, and deployable across digital devices. The collaborating institutions ? University of Colorado Boulder and Washington State University - intend to make the WIDEs experiments freely available to engineering and engineering technology students online, through the widely used LearnChemE website and on YouTube. Comparative assessments will be made at five institutions, including a minority-serving institution.<br/><br/>The project is expected to generate transformative new insights on teaching through virtual and physical experiments by identifying contexts in which physical (LCDLMs) may be more beneficial, as well as identifying how to improve virtual experiments (WIDEs) to best achieve specific learning objectives. Fifteen WIDEs for each of three engineering courses and two new LCDLMs will be created. The WIDEs will be prepared using JavaScript and/or Python so they play directly in most browsers thus permitting use on Windows-based or Apple computers, as well as iPads and other tablets. For WIDEs, the accompanying screencasts will be recorded and processed using special software (Camtasia), then embedded on pages within the WIDE. Additionally, the same screencasts will also be located on a YouTube channel so that they reach the widest possible audience. The hypothesis that WIDEs will achieve comparable learning outcomes to LCDLMs will be tested through a quasi-experimental design study in which students from a given class will be randomly assigned to use either the simulation (WIDE) or the physical experiment (LCDLM). All students will be given the same pretest before the activity and post-test after the activity to measure cognitive gains.

To properly understand the biological consequences of such nanomaterials, new methods are needed that can track their distribution and biochemical effects, especially for newly emerging precision therapies based on RNA. Professors Vachet and Rotello are developing new imaging approaches that can simultaneously reveal the locations and effects of polymeric nanomaterials in tissues. The proposed imaging methods rely on new chemical tagging strategies and sophisticated laser-based mass spectrometry tools that will enable nanomaterials to be quantified in tissues. The ability to quantify these nanomaterials and the therapies that they carry has the potential to help guide the design of safer and more effective therapeutic delivery systems. In addition, new computational tools will be developed that may be extendible to other applications that require high resolution and site-specific molecular information. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the project, and these students will obtain training in cutting-edge mass spectrometry and nanotechnology.<br/><br/>This collaborative study from the Vachet and Rotello groups will develop new molecular mass tags that when combined with laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS (MALDI MS) is expected to yield quantitative spatial information about nanomaterials, their therapeutic cargo, and their biochemical effects in tissues. Moreover, these molecular tags will enable a multiplexed imaging approach that allows multiple polymeric nanomaterial designs to be imaged simultaneously in mice, facilitating therapeutic optimization while avoiding overuse of mice. The new molecular tagging strategies will also facilitate the computational fusion of the mass spectrometry methods with fluorescence imaging methods, resulting in high-resolution, information-rich data that will provide unprecedented insight into the fate and effect of nanomaterial therapeutic delivery systems.

Further, this project investigates, in the event of an incident, how counterfactual reasoning can be applied to identifying the cause of the issue and re?ne or harden the analyses or software to prevent future incidents. This project provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in topics including program testing, verification, vulnerability detection, and software security via research projects and dedicated course modules.<br/><br/>The project first develops the logical and semantic foundations for compositional assurance reasoning, where modal operators such as possibility and necessity are used to express truth derived from under-approximate (incomplete) analysis and truth derived from over-approximate (complete) analysis, respectively. Reasoning principles to compose results from different types of analysis are built around these modal operators. To be concretely applicable to the analysis of programs for assurance, a Kripke semantics based on the program execution semantics is defined to give meaning to the logical formulas. Next, this project develops counterfactual reasoning principles to aid the re?nement of the analysis and repairing programs when an incident occurs. The expressiveness, effectiveness, and ef?ciency of the reasoning systems are evaluated via case studies drawn from security incidents reported in recent years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of research experiences in undergraduate education is demonstrated by the increased retention and improved future success of students who engage in research experiences during the first two years of undergraduate education.  Access to research for students at universities is typically common; however, opportunities for research experiences by two-year college students is highly variable, depending on faculty teaching loads, faculty expertise, and institutional investment in research.  This Engaged Student Learning, Level 3 project aims to implement and sustain research experiences in two-year colleges, and to improve basic knowledge of genetics and current gene editing technology by faculty and their students. Faculty at two-year colleges will be trained in a gene editing protocol, guided in curriculum development, provided with material resources, and connected with other faculty through academic networks.  Assessment of the project should advance our understanding of the feasibility and sustainability of research experiences in two-year colleges.  This project is expected to improve equity in science education for students in underserved academic programs, to build a more inclusive and diverse STEM workforce trained in current technologies.<br/><br/>The goal of this five-year project is to bring a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), to two-year colleges nationwide, using CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas gene-editing technology.  Summer workshops during the funding period will initially provide hands-on training for faculty in the specific steps of a modular, CRISPR gene editing protocol in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe).  Workshop participants will be provided with the basic equipment needed to implement the protocol at their schools and will be guided to develop curriculum plans for their specific courses.  The protocol allows for distinct modules to be integrated into existing course curricula and has been successfully piloted in various academic settings.  Faculty participants will also be provided with ongoing knowledge support and training videos.  In addition, participants will be connected to a national community through the CRISPR In the Classroom Network (CICN) for collaboration and refinement of the protocol.  In years two through five, prior workshop participants will attend follow-up workshops, which will train faculty in more advanced uses of CRISPR and will foster collaborations between new and returning participants.  Focus groups and assessment of the project during its duration will identify and address barriers to implementation and sustainability of the CURE.  Validated surveys will be used to assess the knowledge gains and confidence of faculty participants and their students.  All protocols and project materials will be freely available to academic institutions through programs such as CICN and InnovATEBIO.  Results of the project will be disseminated through academic journals and presentations at conferences for STEM targeted education, such as the National Association of Biology Teachers, the Association for Biology Laboratory Education, and AAAS-ARISE.

The fellowship supports the research and training of the fellow who will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Some of the most fundamental questions in understanding the Rules of Life are: where do genes come from, and why do they evolve? This question is tackled by studies that identify and characterize genes that have recently appeared (in evolutionary terms) through the comparison of closely related species? genomes. These studies show that while most newly evolved genes appear as duplicate copies of pre-existing genes, a small but important fraction of these genes appear to evolve de novo from regions of the genome that did not previously contain genes. As we currently have a relatively poor understanding of why different species make new genes from scratch, this research aims to test a new theoretical model explaining this process by examining the influence of the genome?s organizational structure on new gene birth. <br/>	<br/>Prior models of de novo gene origination remain unsatisfying as they fail to explain the low likelihood of mutational processes driving 1) widespread, tissue-specific transcription and 2) the avoidance of post-translational decay of nascent polypeptides. The new cultivator model of de novo gene origination mitigates these problems by hypothesizing that the appearance of a new promoter provides a crude but rapid path toward modulating the expression of older, neighboring genes. This research has three primary components. This research first traces the evolutionary histories of de novo genes identified in Drosophila melanogaster while also producing a comparative evolutionary analysis of transcriptional control of spermatogenesis. The work then comprehensively characterizes the regulatory activity for extant, reconstructed ancestral, and synthetic de novo gene promoters in a high-throughput manner. This work will thus infer fundamental mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Finally, the work systematically screens for enhancer-promoter and promoter competition effects in de novo genes, revealing deeper insights into the interplay between enhancer and promoter elements. This work integrates the mentorship of a cohort of talented high school students from underrepresented backgrounds, first through weekly programming over the academic year, and then via one-on-one summer lab mentorship. This project also helps to increase neurodiversity and raise visibility for mental health issues in academia by establishing an easily accessible peer support network for those struggling with invisible difficulties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The landscape of the Sandhills consists of grass-covered sand dunes overlaying the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast underground reservoir that supports diverse communities of plants and animals. The most diverse and abundant animals in the Sandhills are the little known and seldom observed microscopic nematodes. Nematodes have adapted to a wide range of Sandhills habitats, from pristine groundwater-fed streams to alkaline lakes with a water chemistry that restricts most other forms of life. It is unknown what allows nematodes to survive in these extreme environments. However, given the combined effects of climate change and groundwater depletion, the Nebraska Sandhills provide a natural experiment to study the forces that drive diversity and adaptations in this ubiquitous group of organisms. This research will provide insights into how nematodes respond to environmental shifts resulting from the changing climate. Graduate and undergraduate students will engage with a multidisciplinary team of researchers to address these topical questions.  <br/><br/>Of specific interest to this research are freshwater nematodes in three families (i.e., Tobrilidae, Plectidae, and Monhysteridae) representing three evolutionarily distinct lineages known for their physiological and morphological plasticity but also critical to understanding nematode evolution and phylogeny. There are three main research objectives: 1) describing new species from three targeted nematode families, 2) determining their spatial distributions across the Sandhills, and 3) establishing their taxonomic and ecological context. To accomplish these objectives, three Sandhills regions will be sampled including Alkaline Lakes in Year 1, Sheridan and Cherry Counties in Year 2, and the eastern Sandhills in Year 3 for a total of 128 samples. Samples will be collected from a wide range of aquatic habitats such as lakes, fens/wet meadows, and streams/rivers. Each sample will be split into four aliquots and subsequently used for archiving, individual nematode specimen morphological and barcoding analyses, community metabarcoding and mitochondrial metagenomics, and biochemistry. These data will then be analyzed phylogenetically, and other analyses will include species delimitation, phylogenetic endemism, and multiple regression models and co-occurrence networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These structures are of interest both intrinsically and for potential practical applications. Deliberate manipulation of the phase and intensity of light beams can create patterns in three dimensions that have focal lines along curved paths, rotate or transform the light's transverse pattern as it travels, or have points along its wavefront that oscillate in unison but with patterned orientations. The goal of this research project is to explore techniques for the creation of novel three-dimensional patterns including those that may be of interest for applications. The PI and his undergraduate research team will look for inspiration in the connections between optical beams in the laboratory and other physical systems, such as - on the cosmic scale ? the deflection of light by gravity around astrophysical objects and ? on the microscale ? oscillations of a pendulum governed by quantum mechanics. Connecting these diverse physical systems and size scales is possible due to the similarities in the mathematical structure of these problems and the wave equation of the light. Within this framework, the research team will also investigate communication via the rotation of patterned beams and new types of optical beams with low divergence. Similarities between quantum entanglement and wave behavior also give rise to new parallels that are of interest to pursue. In addition to basic research, the team will incorporate research outcomes into undergraduate laboratory experiences thereby making a direct connection between research and undergraduate classroom/lab instruction. The training of undergraduate students in basic research, and the development of instructional laboratories which can be used by many institutions, will help prepare students to join the emerging quantum workforce.<br/><br/>The manipulation of light?s degrees of freedom in polarization, spatial mode, momentum, energy, and photon number can lead to novel patterns in three dimensions that are of fundamental interest and can lead to applications in biomedical imaging and communications. Via table-top optics experiments, amenable to the undergraduate setting, the PI and his students will study novel problems that harness the similarity in mathematical structure between light?s wave equation and other physical systems, such as cosmic gravitational lensing and atomic and molecular nonlinear oscillations. The outcomes are three-dimensional patterns that carry caustics and vortex singularities, which are novel in their own right and can be exploited for new applications. One such application is in communications where the information is encoded in the rotation of beam patterns. At the quantum level, parallels between photon entanglement and classical optical metrology are also expected to harness new types of non-local metrology. This award will support the continuation of an ongoing program in the development and dissemination of instructional quantum optics laboratories which serve to connect research with instruction.

A powerful way to probe the interior is to measure the energy from earthquake waves as they travel through the complex Earth. Available seismic methods do not have sufficient resolution to describe these features to understand their origin and nature. Improving resolution requires the development of efficient and accurate methods for the computation of how seismic energy travels through these features, to be compared to what is observed at seismograms across the globe. The project team proposes a new algorithm, ?Distributional Finite Difference Method? (DFDM) which presents advantages relative to the most efficient codes presently available by allowing for flexible model geometry without degrading the accuracy of the computation. This approach also shows potential for increased computational speed, as this type of work is computationally heavy and requires access to high performance computing facilities. This project will develop a computer code based on DFDM, compare results with those from available methods, and illustrate its use for modeling regions of extreme physical properties at the base of the mantle. The code will be made available to the community through the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG) portal as a contribution to geophysical infrastructure while supporting the education and professional development of graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career scientists.<br/><br/>As higher spatial resolution is sought in global seismic imaging to investigate the nature of small scale objects, the complexity of meshing, accuracy of the wavefield, and soaring computational time at high frequencies represent significant challenges, justifying continued efforts to design the next generation of numerical wave propagation codes. Flexible methods may take advantage of variable resolution requirements for different locations within a 3D model. This approach keeps the wavefield computation accurate and maintains competitive computational costs in comparison to codes such as the SPECFEM suite, which is based on the spectral element method (SEM). The newly developed versatile Distributional Finite Difference Method (DFDM) shows promise for application in global seismology, with some potential advantages compared to the SEM. DFDM combines the simple structure of the pseudo-spectral/finite-difference methods (FD) with accurate treatment of boundary conditions including free surfaces, as in spectral element-based techniques. This method also accurately accounts for material discontinuities and non-conformal interfaces, via an element-wise domain decomposition, where elements can be arbitrary large, depending on the medium?s geometry. In DFDM, the accuracy is independent of the size of the elements, such that elements can be large in regions where the model is smooth. In addition to its flexibility and accuracy, preliminary benchmarks of the algorithm prior to parallelization and optimization show that the DFDM is computationally faster for the same accuracy when compared to SEM in complex 3D models. DFDM therefore represents an attractive alternative to SEM-based approaches once parallelized and optimized. This team will implement, parallelize, and optimize a novel seismic wave propagation solver, based on this novel algorithm to combine advantages of the spectral element method widely used in global seismology, and of the Finite Difference method. The DFDM shows promise for application in global seismology and for modeling of fine scale structure in the deep Earth. The project will benchmark the resulting code against the highly optimized SPECFEM3D_GLOBE and provide an illustration of application to a complex ultra-low velocity zone (ULVZ) model at the core-mantle boundary. The final product will be a platform-independent, efficient package (?app?) for distribution to the seismology community through the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG) portal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The solar wind compresses the Earth?s dipole magnetic field on the dayside and pulls it into a magnetic tail on the nightside, just like the tail of a comet. In this long and stretched magnetic tail, an explosive process called magnetic reconnection is prevalent. This process converts the magnetic energy in the stretched magnetic tail into particle jets and heating of the ambient plasma. Sometimes the heating is low, and sometimes it is very high. In this project, hundreds of reconnection jets in the Earth?s magnetotail will be studied using in-situ spacecraft observations to find out what controls the degree of the plasma heating. The results will contribute to understanding how particles are energized and the plasma is heated during magnetic reconnection in other astrophysical and laboratory environments, and will help to understand and predict the drivers of the space weather on Earth. <br/><br/>Magnetic reconnection is a universal plasma process which converts stored magnetic energy into particle energies. One of the key unresolved questions in reconnection research is what controls the degree of ion heating in reconnection. Past observational studies of ion and electron heating scaling in reconnection have focused on the low heating regimes of the magnetopause and the solar wind. These studies have found that both ion and electron heating in reconnection are linearly proportional to the available magnetic energy per particle. However, independent observational and theoretical studies have suggested that the linear dependence of ion heating may not be universal. To test the universality of the linear scaling of ion heating, observations of reconnection in the high heating regime are required. The Earth?s magnetotail provides a natural laboratory in the high heating regime where in-situ spacecraft can observe reconnection in action. This project will conduct a comprehensive study using spacecraft observations of reconnection in the Earth?s magnetotail to establish the characteristics and controlling factors of ion heating.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One feature that these applications often share is that the high-dimensional unknown is believed to satisfy a complexity-limiting, low-dimensional structure.  Specifics of the posited low-dimensional structure are mostly unknown, so a statistically interesting and scientifically relevant problem is structure learning, i.e., using data to learn the latent low-dimensional structure.  Because structure learning problems are ubiquitous and reliable uncertainty quantification is imperative, results from this project will have an impact across the biomedical, physical, and social sciences.  In addition, the project will offer multiple opportunities for career development of new generations of statisticians and data scientists.<br/><br/>Frequentist methods focus on data-driven estimation or selection of a candidate structure, but currently there are no general strategies for reliable uncertainty quantification concerning the unknown structure.  Bayesian methods produce a data-dependent probability distribution over the space of structures that can be used for uncertainty quantification, but it comes with no reliability guarantees.  A barrier to progress in reliable uncertainty quantification is the oppositely extreme perspectives: frequentists' anathema of modeling structural/parametric uncertainty versus Bayesians' insistence that such uncertainty always be modeled precisely and probabilistically.  Overcoming this barrier requires a new perspective falling between these two extremes, and this project will develop a new framework that features a more general and flexible perspective on probability, namely, imprecise probability.  Most importantly, this framework will resolve the aforementioned issues by offering new and powerful methods boasting provably reliable uncertainty quantification in structure learning applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Entanglement is a quantum mechanical property in which the behavior of two molecules is correlated, even when they are well-separated from each other. However, to entangle two molecules, they must have the same energy, which is difficult to achieve in molecular systems. Entanglement is also fragile, and once it is created, it can be lost through decoherence. Professor Hood and his students will employ laser-induced tuning to bring arrays of molecules into resonance (i.e., make their energies equal) and observe the decoherence of entangled states by measuring correlations of the emitted photons. Their discoveries could lead to advancements in quantum-based technologies for computing, encryption, and communication. Additionally, the project will contribute to developing a quantum-enabled workforce by providing research opportunities and outreach programs to a multi-disciplinary group of students.<br/> <br/>Currently, quantum light with many photons is inefficiently generated from single photons. A novel approach to addressing this issue involves utilizing multiple emitters to create many-photon entangled light. However, this strategy faces challenges when working with solid-state emitters, particularly in bringing lifetime-limited solid-state emitters into resonance. This research aims to tackle these challenges through two main objectives. The first goal is to integrate organic molecules into nanophotonic cavities and waveguides, thereby enhancing photon collection efficiency and the zero-phonon line. By doing so, the system's overall performance can be significantly improved. The second goal focuses on bringing multiple coupled molecules into resonance and generating entangled states between the emitters and photons. This step is crucial for creating high-fidelity quantum states of light that are essential for various applications. The outcomes of this work are expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of decoherence in collective quantum states. Furthermore, it aims to provide a scalable method for producing high-fidelity quantum states of light, which have significant potential in fields such as quantum-enhanced sensing, imaging, and secure communication.

The Partnership for Integration of Computation into Undergraduate Physics (PICUP) has been working for the last several years to build a community of educators to support this mission. This IUSE level 2 Institutional and Community Transformation (ICT) project will leverage the growing PICUP community to establish regional workshops throughout the country that will be sustained in the years to come through local leadership within each region. These regions have been specifically selected in order to maximize PICUP's impact on Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Two Year Colleges (TYCs), with the goal of assisting physics faculty from at least 50% of the nation?s bachelor?s granting physics departments and 25% of TYC departments in their endeavors to integrate computational activities into their physics courses.  <br/><br/>Alongside the regional faculty-development workshops, the project will build national community through national workshops and leadership development. The project supports research to investigate students' learning in computational physics across a variety of contexts.  The research results will drive the development of an assessment framework for student learning of computation in undergraduate physics courses. Instructors from TYCs and other special-focus institutions will be included in the assessment framework research, which will help support the inclusion of students who are historically understudied in physics education research. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This effort has come together under the Global Ecosystem Research Infrastructure (GERI) to tackle challenges in understanding the biosphere?s response to environmental changes, providing crucial information to researchers, managers, and decision-makers alike. We now seek to extend GERI to include networks and infrastructures from currently unrepresented regions and countries. As part of establishing a strong foundation in GERI, the founding networks have developed a robust cross-cultural understanding and social fabric within which they operate. GERI?s NoN roadmap, network activities, and scientific goals build upon this foundation. Since each network has its own cultural identity?including individual-to-national ways of working, perceptions, biases, strengths, science disciplines, challenges, and synergies?bringing new networks into GERI requires careful consideration of these diverse attributes and how they manifest in building a more inclusive and effective NoN. This workshop proposal is designed to assess the cultural framework and roadmap the inclusion of five Mexican networks into GERI. The workshop aims to (i) engender ownership and belonging among these networks within the GERI NoN, thereby facilitating an inclusive partnership; (ii) bring together early-career representatives from each network who will integrate GERI into their ongoing professional careers; and (iii) begin roadmapping an equitable process for the inclusion of new networks from underrepresented regions into GERI.<br/><br/>The Global Ecosystem Research Infrastructure (GERI) aims to enhance our understanding of and response to environmental changes affecting our planet. Our goal is to expand GERI by incorporating additional networks from regions and countries that have not yet been represented. The GERI network is built on a strong foundation of diverse cultural practices and scientific approaches from its founding members. As we integrate new networks, it?s crucial to consider their unique cultural identities and ways of working to enhance the network?s overall effectiveness. This specific workshop focuses on integrating five Mexican networks into GERI. The workshop aims to make these networks feel a part of GERI, helping them recognize the benefits and contributions they can bring to this international effort. We will also start to plan how to include more networks from other underrepresented regions fairly and effectively. The workshop will gather early-career professionals from these Mexican networks, who will use GERI throughout their careers, helping them to build their skills and understanding of global ecological challenges. It?s also an opportunity to learn from each other and apply these insights more broadly in future collaborations. In short, this workshop is not just about integrating these Mexican networks into GERI; it's about preparing the next generation of scientists to work collaboratively across borders and disciplines, fostering a diverse and inclusive global scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, algorithms steer individuals to different news and video con tent based on personal characteristics, thus affecting informational similarity or diversity across people. Since rational agents make strategic decisions based on what they think others know and what they will do, these changes in the informational environment can significantly influence the outcomes of various socioeconomic events. For example, information similarity may affect whether citizens in different geographies with different information can coordinate a protest against an authoritarian government or whether investors with private information about a bank?s health decide to run on it. This project studies economic environments in which agents share a common goal but not the same information. It builds the tools to formally study changes in information similarity and how they impact incentives in strategic environments. In particular, it addresses the question of whether and when increases in information similarity facilitate achieving a common goal. The research findings will provide a better understanding of the welfare consequences of the recent changes in informational similarity, and can inform the design of policy interventions. The methodological contribution of the project will be of independent interest outside of social science in statistics.<br/><br/>As a first step, the project develops the methodological tools to answer these questions. This involves developing a new order of information similarity that captures the simple idea that as information becomes more similar, conditional on an individual?s private information, she assigns a higher likelihood that others have observed the same information. The literature so far lacked a general measure of information similarity appropriate for incomplete information games. This new notion of information similarity is applied to study classic collective action problems in which individuals want to achieve a common goal, but also want to free-ride. Examples of collective action include protests, regime changes, or voting in committees. An individual may privately learn that reaching the goal is socially beneficial but may still not take the costly action. Her decision depends on what she believes about the information that others have and thus what they will do. The fundamental observation is that greater similarity of information among agents, even those with identical preferences, can act as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, if people believe that others are more likely to have the same information as them, they may be able to coordinate better to reach the common goal. On the other hand, the temptation to free-ride may be exacerbated: If an agent knows that others have the same information and predicts that they will take action, then she does not need to take a costly action herself. The project characterizes precisely when more similar information across individuals helps participation in collective action problems: In particular, more similar information facilitates (impedes) achieving a common goal when achieving the goal is sufficiently challenging (easy). This insight is applied to show why resilient regimes face larger protests while weak regimes face smaller protests as information becomes more similar, and why diversity in committees is beneficial when each vote carries more weight. Finally, the project studies the effect of increased information similarity on behavior in classic coordination games like a bank run. A key methodological result is an equivalence between increasing the similarity of information and expanding the set of equilibria in a class of coordination games.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new EP technology will directly benefit satellite operators by potentially extending the operational lifespan of their satellite fleet with its high propellant utilization capability. It will also offer solutions for safely removing end-of-life space objects from orbit by utilizing its high thrust capabilities for de-orbiting. Furthermore, the innovative EP system opens opportunities for deep space applications, such as deflecting asteroids, which were previously only achievable using high-impulse systems like the gridded ion thruster (GIT). Overall, the new EP system holds immense potential for commercial and scientific advancements in the space industry.  <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the concept and feasibility for an innovative EP system that enables various on-orbit service activities. The project aims to combine two distinct electric propulsion technologies, namely the GIT and the Hall thruster (HT), into a single ion thruster known as the Gridded Hall thruster (GHT). This integration will involve specific performance measurements and characterizations to evaluate the success of this novel combination. The GHT addresses the limitations associated with individual technologies. It overcomes the low thrust limitation of GIT and the low specific impulse of HT, as well as mitigates the inherent process instabilities like the ionization-induced instability found in HT. By doing so, the GHT achieves optimal performance and extends its usable lifetime. Additionally, the GHT offers another potential significant benefit. It enables neutralizer-free electron generation, which simplifies the ion thruster architecture and improves overall efficiency. This advancement in electron generation represents a simpler and more streamlined approach to ion thruster design.

Calcium is an essential ion and plays key roles in a wide range of biological processes. The levels of calcium ion in the blood are tightly regulated by several hormones. The first stanniocalcin (Stc1) was discovered in fish in the 1960s, and recent advances in genomics have revealed that all vertebrates, including humans, have multiple stanniocalcin genes. Zebrafish, for instance, have 4 distinct stanniocalcin genes (stc1a, stc1b, stc2a, and stc2b). Genetic deletion of zebrafish Stc1a results in kidney stone formation, cardiac and body swelling, and premature death, but it is unclear how Stc1a loss leads to these defects. Moreover, the expression, regulation, and functions of Stc2a, Stc1b, and Stc2b are essentially unexplored. This project will determine whether impaired renal function in Stc1a-deficient animals leads to the accumulation of osmotic water and progressive development of cardiac edema and body swelling in zebrafish. The Stc1a receptor will be identified to gain an understanding of how Stc1a works at the molecular level. The expression, regulation and physiological functions of Stc1b, Stc2a, and Stc2b in gill and brain will also be investigated. The results should reveal novel insights on the physiological functions of stanniocalcin isoforms and their underlying mechanisms of action, and will fill a major gap in the field of comparative endocrinology. A mechanistic understanding of the role of stanniocalcins in brain, kidney, and gills should contribute to the development of new applications in the aquaculture industry. The research will incorporate training of undergraduate students and a post-doctoral fellow, contributing to workforce development. The researchers will develop a hands-on research activity for a K-12 summer camp in collaboration with the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, using the zebrafish mutant lines developed in the project to teach the participants about hormones and calcium homeostasis. <br/><br/>Stanniocalcin 1 (STC/Stc 1) was discovered in bony fish as a hypocalcemic hormone over half a century ago. Recent studies suggest that all vertebrates, including humans, have multiple STC/stc genes. In zebrafish, which have 4 stanniocalcin genes (stc1a, stc1b, stc2a, and stc2b), loss of Stc1a results in kidney stone formation, cardiac and body edema, and premature death. Mechanistically, Stc1a regulates ionocyte proliferation and calcium uptake by suppressing local insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling. However, the molecular identity of STC1/Stc1 receptor(s) is currently unknown in zebrafish or any other vertebrate. Furthermore, the expression, regulation, and functions of stc2a, stc1b, and stc2b are largely unexplored. This project tests the hypothesis that Stc1a, mediated by its binding to the cell surface-tethered metalloproteinase Papp-aa and/or the multi-ligand endocytosis receptor Megalin, regulate ionocyte proliferation, calcium uptake, and kidney function, while the other three stanniocalcins function locally in the brain and gills via context-dependent mechanisms. Specifically, the research will determine (1) whether Stc1a plays dual roles in ionocyte proliferation and calcium uptake by regulating local IGF signaling and epithelial calcium channel Trpv6 expression; (2) whether loss of Stc1a impairs renal function, leading to osmoregulation imbalance and body edema; (3) the molecular identity of Stc1a receptor(s); (4) the roles of Stc1b and Stc2a in brain growth and function; and (5) the possible role of Stc2a/2b in mediating hypoxia-induced growth reduction. The research will make conceptual contributions to the field of endocrinology. The project includes research training at multiple levels, including a Research Experiences for Undergraduates component.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rose Kennedy of the University of Rochester is studying the development of new ligands that work in cooperation with earth-abundant metals to catalyze organic reactions. Typically, ligands are viewed as inert supports for the metal atoms that mediate the bond-forming and bond-breaking reactions used to make the ingredients of consumer goods, important agrochemicals, and medicines. By contrast, Professor Kennedy?s team is designing systems where tandem participation from the ligand enables chemical reactions that do not occur when using the metal alone. This approach is expanding the variety of molecules that can be produced efficiently from readily available starting materials, meeting a critical strategic need for sustainable manufacturing. Through parallel efforts in the classroom, Professor Kennedy is developing new assessment strategies for large-enrollment introductory organic chemistry classes. This approach is using metacognition and team-based learning to improve student retention and workforce preparation in STEM fields. A mini-summer course for high-school Upward Bound students is also being developed to improve access and inclusivity in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Designing homogeneous catalysts that use ligand-enabled delivery of complex, multi-atomic reagents to transition metal centers is a powerful approach to expanding the toolbox of synthetic transformations promoted by earth-abundant first-row transition metals. Towards this goal, Professor Kennedy?s research team is developing a family of multifunctional pyridone ligands that, when used in combination with first-row transition elements such as nickel, shuttle complex reagents through the metal?s secondary coordination sphere. This approach is providing a new strategy for engaging poorly reactive but otherwise appealing transmetallating agents and electrophiles. To understand the synergy between the metal and pyridone ligand, the elementary steps relevant to olefin functionalization and cross coupling are being evaluated in detail using a combination of computational and experimental mechanistic tools. Resulting structure-reactivity-selectivity relationships are then being used to invent new catalytic reactions that combine readily available and user-friendly reagents to generate value-added, C(sp3)-rich building blocks for fine chemical synthesis. In the lab, this award is also supporting hands-on chemistry-research training for University of Rochester undergraduate and graduate students as well as Rochester-area high school and community college students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular interest is the possible role played by LLPS in the pathological aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils.  This award aims to elucidate how protein-rich droplets, known to play important roles in normal cellular function, can, under certain conditions, promote the pathological aggregation of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.  At this time, the basic properties of the protein droplets have been scarcely characterized, and the processes leading to droplet formation promoting protein aggregation are unknown. Using coordinated experimental and computational research, carried out by a team of scientist in the US and France, this project will explore factors governing droplet formation and aggregation of two proteins: tau and alpha-synuclein. The research will generate fundamental knowledge in protein science and provide new insight into the molecular processes that are at the origin of protein aggregation diseases. Support will enable the exchange of junior (graduate student and postdoctoral researchers) between institutions, furthering the education and professional development of those young scientists.  <br/><br/>The research conducted as part of this award will explore the role of LLPS in the aggregation of the IDPs tau and alpha-synuclein. The research will employ an innovative combination of computational and experimental techniques, namely electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Overhauser Dynamics Nuclear Polarization (ODNP), neutron scattering (NS) and multiscale computer simulations. Simulations will employ a unique combination of molecular dynamics and field theory approaches to gain novel insights into protein conformations and hydration water dynamics, and to map phase behavior of the IDPs. The consortium is composed of three French and two American partners that form a multidisciplinary team of structural biologists and biochemists, biophysicists, physicists, and computational chemists with computational and experimental expertise in protein sciences.  The contributions of all five partners are essential to create the synergy necessary to tackle the challenging objectives. <br/><br/>Besides generating fundamental knowledge in protein science, this project will provide new insight into the molecular processes that are at the origin of protein aggregation diseases.

The global biodiversity market is projected to value $180 billion by 2050. But the market is in its infancy, lacking clear rigorous science that is market-tested and acceptable to all stakeholders who work in biodiverse regions. This project aims to deliver market-tested public protocols, peer-reviewed scientific methodologies, transparent tracking, clear unitized accountability for biodiversity gains and losses (conservation, restoration, and impact accounting), and provide fair, direct, funding mechanisms to Indigenous Peoples and local communities for their global contributions to planet health. Gains in these components of a fair and functional biodiversity credit market will not only benefit biodiversity frameworks but all nature-based accounting frameworks and broader human health, generating tax revenue, jobs, and sustainable commerce both for US citizens and for global citizens. <br/><br/><br/><br/>This project provides a breakthrough approach to biodiversity crediting based on a combination of Indigenous knowledge, high-tech efficiency, and modern scientific understanding of complex adaptive systems. The methodology monitors impact via ex-post crediting of indicator species observations done by locals themselves (game cameras, audio recordings, photos). The novel unit equates to one hectare, over one month, of intact ecosystem where all ecological niches are available to, and filled by, native species. Observations are typically rare, threatened, endangered animals on conserved land which have no other source of conservation funding. Biodiversity credits are then auto-calculated with open-source computer code and released for certification as biodiversity credit commodities to the international market. A highly qualified interdisciplinary team of biodiversity scientists, Indigenous rights experts, and economists are collaborating to commercialize this solution. They address the planet-wide dual-need to: 1) Reward the populations who are actually preserving biodiversity on the ground, and 2) Target high-biodiverse zones without conservation funding. This proposal aims to bring this solution across the rocky terrain of an international frontier market for biodiversity credits, for the benefit of Indigenous Peoples and the continued protection of 80% of the world?s biodiversity and 30% of the intact planet.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gravitational waves, the latest breakthrough in physics, have become accessible for study through NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Since the landmark detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger, the LIGO and Virgo detectors have observed hundreds of compact binary coalescences including binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star black holes. These observations facilitate extensive research, advancing our knowledge in fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. This award will advance multi-messenger astrophysics by increasing the number of joint observations and enhancing methods for joint analysis of gravitational wave and electromagnetic data, potentially leading to the next significant breakthrough in the field. The award will support summer undergraduate research fellows through Georgia Tech's NSF REU program and, in collaboration with other astrophysics faculty, develop an astrophysics curriculum for the Vertically Integrated Project, a program that provides opportunities for undergraduates to participate in research activities as part of a team. Additionally, the PI will organize astrophysics booths at the annual Atlanta Science Festival to engage the community with the latest findings and the excitement of gravitational-wave astronomy.<br/><br/>Multi-messenger observations of compact binary mergers can significantly enhance our understanding of neutron star matter, and the physics of gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae, and serve as a tool for measuring the Universe's expansion and testing general relativity. Facilitating these observations and conducting low-latency analyses are top priorities as outlined in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observational Science and Operations White Papers and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration Program. This project focuses on the crucial tasks needed to achieve these high-priority goals. Studies indicate that during the fifth observing run, with the A+ upgrades to the LIGO detectors scheduled to commence before the project's end, LIGO will likely detect several tens of binary neutron stars and neutron star?black holes annually, with a few detectable before they merge. With the current and forthcoming wide-field transient facilities, it will be possible to promptly observe these events electromagnetically.

Full-body sensitivity is especially important for robots that physically interact with people, who may contact the robot in unexpected locations or at unexpected times. In 2014, 24.4 million adults in the United States required assistance with activities of daily living such as feeding, bathing, or ambulation. Robots with sufficient power to perform assistive tasks such as helping a person transfer between a bed and a chair can physically injure a person through an unexpected contact. If a robot can detect these contacts through a sensitive skin covering its body, it can stop the motion or move away ? significantly increasing the safety and comfort of the user. This research has significant potential to positively transform society by reducing the risk of injury for the patient care workforce, creating more affordable options for in-home assistance, and supplementing the home care workforce.<br/><br/>Existing pressure and shear force sensors are complicated to build and repair, and thus very expensive. Computational machine knitting provides an opportunity to create sensing skins of arbitrary shape and dimension. Machine knitting is a fast-manufacturing process for which build instructions can be automatically generated, meaning that sensing skins can be quickly produced with arbitrary sensor placement. Dr. Roberts has previously demonstrated a directionally selective knitted strain sensor made from inexpensive off-the-shelf parts: Silicone tubing, silicone cord, and conductive thread. The materials are also reusable and repairable, so the same materials can be used to make multiple skins for the same robot for different applications. This project will investigate how pressure and strain sensors for robot skins can be knitted automatically and at lower cost than state-of-the-art sensors. Objectives of this proposal include: 1) Developing capacitive knitted pressure sensors; and 2) developing directionally selective knitted shear strain sensors, with a computational framework to automatically generate patterns for sensors oriented in arbitrary directions. Sensors will be knitted in a sleeve for an assistive robot arm already being used for tasks such as bed-bathing and limb repositioning, and evaluated using contacts with known force profiles. In combination, these two types of sensors will be able to provide rich information about the contacts experienced by a robot as it interacts with people.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is rapidly growing demand for data scientists both nationally and globally. At the same time, many educational approaches that have been studied in computer science, mathematics, statistics, and other areas have not been explored in the interdisciplinary setting of data science. Creating classrooms where every student has the opportunity to learn effectively is integral to growing and sustaining a diverse data science workforce. Students' sense of belonging in their classrooms is directly associated with their likelihood of persisting in STEM, be it in their chosen disciplines or more broadly. Group work is one method of supporting engagement and sense of belonging in undergraduate classrooms. This project plans to investigate students' experiences when collaborating on pair programming tasks in the data science classroom, with a particular focus on students from populations that have historically been underrepresented in data science and broader STEM. Studies have shown that pair programming in computer science courses can either serve as a positive experience for students or can magnify imbalances in power or perceived authority. The project will iteratively design and test tools that will support positive pair programming experiences and improve student learning. The collaborating institutions provide a rich opportunity to study and refine pair programming practices in distinct contexts, as California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo is a predominantly white institution and California State University, Monterey Bay is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to understand how small group experiences, specifically pair programming, can be designed to create engaging, inclusive, and effective learning opportunities for all students. There is minimal research on specific ways that instructors might foster equitable student collaborations in the data science classroom, and this project's knowledge generation efforts will address this critical gap. The project will use discourse analysis to investigate the conditions under which students are positioned with power and authority when collaborating with their peers on pair programming tasks in data science. A cross-case analysis will be used to explore project-developed pedagogies in a variety of classes within two demographically different institutions. Through these investigations, the project will identify positive, asset-centered narratives about students and create professional development materials to train educators to enact equitable, effective pair programming approaches for data science education. Each of these project goals should increase and strengthen the future data science workforce. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.

In the U.S., foodborne diseases cost ~$60.9B in medical care, lost productivity, and lives lost, rising to $90.2B when taking quality of life losses into account. Food pathogens also lead to greatly increased costs for food producers, both due to food safety testing itself and recalls caused by contaminated food, which average $10M in direct costs. The proposed food pathogen detection system will meet the food industry?s large unaddressed need for portable, affordable, accurate and time-sensitive testing that can be performed by non-specialists. Critically, an affordable onsite system will lower direct costs and increase testing capacity?the increased volume of testing will reduce the risk of contaminated food entering the marketplace with the associated costs to both businesses and the U.S. economy. Further, data collected by the proposed system will provide insights into the food safety landscape resulting in a safer food supply chain and reduced food producer liability.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an end-to-end, affordable, fully automated, easy-to-operate, portable system for accurate and rapid detection of food pathogens across a broad range of food types. The system uses adaptive design of experiments to optimize the platform hardware and protocols, enabling rapid testing and allowing for earlier detection of food pathogens than currently possible.  The proposed technology will provide the same value as traditional third-party laboratories, yet faster and at a fraction of the cost with the ability to test in-house, thus meeting the needs of small to medium-sized food producers and food processing plants. In Phase I, the company aims to  1) Build an automatic sample preparation module and explore its ability to enhance enrichment across food groups; 2) Develop an automated experimental design workflow to speed up the optimization of enrichment time; and 3) Using experimental data, develop an algorithm to quantify the microbial concentrations in food samples.

Empirical evidence suggests that terminating algorithms early, before convergence, enhances prediction performance on unseen data in certain learning scenarios.

The project aims to promote a collaborative and inclusive teaching culture within STEM departments by providing a two-year professional development experience for STEM faculty who hold a variety of instructional roles (e.g. teaching faculty, research faculty, adjunct faculty, and graduate teaching assistants).  The professional development model will support instructors' adoption of effective instructional techniques that meet the changing needs of today's students.  This model, called TRIOS, is Time-sensitive, Reciprocal, Inclusive, Operative, and Strengths-based. This project will also study the significance of the professional development model to impact STEM department cultures and, as an outcome, will produce a handbook for change leaders in other STEM departments.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to shift the teaching culture within STEM departments from isolationist, weed-out, and stagnant to collaborative, inclusive, and open to growth. Using the TRIOS model, which is grounded in strength-based reflexivity, the project plans to support approximately fifty instructors over five years at a single institution to reflect and modify their teaching to be more aligned with evidence-based and inclusive practices in instruction. The professional development model, as well as the assessment of its outcomes, are framed by three central theories: self-determination, positive psychology, and diffusion of innovation. As part of the outcomes assessment and guided by an Advisory Board, the project plans to (a) generate six departmental case studies embedded in the synthesized theoretical framework, (b) produce a handbook for stakeholders in STEM departments who seek to advance teaching culture in their own contexts, and (c) develop and disseminate an empirically- and theoretically-based model for promoting collaborative, inclusive, and growth teaching cultures in STEM departments.  The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the progress that has led to these breakthroughs can be attributed to the development of deep learning methods (deep neural networks). While these methods have developed very quickly to address a large number of tasks, training them often involves manual tuning and requires enormous amounts of data, resulting in significant costs, including both manpower and power consumption. More sustainable, lower-cost approaches for developing and deploying complex ML and AI systems are needed to ensure that these methods can be widely deployed to accelerate scientific progress and benefit society. For this purpose, it is important to develop a better understanding of why and how certain neural networks outperform others. This is critical for faster prototyping, reduced training times, lower complexity, and better interpretability of deep learning models.  The investigators will test their methods through external collaborations and they plan to develop multiple activities to broaden participation in computing, including new course development, REU programs, and K-12 activities. <br/><br/>This project focuses on developing techniques for a mathematical understanding of deep learning intrinsic to the given task and data being considered. In this project, neural networks are viewed as operators whose behavior is characterized in terms of their action on the training (or testing) data and, more specifically, on the geometry of the data. One major benefit of this approach is that it can be applied to a wide variety of networks since it abstracts the architecture and considers only how a specific system converts inputs into outputs. This project has three main research objectives. First,  when both the model and data are fixed, the goal is to compare different networks and understand how they learn and generalize to unseen data. Second, this project investigates the situation where the data is fixed, but the network model can change. This work focuses on clustering, dimensionality reduction, and importance sampling to reduce the size of the model. Finally, the geometric analysis developed in this project is applied in settings where both the model and data change. This makes analyzing domain adaptation and graph neural network transfer possible, providing efficient algorithms and generalization error guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analyze how autophagy impacts cellular recycling of photosynthetic maize leaf cell types using pooled cell-type omics approaches (proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics). 2. Analyze the mechanisms of chloroplast remodeling and turnover by different autophagy-related pathways at the single-chloroplast type level. 3.

Yet, despite gains in our quantitative understanding of S&T progress, our ability to assess and predict how, when, and which research ideas and investments lead to successful applications remains elusive.  The primary challenge stems from longstanding empirical blind spots along the research-to-market pipeline.  As a result, many crucial questions remain open. For example, which specific research insights will actually penetrate the market and propel downstream technological capability, production, and use?  What are the characteristics of specific grants, ideas, researchers, and organizations that best predict tangible advances?  What specific hurdles obstruct progress, and where and how can these hurdles and slowdowns be overcome?  To address these challenges, Northwestern University, together with its partners, will pursue two lines of effort (LOE):  data and models.  The Data LOE creates a data pipeline linking research funding in science and technology to marketplace uses in wide-ranging application areas. The Model LOE builds on the Data LOE as well as prior work on the science of science to develop predictive and causal models of technology outcomes. Together, these datasets and models will provide the research community with tools to broaden the impact of federal R&D investment, accelerate applications and social impact, and direct attention to diverse sources of breakthrough ideas. The ability to predict technological progress and pinpoint untapped opportunities for advancing targeted technology outcomes is expected to open new doorways to national progress. In addition to informing how investments in people, ideas, and organizations predict and promote advances in specific application areas, our models will leverage wide-ranging sources of valuable research ideas and help less research-intensive institutions engage in successful commercialization.  <br/><br/>The goal of this five-year research program is to establish a systematic, quantitative foundation for measuring, understanding, predicting, and accelerating technology outcomes. Despite rapid advances in our understanding of scientific and technological progress, quantifying and predicting what, when, and how we realize advances in specific application areas remains elusive. Key constraints involve data. This research program fills longstanding gaps through five interconnected research thrusts, building an integrated research-to-market data pipeline and creating new models that transform our ability to assess, predict, and accelerate technological progress. Thrust 1 unlocks the research-to-market pathway via Tech Bridge, a bold initiative to aggregate, integrate, and analyze university datasets, including technology transfer, human resources, and research offices. Linking data across a network of over 20 research institutions will create unparalleled opportunities for insight, bridging major gaps in the research-to-market pathway. Thrust 2 illuminates the journey from R&D to market impact. A data lake will be constructed that leverages the power of licensing and startup data from Thrust 1 and builds machine learning models to predict the market impact of upstream R&D investments. Thrust 3 integrates the data in Thrust 2 with deep dives into five technology areas -- additive manufacturing, synthetic biology, advanced materials, artificial intelligence algorithms, and therapeutics. Technology-specific outcomes will be traced to enable downstream predictions of technology capabilities, production, and use.  Thrust 4 builds models for technology outcomes.  The research team will first explore mechanisms governing the evolution of technological frontiers, then leverage machine learning models to train and test a series of inter-related modules along the research-to-market pipeline. Finally, Thrust 5 accelerates key technology outcomes through two frameworks:  A predictive framework identifies ideas, people, and organizations that have the potential to accelerate outcomes, and an intervention framework pinpoints untapped opportunities for federal R&D to have a wider and faster impact.  The research team will link outcomes and their predictors upstream to all phases of research and development and estimate the market impact of specific ideas, investments, individuals, teams, and organizations. Partners include 21 public and private universities across 13 states, 1 national lab, 2 private organizations, and 1 association.   Overall, this integrated research-to-market data pipeline and new models aims to transform the ability to assess, predict, and accelerate technological progress.  New knowledge of how upstream R&D and investments advance downstream technology outcomes will be realized alongside new abilities to identify bottlenecks and opportunities to multiply and accelerate the impact of R&D and investments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this end, this project plans to transform the current landscape of integrating network and functional data, leveraging their combined strength for scientific advancements through the development of innovative hierarchical Bayesian statistical models. The proposed work holds transformative promise in vital scientific domains, such as cognitive and motor aging, and neurodegenerative diseases. It will enhance scientific collaborations with neuroscientists using multi-source image data for targeted investigations of key brain regions significant in the study of motor and cognitive aging. Moreover, the proposed research will facilitate the prediction of images, traditionally acquired via costly imaging modalities, utilizing images from more cost-effective alternatives, which is poised to bring about transformative changes in the healthcare economy. The open-source software and educational materials created will be maintained and accessible to a wider audience of statisticians and domain experts. This accessibility is anticipated to foster widespread adoption of these techniques among statisticians and domain scientists. The PI's involvement in conference presentations, specialized course development, curriculum expansion, graduate student mentoring, undergraduate research engagement with a focus on under-represented backgrounds, and provision of short courses will enhance dissemination efforts and encourage diverse utilization of the developed methods.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to address the urgent need for principled statistical approaches to seamlessly merge information from diverse sources, including modern network and functional data. It challenges the prevailing trend of analyzing individual data sources, which inherently limits the potential for uncovering innovative scientific insights that could arise from integrating multiple sources. Hierarchical Bayesian models are an effective way to capture the complex structures in network and functional data. These models naturally share information among heterogeneous objects, providing comprehensive uncertainty in inference through science-driven joint posterior distributions. Despite the potential advantages of Bayesian perspectives, their widespread adoption is hindered by the lack of theoretical guarantees, computational challenges, and difficulties in specifying robust priors for high-dimensional problems. This proposal will address these limitations by integrating network and functional data, leveraging their combined strength for scientific advancements through the development of innovative hierarchical Bayesian models. Specifically, the project will develop a semi-parametric joint regression framework with network and functional responses, deep network regression with multiple network responses, and Bayesian interpretable deep neural network regression with functional response on network and functional predictors. Besides offering a novel toolbox for multi-source object data integration, the proposed approach will advance the emerging field of interpretable deep learning for object regression by formulating novel and interpretable deep neural networks that combine predictive power with statistical model interpretability. The project will develop Bayesian asymptotic results to guarantee accurate parametric and predictive inference from these models as a function of network and functional features and sample size, an unexplored domain in the Bayesian integration of multi-object data. The proposed methodology will significantly enhance the seamless integration of multimodal neuroimaging data, leading to principled inferences and deeper comprehension of brain structure and function in the study of Alzheimer's disease and aging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mean field games have strong descriptive power in socioeconomics and biology, e.g. in the understanding of social cooperation, stock markets, trading and economics, biological systems, election dynamics, population games, robotic control, machine learning, dynamics of multiple populations, pandemic modeling and control as well as vaccination distribution. It is therefore essential to develop accurate numerical methods for large-scale mean field games and their model recovery. However, current computational approaches for the recovery problem are impractical in high dimensions. This project will comprehensively study new computational methods for both large-scale mean field games and their model recovery. The comprehensive plans will cover algorithmic development, theoretical analysis, numerical implementation and practical applications. The project will also involve research on speeding up the forward and inverse problem computations to speed up the computation for mean field game modeling and turn real life mean field game model recovery problems from computationally unaffordable to affordable. The research team will disseminate results through publications, professional presentations, the training of graduate students at the University of California, Riverside as well as through public outreach events that involve public talks and engagement with high school math fairs. The goals of these outreach events are to increase public literacy and public engagement in mathematics, improve STEM education and educator development, and broaden participation of women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The project will provide novel computational methods for both forward and inverse problems of mean field games. The team will (1) develop two new numerical methods for forward problems in mean field games, namely monotone inclusion with Benamou-Brenier's formulation and extragradient algorithm with moving anchoring; (2) develop three new numerical methods for inverse problems in mean field games with only boundary measurements, namely a three-operator splitting scheme, a semi-smooth Newton acceleration method, and a direct sampling method. Both theoretical analysis and practical implementations will be emphasized. In particular, numerical methods for inverse problems for mean field games, which is a main target of the project, will be designed to work with only boundary measurements.  This represents a brand new field in inverse problems and optimization. The project will also seek the simultaneous reconstruction of coefficients in the severely ill-posed case when only noisy boundary measurements from one or two measurement events are available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To image vibrations, incident light should excite each molecule bound to the metal surface and scatter at altered frequencies carrying vibrational information. However, the wavelength of visible light is about 1,000 times greater than the atomic length scale, making most optical spectroscopy unsuitable for probing single molecules. To address this challenge, Professor Lee and his students will precisely engineer and optimize the geometry of a silver needle, which will confine light to its tip. As the tip hovers over an individual molecule, it can excite it with atomic precision and amplify the scattered light, forming vibrational images. Understanding the mechanism of vibrational imaging could lead to the precise determination of photochemical reaction coordinates, which has the potential to aid in the development of photoresists for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Members of the Lee group supported by this project will reach out to K-12 students in rural areas of Nevada to teach optical spectroscopy labs using materials designed to introduce quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>Atomically resolved tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (ARTERS) developed in the Lee group will be employed to image the vibrational normal modes of pyridine and its derivatives chemisorbed on Cu single crystal surfaces. Molecules chemisorbed on the metallic surfaces pose significant challenges for understanding their vibrational images for the following reasons: 1) They have a 3-dimensional geometry due to their directional molecule-metal bonds. Consequently, the vibrational images are formed from integrated Raman scattering across multiple focal planes. 2) The molecules are no longer deemed isolated; to accurately model the system, the molecule-substrate complex must be considered. To address these challenges, the Lee group will explore the governing mechanism of vibrational imaging through a joint experimental and theoretical approach. The ongoing feedback between experiment and theory will reveal the governing mechanism in the case of chemisorbed molecules. ARTERS can initiate photochemical reactions and image the products. With a rigorous understanding of the imaging mechanism, precise identification of the products with atomistic details becomes possible. This capability can elucidate the pathways of photochemical reactions and aid in the development of new photoresists. Graduate students supported by this project will disseminate the knowledge gained through the research to K-12 students in rural areas of Nevada.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, most patients do not receive adequate physical therapy treatment for walking disabilities caused by conditions such as stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, and sarcopenia (ageing). Also, care givers and therapists do not have the tools and time needed to target improved neuromuscular control of the ankle plantar flexor muscles during gait training. This technology addresses this shortfall by providing a wearable platform that can be used daily at home for personalized precision resistance therapy. In addition, this system allows individuals to train within the functional context of walking, thereby achieving repetitive, high-volume practice. The technology may transform the treatment of gait disorders, improve physical and mental health, and lessen the financial burden of individuals with neuromuscular impairments and age-related disabilities.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a wearable rehabilitation system for individuals with impaired mobility due to a walking disability. The robotic system pairs targeted ankle resistance with a gamified ankle power biofeedback and may provide improvements in neuromuscular function and mobility. Applying adaptive resistance to the plantar flexion is immediately responsive to user input and fosters active engagement. In pilot studies, the device has been shown to work better than the current standard of care for delivering high-quality gait training. The solution matches the performance of high-tech motorized robotic exoskeletons. In addition, the absence of motors and heavy batteries may facilitate adoption by making it easier to use by individuals with weakness and those that historically do not adopt motorized solutions (e.g., older adults).

Turbulence in the near-sun solar wind is imbalanced, meaning there are many more waves moving away from the sun than towards the sun; this imbalance may impact which interactions between waves are most important for moving energy from large to small scales in the solar wind. To better understand how energy moves through this system, the team will conduct scaled laboratory experiments to precisely characterize two of these wave-wave interactions and compare them to a third (previously studied) interaction. These experiments will quantitatively demonstrate the relative importance of these interactions, which can inform interpretation of spacecraft data and future simulation efforts. Additionally, this research is led by and will primarily support an early-career researcher from an underrepresented group who devotes substantial time to a variety of community efforts in broaden participation of the full spectrum of diverse talents in STEM.  The team will participate in outreach programs for public education.  This work includes an international collaboration component. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to better understand wave-wave interaction processes which may be controlling imbalanced solar wind turbulence at ion scales, particularly in the solar corona and inner solar wind. Specifically, the team will conduct a series of laboratory experiments on LArge Plasma Device (LAPD) located at the University of California, Los Angeles to investigate the detailed behavior of two interactions between co-propagating Alfvn waves: a novel interaction driven by Hall physics, and the already known dispersive interaction. The team will conduct a scaling study of the transition between these two co-propagating interactions and compare them to the often-dominant MHD counter-propagating interaction. These comparisons will help establish which processes may be most active in driving the dynamics of imbalanced magnetized plasma turbulence. Such efforts are particularly timely, as Parker Solar Probe is now studying precisely the region of space where the interactions occur. The results of this project could influence the plasma dynamics, allowing the team to inform interpretation of Parker Solar Probe measurements and related simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the basic working mechanism of these processes can lead to breakthrough improvements in biochemical and biomedical sciences and engineering. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), by far, is the most suitable platform for nanomechanical characterization of biological materials owing to its capability to exert precisely controlled force at desired locations and sense the sample response. However, such a technique is subject to substantial workload and biases of human experimentalists. It heavily relies on constant human supervision and human insight for execution and analysis of problems such as AFM probe breakage after prolonged functionalization, and sample damage due to lack of optimization of the loading forces. To address these challenges, this project will build a transformative new cyber physical system (CPS) by leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) towards high-throughput, scalable, and ultra-precise AFM. This will lead to a key enabling tool to create new knowledge of life science materials.<br/><br/>This project will develop and validate a novel closed-loop framework with AI-based sensing & characterization, modeling interactions between the AFM probe and soft biological samples via physics-aware neural surrogates, and AFM navigation & control algorithms via real-time learning that will lead to a next-generation AI-enabled AFM (namely, AI-AFM). The key intellectual merits extend beyond conventional AFM applications in biomechanical and biomaterial studies. Specific innovations will include: (i) large multimodal models for bioimaging and AFM data characterization; (ii) generative models for enhancing AFM images (iii) AFM probe?sample contact dynamics modeling using physics-aware ML for optimizing the AFM mechanical stimuli design; (iv) ML-based closed-loop+feedforward predictive control in an adaptive manner for the AFM material mapping; and (v) software and hardware implementation and demonstration of the sensing, modeling and control modules in a commercial AFM setup. The research outcomes will go beyond live cell AFM studies and impact other CPS sectors such as biomedical devices, materials, and manufacturing. This project will incorporate the research outcomes at all educational levels by enriching the graduate/undergraduate curriculum, providing undergraduate research experience and K-12 outreach activities, and broadening the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in computing and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The synthetic data generated by the proposed technology can be used to train as well as characterize the advanced screening solutions deployed. This will boost understanding of expected field performance and hence confidence in systems used to protect people and critical infrastructure. At airports, fewer false alarms from people and baggage screening equipment would translate to shorter lines, smaller wait times and decreased stress levels. Better threat detection rates would boost confidence in the screening solutions and truly help in reducing anxiety surrounding air travel, large gatherings, and outdoor events. The apparatus for generating synthetic data can also benefit education and training of the budding STEM workforce in advanced technologies.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate that a novel radiation physics solver based on first principles can generate synthetic data that matches the realism of data obtained through manual acquisition on physical radiation-based scanners. In addition, the solver can grow/widen the sample probability distribution to more closely match the population probability distribution than manually acquired data and do so in a hitherto unrealized linear computational time. In an emerging world of machine learning based automated threat or anomaly detection, this cost-effective data synthesis fulfills an immediate need to address the problem of data paucity to both train and test such algorithms. The research and development effort in this Phase-I project will be focused on developing computational methods to estimate the residual energy post photon-matter interaction in a cost-efficient manner. Representative object assemblies will be constructed to virtually scan and generate realistic and precisely annotated imaging data.

The compound, with high thermal stability and unique chemical structure, will present new opportunities as the reactivity is better that the current boranes on the market. The catalytic reactivity will be leveraged in the polymer materials and the pharmaceutical industries. Significant in energy reductions in large scale processes as well as access to new compounds and materials will result from this project. The disciplines that may benefit from commercialization include chemistry, materials science, energy technology, and environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>The project is aimed at optimizing the synthesis of tris(ortho-carboranyl)borane and scaling up production to the kilogram quantity to enable distribution. The current problems with production of this compound are the low yield in the synthesis, unoptimized work up, and need for specialized equipment to handle moisture sensitive compounds. The research will optimize the synthesis and develop methods to handle the compound without a glovebox or Schlenk line. The approach to solve the latter will be through reaction optimization in exploring all reagents and solvent combinations, conditions, and isolation methods to achieve a safe scalable synthesis founded on manufacturing costs. With many variables, there are many opportunities to improve the method and minimize waste from the current synthesis. Packing and distribution are not an issue for customers with inert atmosphere devices as the compound is a free-flowing solid. However, tris(ortho-carboranyl)borane is sensitive to moisture and thus, alternatives to handling the bulk powder need to be developed in distribution and packaging.

Frequency combs are precise tools for measuring different colors of light and have revolutionized metrology, spectroscopy, and sensing. However, current mid-infrared frequency comb sources are limited by high cost, low efficiency, and large size. By leveraging recent advances in lithium niobate nanophotonics and ultrafast laser technology, this project will create chip-scale mid-infrared frequency comb sources that require orders-of-magnitude less power than current systems while having much broader bandwidth and lower cost. If successful, this project will dramatically expand accessibility to mid-infrared frequency combs, accelerating scientific discovery and enabling new technologies to monitor greenhouse gasses, analyze chemicals, and sense biomolecules for health monitoring. This project will also train graduate students in cutting-edge skills in ultrafast optics and nanophotonics, supporting a diverse high-tech workforce. The collaboration between US and Swiss research teams will strengthen international scientific ties and leverage complementary expertise to maximize the project's impact.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The goal of this project is to develop the MOLINO platform, a chip-scale platform for generating broadband mid-infrared frequency combs pumped by ultrafast near-infrared lasers. This will be achieved through a collaboration between teams at Stanford University and University of Neuchtel with three synergistic thrusts: (1) developing advanced GHz-repetition-rate, ultrashort-pulse-duration lasers in the 1-2 m band based on Yb and Tm gain media; (2) creating multilayer-clad, dispersion-engineered lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguides and resonators with low loss, high nonlinearity, and low sensitivity to fabrication imperfections; and (3) demonstrating broadband, coherent mid-infrared light generation in MOLINO devices through nonlinear optical effects such as supercontinuum generation, difference frequency generation, and synchronously-pumped optical parametric oscillation. The teams will leverage their world-leading capabilities in ultrafast solid-state laser development, ion-beam-sputtered optical coatings, thin-film lithium niobate nanofabrication, and characterization of nonlinear photonic devices. The Swiss team will focus on laser development and coating fabrication, while the US team will lead MOLINO device design and fabrication, and the teams will work together to demonstrate and characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the MOLINO devices.

The profit margins for cattle owners are very thin. Treating a disease costs cattle owners on average about $80 per head. By the time an owner can tell their cattle are infected, it is typically too late to prevent infection and the spread of the disease in the pen and feedlot. With the successful implementation of the proposed technology, cattle owners will save on average about $80 per head. For an average 500-head owner, pinkeye can impact 90% of the individual cattle herd if one individual animal is infected, costing over $15k to treat in the case of an outbreak. The proposed technology aims to reduce the cost to only the cost of one vaccine since the proposed system should alert the owner about this risk early, allowing early isolation before the disease is able to spread. The proposed solution would enable early disease detection, help to secure the US food supply chain, reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses, and benefit the US economy by preventing cattle loss.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) technology to detect Bovine Respiratory Disease early on in a small pilot study.

When new calves that are sick enter a feedlot setting, they typically are not as active as healthy calves. There are also visible symptoms such as droopy ears, nasal discharge, and watery eyes. However, since the calves might be stressed due to travel, these symptoms do not necessarily mean the calf is sick, making it challenging to identify sick cattle.

Assigning students into teams to collaborate on a design problem helps them to develop technical skills as well as essential professional skills. In this process, engineering students often struggle with conflicts in their teams. Typically, introductory engineering courses have large enrollments making it hard for a single faculty instructor to effectively monitor all the teams and intervene on team conflicts quickly. To mitigate this problem, many large-enrollment engineering courses employ undergraduate students who have previously taken the course to mentor student teams. It is important to coach undergraduate student mentors to identify and respond to team conflicts. This work will first document the common reasons behind student team conflicts in a large introductory engineering course with approximately 650 students. It will then use a simulated classroom environment to understand how undergraduate student mentors respond to various team conflict scenarios. Through this, we will identify the essential features of a coaching program that enables undergraduate students to become effective mentors of student teams and help them better navigate such conflicts. By developing strategies to promote persistence and professional skills for teamwork in the first year, we will empower all engineering students, including student mentors, to successfully navigate future team experiences in both future courses and professional life.<br/><br/>Many students in engineering programs are assigned their first team-based design project in first-semester introductory engineering courses. Interpersonal conflict with teammates is a common challenge for students. Responding to team conflict in a timely manner is a logistical challenge in introductory engineering courses that typically have large enrollments. We are focused on developing scalable strategies for enabling first-year engineering students to navigate team conflicts successfully with the help of near-peer mentors (NPMs)?undergraduate students who have previously completed the course. This project seeks to develop a coaching program for NPMs to promote equity-oriented strategies for identifying and responding to conflicts that arise during team-based design projects. This project will focus on three key research questions: (1) What are the root causes and common characteristics of engagement-related team conflicts in introductory engineering courses? (2) Given a mixed-reality simulation of engagement-related team conflict, how do NPMs facilitate discussions that aim to diagnose and intervene in instances of team conflicts? (3) What features of a coaching program are essential to improve the efficacy of NPMs in responding to reports of disengaged team members with strategies that promote persistence and develop professional habits for all team members? This study will produce knowledge about the underlying causes of these team conflicts and how NPMs use pedagogical strategies to identify and remedy them. The research will be conducted using a mixed methods approach to collecting, analyzing, and integrating both qualitative and quantitative data sources. We will use a novel mixed-reality simulation environment to collect data from NPMs. The simulation scenarios will be informed by interdisciplinary research in education; diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ); and organizational behavior.

This lag can be attributed to several factors, which include a lack of wide access to IoT software and the essential infrastructure needed to develop cybersecurity curricula and teaching materials, and a lack of active learning platforms for students such as IoT specific Capture-the-Flag (CTF) systems. Moreover, existing CTF platforms have many pedagogical, functional, and inclusiveness limitations. To mitigate current educational shortcomings, this project will design and host a next generation CTF platform. It will have profound broader impacts, including: (1) enhancing the education and training of the next generation of cybersecurity researchers in topics related to IoT software and systems security; (2) preparing educators and practitioners who will have deep theoretical understanding and practical skills in IoT software and systems security; and (3) involving partner institutions in the project that will utilize the project's outcomes to enhance their cybersecurity curricula.<br/><br/>This project will advance the state of knowledge in IoT software and systems security education pedagogy and platforms. The key intellectual merits include the following. (1) Student-centered pedagogy in software and systems security education that will involve students in designing CTF and defensive challenges, while tracking and supporting students' progress by automating the feedback process. (2) Inclusive pedagogy in software and systems security education. (3) Development of the PwnIoT.Academy, a next generation student-centered CTF platform.

To function properly, many carbon-containing medicines, proteins, and polymers require specific stereochemistry, which is based on the specific three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms. Synthesizing these molecules, therefore, requires reactions that proceed with precise control of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in the resulting products. Dr. O?Neil and his group will investigate new reactions between readily available carbon-based molecules and samarium to achieve this goal. These reactions can be conducted in the presence of water, thereby avoiding the need for specialized equipment. In this way, the reactions may be readily adopted by others and are well suited for incorporation into an Introductory Organic Chemistry Laboratory course as a course-based research experience. In this project, a diverse group of undergraduate and M.S. students will be trained in modern synthetic organic chemistry, learn a variety of research methods including advanced analytical techniques, and become integrated into the scientific community through attendance at professional meetings and dissemination of results.<br/><br/>Reactions that produce carbon atoms with control of their stereochemistry are required for the synthesis of many functional organic molecules. The goal of this project is to investigate allyl organosamarium complexes, generated from the reaction of allylic benzoate esters and phenyl sulfones with samarium diiodide and water, as synthetic intermediates for the stereoselective synthesis of asymmetrically-substituted (stereogenic) carbon atoms. Results from the research are expected to provide a versatile alternative to the existing challenge of stereoselectively synthesizing functional stereogenic carbon-containing molecules of interest to various disciplines such as biology and materials science. Reactions to be developed will be capable of stereoselectively creating stereogenic carbons in products that would be difficult to prepare with other methods. Combined with their ease of execution, a broad scope, predictable and controllable stereoselectivity, and the potential for catalysis, the methods developed may have a significant positive impact on the synthesis of important organic molecules while also increasing our fundamental understanding of organosamarium chemistry. Broader impacts and educational components of the project include the development and implementation of a four-day course-based research experience for undergraduates, with students investigating the impact of substrate structure on stereospecificity. This experience will teach students concepts related to stereochemistry as well as providing training in organic synthesis and methods for molecular characterization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The molecular structures and relative abundances of the species that may result from sublimation of ices containing complex molecules remain largely unexplored. However, understanding the dynamics of sublimation is central to the water cycle, to fixing Earth?s albedo, and to cloud and aerosol dynamics in the upper atmosphere. Professor Broderick and her students will study the sublimation dynamics of various polar and nonpolar molecules desorbed from ices generated at 4 K (or warmer) within a custom-built ultrahigh vacuum apparatus. Temperature programmed desorption experiments will be conducted at various ramping rates and the structures of the desorbed products will be determined with isomer-, conformer- and vibrational-state specificity using chirped-pulse mm-wave rotational spectroscopy. Their studies could provide better understanding of chemical reactions in ices and the dynamics of sublimation which could have broad implications to the atmospheric, astrochemical, and materials science fields. The broader impacts of this work include the development of a ?Freshman Interest Group? (FIG) for first-year undergraduate Chemistry majors at the University of Missouri.<br/><br/>The CPICE apparatus, developed by the Broderick group, takes advantage of revolutionary developments in rotational spectroscopy combined with powerful buffer gas cooling methods which together open a new window into the solid to gas phase transition. First, Chirped-pulse Fourier-Transform mmWave (CP-FTmmW) spectroscopy allows for recording a rotational spectrum of several GHz in a few microseconds at sub-MHz resolution with meaningful relative intensities. Second, buffer gas cooling offers a means to overcome the disadvantageous temperature dependence of rotational spectroscopy, generally without disturbing the desorbing conformer populations or vibrational distributions. The temperature dependence of the rotational partition function is particularly problematic for ice desorption studies given that the majority of the organic molecules of interest sublime at unfavorably high temperatures. Buffer gas cooling thus gives orders of magnitude enhancement in signal levels. With CPICE, the Broderick group will explore the role of molecular complexity in sublimation dynamics. This approach allows them to monitor the molecules directly sublimed from the ices, to detect a broad range of polyatomic systems with increasing molecular complexity, to achieve conformerspecific detection at desorption, and to employ CP-FTmmW spectroscopy with instantaneous scans and reliable branching determination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To be sustainable, next-generation AI needs to be much more efficient in power consumption and speed. In-memory computing is a highly promising solution to this challenge; however, its many noise mechanisms require effective error correction schemes to make its computing reliable. This project will explore new error-correcting codes for in-memory computing in next-generation AI systems. The codes can be integrated with AI systems that directly use analog values for computing, which will help AI achieve much higher efficiency. The codes will focus on the correction of significant errors in computing that are most likely to affect the performance of AI, thus help AI systems achieve an optimal tradeoff between efficiency and reliability. By making in-memory computing more reliable, the project can help AI systems overcome the ""von Neumann bottleneck"" and become more scalable. The project will also develop on-line course materials related to the research topic, and organize workshops to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field.<br/>  <br/>This project proposes Quantized-Analog Error-Correcting Code (QA-ECC), a new type of code for reliable in-memory computing. It focuses on the dominant operation in deep neural networks---the vector-matrix multiplication---and accommodates various practical constraints of analog AI systems. The project will conduct a comprehensive study of QA-ECCs, including their theoretical foundations, practical constructions, and efficient integration with AI systems. It will explore a new paradigm for error correction codes, where redundancy is initially added to the input data for computing, while error correction is performed on the result of computing, making it different from conventional error-correcting codes used in data storage and communications. It will consider multiple resolutions for analog data, and focus on the correction of the most significant errors in computing, making it practical for in-memory computing. The project will develop new theoretical foundations for the new error-correcting codes, including maximum code rates, analytical tools for measuring their error-correction capabilities, and the impact of various parameter settings on the codes' performance. The project will develops new techniques for building error correction codes for analog computing, new algorithms for code searching and error correction, and new methodologies for integrating the codes closely with various aspects of AI systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advertising revenues are vitally important to the digital media industry, where many free-to-use platforms generate profit from the attention of their users. This research asks how the advertising industry conceptualizes the attention of consumers such that it can be measured, valued, and exchanged as a market good. This project focuses particularly on the spatial contexts for the valuation of attention across diverse forms of media, ranging from digital media to printed media to outlets that are geographically located (e.g., roadside billboards). By situating advertisers' understandings of attention within their historical and spatial contexts, the project advances a holistic perspective on the multifaceted economics and experiences of commercial media. This perspective allows for new insights regarding the consequences and possibilities of digital media for individual and collective well-being. Among other contributions, the findings assist efforts to mitigate the potentially harmful effects of social media advertising and trains a graduate student.<br/><br/>The project draws throughlines between historical and contemporary advertising knowledge and practices of attention via discursive analyses of a wide range of materials from within the advertising industry. The researchers analyze archival materials from advertising agencies, professional organizations, and researchers to establish the historical relationships between attention measurements and commercial media. They combine this analysis with an examination of technical documents from advertising technology and social media platforms to determine the continuities and novelties of digital media with respect to attention measures. Finally, the researchers conduct observations at industry conferences and expert interviews with advertising professionals to investigate how modern advertisers apply practical knowledge of attention. Through its focus on the spatial and historical contexts of media, the project brings together disparate scholarship from geography, media studies, science and technology studies, psychology, and economics to speak to pressing concerns about the encroachment of digital media technologies into the spaces of Americans? everyday lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tellurium compounds are able to spontaneously form complex structures resulting from the interaction of multiple molecules, a process called supramolecular self-assembly. This holds promise for the development of components for optical and electronic devices. Prof. Junk?s team plans to take on two challenges in order to realize the application potential: firstly, new and green methods will be developed to make such compounds. Secondly, advanced computation methods are planned to model the self-assembly process to rationally design materials with desirable properties. All participants, notably participating graduate and undergraduate students, will gain an improved understanding of supramolecular assemblies. The project is further expected to catalyze interdisciplinary collaborations within Louisiana and across EPSCoR jurisdictions.<br/><br/>The project will focus on tellurazoles and tellurazines, selected for their high chemical stability. Such compounds are capable of forming strong secondary chalcogen bonding interactions (SBI?s), but the extent to which this happens strongly depends on substituents present in the molecules. The first step will be the development of improved synthetic strategies that permit more structural flexibility than currently feasible, notably by employing regioselective electrophilic tellurination. The second will be an ab initio modeling of SBI formation. The results will be benchmarked against a library of the prepared test substrates to provide a foundation for targeted syntheses. Collaborative research to establish organotellurium compounds as components in non-linear optical devices, sensors, redox catalysts, chelators and organic photoemitters is scheduled follow.

More specifically, this project will develop latent space models to disentangle common and individual local and global latent features in samples of networks, propose efficient spectral matrix-based methods for data integration, provide high-dimensional structured penalties for dimensionality reduction and regularization in network data, and develop cross-validation methods for multiple network data integration. New theoretical developments spanning concentration inequalities, eigenvector perturbation analysis, and distributional asymptotic results will elucidate the advantages and limitations of these methods in terms of signal aggregation, heterogeneity, and flexibility. Applications of these methodologies to the analysis of multi-subject brain network data will be studied. Emphasis will be on interpretability, computation, and theoretical justification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When scientists look at how eyes change in animals, they find examples where the eyes get smaller or disappear altogether, especially in creatures like cavefishes. Three species of fish in the Anableps genus have split pupils and corneas, letting them see both underwater and above the surface at the same time. Anableps is extremely well suited for scientists to study eye duplication. This proposal exploits the fascinating four-eyed fish Anableps anableps as a model for investigating innovations of the visual system. These fish are easy to find and keep in aquariums, and scientists at Louisiana State University (LSU) already know a lot about their biology. At LSU, scientists have established a colony of this fish, and thanks to a project that sequenced their genome, they have all the tools needed to study them in detail. Using cutting-edge technology, researchers are diving deep into how these fish develop their unique visual systems. These are exciting times to figure out how visual perception happens in animals that have adapted the visual system to simultaneous visual fields. Ultimately, they will utilize an evolutionary framework to address questions in developmental biology and evolution related to the visual system. The Broader Impact activities include involving students at all levels in the research and public outreach to the native Amazon community where these fish are naturally found. All activities will be evaluated and assessed.<br/><br/>Morphological innovations allow organisms to adapt to new niches and exploit new ecological opportunities, yet how such innovations arise is a longstanding question in evolutionary biology. Here, researchers will exploit the fascinating four-eyed fish Anableps anableps as a model for investigating innovations of the visual system and gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular basis for this innovation. Novel features of the Anableps visual system include its uniquely duplicated dorsal and ventral corneas, its distinct dorsal-ventral expression domains of opsins in the retina, and a putative new brain area that may have coevolved with simultaneous terrestrial and aquatic visual processing. Previous work from this group identified transcripts highly expressed during cornea duplication that may be causally involved in this process. By combining bulk and spatial RNA-seq to epigenetic profiling via ATAC-seq, this group has begun identifying candidate cis-regulatory elements (CREs) near genes that control regionally restricted expression in the retina. In this proposal, researchers will ask: 1) What is the genetic basis of cornea duplication?; 2) Does regionalized gene expression in the Anableps retina rely on novel CREs or changes to existing ones?; and 3) Did the origin of the unique Anableps eye coevolve with new or modified retinorecipient areas of brain?

AVs are expected to bring convenience and other benefits, for example for those who cannot drive. Despite well-known companies making advances in autonomous driving, the technology is not as safe as it should be -- with widely publicized accidents from major companies in the AV industry. Over the past few years, software engineering research in the domain of ADS has yielded tools that can generate virtual scenarios for testing. However, reusing these tools is challenging as it requires sufficient experience with installation and complex interoperability issues, as well as costly hardware investments. To overcome these issues, this project aims to develop CADRI (Cloud-based Autonomous Driving software Research Infrastructure), a first-of-its-kind cloud-based ADS research infrastructure to ease software research in the context of ADS testing. CADRI will be delivered as a tool suite comprising three principal components: (1) a cataloged library of cutting-edge ADS testing approaches; (2) pre-configured ADSes and simulators on the cloud that allow new approaches to be easily evaluated; and (3) a dataset repository and benchmark that is accessible through a web-based graphical user interface. CADRI will be the first software research infrastructure of its kind with the goal of improving accessibility and reusability of ADSes, relevant simulators, and ADS testing approaches. It will provide an effective, community-wide platform for ADS research and practice through the continuous integration of diverse tools. The planning activities supported through this award include prototype library development, community planning workshops, prototype software development, and pilot studies.<br/><br/>CADRI has the potential to improve the future of ADS research and development by making AVs safer and more comfortable. It will facilitate the discovery and adoption of cutting-edge techniques and tools that are best suited to the problems at hand.

However, the validity of magnetogenetics has been a topic of ongoing debate, primarily due to uncertainties about nanoscale energy conversion phenomena. These debates arise from the intricate interplay of physical and chemical processes in the noisy biological environment and a lack of theoretical and experimental tools that can analyze nanoscale events at the single nanoparticle level with the temporal resolution needed to match the magnetic field's frequency. To address these challenges, this research integrates innovative modeling and experimental methods for thorough analysis of magnetic nanoparticle heating.

Much of the progress that has led to these breakthroughs can be attributed to the development of deep learning methods (deep neural networks). While these methods have developed very quickly to address a large number of tasks, training them often involves manual tuning and requires enormous amounts of data, resulting in significant costs, including both manpower and power consumption. More sustainable, lower-cost approaches for developing and deploying complex ML and AI systems are needed to ensure that these methods can be widely deployed to accelerate scientific progress and benefit society. For this purpose, it is important to develop a better understanding of why and how certain neural networks outperform others. This is critical for faster prototyping, reduced training times, lower complexity, and better interpretability of deep learning models.  The investigators will test their methods through external collaborations and they plan to develop multiple activities to broaden participation in computing, including new course development, REU programs, and K-12 activities. <br/><br/>This project focuses on developing techniques for a mathematical understanding of deep learning intrinsic to the given task and data being considered. In this project, neural networks are viewed as operators whose behavior is characterized in terms of their action on the training (or testing) data and, more specifically, on the geometry of the data. One major benefit of this approach is that it can be applied to a wide variety of networks since it abstracts the architecture and considers only how a specific system converts inputs into outputs. This project has three main research objectives. First,  when both the model and data are fixed, the goal is to compare different networks and understand how they learn and generalize to unseen data. Second, this project investigates the situation where the data is fixed, but the network model can change. This work focuses on clustering, dimensionality reduction, and importance sampling to reduce the size of the model. Finally, the geometric analysis developed in this project is applied in settings where both the model and data change. This makes analyzing domain adaptation and graph neural network transfer possible, providing efficient algorithms and generalization error guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mechanisms by which neurons adopt specific morphologies and connections remain unclear. This investigation will identify the role of a membrane protein called acid-sensing ion channel 1a, which senses brain acidity in the development and maturation of brain neurons. Through an array of methodological approaches, the study will determine the role of acid sensing in normal nervous system development. The findings from this investigation may help in devising treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders associated with dysregulation of acid-base balance. Through an integrated educational and research training program, this project will enable students at different levels, particularly those from underrepresented groups in STEM, to gain hands-on experience in diverse methodologies relevant for research in neuroscience. These experiences will better position trainees to pursue careers in STEM and contribute to broadening participation across the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Neuronal development and maturation are essential for the normal structure and functions of the brain. The specific signaling pathways involved in these processes, however, are not fully understood. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), a novel proton-gated and Ca2+-permeable cation channel, plays an important role in neuronal development and maturation. Proton concentrations change locally when synaptic vesicles release their acidic contents during neurotransmission, and globally in the brain during periods of intense neural activity. For decades, the signaling role protons play in neurons remained elusive. The finding that protons can gate a distinct family of ion channels has shed new light on the mechanisms of acid signaling. ASIC1 is widely expressed in neurons of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Emerging studies have demonstrated that activation of ASIC1a plays important roles in neuronal injury associated with various neurological conditions. In contrast, the physiological functions of ASIC1a in the developing brain remain largely unclear. Using a combination of molecular biology, imaging, electrophysiology, pharmacology, proteomics, RNA-seq, in vitro and in vivo models, the proposed studies will systematically examine the role of ASIC1a in neuronal development and maturation and its underlying signaling mechanisms. Understanding the fundamental function of ASIC1a in nervous system development will advance the field of neuroscience and may also help establish novel therapeutic strategies for treating neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The behavior of water in such nanometer-sized cavities is known to deviate strongly from bulk properties, yet prior studies of confined water have reported widely divergent phase transition temperatures for a given pore size. Professor Kuehne and his students will use a unique combination of photoluminescence spectroscopy, Raman excitation spectroscopy, electromechanical resonance measurements, and transient electrothermal methods to address this knowledge gap. Their studies will advance the fundamental understanding of the phase behavior, mass density, and heat capacity of water in well-defined cylindrical nanopores relevant to green energy technology and water desalination. The project outcomes are expected to ultimately benefit society by informing the engineering of advanced separation membranes and electrochemical devices, and by training the next generation of scientists and engineers in this important area of research. As part of the project's broader impacts, two educational videos will also be produced to engage the general public on topics related to fluids at the nanoscale.<br/><br/>Professor Kuehne's research examines three key aspects of water thermodynamics under cylindrical nanoconfinement between 4-500 K. First, photoluminescence and Raman excitation spectroscopy will be used to precisely determine water phase transition temperatures in isolated carbon nanotubes based on changes in the nanotube's optical and vibrational properties. Second, the total and interfacial mass densities of the confined water will be measured by combining electromechanical resonance techniques with Raman spectroscopy. Third, a transient electrothermal method will be coupled with Raman spectroscopy to determine the volumetric heat capacity. The research leverages the Kuehne lab's expertise in fabricating carbon nanotube nanofluidic devices and combines advanced optical and electrical measurement techniques in an innovative approach. Together, these complementary techniques will enable more reliable mapping of the phase diagram of water in single-digit nanopores and extracting enthalpies of phase change. The results will aid in resolving contradictions in reported phase transition temperatures for a given pore size and in developing accurate molecular models of nanoconfined water. The experimental tools developed in this project will further pave the way for systematic investigations of other confined fluids and electrolytes beyond water in future work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These networks often rely on battery-operated sensors that wirelessly transmit data to a fusion center for analysis, enabling the detection of critical phenomena through distributed detection methods. The effectiveness of these systems hinges on achieving high detection performance over noisy wireless channels, while conserving energy. Traditional approaches transmit either raw observations or their summaries to the fusion center. However, they either require higher transmission bandwidth or are not optimized for energy conservation. This project aims to develop and optimize the transformation of raw sensor observations for optimal detection performance over noisy wireless channels, subject to constraints on transmission power and bandwidth.  Anticipated outcomes include near-optimal distributed detection solutions, especially in the context of 6G and wireless sensor network deployments, elevating detection precision and facilitating timely decision-making. Additionally, the project seeks to enhance STEM education by providing research opportunities to underrepresented groups, including domestic minority and women students in Mississippi.<br/><br/>By exploring alternative data forms beyond the current options of transmitting either original observations or binary codewords, this project aims to determine the most effective means of conveying information from the sensors to the fusion center. This objective will be pursued through a comprehensive investigation into the transformed distributed detection paradigm with several concerted efforts. First, the project focuses on the transformed, quantized distributed detection, assessing its design tractability and identifying its optimal operational region compared to conventional methods under the same bandwidth and power constraints. Second, employing functional analysis and numerical techniques, the project aims to optimize the sensor observation transforms to maximize the distributional divergence for signals received at the fusion center under different hypotheses. Third, the project evaluates the performance of transformed distributed detection in scenarios involving both channel noise and correlated observations, considering both Gaussian and non-Gaussian copula models. By addressing some fundamental issues in the field of distributed detection, including the optimality of the transforms and performance boundaries, the project is expected to yield optimized energy-efficient transmission of sensor information for decision making in networked systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many protein factors collaborate during the formation and processing of different types of branched DNA structures. How many of these proteins interact with branched DNAs and enable their processing is not clear. The objective of this collaborative project is to determine how a genome-protecting complex called Smc5/6 manages various branched DNA structures. The two research teams will combine biochemical and biophysical expertise to achieve high-resolution understanding of Smc5/6 structure and function. The outcomes will advance knowledge of how cells quickly resolve DNA repair intermediates to ensure genome integrity.

Nitrogen pollution - fueled primarily by excess fertilizer and manure on agricultural land - is a major threat to the environment and human health. Once lost to the environment, nitrogen makes almost every environmental problem worse: from air and water pollution, to biodiversity loss, stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change. Policymakers have started to take notice: a growing number of national, regional and global efforts have coalesced around the goal of halving nitrogen losses to the environment, and countries will need to develop national action plans to make this goal a reality. Building effective plans requires the scientific community - in collaboration with a range of stakeholders from the public and private sector - to fill some fundamental scientific gaps: a lack of data in key areas; ineffective governance options; a fragmented understanding of the links between nitrogen and climate action; and weak communication between scientists and other communities. iN-Net will address these gaps by creating working groups of scientists and stakeholders to shape and drive research agendas on data, governance and nitrogen-climate interactions; establish a data platform that will enable countries to measure their progress and identify effective actions; and implement a workforce development program to train the existing and next generation of nitrogen scientists to be capable communicators and do policy-relevant research. It will cement US intellectual leadership on this important issue, while designing and implementing data, models, governance options and other approaches that will be critical for humanity to improve its complicated relationship with this essential resource and major pollutant.<br/><br/>We propose to establish the International Nitrogen Network (iN-Net), an international network of networks, to address the fundamental gaps between research, policy and action that are currently impeding the development of national action plans to successfully operationalize the ambitious global goal of halving nitrogen (N) waste by 2030. These gaps include: inconsistent and incomplete data to establish a baseline and measure progress; a paucity of effective governance options to implement plan measures; and a fragmented understanding of the links between N and climate action. Cutting across all of these gaps is an inability to effectively communicate across scientific communities and stakeholder groups. Under the aegis of the the International Nitrogen Initiative (INI) and in collaboration with a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded global center on N innovation as well as several regional and international scientific and science-policy networks, we will: 1) Create three transnational and transdisciplinary working groups with broad stakeholder participation to tackle the major gaps (data, governance, climate, and communication) for translating the halving N waste goal into national action plans; 2) Establish a collaborative data platform to be a ?one-stop shop? for N data and indicators for researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders to establish baselines and measure progress towards the implementation of national action plans; 3) Initiate several workforce development initiatives, including policy fellowships that will allow scientists and students to experience and contribute to global governance deliberations on N. In short, iN-Net will transform INI from a convener of the international N research and stakeholder community to a catalyst for novel research and policy approaches to help translate halve N waste targets into national action plans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DNA is packaged into the nucleus in the form of chromatin, consisting of a complex between DNA and histone proteins. DNA wrapped in compacted histones is thought of as ?repressed? and ?inaccessible?, and thus chromatin compaction plays a critical role in regulating gene activity. Current chromatin modeling is based on polymer simulations at different levels of resolution. However, given the slow time scales of these processes of the order of minutes to hours, the size scales of the order of 5--10 um (typical size of nucleus) are not accessible using methods such as molecular or dissipative dynamics approaches. The objective of this project is to decode the quantitative relationship between the physical microenvironment, multiscale 3D genome organization, and transcriptional output. The project will employ a convergent research strategy that integrates super-resolution microscopy, genomics, biophysical modeling and simulation, and machine learning. The new tools developed in this project will impact many areas in biology, including normal and abnormal tissue development, tissue degeneration in disease, as well as tissue regeneration. The research team will educate future scientists and a diverse workforce with a collaborative expertise in interdisciplinary training. Additional outreach activities will include research experiences for undergraduate students and high school students.<br/><br/>Tissue-resident cells continuously sense changes in their chemo-physical environment and use this information to maintain their phenotype and tissue homeostasis. The project will develop a predictive framework of emergent epigenetic and transcriptional features of cells in response to changes in their physical environment. The project will develop new quantitative models for the distribution of heterochromatin domains in the interior of the nucleus as well as along the nuclear periphery. Specifically, a mathematical model will be developed to study the effect of rates of histone tail acetylation, methylation, and transcription on determining the distribution of heterochromatin domains in the interior of the nucleus. The project will further extend this model to include the formation of lamina-associated domains (LADs) by incorporating the energetic interactions between chromatin and the nuclear lamina via chromatin anchoring proteins. To verify the theoretical model, cells of fixed fate and fluid fate will be grown under varying micro-environments, and their whole genome organization at the nano- and micro-scale will be visualized and quantified through super-resolution microscopy. In addition, a machine learning framework leveraging novel deep neural operators will be developed for nonlinear inverse problems to extract the high-dimensional parameter fields implicitly and explicitly from noisy experimental images. To enhance the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of neural operators with small data, the project will endow neural operators with prior knowledge, physics, multifidelity data, and active learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The network will be composed of researchers from academia, national labs and industry, across the globe. Clean hydrogen is entering a pivotal moment of ever-growing interest, with its potential to decarbonize the fields of energy generation, transportation, manufacturing and a number of chemical and industrial processes. However, close to 95% of the current global hydrogen supply is produced from fossil fuels by steam reforming processes that emit large amounts of CO2. The grand challenge is to enable a paramount shift and scale-up in clean hydrogen production, mainly by water electrolysis, and its use (in fuel cells to produce clean energy and other applications). Our network will enable a coordinated and collaborative global effort with the goal to collaboratively address unmet fundamental research gaps and accelerate science in clean hydrogen technologies, water elecrolyzers and fuel cells, as well as to facilitate networking, education and training of next generation diverse talent and qualified workforce, benefiting society as a whole. <br/><br/>REACH2 Network will advance the following scientific areas by facilitating coordinated and synergetic collaboration, by providing tools and models for knowledge, data, samples, and facilities sharing, and by utilizing expertize of each network member: (1) We will collaboratively study, develop, and implement process automation, advanced data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches in fabrication, testing, characterization, experimentation and data correlations for fuel cell and electrolyzer systems; (2) We will focus on accelerating scale-up fabrication science and on understanding processing-structure-properties-performance correlations in these systems by using above tools; (3) We will focus on rational design and synthesis of next generation functional, highly-performing and stable catalysts and electrolytes for these systems, and study their properties, interfacial phenomena, performance and degradation mechanisms. The final and most important focus of REACH2 NoN is to enable effective and systematic networking, scientific exchange, sharing of ideas and knowledge, and synergistic training and education of next generation leaders in clean energy. During the Design phase of our Network, we will have three main planning goals that will enable launch of the REACH2 NoN and its successful implementation:  (1) Design and establish the Network roadmap, with mission, goals, models, and activities to promote collaborative synergistic research innovation and scientific discovery; (2) Plan and establish a suite of shared and publicly accessible tools and platforms for data sharing, storage and processing; (3) Design shared training programs for development of future workforce and next generation of experts and leaders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physically, the skin protects from external threats including infectious agents and prevents from excessive loss of water from the body. This barrier function is first provided during embryonic development by a transient protective layer called the periderm. Although the genesis and loss of the periderm are the first and last steps in the development of the epidermis, the precise role of this transient embryonic layer remain mysterious. To improve the dissemination of knowledge about embryology and epidermal barrier, there is a need to understand how the periderm is formed, what it does, and a need to teach about it in the classroom. This project will use advanced microscopy to get detailed information about the structure of the periderm. This study will engage scientific illustrators to depict the genesis and loss of the periderm in a public-accessible manner and promote its inclusion in textbooks. It will also involve high school students in observing developing skin under the microscope and teach them about the periderm. Students will sketch and annotate specimens seen under the microscope and create an artistic rendering of the same specimen, both of which will be exhibited for public viewing. The work train students from high school through graduate levels in original scientific research.<br/><br/>To understand how the periderm contributes to epidermal fate and function, this project will utilize a mouse model system, the Irf6-deficient embryo. Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) has long been described as a master regulator of terminal epidermal differentiation. While analyzing Irf6-deficient embryos, it was observed the presence of adhesion-associated defects in the formation of the palate and the limbs, as well as differentiation-associated defects in the morphogenesis of epithelial cells in the epidermis (i.e., keratinocytes). These mutant embryos also exhibited significant thickening of the embryonic epidermis, with aberrant periderm differentiation and striking expansion of the suprabasal (i.e., spinous) compartment and lack of the uppermost epidermal layers (granular and cornified). These defects are associated with taut skin and a leaky epidermis, features that are incompatible with life. Together these data support the central hypothesis that peridermal cells are required for terminal differentiation of the epidermis, and that their development and fate are regulated by the transcription factor IRF6. The proposed study will test this hypothesis, utilizing a combination of classic ultrastructural microscopy, state-of-the art microscopy, quantitative image analysis, murine genetics (using specific alleles), and systematic experimental approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, real-world relationships often go beyond simple presence or absence, which poses challenges and necessitates the development of advanced methods. This project focuses on an important class of heterogeneous networks -- ?signed networks?, where relationships can be positive (for example, friendship, alliance, and mutualism) or negative (for example, enmity, disputes, and competition). Such signed relationships are prevalent and exhibit substantially different and unique interaction patterns. This project aims to provide a comprehensive investigation on signed networks through statistical model-based learning and inference, pushing the frontier of our understanding of the role of negative edges in real-world complex systems. The research outcome will stimulate interdisciplinary research and make significant contributions in a broad range of scientific domains, including political science, biochemistry, medicine, genetics, ecology, and business and marketing. The project will support and train STEM workforce members by providing research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will develop novel statistical methodologies and theories for analyzing signed networks, focusing on the integration of negative relationships in three core problems: (a) understanding the formation mechanism of signed networks guided by fundamental social theories; (b) detecting communities in signed networks by leveraging unique patterns; and (c) learning informative and interpretable embeddings for signed networks to assist downstream analysis. For the first problem, the investigator will provide a valid statistical inference method under novel nonparametric graphon models for signed networks and study real-world evidence of conceptual theories to understand its formation mechanism. For the second problem, new fast community detection methods will be developed under a novel stochastic block model with a hierarchical structure for signed networks, with associated theory emphasizing the positive impacts of negative relationships. Finally, the project will tackle the problem of embedding learning by developing a general latent space framework.

Avalos and her group at New York University are designing and characterizing molecules intended for applications in quantum sensing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal enhancement.  Molecules that can be classified as good quantum spin sensors often exhibit properties that also make them good candidates for NMR signal enhancement.  In both cases, the molecule?s spin state should be readily controlled by the application of some form of electromagnetic radiation. Using a combination of computational and experimental techniques, the Avalos lab is seeking to identify the magnetic and structural motifs that facilitate optically induced spin control.  Identification of classes of molecules that exhibit these properties would have a significant impact on improving the performance of magnetic resonance methods (which are widely used in chemical industry) and quantum sensor designs (with applications such as gyroscopes, magnetic field detection, and nanothermometry).  Dr. Avalos is also engaged in educational activities involving magnetic resonance methods at both the local and national level through workshops that aim to help educators explain and incorporate magnetic resonance tools into their physics and chemistry curriculum at the high school and undergraduate level.<br/><br/>The ability to optically generate highly polarized nuclear spin states with chromophore-radical (C-R) dyads has the potential to enable highly sensitive multi-dimensional NMR with sample-limited systems without the need for cryogens or expensive microwave sources. Given the vast chemical space that is possible in C-R systems, combined computational and experimental studies are vital to aid in the rational design of C-R molecules with desired electronic and spin properties. Dr. Avalos is seeking to determine how the C-R structure is correlated with the mechanism of polarization of the radical as well as how this structure affects the polarization transfer mechanism to neighboring nuclear spins.  Improved understanding of the relationship between mechanism and structure should facilitate design of molecules with desirable magnitude and sign of the spin polarization generated as well as provide guidance for the magnetic field and temperature conditions where polarization may be accessed. The dominant mechanisms rely on an interplay of spin-spin coupling, magnetic anisotropy, orbital overlap, and sources of spin relaxation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program was modeled after the former NSF Sociology DDRIG program and has been in place since 2020. The ASA DDRIG promotes the progress of science by identifying and supporting talented doctoral students with exceptional projects that have the potential to advance science and promote the public good. The emerging generation of sociologists whose work is funded are pursuing questions that are not just interesting, but are original, significant, and needed. These scholars use rigorous social scientific methods to increase knowledge about the social world and inform decision-making and practice on a broad range of contemporary issues including poverty, conflict, crime, and inequality. As such, the research supported by the ASA DDRIG may contribute to the health, prosperity, and general welfare of our society for generations to come. Removing economic barriers to the production of high-quality, rigorous scientific research at the PhD level is critical for advancing and widening the STEM pipeline. In doing so, the ASA DDRIG program helps contribute to a diverse and globally competitive scientific workforce.<br/><br/>The ASA DDRIG program awards up to 25 grants of up to $16,000 each annually to support theoretically grounded and empirically rigorous sociological research conducted by doctoral students and supported by faculty sponsors. Proposals are reviewed by a panel of PhD sociologists representing a wide range of substantive and methodological expertise. The ASA DDRIG program?s contribution to science is demonstrated in the scientific quality of the funded dissertation projects, and in the program?s influence on knowledge production in the discipline. Funded projects have the potential to advance sociology by expanding existing theories, filling gaps in knowledge, and making methodological contributions. ASA DDRIG proposals also are evaluated for their potential to contribute to society and their likelihood of advancing desired societal outcomes. In this way, the ASA DDRIG program helps ensure that emerging sociologists design research projects with an eye toward not just creating new understandings of social processes, but doing so in a way that can help inform both decision-making and practice on a wide range of important social issues. Along with direct financial support, the program provides recipients with access to ASA?s professional development resources and networking opportunities which enhances the impact of the award. Dissertation research is a stage at which an injection of funds and a vote of confidence from the student?s disciplinary association can propel a doctoral student to higher ambitions and greater success. The reciprocity of effort and influence between the ASA DDRIG program and the association?s support of doctoral education positively influences the quality of training and the production of knowledge far more than either initiative could in isolation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In model selection problems such as variable selection and graph estimation, models are characterized by an underlying Boolean structure, such as the presence or absence of a variable or an edge.  Therefore, false positive error or false negative error can be conveniently specified as the number of variables/edges that are incorrectly included or excluded in an estimated model.  However, the increasing complexity of modern datasets has been accompanied by the use of sophisticated modeling paradigms in which defining false positive error is a significant challenge.  For example, models specified by structures such as partitions (for clustering), permutations (for ranking), directed acyclic graphs (for causal inference), or subspaces (for principal components analysis) are not characterized by a simple Boolean logical structure, which leads to difficulties with formalizing and controlling false positive error. A new perspective is needed to provide reliable inference in modern data analysis.

The research will engage both graduate and undergraduate students and will be disseminated to a broader audience through the development of new courses. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI develops a generic framework to organize classes of models as partially ordered sets (posets), which leads to systematic approaches for defining natural generalizations of false positive error and methodology for controlling this error. The project aims to use the poset framework to address the following questions: what attributes of the poset structure determine the power and computational complexities of false positive error controlling procedures? How can we exploit specific structures in posets to design powerful model selection methods? How do we provide false discovery rate guarantees over posets?

It is estimated that by 2050, there will be over $1 trillion (T) invested in floating offshore wind projects around the world, totaling up to 250 gigawatts (GW) of capacity.  A major challenge facing the floating wind industry is the massive size of turbines and floating platforms, prohibiting them from fitting in existing United States (US) port infrastructure. Furthermore, the supply chain is severely constrained as only a few shipyards and port facilities in the world, can build, assemble and load-out these massive structures. The proposed platform solves these challenges because it can be assembled and transported horizontally, significantly reducing the required depth, overhead clearance, and overall footprint.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project relates to the development of the upending procedure for an offshore floating platform with a pre-installed turbine. The platform can be assembled and transported in a horizontal position, and then unfolded into its vertical position through an upending process that only uses ballast water. During this project, the upending procedure of the platform with a pre-installed turbine will be studied to determine the optimal design to ensure the turbine can withstand the mechanical forces associated with assembly, transportation, and upending, as well as the materials challenges associated with an offshore environment.  In addition, the upending procedure will be modeled in a variety of conditions to determine the maximum weather conditions in which the upending procedure can safely occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Earth?s magnetosphere has been observed by spacecraft for decades, but magnetospheres can also exist on much smaller scales, such as around small moons or asteroids that are difficult to study directly.  This project utilizes laboratory experiments to create and explore artificial versions of these ?mini? magnetospheres.  By leveraging the ability of laboratory experiments to be carried out with high repeatability in a controlled setting, the experiments will provide an unprecedented, high-resolution three-dimensional map of a dynamic magnetosphere.  This will advance our fundamental understanding of space weather by investigating magnetic reconnection, a key process that can drive geomagnetic storms that pose extreme hazards to human activities in space.  The project will utilize the LArge Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles and includes a collaboration with the Instituto Superior Tcnico in Lisbon, Portugal.  The project also provides advanced training and mentorship opportunity to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students to prepare them for the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Magnetospheres are a ubiquitous feature of magnetized bodies embedded in a plasma flow. In planetary magnetospheres, a key process driving magnetospheric dynamics is magnetic reconnection, in which magnetic energy is explosively released when opposing magnetic field lines merge and annihilate. In space environments, this reconnection is collisionless and controlled by kinetic-scale plasma physics. Mini-magnetospheres, small ion-scale structures that are well-suited to studying kinetic-scale physics, provide a unique environment for studying magnetospheric reconnection that can be created in the laboratory.  This project will create ion-scale magnetospheres by coupling a supersonic, laser-driven plasma flow with a dipole magnet embedded in the uniform, magnetized plasma of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles.  Leveraging the high-repetition and reproducible capabilities of the platform and high-fidelity 3D numerical simulations, the objectives of the project are to 1) develop a novel 3D Thomson scattering diagnostic for measuring key plasma parameters in mini-magnetosphere experiments; 2) measure for the first time the magnetic reconnection rate in both dayside and magnetotail configurations through highly-resolved, volumetric datasets; and 3) investigate how magnetic reconnection impacts the global structure of the magnetosphere.  The laboratory measurements will help validate numerical simulations and magnetospheric models, as well as complement spacecraft observations of mini-magnetospheres such as those associated with small moons, comets, and lunar magnetic anomalies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

So far, the origin and formation mechanism of soil organic carbon in complex with iron remain poorly understood. As a primary precursor for soil organic carbon, plant-derived lignin can be degraded into compounds that may bind to iron oxides. This project aims to uncover the chemical nature of lignin-derived ligands for iron. Soil carbon is an important part of the Earth's carbon cycle, and an element of this cycle that is highly relevant to climate. Graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students will be engaged in this research at both institutions. Leveraging an NSF-funded Innovations in Graduate Education project, a summer camp module will be developed focusing on environmental chemistry relevant to sustainability, to increase the representation of first-generation students and underrepresented groups in graduate studies in science.<br/> <br/>This project sets out to develop targeted and non-targeted methods to detect and quantify lignin-derived ligands and their iron complexes by liquid chromatography together with high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The method will be developed and validated with a set of known lignin degradation products and used to characterize the iron-binding products formed by microbial degradation of lignin in pure culture and soil incubation. It is expected that these studies will help elucidate the chemical nature of biopolymer (lignin)-derived iron ligands and their complexes and provide insights into the chemical mechanisms that fractionate soil organic carbon, ultimately governing soil organic carbon stocks. Such understanding is critical for developing predictive models for the nature and form of soil-constrained organic carbon. The methods developed in this project are expected to be broadly applicable for the investigation of other biopolymer (cellulose, cutin, and others)-derived ligands in soil and aqueous environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. In many organisms, chromosomes have big regions of repetitive sequences (repeats) with unknown roles. Complete repeat sequences can now be obtained, but interpreting this information is largely beyond existing analytical frameworks. This project will leverage a powerful concept, fitness landscape, to understand how different repeats influence the survival of individuals in fruit flies.  This research will generate a much-needed mathematical theory on repeat evolution to make sense of the explosive growth of genome data. Through this research, the fellow will also contribute to broadening the accessibility of quantitative biology to undergraduate students. The fellow?s pedagogical activities will foster interest among biology students in quantitative reasoning, an essential skill for modern biological research.<br/><br/>In fruit flies (Drosophila), a particular satellite repeat (359-bp) sits on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster but is absent in the closely related species D. simulans. This satellite fails to segregate during mitosis when placed in D. simulans? eggs, suggesting that its mitotic stability requires specific embryonic regulation by D. melanogaster. In Aim 1, the fellow will use natural variation in D. simulans to map embryonic regulators of 359-bp. In Aim 2, the fellow will obtain a series of 359-bp alleles by a combination of CRISPR-induced deletion and natural alleles sampling. Then, the fellow will determine a quantitative map between 359-bp genotypes and their mitotic stability in interspecific hybrids. In Aim 3, a mathematical theory will be constructed based on this map to model the introgression dynamics of repeats between species. The fellow will receive new training in molecular genetic tools and bioinformatic methods on repetitive DNA. The fellow will recruit and mentor undergraduate students to participate in this research. The fellow will also develop teaching materials on introductory quantitative biology for first-year students at Cornell, which will be implemented in a workshop and distributed online to the broader biology community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The temperature of the corona can vary from a million to a few millions of degrees, while the solar surface is approximately 6000 degrees. This temperature increase from the surface to the corona is counterintuitive, as one expects the temperature to decrease away from the heat source. Furthermore, the solar wind, a hot, tenuous plasma originating from the sun and filling the heliosphere, also originates from the corona. Despite several decades of research, the cause of the heating of the corona and acceleration of the solar wind are not well understood. This project will focus on understanding important aspects of this long-standing physics problem through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Understanding the heating of the solar corona and acceleration of the fast solar wind are major goals of the heliophysics community as outlined by the 2013 NRC Heliophysics Decadal survey. The research results will be disseminated broadly through presentations to the scientific community at national and international meetings and publication in peer-reviewed literature. Elements of this research will be incorporated into public outreach events. Undergraduate and high school students will be involved in this research, and their involvement will aid workforce development for the plasma physics community.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand the contribution of Alfven wave absorption and reflection in heating coronal holes using experiments and simulations.  The objectives of this project are: 1) Determine the mechanism responsible for Alfven wave reflection, including the role of collisions within the gradient. 2) Determine how incident Alfven wave energy is absorbed, and into which channel (electrons and/or ions) the wave energy is deposited, including the form of the deposited energy (isotropic or anisotropic heating or flow generation). 3) Quantify the contribution of Alfven wave absorption in heating and/or accelerating plasma in coronal holes, and 4) Develop an experimentally validated model for Alfven wave absorption for use in coronal modeling.  Experiments in the LArge Plasma Device (LAPD) located at the University of California, Los Angeles will be conducted to characterize the effect of collisions in Alfven wave reflection and measure the increase in plasma kinetic energy due to wave absorption. The experimental setup will be simulated numerically to gain additional insights into wave absorption, and additional simulations will be carried out with coronal parameters. An experimentally validated model of Alfven wave absorption will be developed for use in coronal modeling.  This project will significantly enhance our understanding of Alfven wave processes in a strong Alfven speed non-uniformity like those in coronal holes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aerogels are a class of lightweight thermal super-insulators that are challenging and costly to manufacture due to a high-heat, high-pressure drying process in the final stages of production. To address this, a new method for drying aerogels using ambient pressure and ambient temperature has been developed. This process enables low-cost, high volume production and reduces aerogel production costs by up to 90%. This process will first be used to develop thermal insulation for batteries in electric vehicles, where aerogels are critical as a lightweight, high-temperature material for maintaining stable temperatures. The market for aerogels in EV batteries is rapidly growing, and has a balance of price sensitivity and demand that makes it suitable as a first market using this new production process. Once this process is scaled and optimized, aerogels may become viable for other critical markets including building insulation, energy storage and aviation.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a low-cost, scalable manufacturing process for aerogel insulation materials. Aerogels are a class of super-insulating materials known for their light weight and superior insulating properties, but are extremely expensive and scarce due to inefficiencies in the production process. The current manufacturing involves using specialized pressure chambers to dry aerogels under high heat and pressure, resulting in high energy costs and low production volumes. This project proposes a novel aerogel production process that dries the aerogels under ambient pressures and temperatures in a continuous process that resembles window glass manufacturing. This ambient drying process dries aerogels by saturating wet gels in a gas atmosphere, slowly drying the gels without causing stresses that can crack the gel. This reduces costs and energy consumption, and allows for a continuous, linear production process without the use of specialized pressure chambers. By enabling scalable production of high-quality aerogel insulation, this innovation could make aerogels more accessible and affordable, transforming insulation across a variety of modern industries. The project aims to use this manufacturing method to develop thermal separators for electric vehicle battery insulation to enhance safety and performance in extreme temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The landscape of the Sandhills consists of grass-covered sand dunes overlaying the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast underground reservoir that supports diverse communities of plants and animals. The most diverse and abundant animals in the Sandhills are the little known and seldom observed microscopic nematodes. Nematodes have adapted to a wide range of Sandhills habitats, from pristine groundwater-fed streams to alkaline lakes with a water chemistry that restricts most other forms of life. It is unknown what allows nematodes to survive in these extreme environments. However, given the combined effects of climate change and groundwater depletion, the Nebraska Sandhills provide a natural experiment to study the forces that drive diversity and adaptations in this ubiquitous group of organisms. This research will provide insights into how nematodes respond to environmental shifts resulting from the changing climate. Graduate and undergraduate students will engage with a multidisciplinary team of researchers to address these topical questions.  <br/><br/>Of specific interest to this research are freshwater nematodes in three families (i.e., Tobrilidae, Plectidae, and Monhysteridae) representing three evolutionarily distinct lineages known for their physiological and morphological plasticity but also critical to understanding nematode evolution and phylogeny. There are three main research objectives: 1) describing new species from three targeted nematode families, 2) determining their spatial distributions across the Sandhills, and 3) establishing their taxonomic and ecological context. To accomplish these objectives, three Sandhills regions will be sampled including Alkaline Lakes in Year 1, Sheridan and Cherry Counties in Year 2, and the eastern Sandhills in Year 3 for a total of 128 samples. Samples will be collected from a wide range of aquatic habitats such as lakes, fens/wet meadows, and streams/rivers. Each sample will be split into four aliquots and subsequently used for archiving, individual nematode specimen morphological and barcoding analyses, community metabarcoding and mitochondrial metagenomics, and biochemistry. These data will then be analyzed phylogenetically, and other analyses will include species delimitation, phylogenetic endemism, and multiple regression models and co-occurrence networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They represent a form of active learning, enriching traditional lessons by better engaging students and strengthening spatial, verbal, and math skills for many students. However, field trips also present major logistical, financial, and accessibility challenges for many educational institutions. In this IUSE level 3 project, Arizona State University in collaboration with the University of Missouri plans to engage in a 54-month project, the goal of which is to investigate the use of virtual field trips to improve student learning through a virtual field trip platform. The approach leverages web-based digital environments to deliver multi-user, synchronous, situated learning experiences offering students in-depth spatial communication practice. The project features a transformative change in the ways that spatial communication learning is conducted in STEM, democratizing it by making field trip experiences fully accessible anywhere, anytime. Broad dissemination of findings is assured through extensive faculty professional development and the implementation of iVisit in courses, workshops, webinars, and outreach. Intentional efforts will be made to reach low-income and students from groups underrepresented in STEM using iVisit, further improving STEM inclusion.<br/><br/>Research questions posited to guide the investigations include (1) What learning affordances in virtual field trips foster active spatial communication and student group engagement? and (2) How do virtual field trips improve student group spatial communication learning? A design-based research approach is to be employed to obtain answers since this offers the opportunity to improve educational practice through iterative analysis, design, and implementation. Researchers and practitioners will collaborate in real-world settings to create and test design principles and solutions for educational core areas in the current curriculum of Construction Management programs in the United States. The iVisit field trip contents and technology will be informed by the conceptual frameworks for situated learning, including Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), and spatial communication in construction. Focus group interviews for instructors recruited to provide the field trip experience for their courses, will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via thematic analysis. By leveraging the results from the focus groups, the field trip contents and the PBL Student Activities will be created. In order to support the created contents and activities, multiple media representations of spatial data will be embedded into iVisit to digitally embody the required knowledge for learning spatial communication. These field trip contents and PBL student activities will then be used for the iVisit platform development.

Time-frequency analysis originates in signal processing and considers the properties of a signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously. Historically, the development of time-frequency analysis was motivated in quantum mechanics (e.g. the celebrated Heisenberg uncertainty principle and related work of Wigner and Gabor) and radar detection. Modern applications relying on time-frequency techniques include areas such as image sampling, satellite transmission/GPS location and biomedicine. The PI will continue the development of powerful analytical methods to advance time-frequency analysis from a theoretical perspective. The PI will organize a series of educational activities that include outreach and mentoring for high school and undergraduate students, Putnam exam preparation, reading-course offerings, supervision of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and co-organization of seminars, conferences, and summer schools. <br/><br/>This project involves important problems in harmonic analysis with connections to additive combinatorics, ergodic theory and PDE. Relying on time-frequency analysis, the main focus is on the interplay between non-zero and zero curvature settings, with special attention paid to hybrid situations that encapsulate features from both extremes of the scale. The main themes include: (I) Multilinear maximal/singular/oscillatory operators: Building on a natural hierarchical structure that includes the Carleson operator and the bilinear Hilbert transform, this topic studies several relevant model problems in connection to two celebrated open questions: (a) the behavior of the pointwise convergence of bilinear Fourier series, and (b) the boundedness properties of the trilinear Hilbert transform. (II) Multidimensional maximal/singular/oscillatory operators along variable curves: This theme focuses on Carleson-Radon type behavior as well as on an array of problems related to Zygmund's differentiation conjecture. The crucial difficulty here lies in the multivariable dependence of the curves involved in the representation of the operators under study. This creates a series of new difficulties in part due to the existence of Kakeya/Besicovitch type phenomena. (III) Pointwise convergence of Fourier Series, end-point behavior: This topic revolves around the century-old problem regarding the behavior of Fourier Series and discusses some long-standing conjectures on which the investigator has made relevant progress. The main interest in this study relies on the new methods to be developed in order to exploit subtle connections with additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the intraday return path of a financial asset, the age-at-death distributions, the annual composition of energy sources, social networks, phylogenetic trees, and EEG scans or MRI fiber tracts of patients can all be viewed as random objects in certain metric spaces. For many endeavors in this area, the data being analyzed is collected with a natural ordering, i.e., the data can be viewed as an object-valued time series. Despite its prevalence in many applied problems, statistical analysis for such time series is still in its early development. A fundamental difficulty of developing statistical techniques is that the spaces where these objects live are nonlinear and commonly used algebraic operations are not applicable. This research project aims to develop new models, methodology and theory for the analysis of object-valued time series. Research results from the project will be disseminated to the relevant scientific communities via publications, conference and seminar presentations. The investigators will jointly mentor a Ph.D. student and involve undergraduate students in the research, as well as offering advanced topic courses to introduce the state-of-the-art techniques in object-valued time series analysis.<br/><br/>The project will develop a systematic body of methods and theory on modeling and inference for object-valued time series. Specifically, the investigators propose to (1) develop a new autoregressive model for distributional time series in Wasserstein geometry and a suite of tools for model estimation, selection and diagnostic checking; (2) develop new specification testing procedures for distributional time series in the one-dimensional Euclidean space; and (3) develop new change-point detection methods to detect distribution shifts in a sequence of object-valued time series. The above three projects tackle several important modeling and inference issues in the analysis of object-valued time series, the investigation of which will lead to innovative methodological and theoretical developments, and lay groundwork for this emerging field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, balance between tourism development, environmental conservation, and community benefits is hard to achieve. It is necessary to research the challenges and opportunities to accomplish such balance to inform future tourism governance. Research should particularly focus on islands where land is limited and isolated, there is high endemism, and economies are heavily reliant on tourism. To address this need, this doctoral dissertation study examines social and environmental implications of tourism governance in an island setting. The project trains a graduate student in methods of scientific data collection and analysis and builds capacity for the future conduct of scientific research in this setting. The data and findings are being disseminated to improve the public?s understanding of science and the scientific method, through colloquia, guest, and other communicative platforms outside academia.<br/><br/>This research applies common pool resource (CPR) governance theory to tourism in a novel way to help understand governance more thoroughly. Although historically used to explain natural resources, tourists can also be considered a CPR. CPRs are characterized by exclusion and subtraction. Resource users are nearly impossible to exclude, and one user?s gain is another?s loss. In tourism, tourists can be considered the resource, and those employed by tourism considered the users. Through the application of CPR governance to tourism, the study?s research questions consider formal and informal tourism management strategies, power dynamics among stakeholders, differing property rights regimes, and environmental impacts in and out of designated protected areas. The focus of the research in a major UNESCO World Heritage Site proves an ideal location to study socioecological balance and tourism governance, as the site?s famous wildlife drives the local economy through ecotourism. This ethnographic study utilizes 100 semi-structured interviews of stakeholders to capture community perspectives of tourism governance. Data analysis includes deductive and inductive coding of collected materials. The results engage with and further develop CPR governance theory by considering tourists as a mobile resource and users as those dependent on tourism, Additionally, results inform decision-makers on how to better address the balance between tourism, conservation, and community well-being, especially in island settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SSR expansion is a major cause of over fifty neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The trigger for expansion occurs during fundamental cellular processes,such as replication, in which DNA forms structures that are different from the standard Watson-Crick, double-stranded helix. This project seeks to uncover mechanisms that underlie SSR expansion, including the destabilizing role played by nonstandard DNA and RNA structures as well as the role of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system that, instead of repairing the mutations, paradoxically enhances their toxic expansions. In addition to its scientific impact, this collaborative research project will train several students. The larger Biophysics community will also benefit through continued development and support of our freely available simulation software as released via the national AMBER simulation package. Additional goals include fostering minority student education and enhancing undergraduate physics education.<br/><br/>This collaborative project amongst three researchers will combine single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) investigations focusing on the structural, mechanistic, and dynamical aspects of nucleotide and mismatch repair (MMR) complexes to elucidate their role in SSR expansions, and the role of atypical nucleic acid structures that hijack the MMR system. Surprisingly MMR, which acts after DNA replication to maintain genomic stability, has been associated with mutagenic action related to SSRs. To understand the crucial role played by atypical nucleic acid secondary structures, the combined computational and experimental investigations will focus on DNA three-way junctions and R-loops that form during transcription. The project will map out possible dynamical pathways for R-loop generation through the interplay of negative superhelicity and relative stability of the atypical structures, such as hybrid triplexes that can form during bidirectional transcription. To unravel the workings of the DNA MMR system, the project investigates the structure and function of the complexes formed between MMR proteins and SSR DNA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These changes threaten food security and at worst, have the potential to trigger regional famine and civil unrest and are thus a threat to national security. Understanding plant development and stress response processes is crucial to producing crops that are more resilient to increasingly extreme environmental conditions. Small peptides play significant roles in changes during development and stress responses in plants. This project aims to explore the functional role of 20 newly identified small peptides in plant development and response to environmental stressors to identify potential targets for crop improvement. This project will engage undergraduate students in the research process through hands-on experience in a course-based undergraduate research project in Molecular Biology and in more immersive summer research positions at Gustavus Adolphus College and the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell University. Additionally, undergraduate students will collaborate to develop and test next-generation science standards-aligned educational modules for K-12 educators on genetics, genetic engineering, and climate impacts on food security.<br/><br/>Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) play a significant role in gene expression changes during development and stress responses in plants.

Field trips are one of the most common methods used to deliver real life situated learning experiences to students. They represent a form of active learning, enriching traditional lessons by better engaging students and strengthening spatial, verbal, and math skills for many students. However, field trips also present major logistical, financial, and accessibility challenges for many educational institutions. In this IUSE level 3 project, Arizona State University in collaboration with the University of Missouri plans to engage in a 54-month project, the goal of which is to investigate the use of virtual field trips to improve student learning through a virtual field trip platform. The approach leverages web-based digital environments to deliver multi-user, synchronous, situated learning experiences offering students in-depth spatial communication practice. The project features a transformative change in the ways that spatial communication learning is conducted in STEM, democratizing it by making field trip experiences fully accessible anywhere, anytime. Broad dissemination of findings is assured through extensive faculty professional development and the implementation of iVisit in courses, workshops, webinars, and outreach. Intentional efforts will be made to reach low-income and students from groups underrepresented in STEM using iVisit, further improving STEM inclusion.<br/><br/>Research questions posited to guide the investigations include (1) What learning affordances in virtual field trips foster active spatial communication and student group engagement? and (2) How do virtual field trips improve student group spatial communication learning? A design-based research approach is to be employed to obtain answers since this offers the opportunity to improve educational practice through iterative analysis, design, and implementation. Researchers and practitioners will collaborate in real-world settings to create and test design principles and solutions for educational core areas in the current curriculum of Construction Management programs in the United States. The iVisit field trip contents and technology will be informed by the conceptual frameworks for situated learning, including Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), and spatial communication in construction. Focus group interviews for instructors recruited to provide the field trip experience for their courses, will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via thematic analysis. By leveraging the results from the focus groups, the field trip contents and the PBL Student Activities will be created. In order to support the created contents and activities, multiple media representations of spatial data will be embedded into iVisit to digitally embody the required knowledge for learning spatial communication.

Techniques currently used include the culturing of plant tissues, the insertion or editing of DNA, and the recovery of whole plants, but each of these steps poses challenges to the degree that they work reliably in relatively few species, and even then may not work well in all varieties of the species. To fill this gap, we propose that the parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta species) can be used to deliver gene editing molecules to a wide range of plants. Dodder plants live by attaching themselves to the stems of host plants and forming connections to withdraw water and nutrients. The organs that form the connections are called haustoria, and function somewhat similar to the way a mosquito taps into a vein to feed, and dodder is able to transmit a variety of large molecules, including proteins and RNAs, to their hosts. Another key feature of dodder is its ability to connect to an unusually wide range of host species, including the most important broadleaf crops. We will evaluate the ability of dodder to mobilize genome editing molecules into its hosts, with the goal of producing gene-edited seeds. Success in this activity would establish a novel vehicle for genetic modification of plants that is relatively simple, rapid, and broadly applicable.<br/><br/>The project will explore multiple possibilities for transferring Cas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) between dodder and hosts. Among the possibilities are the movement of these molecules from an easily transformed host, such as Arabidopsis, to result in transformed dodder, or the reverse from stably transformed dodder to result in a transformed host. Given success with these, we will explore the ability for dodder to serve as a bridge between a Cas9-sgRNA expressing donor host and a target host (e.g., tomato). The project has three major aims to achieve these outcomes, including: 1) the stable transformation of dodder (C. campestris) to be used in host gene editing, 2) the development of a dodder protoplast system for rapid screening of gene editing constructs, and 3) the development of a dodder-mediated gene editing system. Preliminary results indicate that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of dodder is possible, and the procedure will be optimized to enable generation of multiple lines bearing various transgene constructs. Other considerations include identifying promotors for the appropriate expression of gene constructs and optimized targeting for systemic trafficking of Cas9/sgRNA in the parasite-host system. For the outreach goal of this project, PIs will develop a program for refugee students to help them participate in project-related activities and develop their understanding of plant science at the University of Missouri. In summary, the project will leverage the intrinsically engaging topics of plant parasitism, RNA mobility, and genome editing to attract these students to plant science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By reducing the number of privately owned vehicles, this initiative can: 1) alleviate parking demands in densely populated areas, freeing up valuable space for alternative uses, 2) mitigate traffic congestion and pollution emissions, and 3) enhance access to affordable and reliable transportation for low-income and underserved communities. Collectively, the system will foster economic empowerment and social inclusion, as individuals can engage in activities that enrich their quality of life. This solution targets customer segments that find vehicle insurance, maintenance, and other ownership expenses burdensome. By paying only for usage time in a shared ownership model, users could reduce transportation costs by up to 65% compared to full ownership. Unlike classic car-sharing platforms, this technology can analyze users? travel behavior, predict and suggest trips, and maximize vehicle availability. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of an innovative approach in using travel behavior data and predictive artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for optimizing shared mobility systems. By leveraging these technologies, the commercialized product aims to disrupt the way individual travel patterns are analyzed, predicted, and utilized, leading to more efficient and reliable car-sharing services. Particularly, machine learning algorithms are utilized to collect, analyze, and cluster travel patterns, allowing for a deeper understanding of individual travel needs and predictable future trips. Furthermore, optimization algorithms are developed to match users with complimentary travel needs, maximizing system utilization and ultimately enhancing the reliability and quality of services while reducing the cost of car-sharing. By combining these cutting-edge methodologies and applying them in the context of shared mobility systems, the project offers practical solutions to improve efficiency and address drawbacks of existing mobility services.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  Competition for resources and the local environment can influence how different species are distributed across the landscape. This research will investigate how these factors impact where two species of lake fish live and predict whether increasing water temperatures may change future distributions. Knowledge gained from this project will be important for understanding effects on species in other ecosystems and aid in the conservation of species sensitive to rising temperatures. As a component of the training plan, the fellow will broaden participation of diverse scholars in biology by providing mentoring to underrepresented postdoctoral associates and late-stage graduate students to build community and recruit diverse scholars to postdoctoral positions. <br/><br/>This research will investigate the implications of interspecific interactions and local climate filters on species persistence under climate change scenarios by using a data-rich conservation-relevant system (warmwater and coolwater recreational fisheries). This research will address the hypothesis that competition and local climate filters will constrain current predictions of species distributions because differences in thermal tolerance and competitive ability will influence the niche overlap of coexisting species that create magnified competition factors reducing fitness of thermal specialist species.  This research will first determine local niche overlap of coexisting species (Largemouth Bass, thermal generalist, and Walleye, thermal specialist) with varying thermal tolerances in lakes across a climate gradient in North America (Southern Canada to Ohio River Valley) then evaluate the role of biotic and abiotic factors in predicting current species distributions. Finally, this research will utilize joint species distribution models to predict future species distributions under climate change scenarios (water temperatures predicted for 2040-2089). The fellow will facilitate a mentoring program for the University of Minnesota Postdoctoral Association members and late-stage graduate students from underrepresented backgrounds pre-and-post program to learn how to recruit and maintain Postdoctoral associates in the biological sciences.

One such response involves the control of gene expression via a process known as alternative polyadenylation (APA). APA is known to impact plant development and to affect the responses of plants to conditions such as elevated temperature or infection by pathogens. However, many questions remain concerning the connections between the cue (developmental or stress) and the protein machinery (the polyadenylation complex) that mediates and regulates APA. This project focuses on where and when in the plant these connections are made, and how these connections affect the composition of the machinery that mediates the process. To this end, a spectrum of tools will be brought to bear ? the activity of the complex will be assayed at the single cell and sub-cellular levels, and the composition of this complex will be studied in mutants of the model plant Arabidopsis that lack strategic protein subunits.  This research will lead to a better understanding of the growth and development of crop plants, and their responses to various stresses, the results of which will benefit crop breeding in the future.  This project will also provide training opportunities for postdoctoral scientists, undergraduate students, and faculty from a range of post-secondary institutions.  <br/><br/>Eukaryotic messenger RNA polyadenylation is mediated by a large complex (the PolyAdenylation Complex, or PAC). This project will test the model that variability in subunit composition is a key mechanism by which the plant PAC is regulated.  Three aims will be pursued.  One will test the hypothesis that the activity of the PAC varies in specific cells and tissues.  The second will test the hypothesis that the composition of the plant PAC determines its RNA substrate specificity.  The third will test the hypothesis that the composition of the functional plant PAC can vary. A diverse range of experimental approaches will be used.  The activity of the PAC will be assayed in different root cells using single cell transcriptomics approaches. The RNA specificity of the PAC will be assayed in nuclear extracts from cells lacking PAC subunits.  The compositions of complexes affinity-purified from different mutants will be determined by mass spectrometry.  This research will provide new insights into an evolutionarily-conserved complex and will impact fields of study beyond plant science. These studies will engage postdoctoral scientists, graduate students, and several undergraduate trainees. Workshops directed towards faculty at undergraduate-focused and minority-serving institutions will be conducted.

This project will provide statistical methods that will allow making decisions about an emergence of an atypical pattern in a complex system in real time with certain theoretical guarantees. The project will also offer multiple interdisciplinary training opportunities for the next generation of statisticians and data scientists.<br/><br/>The methodology that will be developed is related to sequential change point detection, but is different because the in-control state is estimated rather than assumed.

All methods will be inferential with controlled probabilities of type I errors. Some of the key aspects of the project can be summarized in the following points. First, statistical theory leading  to change point monitoring schemes in infinite dimensional function spaces will be developed. Second, strong  approximations valid in Banach spaces will lead to assumptions not encountered in scalar settings and potentially to different threshold functions. Third, for monitoring of random density functions, the above challenges will be addressed in custom metric spaces.

Most approaches to predict technology outcomes and identify opportunities focus primarily on analyzing the existing ?solution space?, i.e., cutting-edge technologies, recent inventions, and innovative startups claiming to offer a new and brighter future. While uncovering and systematically tracking such technology solutions is important and has become increasingly feasible given modern data-driven tools and approaches, it misses a critical piece of the equation: a deep understanding of the underlying problems and needs that such technologies aim to address and overcome. Ultimately, the value and readiness of any individual technology or technical ecosystem is a function of the problems/needs that it addresses, as well as the complicating problems/challenges that it creates. In practice, a failure to understand the presence, status, and importance of problems associated with technology can lead to serious blind-spots, including poor investment decisions driven by inaccurate predictions of technology trajectory, poor assessments of technology value, and missed opportunities for innovation and partnership. <br/><br/>This project aims to equip technology innovators and investors with a more holistic view of the technology landscape by building a deeper understanding of not only the relevant technologies and organizations involved, but also the complex network of problems that drive such innovation forward. Leveraging cutting-edge data mining and AI/machine learning, comprehensive datasets of the current and historical problems-to-be-solved in various technical domains, along with a range of diverse metrics for each will be created. These data will be compared against historical outcomes to isolate potential statistical factors that may be predictive of both technology capability outcomes, as well as high-leverage problems on which to focus technical research and investment. The intended outcome is for innovators to be able to better understand how to spot hidden opportunities for high-value research/innovation, assess the value/breadth of impact of individual technologies, identify ideal partners working on complementary problems/technologies, highlight high-leverage organizations/efforts where additional investment dollars could make the biggest impact on technology/market outcomes, and better monitor and predict how broader technical ecosystems are likely to evolve over the long-term. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project involves 1) collecting a massive set of technical, industry, and other data sources, including global patents, scientific journals, trade publications, industry news, etc. across three selected technical domains; 2) applying a range of proprietary and open-source AI/NLP models and techniques to identify, cluster, structure, label, and summarize problems, technologies, and organizations; 3) analyzing the set of aggregated problems, technologies, and organizations according to various statistical metrics, e.g., publishing activity, language patterns, network statistics, etc; 4) building ?ground-truth? datasets for comparison based on SME surveys and historical datasets; and 5) identifying potential predictive factors, and making recommendations for integrating such problem-oriented datasets into broader, downstream modeling efforts. In addition to providing immediate insights on the chosen technical domains, resulting datasets and learnings from this project could serve as a proof-of-concept for systematically integrating problem-based analyses into future technology forecasting efforts, as well as R&D and policy investment planning, technology/company valuation, partner identification for collaborative R&D and technology transfer/licensing, and much more.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experiential learning, a pedagogical approach that engages students in hands-on experiences, improves students? conceptual understanding of abstract concepts and enables them to connect theoretical knowledge learned in the classroom to real-world situations. In this IUSE Level 2 Engaged Student Learning project, experiential learning acquired through in-class physical experiments using low-cost desktop learning modules (LCDLMs) is compared with that acquired through web-based interactive digital experiments (WIDEs). Although both LCDLMs and WIDEs offer educational institutions a cost-effective, accessible way to provide high-quality laboratory experiences in engineering, this potentially transformative project seeks to directly compare the efficacy of LCDLMs and WIDEs. The main advantages of WIDEs are that they are inexpensive, highly scalable, easy to maintain, and deployable across digital devices. The collaborating institutions ? University of Colorado Boulder and Washington State University - intend to make the WIDEs experiments freely available to engineering and engineering technology students online, through the widely used LearnChemE website and on YouTube. Comparative assessments will be made at five institutions, including a minority-serving institution.<br/><br/>The project is expected to generate transformative new insights on teaching through virtual and physical experiments by identifying contexts in which physical (LCDLMs) may be more beneficial, as well as identifying how to improve virtual experiments (WIDEs) to best achieve specific learning objectives. Fifteen WIDEs for each of three engineering courses and two new LCDLMs will be created. The WIDEs will be prepared using JavaScript and/or Python so they play directly in most browsers thus permitting use on Windows-based or Apple computers, as well as iPads and other tablets. For WIDEs, the accompanying screencasts will be recorded and processed using special software (Camtasia), then embedded on pages within the WIDE. Additionally, the same screencasts will also be located on a YouTube channel so that they reach the widest possible audience. The hypothesis that WIDEs will achieve comparable learning outcomes to LCDLMs will be tested through a quasi-experimental design study in which students from a given class will be randomly assigned to use either the simulation (WIDE) or the physical experiment (LCDLM).

Through the use of careful experiments, clever modeling and convincing analysis of data, behavioral economists have developed a powerful, predictive portrait of how humans reason about and respond to risk, uncertainty, time delay and small scale social interactions.  But behavioral economics thus far has not yet seriously turned its powerful lens towards the classical focus of economic theory: understanding how individuals respond to and reason about the mass behavior of large groups of people.  Yet understanding the special psychology of mass behavior, and how it impacts markets, online cohorts, mass movements and electorates, has never been more urgent in our increasingly connected world.   In this research, the investigator will use the powerful conceptual and empirical tools of contemporary behavioral economics to answer some basic questions about the psychology of mass behavior in order to guide the development of predictive models and guide decisions.   Using experiments, the researcher will explore how large groups reason together, how individuals reason about large groups and how people respond to the strategic powerlessness of acting as a member of a large group.  The dataset gathered by the investigator and the conceptual insights gleaned from it will allow us to better understand the function of human institutions, the way people form beliefs, and the rationality of large groups of people acting and interacting in concert.<br/><br/>Behavioral economics has mostly, so far, focused its attention on understanding how people reason about and form preferences over either (i) exogenous variables or (ii) very small-scale strategic interaction.   For instance, the vast majority of empirical and theoretical work in the field focuses on understanding individual-level optimization, statistical inference, risky choice, ambiguous choice, intertemporal choice, social preferences, and behavior in games that involve only a handful of players.   This focus has been highly productive, generating both (i) a set of sharp characterizations of the structure of human reasoning and preference formation in these settings and (ii) a set of conceptual and empirical methods for characterizing and modeling individual behavior. This work will extend these methods to include how people reason about and respond to the behavior of large groups of other people (?mass behavior?).   The idea is to use the same style of experiments that have been honed for decades for understanding statistical inference, optimization and preference formation in response to exogenous variables, and simply replace these exogenous variables with the endogenous aggregate behaviors of large groups of other people.   The research project will focus on understanding (i) how large groups of people reason or compute together in various canonical institutional settings, (ii) how individuals respond to the strategic powerlessness of being a member of a large group (i.e., of being a ?price taker?) and (iii) how people reason about the outcomes of mass interaction when forming social opinions and views.  The data collected will be relevant to (a) building better models of large-scale institutions like markets, organizations and electorates, (b) understanding mob behavior and mass movements, and (c) designing better decisions for an increasingly integrated and coordinated world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Grasslands in many desert or semi-desert regions around the world are becoming dominated by woody plants or shrubs and bare ground. Such changes in the plant community can be good but are more likely to be bad for animals living in these environments. Certain animals may even influence how quickly grasses are replaced by shrubs. However, for most species, these relationships are unknown. By eating insects, bats reduce the need for pesticides in agricultural systems, and can benefit plant health in other ecosystems. This project will help develop ideas and plans to protect and promote healthy grasslands and wildlife communities. In addition, this project will provide hands-on research experiences for diverse undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will monitor bat and arthropod interactions across a grass?shrub gradient in the northern Chihuahuan Desert to evaluate how insectivorous bats are affected by?and potentially influence?shrub encroachment in arid landscapes. Research will be conducted at the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in southern New Mexico, leveraging a variety of long-term experiments and datasets. The researchers first aim to quantify species-specific bat activity using acoustic recorders across habitats that are grass-dominated, shrub-dominated, or in the grass?shrub transition zone. Bats will also be captured across these habitats to collect fecal samples that will be molecularly analyzed to determine what insects are present in their diets. The researchers expect that shrub encroachment reduces habitat complexity and potential arthropod food opportunities, and thus diminishes arthropod species richness and abundance. This may in turn reduce the species richness, foraging activity, and diet diversity among the bats preying on those arthropods. The researchers will also measure the indirect effects of bats on woody plant success in at-risk grasslands. Reductions in insects and herbivory will be quantified by comparing areas from which bats are excluded and control sites within habitats that are grass-dominated, shrub-dominated, or in the grass?shrub transition zone. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Population and Community Ecology cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Biological Infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore long-term records from tree rings on past rainfall do not robustly record wet extremes. This bias in the baseline data of the past rainfall variability is problematic for water management and projecting the impact of future rainfall extremes. The goals of this project are to use dendrometers (instruments that record tree growth in real time) to measure the response of tree growth to rainfall at four sites that are part of the AmeriFlux network, sites that have weather stations that measure detailed records of rainfall through time. The investigators will use what they learned from the dendrometer study on how trees respond to wet extremes to refine reconstructions of rainfall and wet extremes from the past from an existing archive of tree ring cores, and use models to study the uncertainty in tree ring reconstructions of rainfall extremes. The project will include training of a postdoc, graduate student and undergraduate students, and public outreach events on climate change through collaboration with a nonprofit cinema's ""Science on Screen"" series.<br/><br/>Tree-ring based hydroclimate records of wet extremes are not as robust, which is problematic for water management and projecting the impacts of future hydroclimate extremes.

Improving ADS safety is critical to achieving road safety.  Physical testing of ADS-driven vehicles, albeit important, is limited. Testing autonomous vehicles on city roads does not scale and, more importantly, can be unsafe. For these reasons, simulation-based testing has been shown to be of fundamental importance to ADS quality assurance; it enables developers to assess ADS robustness before deployment. Simulation-based testing relies on high-fidelity simulators. Developers ?plug? their ADS into a simulation platform and run tests largely consisting of a route definition within a map with static and dynamic obstacles. Despite recent advances in techniques for simulation-based ADS testing, three important challenges remain. First, finding failure-revealing inputs using simulation is costly. Second, existing techniques often report duplicate infractions that do not contribute to information gain. Third, existing techniques make unrealistic assumptions about the environment. For example, they assume a single ADS-driven vehicle in the simulation. This project proposes novel approaches to mitigate these fundamental challenges, advancing the state of the art in simulation-based ADS Testing. <br/><br/>In this project, machine learning-based techniques will be used to address the fundamental limitations of simulation-based testing for ADS. One research goal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of simulation-based testing by leveraging the risk signals produced by anomaly detectors during a simulation to improve the ability of simulation-based testing to detect infractions within a given time budget. A second research goal is to improve the relevance of testing by leveraging semantic information embedded in parts of a simulation to deduplicate infractions that testing techniques report. A third research goal is to improve the realism of simulation-based testing by using real-life data and human input.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Also known as colorism, it typically manifests itself in favoring lighter skin over darker skin and has been found to be an important predictor of many outcomes, including occupation, educational attainment, criminal justice system involvement, and marital outcomes, among others.  However, there is no objective way of measuring skin color.  This CAREER award will fund research to develop new methods, based on artificial intelligence technology, to accurately measure skin tone, for a large number of young people and make the data available to other researchers.  This will allow more research on the relationship between skin tone and several outcomes.  The research will also use the data to investigate how skin tone affects who is chosen to participate in crime intervention programs as well as parental investments in their children?s education.  The results of this research will provide inputs into efforts to reduce differential opportunities based in skin tone differences.  This will improve the overall quality of the US labor force, increase productivity, economic growth, and improve the well-being of citizens.  The results of this research will also help establish the US as a global leader in reducing the effects of colorism on outcomes.  <br/><br/><br/>Despite the potential distortionary effects on decision-making, colorism has been understudied in the economics literature, partly because it is difficult to measure colorism. The first part of this CAREER research award will develop AI and neural networks assisted computational protocols to systematically classify skin color that is scalable, replicable, accounts for local knowledge in a study setting, and use the protocols to create a large data set on skin color. The methods and data collected will open new avenues of inquiry across the social sciences, medicine, humanities, and law.  The research project will also study how individual-level  interventions, such as those related to education and other human capital investments, and empowerment programs, may be causally influenced by colorism. This part of this research will also study the  heterogeneous impacts of interventions based on skin color, as well as explore potential underlying mechanisms that contribute to these differential effects. The results of this research will provide inputs into efforts to reduce differential opportunities to people based on skin color; efforts that are likely to improve the overall quality of the US labor force, increase productivity, economics growth, and the well-being of American citizens.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Natural populations experiencing global climate change are threatened by increasingly complex, stressful environments. In these complex environments, the ability of organisms to adapt to a myriad of adverse conditions is essential for survival. As such, there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that facilitate adaptation to complex environmental stress. The research aims to support this need by investigating the molecular responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast populations to complex environments using different strengths and combinations of antifungal drug stressors. This research will reveal evolutionary dynamics resulting across a spectrum of environmental complexity, thereby improving predictions of the impacts of climate change on natural populations. The research will also deepen our understanding of the genetic basis of antifungal drug resistance. Mentorship and outreach activities will be implemented in this project to increase participation of students underrepresented in the sciences and broaden education in evolutionary biology, climate change, and drug resistance.<br/><br/>The fellow will perform two highly-replicated evolution experiments using a recombinant S. cerevisiae yeast population as the model system to characterize the dynamics and outcomes of adaptation in complex environments. Replicate S. cerevisiae populations will be evolved for 100 generations under low, moderate, and high selection intensities of three antifungal drugs (Aim 1) and in combinations of each drug (Aim 2). Evolved populations from both evolution studies will be phenotyped for fitness changes and sequenced using multi-omics tools (DNA-sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and ATAC-sequencing) to probe evolutionary changes in the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome via modeled comparisons between populations evolved in each environment. Through this research, the fellow will gain invaluable training in the computational analysis of complex ?omics? datasets and bolster communication and mentorship skills. To engage in open science efforts, the fellow will incorporate findings from the research into outreach events and broadly disseminate all data, code, and methodologies related to the project.

During the preschool years, teachers contribute to children?s language development by engaging in conversations with them. However, it is not clear how often preschool teachers have language interactions with children, or if every child in the class receives opportunities to talk with teachers. This project uses innovative sensing technology tools to examine teachers? language interactions with preschoolers over the course of a school year. The project employs advanced speech processing algorithms that automatically analyze language data, providing a more detailed understanding of how language is used in the classroom than has previously been possible. The results provide insights into how preschool language experiences shape language development and whether children?s language experiences differ based on their background characteristics, such as their standardized English language skills, temperament, or gender. The eventual goal of this work is to provide teachers with concrete, actionable data on how to enrich language experiences in preschool and lay a strong foundation for future reading success.<br/><br/>The study seeks to answer the following research questions: How often do teacher language interactions occur in preschool classrooms? Which children in a classroom are involved in fewer or briefer teacher language interactions, as compared to their peers? Do teacher language interactions change over the course of the year? Are teacher language interactions associated with growth in children?s English language skills? Monthly data are collected in preschool classrooms using sensing technology tools to address these questions. These sensing technology tools allow for the identification of language interactions, or moments when a teacher and child are in proximity to each other and are talking. Information is also collected on children?s language skills, temperament, teacher-child relationships, and demographic information. The outcomes of this project are expected to inform models of language development in preschool-age children and provide fine-grained data that can be used by educators to equitably support language development in preschool settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Citizenship laws are important to study because they simultaneously define who can participate in a national election and who belongs in the nation. And while autocratic contexts may not provide opportunities to formally participate like democracies, shaping a cohesive nation remains an important goal. Is citizenship law more inclusive in democracies than autocracies? To examine the political factors that determine citizenship policy, this project collects global data of laws for gaining and losing citizenship, across countries and over time. With this comparative view, the project can examine the relationship between regime values and how states define their national communities. This project advances prosperity and welfare, especially in terms of how obtaining citizenship can create security and opportunity for immigrants and diasporic communities.<br/><br/>While existing scholarship focuses largely on contemporary politics, ranging from the role of far-right political parties and social mobilization to court decisions, there is a lack of theories that considers factors beyond democratic politics. This project theorizes that regime-level factors create meaningful contexts for understanding variation in citizenship policy settings. As a result, democracies and autocracies may both maintain similarly accessible (or restrictive) citizenship laws but be motivated by distinct reasons. To test this and related arguments, the project will conduct statistical analysis with original data, obtained by building an expanded Global Citizenship Law Dataset, which describes laws for gaining and losing citizenship, across 191 countries and between the years 1960 and 2024. This research will make significant contributions to scholarly literature on citizenship and migration, public policymaking, welfare, immigration politics, and democratization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viruses play a pivotal role in shaping microbial host genomes and phenotypes and ultimately influence microbial diversity, species evolution, and global-scale biogeochemical cycles. Despite ongoing climate change-induced alterations in environmental conditions, the current understanding of how these changes affect viral dynamics is lacking. The fellow will conduct a project that will help fill this knowledge gap by evaluating how increasing osmotic and ionic stress influences viral-mediated shifts in microbial genomes and phenotypes. Specifically, the fellow will enable the complete evaporation of seawater in a controlled experimental setting and measure changes in microbial host-virus dynamics. Additionally, the fellow will i) provide high school and colleges students with hands-on research experience working with bioinformatic data and viral samples and ii) mentor STEM-curious students from historically underrepresented backgrounds. <br/><br/>Climate change-induced global evaporative loss is impacting numerous shallow aquatic environments by increasing salinity, and thereby osmotic and ionic, stress. The fellow will explore the influence of these shifting stresses on viral activity and how these changes affect microbial host genomes and phenotypes to determine the large-scale effects of these changes on microbial evolution and global biogeochemical cycling. The fellow will use metagenomic and viromic approaches combined with flow cytometry to track changes in microbial and viral community abundance and diversity, microbial activity, and viral influence on microbial host metabolism. Additionally, several microbial host-virus systems will be isolated and characterized to identify how salinity-driven changes in viral activity influence isolated microbial host growth rates, burst sizes, and respiration rates. These results will enable a stronger understanding of how environmental-driven changes in viral dynamics affect microbial host genomes and phenotypes as well as global-scale carbon cycling.

Intuitively one may think of positive curvature in the following manner: On the surface of Earth any two longitudes from the North pole appear to bend towards each other and indeed they meet at the South pole. This is true of all points on Earth if we imagine longitudes emanating from each point. Because of this, we say that the surface of Earth has positive curvature everywhere. By the same token, a saddle has negative curvature at the point where the rider sits while a flat table has zero curvature. In higher dimensions, matters are far less visually apparent. One deals almost exclusively with equations and sophisticated geometrical techniques that describe the curvature of manifolds, a term that refers to objects that, roughly speaking, have no sharp edges. Manifolds of bounded size are called compact manifolds.  One of the great mysteries in the study of positive or non-negative curvature is the dearth of examples. The techniques at hand are few and the number of known examples remains relatively small.  In this project the PI aims to study positively and non-negatively curved manifolds with proposed new methods of construction. The project also presents several broader impact activities including outreach, inclusivity, and undergraduate research.<br/> <br/> <br/>The study of manifolds with positive or non-negative sectional curvature has a long history with roots as far back as Felix Klein in the late nineteenth century.  The PI's work for many years has been to try and construct new examples while attempting to prove rigidity theorems in the presence of additional hypotheses.  Complete manifolds of non-negative sectional curvature fall into two broad categories: compact and non-compact. In the non-compact case we have the beautiful Soul theorem of Cheeger and Gromoll:  A complete, non-compact manifold with non-negative sectional curvature is diffeomorphic to a vector bundle over a closed, totally convex submanifold.  In the compact case, Gromov's theorem restricts the topology sharply:  The total Betti number is bounded by a constant depending only on the dimension.  Beyond these theorems the question remains: which closed manifolds admit metrics of non-negative sectional curvature?  In this project the PI continues their recently successful research program on constructing new manifolds with non-negative curvature as well as a new proposed method for constructing positive curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Embryo transfer use to improve domestic herds is currently limited due to low success rates and almost exclusively used in a small margin of elite herds. By improving the success of this technology and lowering the cost, it will democratize it for wider industry use. Accelerating national sheep and inventory numbers through more productive and prolific animals will significantly bolster the health, safety, and welfare of the American populace through increased access to economical, lean protein. More animals entering the food supply means job creation and an expansion of tax revenue through increased demand for animal feedstuffs, routine animal care, veterinarian services, transportation, animal processing, and distribution of value-added products. Fulfilling U.S. consumer needs with U.S. grown sheep and goats means job creation and internal food security.<br/><br/>In this project, machine learning models with computer vision and multifactorial herd qualities will be studied to significantly improve sheep and goat breeding success rates. Key identified features in the embryo will be used as a baseline that will enable evaluation of a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to the ewe during the gestational period to better understand environmental factors related to pregnancy failure and success.  This analysis will produce a comprehensive embryo and animal health analysis that can be used in sheep and goat embryology laboratories to enable veterinarians, embryologists, and producers to improve breeding success rates.

Students' sense of belonging in their classrooms is directly associated with their likelihood of persisting in STEM, be it in their chosen disciplines or more broadly. Group work is one method of supporting engagement and sense of belonging in undergraduate classrooms. This project plans to investigate students' experiences when collaborating on pair programming tasks in the data science classroom, with a particular focus on students from populations that have historically been underrepresented in data science and broader STEM. Studies have shown that pair programming in computer science courses can either serve as a positive experience for students or can magnify imbalances in power or perceived authority. The project will iteratively design and test tools that will support positive pair programming experiences and improve student learning. The collaborating institutions provide a rich opportunity to study and refine pair programming practices in distinct contexts, as California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo is a predominantly white institution and California State University, Monterey Bay is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to understand how small group experiences, specifically pair programming, can be designed to create engaging, inclusive, and effective learning opportunities for all students. There is minimal research on specific ways that instructors might foster equitable student collaborations in the data science classroom, and this project's knowledge generation efforts will address this critical gap. The project will use discourse analysis to investigate the conditions under which students are positioned with power and authority when collaborating with their peers on pair programming tasks in data science. A cross-case analysis will be used to explore project-developed pedagogies in a variety of classes within two demographically different institutions. Through these investigations, the project will identify positive, asset-centered narratives about students and create professional development materials to train educators to enact equitable, effective pair programming approaches for data science education. Each of these project goals should increase and strengthen the future data science workforce. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also funded by the NSF Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is widely recognized that context?the set of options under consideration?significantly influences our decisions in areas like perception, preference, and predicting future events. This project aims to deepen our understanding of how context impacts our beliefs in these diverse areas. Knowledge of context effects can lead to powerful tools for influencing judgment and decision-making. For example, school dining services might design menus to promote healthier choices. Additionally, understanding of how context impacts judgments can improve the quality of decisions. For instance, doctors could use this insight to provide more accurate assessments of treatment plans, thereby helping patients make better-informed decisions.<br/><br/>This research seeks to unravel the fundamental characteristics of the general context effect and explore its domain specificity or generality. This goal is achieved by constructing detailed and empirical mappings of context effects within domains of perception, preference, and predicting future events. Such comprehensive mapping attempts to provide an extensive understanding of how context effects operate within and across these domains. The dataset generated from this project is an invaluable resource for rigorously evaluating various judgment and decision-making models. The richness of this dataset, combined with the detailed mapping of context effects it provides, presents a substantial challenge to judgment and decision-making models, compelling them to accommodate the full spectrum of these effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cell division is a critical process essential for the proper growth and maintenance of living organisms. A better characterization and understanding of this process could have applications in enhancing biodiversity, agriculture, or food production. Cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division, involves the physical separation of the two newly formed cells. In animals and fungi, this process is regulated by a series of conserved molecular pathways, one of which involves a key protein called Sid2p. Recent research indicates that other proteins, known as scaffold proteins, play a role in recruiting Sid2p at the appropriate time to the precise location where the cell will divide. Understanding how these scaffold proteins interact with Sid2p is essential for unraveling the mechanisms underlying cytokinesis. By utilizing genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to investigate these interactions, this project will provide insights into the fundamental principles governing cell division. In addition to the research goals, this project will enable training of Wellesley College undergraduate students in basic genetics, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, quantitative microscopy, and computational image analysis. Trainees will also help stimulate interest and excitement about scientific research in the next generation of students through their mentorship of participants in the Wellesley College Science Club for Girls, which is an after-school outreach program for girls interested in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Cytokinesis, the final step in cell division, is a highly regulated process that must be coordinated with many concurrent events in the cell cycle. Cytokinesis in animals and fungi involves the conserved mechanism of contractile ring assembly and constriction, which has been extensively studied in fission yeast. The fission yeast SIN pathway is a signaling cascade, homologous to the mammalian Hippo pathway, which initiates completion of cell division by promoting onset of contractile ring constriction. The final step in the SIN involves the NDR-family kinase Sid2p, which is homologous to the mammalian division regulatory protein LATS1/2. Work from the principal investigator?s lab and others implicate four Type 2 interphase node scaffold proteins in recruiting Sid2p to the contractile ring. This project tests the hypothesis that these scaffold proteins function in a synergistic pathway to localize Sid2p to the division site during cytokinesis, thereby ensuring timely cell division. This research will characterize Sid2p recruitment to the division site in cells depleted of the cytokinesis scaffold proteins and evaluate the effect on contractile ring constriction and time to completion of division using fluorescence microscopy. The project will then identify binding domains between scaffold proteins and Sid2p using truncation mutants and immunoprecipitation. Together, this project provides insight into localization of the NDR kinase Sid2p during cytokinesis in fission yeast, which will in turn provide a better understanding of how this conserved, essential protein is regulated and contributes to successful cell division in other organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One feature that these applications often share is that the high-dimensional unknown is believed to satisfy a complexity-limiting, low-dimensional structure.  Specifics of the posited low-dimensional structure are mostly unknown, so a statistically interesting and scientifically relevant problem is structure learning, i.e., using data to learn the latent low-dimensional structure.  Because structure learning problems are ubiquitous and reliable uncertainty quantification is imperative, results from this project will have an impact across the biomedical, physical, and social sciences.  In addition, the project will offer multiple opportunities for career development of new generations of statisticians and data scientists.<br/><br/>Frequentist methods focus on data-driven estimation or selection of a candidate structure, but currently there are no general strategies for reliable uncertainty quantification concerning the unknown structure.  Bayesian methods produce a data-dependent probability distribution over the space of structures that can be used for uncertainty quantification, but it comes with no reliability guarantees.  A barrier to progress in reliable uncertainty quantification is the oppositely extreme perspectives: frequentists' anathema of modeling structural/parametric uncertainty versus Bayesians' insistence that such uncertainty always be modeled precisely and probabilistically.  Overcoming this barrier requires a new perspective falling between these two extremes, and this project will develop a new framework that features a more general and flexible perspective on probability, namely, imprecise probability.  Most importantly, this framework will resolve the aforementioned issues by offering new and powerful methods boasting provably reliable uncertainty quantification in structure learning applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By automating routine tasks, the system can free up time to focus on instructional design and teaching, alleviating the workload on instructors and teaching assistants. This innovation represents an affordable alternative for institutions (including community colleges and other non-traditional teaching institutions) that cannot afford additional teaching assistance for instructors, allowing them to focus on more complex and creative educational tasks and student engagement. The benefit of this approach is its potential to enhance teaching effectiveness, increase engagement in the learning process for large classes, and improve individualized learning, while preserving and reflecting the personalized approach of the instructor. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a Retrieval Augmented Generative artificial intelligence (RAG) ?always available? chatbot system called ChaTA (short for Chat Teaching Assistant). The technology is an instructor-customizable interface between students and instructors, based on a novel approach to RAG prompting where a Large Language Model (LLM) is combined with an instructor supplied database of information (their notes, presentations and videos, and answers). The LLM will interpret the student questions, classify them based on instructor policy, convert them into a query of the database, and evaluate if the results answer the original question. The chatbot learns from the student ratings of the acceptability of the answers and is moderated by the instructor (to identify ""hallucinations"" or erroneous or nonresponsive answers) as it learns to reflect the instructor?s point of view.

This coexistence of cells with different attributes is an important aspect of microbial ecology, conferring resilience and adaptability to microbial populations. Remarkably, the emergence of heterogeneity does not necessarily depend on complex cellular mechanisms, but can instead be achieved through fundamental physical and biological processes that are common to all microbes. Yet, despite our broad understanding of microbial physiology, we still lack a framework to connect the molecular processes happening at the cellular scale to the complex behaviors we observe in microbial communities. The goal of this award is to understand the role of two general features of microbial populations in generating phenotypic diversity: noise in gene expression and spatial variations across microbial colonies. Using antibiotic responses in bacteria as a model system, this project will investigate how these features affect responses in single cells, providing a mechanism for the emergence of complex collective behaviors such as increased antibiotic resistance and ?memory? from past events. These studies advance basic research by laying a foundation for future investigations into how complex environments mediate microbial evolution, as well as developing state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods, ultimately leading to a framework to predict the behavior of microbial populations that will guide the development of synthetic systems for biotechnology applications.<br/><br/>With support from the National Science Foundation, this research project aims to investigate the hypothesis that the interplay between drug action, gene regulation and cell metabolism determines phenotypic diversity and collective behavior in microbial populations during antibiotic responses. To overcome difficulties in studying cell responses across multiple scales, this approach combines microfluidic experiments to image single bacterial cells and biofilm-like colonies with liquid-culture experiments to measure growth in large planktonic populations. These experiments will be leveraged to develop physical models of the dynamics of antibiotic responses. The research plan will answer two questions: 1) How do stochastic fluctuations generate phenotypic diversity? Here, the investigators will develop a theory to understand how metabolism-mediated feedback mechanisms amplify stochastic variations to generate phenotypic variability in a predictable manner. These results will describe the nature and stability of these different phenotypes and connect single-cell heterogeneity to population-level growth. 2) How are collective responses coordinated among different phenotypes in spatially structured microbial colonies? Here, the investigators will develop a theory to understand the contribution of spatial structure to the collective mechanisms of resistance provided by organization into biofilms. Together, these aims will elucidate how heterogeneity emerges in microbial populations and how it gives rise to complex behaviors at the population level.

Land-based aquaculture production has increased substantially in recent decades and is expected to expand faster than marine-based production. Recent work suggests that the shift from rice to aquaculture in coastal areas is not motivated simply by profit or policy drivers. Instead, the more frequent large storm surges and salinity related to increasing environmental variability may be catalyzing the shift. There are also indications that the shift to aquaculture is not benign for either the environment or the people. The dynamic relationships between aquaculture land transformations, environmental drivers, and social-environmental consequences, however, have received relatively little empirical attention. This doctoral dissertation research project aims to explain the historical geographical patterns of aquaculture land transitions, the motivations driving these transitions at a household level, and the consequences of these transitions on the people, the environment, and places. The project investigates whether shifts to aquaculture are an adaptative response and whether this human intervention is detrimental for marginalized groups, especially women and landless laborers. An additional objective is to ascertain the extent to which these practices are potentially accelerating sea-level rise outcomes in fragile coastal areas. The project also facilitates the training of an early-career researcher to conduct interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>To understand the patterns, drivers, and consequences of aquaculture land transformation, the research design uses a mixed-methods approach. First, remote sensing methods and causal inferential analysis are employed to understand the relationship between past experiences of storm surges, historical changes in coastal salinity, and temporal land changes to aquaculture. Second, the researchers employ a novel, large-scale social survey to understand the specific hierarchy of factors driving household-level land change decisions. Finally, to understand the consequences of these transitions on people and places, the targeted survey on aquaculture impacts and focus group discussions, particularly with marginalized social groups, are undertaken. The project leverages a natural experiment to collect and study soil and groundwater quality changes that can be attributed to aquaculture practice. In turn, this research shows the extent to which aquaculture practices and management plans can help to balance tradeoffs between social and environmental outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, such (un)installation tasks are being performed manually with the help of helicopters, cranes, scaffolding, and/or rope access. Such manipulations are dangerous since, for example, a helicopter would be at low altitude where it would be impossible to recover from an engine failure and would have substantial risk of colliding with the line. On the other hand, conventional multicopter drones cannot perform heavy sensor installations. Specifically, they move by first pitching or rolling (underactuated motion), which hampers their ability to counter wind disturbances. This project will develop (i) techniques for localizing the drone with respect to power lines and (ii) control strategies that enable installation, removal, and maintenance of DLR sensors.<br/><br/>The work proposed in this project is to use innovative algorithms to navigate a cyclorotor-based drone to a power line based on the measurements of the electric and magnetic fields around power lines. This state-estimation technique around power lines is robust, using only the root-mean square (rms) electric/magnetic field that is present around the power lines naturally due to the flow of power through them. In parallel, a control system will be developed to bring the drone stably into contact with a power line to install and uninstall dynamic-line rating (DLR) sensors, bird-diverters, and other line products. This control system will be designed to seamlessly handle any abrupt transitions from free-flight to contact with a power line.

Field trips are one of the most common methods used to deliver real life situated learning experiences to students. They represent a form of active learning, enriching traditional lessons by better engaging students and strengthening spatial, verbal, and math skills for many students. However, field trips also present major logistical, financial, and accessibility challenges for many educational institutions. In this IUSE level 3 project, Arizona State University in collaboration with the University of Missouri plans to engage in a 54-month project, the goal of which is to investigate the use of virtual field trips to improve student learning through a virtual field trip platform. The approach leverages web-based digital environments to deliver multi-user, synchronous, situated learning experiences offering students in-depth spatial communication practice. The project features a transformative change in the ways that spatial communication learning is conducted in STEM, democratizing it by making field trip experiences fully accessible anywhere, anytime. Broad dissemination of findings is assured through extensive faculty professional development and the implementation of iVisit in courses, workshops, webinars, and outreach. Intentional efforts will be made to reach low-income and students from groups underrepresented in STEM using iVisit, further improving STEM inclusion.<br/><br/>Research questions posited to guide the investigations include (1) What learning affordances in virtual field trips foster active spatial communication and student group engagement? and (2) How do virtual field trips improve student group spatial communication learning? A design-based research approach is to be employed to obtain answers since this offers the opportunity to improve educational practice through iterative analysis, design, and implementation. Researchers and practitioners will collaborate in real-world settings to create and test design principles and solutions for educational core areas in the current curriculum of Construction Management programs in the United States. The iVisit field trip contents and technology will be informed by the conceptual frameworks for situated learning, including Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), and spatial communication in construction. Focus group interviews for instructors recruited to provide the field trip experience for their courses, will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via thematic analysis. By leveraging the results from the focus groups, the field trip contents and the PBL Student Activities will be created. In order to support the created contents and activities, multiple media representations of spatial data will be embedded into iVisit to digitally embody the required knowledge for learning spatial communication. These field trip contents and PBL student activities will then be used for the iVisit platform development.

Bacterial extracellular vesicles can potentially be produced at low cost and have numerous biotechnological applications including vaccines, therapeutics for inflammatory diseases, and drug delivery vehicles. In particular, most inflammatory diseases lack desirable treatments or cures, with an unmet need existing between first line therapies and more aggressive antibody-based therapies that require costly and laborious administration via intravenous infusions. This unmet need is particularly noteworthy for inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) and inflammatory skin conditions (e.g., dermatitis). Bacterial extracellular vesicles offer the safety and convenience of first line therapies, which are typically oral small molecule drugs with favorable safety profiles, and with the potential for improved efficacy like later line therapies. Clinical translation of bacterial extracellular vesicles has been hindered by low production rates from cells and lack of tools to further improve efficacy. These challenges present untenable manufacturing costs and biologic risk when translating results from mice to humans.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of vectors for oral delivery of immunotherapies for treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Most therapeutics for inflammatory bowel diseases lack desirable delivery. Drugs unstable in the gastrointestinal tract require injection, and drugs with poor biodistribution and pharmacokinetics have limited efficacy and potential for systemic toxicity. The technology addresses these limitations in gastrointestinal disease treatment by leveraging bacterial extracellular vesicles - cell-secreted biologic nanoparticles naturally used by the healthy gut microbiome to communicate with human cells. The technology exploits this phenomenon by solving the most immediate bottlenecks facing bacterial extracellular vesicles therapeutics: potency and scalable biomanufacturing. The technology enables mass production of probiotic bacterial extracellular vesicles with high potency. Preclinical data in small animal models has demonstrated the technology function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, more than 25% of the 80 million U.S. workers must lift objects that weigh more than 50 pounds on a regular basis. As a result, more than 120,000 of these workers sustain lower back injuries each year from repetitive lifting resulting in productivity losses, high employee turnover, and lower quality of life. This technology is a back exoskeleton or exosuit, which relieves loads from the back and reduces the risk of injuries or pain. This technology may be used in occupations such as manufacturing, logistics, nursing and emergency medicine, construction, mining, and retail stores.  Each of these occupations has a relatively high rate of back injuries due to the repetitive lifting or lifting of heavy objects required for the job. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a back support exoskeleton that assists users with bending and lifting tasks. The technology is designed to make a lifted object feel between 35-50 pounds lighter to the user's back. The design is completely passive, using no motors or batteries. Instead, it utilizes a lightweight fiberglass leaf spring that stores energy when bending and releases the energy to assist when standing up. The exoskeleton looks and feels like a lightweight backpack with leg straps, weighing only 5.5 pounds, and it can be put on in 15 seconds. The combination of the fiberglass spring and a specifically designed differential mechanism allow users to seamlessly go about their work while the device assists them with lifting tasks, without hindering them during walking and without needing to engage or disengage the exoskeleton. A prototype has been shown to decrease muscle activity by over 30% during lifting, which reduces strain on the back, lowering the risk of injury. In addition, the technology also decreases the energy required during lifting, improving overall user well-being. Compared to other back exoskeletons, this device is simpler yet provides three times more support to the back, which may help to reduce back injuries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the deepest problems in theoretical physics revolve around combining Einstein?s theory of general relativity with quantum theory. The resulting theory is called ?quantum gravity? and is needed to understand the origin of the universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, and what happens inside black holes. The research supported by this award will use the latest techniques and tools to try to answer some of these fundamental problems. An essential part of this award is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the knowledge and techniques that are central to understanding and discovery in gravitational physics. Through a range of forums from public lectures, to informing media reporters, the Principal Investigators will disseminate the directions and results of their research to a broad audience. Society at large will benefit by increasing their understanding of science and the world they live in.<br/><br/>This award involves three related programs of research. PI Horowitz will explore black holes at very low temperatures in more general situations than has been done before. This will include breaking some spatial symmetry (both with and without a cosmological constant) and including quantum corrections to general relativity. It has recently been shown that these black holes can have much larger tidal forces near their horizon than previously thought. PI Horowitz will investigate new examples and look for possible astrophysical applications. PI Marolf will explore evidence for and implications of the idea that gravitational systems have a finite density of states, meaning that in a finite region of space, they can have only a finite number of states with energy less than any chosen value. While this idea would explain the thermodynamic properties of black holes, it is well known to fail in perturbative treatments of quantum gravity. In particular, one can find black hole geometries with arbitrarily large volumes of space behind the horizon, and which can thus hold arbitrary numbers of independent states. A focus of PI Marolf?s work will be the study of toy models in which the density of states in the full theory is much smaller than that of the naive perturbative theory. Horowitz and Marolf will both study possible definitions of quantum gravity associated with Feynman?s reformulation of quantum mechanics as a sum of all possible histories. For gravitational systems, such histories are entire spacetimes and so are associated with both geometry and topology. If one considers positive definite metrics, the sum over topologies has recently been argued to lead to the above-described finite density of states. But relativity teaches us that the metric of a physical spacetime is not positive definite, and the desired so-called Lorentz-signature metrics are not compatible with general such topologies. This tension will be explored from a variety of viewpoints. The methods employed in all three programs of research will be primarily analytic, though these will be supplemented with numerical calculations on desktop computers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will enhance food security while increasing productivity from marginal lands with native crops? reduced input needs- aligning with NSF priorities toward ecological and public health stewardship. Project outcomes will provide more sustainable options for farmers than traditional commodity crops- without sacrificing land profitability. By introducing a protein-rich, low-water-use alternative crop, the project will promote consumers? access to nutritional density. As demand for plant-based protein grows, commercialization of these cultivars could position them toward the lead of a burgeoning plant protein market. This will support one FT position and one researcher to screen hybrids for desired traits to enable Phase II hybrid selection and patent protection. Upon Phase II completion, the project will move toward commercialization. Following this, at least 3 FT and 3 PT employees in R/D, Product Manager, Business Development and other roles will be filled to support projected growth.<br/><br/>This project proposes rapid domestication and commercialization of novel, native-derived lupines to address the need for sustainable, climate-resilient crop protein sources. This initiative focuses on development of heterozygous F1 lupine hybrids, incorporating the pauper allele from the 'Amiga' cultivar of European White lupine (EWL, Lupinus albus) into four drought-tolerant, US-native species (Lupinus arizonicus, Lupinus stiversii, Lupinus succulentus, Lupinus arbustus). This allele confers reduced alkaloid content, enhancing lupines? palatability without sacrificing the drought and disease resistance of native lupines. Phase I of the project will generate these hybrids through genetic marker-accelerated introgression of the pauper allele while overcoming challenges, including potentially reduced fertility from aneuploidy among US-native and EWL parents. The project?s comprehensive approach includes PCR-based genetic analysis to confirm presence of the pauper allele, alkaloid profiling to ensure the trait's expression in various tissues, and evaluation of growth and yield.

The research findings can help understand adaptation across many species facing similar challenges. The project will also support paid research internships for students with limited access to careers in science. The project will host workshops to build international exchange with the Philippines. Finally, this research can inform fisheries by identifying fishing zones and where seafood was caught.<br/><br/>This project will help to understand the architecture and genomic origins of rapid adaptation, in part by testing the hypothesis that local adaptation provides the raw material for rapid evolution through time. Species objectives include to 1) assemble and annotate high-quality genomes to understand genetic architecture in blue sprat (Spratelloides delicatulus); 2) resequence the genomes of ~1000 individuals across at least five sites in historical and modern eras to identify loci targeted by spatially divergent or temporal selection, and 3) measure morphology and growth to test for the functional importance of genomic variation. The project will focus on historical (1907-1909) samples held by the Smithsonian Institution and modern samples collected in collaboration with Silliman University.

Establishing robust communication links at such high frequencies is challenging due to limited power of transmitting signal sources, high path loss of electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation, and susceptibility to signal blockage. These challenges can potentially be mitigated through large aperture antennas, transmissive metasurfaces, and intelligent reflecting surfaces. These large EM apertures extend the range of their near-field regions, and thus stimulated interest in studying near-field wireless communications, especially in the radiated near-field region.

These devices are the essential components in electric vehicles, power transmission lines that transport electricity from generation sites to households and industries, and electronic systems designed for high-temperature and radiation environments such as jet engines, nuclear reactors, and spacecrafts. Among UWBG materials, Gallium Oxide (Ga2O3) stands out as one of the most promising candidates for these applications due to its desirable electrical properties, good stability at high temperatures, radiation tolerance property, and abundance of electronic grade Ga2O3 wafers. Nevertheless, the limited thermal conductivity of Ga2O3 renders high-power devices fabricated from this material susceptible to failure. Growing diamond is another promising UWBG material with the highest thermal conductivity among all materials. As a heat dissipation layer on Ga2O3, it can address the poor thermal conductivity associated with Ga2O3-based devices. Since diamond can be easily doped p-type, integration with n-type Ga2O3 would lead to the fabrication of a p-n junction.  However, the material quality of Ga2O3 drastically degrades in the harsh growth environment of diamond growth. This proposed work aims to address the ever-present challenges of growing delamination-free uniform and high-quality diamond film with a small thermal boundary resistance directly on UWBG oxides by incorporating an ultrathin quenched(Q)-carbon interlayer. Prototype p-diamond/n-Ga2O3 devices will be fabricated to assess their compatibility and determine the device characteristics. The outcomes of this project will contribute to the design of advanced and more compatible Ga2O3-based power devices. An important aspect of this study involves training both undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, high school students will receive exposure to this research through summer workshop programs hosted at Texas State University. The project activities and outcomes will also be showcased through lab tours, demonstrations, visits to local schools, and on-site presentations, aiming to enhance scientific awareness among the public. <br/><br/>Ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) Gallium Oxide (Ga2O3) based electronic device systems have the potential to handle extraordinarily large power across a wide range of frequency bands for next-generation high-temperature, high-power, and high-frequency applications. Two major bottlenecks to harnessing the true potential of this immensely promising UWBG material are the absence of p-type Ga2O3, which limits the fabrication of homojunction devices, and its low thermal conductivity, which directly impacts the device performance and reliability. In this regard, p-diamond/n-?-Ga2O3 integration offers potential solutions owing to diamond's superior thermal conductivity and p-type dopability. The diamond layer in the device can effectively dissipate heat during operation. However, lattice and thermal mismatch between Ga2O3 and diamond and issues related to harsh growth conditions for diamond are major challenges to implementing this concept. This proposal aims to address the persistent issues of integrating p-type diamond films with UWBG n-type Ga2O3 layer by implementing a novel approach, i.e., incorporating an ultra-thin quenched carbon (Q-carbon) interlayer achieved by pulsed laser annealing between the Ga2O3 and diamond interface. The Q-carbon layer on Ga2O3 will provide the nucleation base for high-quality uniform coverage diamond growth, protect the Ga2O3 layer from damage during the growth process, and reduce the thermal misfit between Ga2O3 and diamond. The project also aims to investigate the structural and electrical properties of each layer of the device and the heterointerface. Prototype Ga2O3-diamond p-n and p-i-n devices will be fabricated to measure the key performance parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process has been recognized only in the last two decades and is not yet fully understood, especially when compared to more conventional strengthening methods, such as precipitate strengthening, which involves growing hard particles in alloys to make them stronger. In this work, Mg alloys are selected as the model system. The goal of this research is to understand when and why the nanoscale clustering of solute atoms can work better than other strengthening mechanisms. It is anticipated that certain types of solute clusters, based on their chemical compositions and spatial arrangements, can be particularly potent at blocking the movement of dislocations, which are line defects in alloys that accommodate plastic deformation. Via a combination of advanced experimental characterization and computer simulation techniques, the research will be carried out in the following steps: first, to understand the structure and spatial dispersion of solute clusters; next, to elucidate how these solute clusters interact with dislocations at the nanometer scale; and finally, to quantify how much stronger these solute clusters can make the metal macroscopically. This research could lead to a new theory to quantitatively predict metal strength based on the presence of these solute clusters. The significance of this research lies in its potential to advance our knowledge of alloy strengthening, which could result in the development of stronger and lighter metallic materials for everything from cars to planes. It also includes educational outreach, such as engaging students of various age groups and the public with materials science and creating new learning opportunities in the field.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Recognizing solute cluster strengthening as a novel strengthening mechanism, the goal of the project is to address the knowledge gap in quantitatively modeling and understanding the interactions between solute clusters and dislocations at the atomistic level and the subsequent macroscopic yield strength enhancement. Using Mg as the model system, the project's objective is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underpinning solute cluster strengthening through a multiscale approach and to develop a quantitative predictive model of the associated strengthening stress. One key scientific question to be tackled is why solute clustering is more effective than traditional precipitate strengthening under certain conditions. The hypothesis is that specific solute cluster configurations and chemistries offer superior strengthening effects compared to both a superposition of individual solute atoms in a randomized solid solution and precipitates containing an equivalent number of solute atoms. To validate this hypothesis, the following research activities are proposed: atomic-scale prediction and identification of solute cluster chemistry and structure; nanometer-scale modeling and characterization of dislocation-cluster interactions; and continuum-scale prediction and measurement of the critical resolved shear stress enhancement due to solute clusters across different slip systems. By integrating computational simulations with experimental validation, the proposed research seeks to develop a transformative multiscale model that integrates the intricate atomic-level details of cluster-dislocation interactions for quantitative modeling of dislocation slip mechanics and prediction of flow stress. Moreover, this research will offer insights into the specific scenarios wherein solute cluster strengthening outperforms conventional precipitate hardening. The anticipated outcome is a new physical model that complements existing alloy strengthening theories, advancing the field of materials science and the development of alloys with enhanced mechanical performance. The educational component of the project will promote engagement with K-12 and underrepresented student groups, facilitating their participation in science and engineering through special events and student exchange programs. Additionally, the development of a new summer school course on multiscale modeling of structural materials will further reinforce the nation's scientific and engineering workforce competitiveness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electrochemical production of net-zero fuels, powered by wind and solar energy is an attractive way to decarbonized liquid fuels. Substantial efforts have been made to develop efficient electrocatalytic materials that aid in transforming feedstock molecules, like CO2 or biomass, to fuels, but engineering of the electrochemical reactors that perform such transformations is not well-developed. The principal investigators and their team at Purdue University explore the underlying reasons why instabilities in electrochemical reactor arise, which reduces their efficiency and can potentially cause safety concerns. This work combines computational and experimental approaches to explicitly study this challenge to electrocatalytic production of net-zero fuels. The results of this work will provide an improved electrochemical engineering design framework to enable efficient production of low-carbon fuels. Additionally, the project provides research opportunities for students and the research outcomes are used to prepare students with in-depth knowledge about electrochemical reactor design, optimization, and the pressing need for decarbonization in modern chemical engineering.<br/> <br/>With funding from an EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award through the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative, the principal investigators aim to bridge crucial knowledge gaps concerning the impact of multiple steady states (MSS) on electrochemical reactor performance for net-zero fuel production by developing a mathematical framework to describe the physical interplay between reaction, mass transport, and thermodynamics. Specifically, they explore the conditions under which MSS manifests using fundamental electroanalytical techniques, focusing specifically on two-electron two-proton reduction reactions relevant to decarbonized fuel production in order to deepen the understanding of the behavior of electrochemical MSS. Additionally, the research is focused on integrating these fundamental discoveries with practical reactor applications through the development of a hybrid modeling framework. This framework, capitalizing on physics-informed machine learning, promises a transformative approach to reactor design optimization.

The exotic properties of this new class of semiconductors make them particularly interesting for fundamental science research and practical applications. The investigators will explore the electronic, magnetic, and thermal properties of these unique materials with thicknesses of a few-atomic layers only. The PIs will also investigate the potential of these materials for use in devices with novel functionality that operate at high speed with low-energy dissipation. This research aligns with the Nation?s need for the development and research of novel semiconductor materials and devices under the recent CHIPS and Science Act. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will facilitate the involvement of students in the proposed research and contribute to undergraduate and graduate STEM education. The project team has developed a detailed Broadening Participation Plan that will impact the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education of minorities underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Transition-metal phospho-trichalcogenides span a wide variety of compounds with different electronic, magnetic, and phonon properties. These materials are one of a few van der Waals layered structures which can have intrinsic antiferromagnetism, even at mono-layer thickness. The band gap of these materials varies from ~1.3 eV to ~3.5 eV based on the type of its transition- metal element. Theory suggests that the application of gate bias and strain can induce phase transitions in these materials, changing their properties. While electrical insulators and conductors with AFM spin order have been studied extensively, little is known experimentally about antiferromagnetic layered semiconductors. This project aims to investigate the electron, phonon, and magnon properties of these unique materials at single- and few-layer structures, and to assess the possibilities of controlling their properties for enabling novel device functionalities. To achieve these goals, various types of these compounds will be synthesized and characterized using cryogenic micro ? Brillouin ? Raman spectroscopy, and electrical and thermal transport measurements. The results of this interdisciplinary research will add to the core knowledge in several areas of material science and electrical engineering, thereby delivering a transformative impact for applications of antiferromagnetic layered semiconductors. The intellectual merit of this project include knowledge of phonon and magnon band structures, and their modification with the thickness, strain, and electric bias; experimental data for controlling the Nel temperature in two- dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductor films; mechanisms and methods for tuning the phase transitions in AFM semiconductors under the action of gate and strain; innovative approaches for enabling novel device functionalities via control of the electron, phonon, and magnon states in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These biohybrid systems could have many uses, such as large-scale chemical production and controlling bacterial activities without changing their genetics. By adding light-sensitive semiconductor particles to the periplasm, chemical production can be increased by affecting key processes in bacteria. This approach uses the natural structures of bacteria and different combinations of semiconductor particles to advance microbial engineering. The principal investigator is developing methods to grow semiconductor particles within the periplasm in cells to study how they interact with bacteria. The goal is to design experiments that mimic photosynthesis to increase chemical production, for example in the production of malate, a valuable chemical precursor. This project will also provide valuable learning opportunities for students from all backgrounds. By offering interdisciplinary research experiences and international exchange programs, the project will increase participation in science and engineering. Educational initiatives will include summer research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students, as well as international symposia and partnerships with local art centers. The results will be shared widely through publications, seminars, conferences, and online platforms. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The periplasmic space in bacteria offers a unique environment for creating semiconductor-based biointerfaces, which can be used for large-scale biosynthesis and modulation of bacterial processes without genetic modifications. Incorporating light-harvesting semiconductor nanoclusters into the periplasm can significantly enhance the efficiency of chemical production in biohybrid systems by modulating central metabolic processes. This approach leverages existing cellular structures and diverse nanocluster-cell combinations to innovate microbial engineering. The principal investigator aims to establish a robust protocol for biomineralizing semiconductor nanoclusters and their alloys within the periplasm. The study will probe the biomineralization mechanisms and the properties of the resulting biointerfaces using transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and fluxome analyses to identify the molecular pathways and potential stress conditions involved. The optical properties of the semiconductor/bacteria composites will be examined with fluorescence microscopy and micro-spectrofluorometry, while transient absorption and time-resolved infrared spectroscopy will probe energy and charge transfer mechanisms at the biointerfaces. The research ultimately aims to conduct artificial photosynthesis experiments using a custom-built light emitting diode array for illumination and differential pulse voltammetry to measure chemical production, with a focus on improving malate bioproduction yield through a scalable bioreactor process. This research will also provide valuable interdisciplinary learning opportunities and foster broad participation in science and engineering through summer research experiences, international exchanges, and educational programs for high school and undergraduate students.

Undergraduate research has been recommended as an integral high-impact practice, but engagement in research generally requires a commitment of time beyond a student's typical required coursework. This additional time commitment is more likely to be a barrier for many students, including Hispanic students. Integrating research experiences directly into required courses has been proposed as one model to eliminate this barrier to research experiences, but community college faculty need support and time to develop meaningful research experiences for their students. This project aims to provide the necessary faculty professional development and investigate its impact on their teaching practices. Further, this project will investigate the impact of these research experiences on students; it is expected that student participation in course- based undergraduate research experiences will result in content-specific skills development, a deeper sense of belonging to their intended major, and self-efficacy that drives motivation and retention. Finally, this project will provide opportunities for students to showcase their research more broadly and support students seeking external research internships.<br/><br/>The first goal of this project is to increase Columbia Basin College?s research capacity by providing professional development and support to faculty members, which is expected to increase the college?s research capacity from a baseline of 15 students each year to over 250 students each year. Integrating research experiences into existing required courses will ensure equitable access for all students. The second goal of this project is to assess the impact of professional development and implementation of course-based undergraduate research experiences on all project participants. This will be conducted through faculty pre- and post-surveys, student pre- and post-surveys, analysis of course grades, and longer-term tracking of student impacts using institutional data and follow-up surveys. Assessment of participating faculty members will provide data to refine this professional development model, and assessment of students will generate data that can also refine this professional development model in addition to highlighting the impact of research experiences on course completion, retention, scientific identity, belonging, and self-efficacy. The final goal of this project is to expand, highlight, and celebrate student research. This will be accomplished by offering internship seminars with community partners, workshops to support external internship applications, and through the development of an institution- wide undergraduate research symposium where the most outstanding student work will be selected to be presented at regional conferences. It is expected that the positive outcomes of this project will ultimately 1) increase the number and diversity of graduated, employment-ready individuals that can meet the needs of tomorrow?s workforce and 2) provide a model for professional development and integration of course-based undergraduate research experiences that can be expanded and adopted by other two-year HSIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During high-speed collisions of heavy ions, nuclei break down into these basic particles, forming the QGP. This matter was found to behave like a nearly perfect liquid at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Scientists continue to study the QGP, with RHIC offering a wide range of collision energies and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reaching the highest temperatures and energy densities. With this award, the PI and graduate students will investigate the properties of the QGP.  They will measure observables that arise when jets of particles move through the QGP.   Their aim is to move from a basic description of the QGP to a detailed understanding of its properties. The PI also aims to boost diversity and competitiveness in U.S. STEM fields by inspiring female students, recruiting women and minority undergraduates in physics, and involving them in research.<br/><br/>The PI's research will use hard probes to study the QGP. She will measure jet observables in heavy-ion collisions at LHC using the CMS detector and at RHIC using the STAR detector. To map out the phase diagram of the QGP at different scales, the PI and her team will measure the center of mass energy dependence of jet shapes for inclusive jets and jets coincident with vector bosons. This will help constrain the jet energy, enabling a controlled measurement of how the medium modifies jets and the plasma's response. Additionally, they will directly measure heavy flavor quark jets and D0 meson-tagged jets at lower kinematic regions where mass effects are significant, probing the flavor dependence of parton energy loss. The research will incorporate machine learning techniques to simultaneously analyze jet measurements, enhancing the precision and efficiency of data interpretation. These complementary measurements will determine key features of the QGP, including its thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients, how it responds to jet energy loss, and how it affects jet structures. Furthermore, the PI will promote STEM education for underrepresented minorities through initiatives such as encouraging female middle and high school students to pursue STEM, incorporating high-energy nuclear physics research into introductory physics courses, and mentoring minority students throughout the <br/>research process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is made in response to Dear Colleague Letter 23-109, as part of the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative.  Chemical and refining industries are responsible for roughly half of the U.S. manufacturing sector?s energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the current energy landscape, most of the energy needs of chemical processes are met by combustion of fossil fuels. However, with the proliferation of renewable energy resources and the sustained shift of the U.S. energy landscape towards decarbonized electricity, chemical and refining industries are also transitioning towards decarbonization via electrification. A critical piece of this transition involves the integration of electrified chemical processes with the renewable driven, decarbonized electric grid. However, a smooth integration demands active, real-time data sharing between the chemical and power system stakeholders raising significant privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of chemical process data. With this project, the principal investigators at Oklahoma State University study fundamental issues associated with privacy and data sharing that can serve as a major roadblock for the smooth integration of electrified chemical process with power system infrastructure to achieve industrial decarbonization. The research directly addresses pressing needs of industrial decarbonization crucial for achieving the nation?s net-zero emissions goals by 2050. It enhances the economic competitiveness and national security of the U.S. by proposing novel ways to facilitate sustainable methods to support advanced manufacturing processes. Additionally, the project is geared towards developing the next-generation workforce who are capable of designing and operating new, decarbonized chemical plants and energy systems in a net-zero economy.<br/><br/>With funding from an EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award through the NSF-wide Clean Energy Technology initiative and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), the principal investigators develop new research directions aimed at breaking down barriers to information and data sharing impeding decarbonization efforts for chemical process heating via electrification. The team analyzes the convergence of decentralized optimization algorithms for joint maintenance and operations of decarbonized chemical manufacturing processes and power systems, thereby closing critical gaps stemming from the need to move plant-level process data to successfully integrate operations of electrified chemical process units and existing power systems. The research comprises the design of novel decomposition techniques to decouple maintenance and operations components of the joint problem to be able to solve it without the need to move process or sensor data, and the development of a decentralized, federated machine learning framework to accurately capture complex spatiotemporal interdependencies pertaining to clean energy contribution from existing electric infrastructure while eliminating the need to move stakeholder data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include crashes in stock markets, flurries of activity on social media following news events,  and changes in animal migratory patterns, among countless others.  Reliable detection and statistical analysis of shock events is crucial in applications, as shock inference can provide scientists deeper understanding of large systems of time-dependent variables, helping to mitigate risk and manage uncertainty.  When large systems of time-dependent variables are observed at high sampling frequencies, information at fine timescales can reveal hidden connections and provide insights into the collective uncertainty shared by an entire system.  High-frequency observations of such systems appear in econometrics, climatology, statistical physics, and many other areas of empirical science that can benefit from reliable inference of shock events.  This project will develop new statistical techniques for both the detection and analysis of shocks in large systems of time-dependent variables observed at high temporal sampling frequencies. The project will also involve mentoring students and organizing workshops.  <br/><br/>The investigators will study shock inference problems in a variety of settings in high dimensions.

Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to at least 15 unique full-time first-year or transfer students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, or physics. First-year students will receive four-year scholarships. Transfer students will receive two- or three-year scholarships depending on the time necessary for degree completion. The project aims to increase student retention and graduation rates by emphasizing evidence-based supports during the 1st and 2nd years of collegiate study. Supports include forming a learning community, orientation, faculty mentoring, cohort courses, and building professional identity through undergraduate research, professional development, and engagement with STEM professionals. Millikin's prospective Scholars include a large percentage of female student and students from groups underrepresented in STEM, thus diversifying and strengthening the STEM workforce by increasing the participation of underrepresented individuals and helping to close the gender gap in STEM. Moreover, the project is anticipated to positively impact additional STEM majors and faculty through their engagement with participant supports and professional development opportunities. Through the evaluation of supports, importantly, the project will impact STEM retention and graduation at similarly focused regional primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Specifically, it will facilitate the obtainment of B.S. degrees in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics so students may pursue successful STEM careers and help meet the critical national demand for STEM professionals. Fifteen students will receive an annual scholarship as Big Blue STEM Scholars to cover all unmet need. Importantly, scholarships will be provided to Scholars in good standing until they graduate. Since Millikin's institutional data indicates retention from year 1 to year 2 is a strong predictor of persistence in STEM fields for its diverse student population, this project was designed to emphasize early-stage interventions, primarily during years 1 and 2 for each cohort. The Big Blue STEM Scholars project relies on building a sense of belonging and STEM identity through evidence-based supports targeted at improving student persistence, retention, and graduation.

This activity has been conducted since 2005 under the guidance of the Graduate Student Symposium Planning Committee of the American Chemical Society (ACS), typically with base funding from ACS supplemented by funding from other organizations. A team of students from the University of Buffalo has been selected as the Graduate Student Symposium Planning Committee (GSSPC) to organize this symposium at the ACS Fall 2024 National Meeting in Denver, Colorado. The GSSPC is responsible for all aspects of the symposium, including selecting a topic, inviting speakers, securing funds, and recruiting and mentoring the next GSSPC. The symposium's theme, ""Breaking the Mold: Building Communication to Promote Green and Sustainable Practices,"" revolves around examining and discussing innovative approaches to implementing green and sustainable practices in both academia and industry. The primary objectives of the symposium are: (1) to raise awareness about the relevance and need for green chemistry in academic and industrial settings, (2) to establish a collaborative platform for the exchange of best practices among the attendees, and (3) to promote the notion that green and sustainable practices are achievable without compromising quality, cost, and efficiency. To maximize engagement and knowledge dissemination, the symposium will consist of two events: 1) Lectures by invited speakers (i.e., individuals from academia, scientists who work at government agencies, and active members working in industry), and 2) Green Connect: A networking event held to facilitate engagement among speakers, sponsors, and attendees.

However, some genes and chromosomes can cheat to get more than their fair share of copies in eggs and sperm, a process known as drive. Centromeres, which guide chromosomes through cell division (mitosis and meiosis), can selfishly drive to gain unfair access to the sole egg cell in females. By disrupting fair transmission, such drive can damage the health and fertility of plants and animals. Scientists must study drive in action to understand how and when centromeres cheat, whether linked fertility costs are inevitable, and if resistance is possible. This project studies a driving centromere found in the model plant yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus). It investigates how genes and other DNA sequences work together to cause drive, how some plants resist drive, and whether the same processes cause seed and pollen loss. The research will increase knowledge key for maintaining human and crop health, train diverse scientists in modern genomic methods, and create shared resources. An integrated course immerses college students in real genetics research and a summer camp activity for middle school students supports hands-on learning about plants and genes.<br/><br/>A collaborative scientific team from a large research institution and a small liberal arts college builds on new chromosome-scale genome assemblies in yellow monkeyflowers to explore the mechanisms and consequences of selfish centromere evolution.  Project 1 unpacks the mechanism of drive with genetic and epigenetic characterization of functionally-distinct centromeres and evolutionary genomic analyses of the selfish centromere's novel gene content. Project 2 examines drive through the lens of the losers, using known and predicted variation in resistance to explore the functional mechanisms of drive and its multiple effects on fitness in natural populations. Project 3 asks what forces shape the spread of a driving centromere across complex landscapes and enhances undergraduate education via course-embedded and summer research on drive?s interactions with environmental factors. Together, these projects advance knowledge of the mechanisms, consequences, and dynamics of centromere evolution and reveal how natural selection acts across scales of organization.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Evolutionary Processes (BIO-DEB), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Genetic Mechanisms (BIO-MCB).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The world is losing much of its animal biodiversity, and populations of large-bodied mammals are declining at an alarming rate. Their decline has serious consequences because large mammals have important roles within ecosystems, which are not replicated by smaller-bodied animals. Not surprisingly, a major focus of conservation, biology, and wildlife management efforts today are geared towards developing an understanding of how this biodiversity loss may impact contemporary ecosystems, and what we can do about it. The consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem function can take decades or even centuries to manifest, and so this is where a paleontological, or longer time, perspective can help. The migration of humans into the Americas at the terminal Pleistocene (~13,000 years ago) led to the extinction of >150 species of the largest mammals on the continents, including mammoths, llamas, horses, camels, giant ground sloths, the cave lion, and saber-toothed cats. Examining the role of these extinct mammals, and what happened to the surviving mammals after their extinction, can help us understand what might happen following biodiversity extinction in the future. Thus, this project provides critical baseline information for conservation efforts, as well as insights into the functioning of modern mammal communities.  Broader impacts of this work include educational and public outreach, student training, and contributions to scientific infrastructure from the identification and accessioning of fossil materials. <br/><br/>The research team will quantify the ecological legacy of the terminal Pleistocene megafaunal extinction on mammal communities in the Edward?s Plateau region of Texas. Building on an unparalleled late Quaternary fossil record of extinct and surviving mammals compiled by the researchers, diet (through stable isotope analysis of preserved collagen in bones), morphology (through 2D and 3D imaging), and ecological interactions (through modeling and simulations) will be characterized at eight key time intervals spanning the past 20,000 years. The overall aim is to characterize the consequences of species extinction on communities, on earth systems, and on surviving animals. Further, the research team will quantify if and how communities recovered, and investigate whether these patterns were influenced by changing climates or by the acceleration and expansion of human impacts over the late Holocene.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project's goal is to design new tools to help gig knowledge workers identify shared challenges and collaborate to address them. These tools will allow workers to collect and make sense of job, wage, and employer data as a group in order to identify challenges they face together, and to develop and implement plans for taking action around those challenges. Through this research, the project team will advance understanding on both the challenges gig knowledge workers face and ways to address them, as well as around developing tools to support collective action more generally. The findings and tools will be disseminated widely through computer science courses for high school and college students that encourage socially responsible and nuanced design, as well as through workshops aimed at gig knowledge workers themselves.<br/><br/>The research is organized around human-centered engineering approaches that address three main challenges: collecting data on gig labor, interpreting this data, and enabling collective action based on the insights gained. For data collection, the research team will work closely with gig knowledge workers to design monitoring tools that enable the aggregation of job-related data without adding to their workload or risking violations of platform terms of service. For understanding, the team will create and evaluate tools that analyze the collected data, grouping workers based on similar work activities and challenges. These tools will also incorporate suggestions from large language models to aid in brainstorming solutions for the identified challenges. For collective action, the team will create systems that support workers in implementing the plans devised during the brainstorming sessions, ensuring the plans are carried out in a socially cohesive and accountable manner. In all three sub-projects, the team will adopt a participatory design approach, guided by social science theories of collective action and social identity and leveraging capabilities of generative AI technologies to create user-friendly, intelligent interfaces that are specifically tailored for the needs of gig knowledge workers.

Who joins these gangs and why? This project builds on a survey of 10,000 grade 7 and 8 boys in a setting characterized by hundreds of well-organized drug-selling gangs. The survey is designed to better understand their beliefs about gang versus legal careers. The project follows the subjects over time, tracking who stays in school, who drops out, who is arrested, and who joins a gang. It assesses what beliefs and circumstances drive gang entry, and how one may predict (and ultimately prevent) gang entry before it happens. After identifying the highest risk youth, the project develops and tests two programs to reduce gang entry. One improves children?s familiarity with and the attractiveness of higher education and legal careers and builds their planning and goal-achievement skills. The other provides financial incentives to avoid criminality. The project tests both approaches with randomized trials. Successful program models could be duplicated and implemented in cities around the world.<br/><br/>The project builds on a longitudinal study in a single city charactered by high gang presence that attempted to survey 13- and 14-year-old boys in highest-risk schools. The survey focuses on subjective beliefs about a range of careers, including gangs. It elicits beliefs about financial and non-financial benefits and costs, plus interest in each career. The investigators use these data to estimate structural models of criminal occupational choice, assess which beliefs matter most to the decision, and simulate policies. Using rich administrative data, the project follows respondents long-term in school, arrest, and social security records to determine actual participation in legal and criminal careers. The investigators implement and evaluate several information and field experiments to test which misperceptions drive gang entry and if they can be corrected. Altogether, this is the first longitudinal panel study and experimental evaluations of armed group entry outside a high-income country. Compared to existing longitudinal studies of delinquency, the study has several advantages. The survey begins following youth before the age of recruitment and collects and follows their social network. It links all children to lifetime schooling, crime, and social security data. It is also the first panel to elicit beliefs about the financial and nonfinancial returns to criminal and legal careers (and hence estimate which beliefs matter).

Critical elements, including rare earth metals, are vital for electronics, renewable energy, and advanced materials. However, the stable supply of these elements remains a challenge due to the limitations of the current extraction and separation methods that are high-cost, polluting, and/or geographically constrained. Nature has evolved sophisticated metal-binding peptides (MBPs) that selectively recognize and bind certain ions and molecules, which show great promise as a new modality for critical element separation. In practice, these MBPs need to be immobilized in a porous scaffold to facilitate the adsorption of targeted elements and promote the recycling of MBPs. The goal of this project is to study and develop a new class of immobilization substrates, namely mesoporous protein crystals, for critical element separation. Protein crystals show several appealing properties for MBP immobilization, including appropriate pore size and distribution, structural stability, and low toxicity, but they are limited by a low propensity of crystal nucleation. In this project, computationally designed protein crystals will be used to study the nucleation and growth behaviors of protein crystals. The structure-property relationship of protein crystals will be systemically characterized. The team will further evaluate immobilization strategies to maximize the density of MBPs in crystals while maintaining a sufficient porosity for ion diffusion. The capability of immobilized MBPs in sequestering critical elements will be evaluated and compared to the free MBPs. The success of the project will create a new MBP immobilization platform for efficient and selective critical element separation. The platform can be generalized to immobilize other materials for broader applications. Additionally, the project will provide valuable training and education opportunities to graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students by developing educational modules on advanced biomaterials for energy and sustainability. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project aims to obtain a comprehensive understanding of protein crystals as immobilization substrates for critical element separation. The team will combine protein engineering and rational design to tune the assembly of protein crystals and unravel factors that impact the crystal nucleation and growth. Batch crystallization will be exploited for the scalable synthesis of protein crystals and their physicochemical properties in varied structures and binding affinity will be systemically investigated. The team will explore immobilization strategies that can maximize the gravimetric ratio of guest MBP proteins in the crystalline scaffold while maintaining stable immobilization without gradual loss of MBPs over time. The immobilization platform will be examined by immobilizing Lanmodulin (LanM), a protein derived from nature for selective sequestration of rare earth elements (REEs). The capability of LanM-crystal complexes in binding REEs and their selectivity over other bivalent and trivalent cations will be evaluated. The team will further test the performance of immobilized LanM in practical REE extraction scenarios, such as extraction from simulated low-grade leachate using fixed-bed columns packed with LanM-crystal complexes. The new immobilization platform will address the scalability, cost, and stability issues of protein-based adsorbents that traditionally hinder their deployment. The success of this project will also offer a secure and resilient critical elements supply chain essential to economic prosperity and national defense.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Condensed matter physics concerns itself with systems composed of a large number of interacting constituents. Materials are a common example as they contain many atoms and many electrons. It is common to think of such complex systems not in terms of the individual constituents, but rather in terms of properties that emerge from their collective behavior. The concept of phases of matter is an important example of a collective property. Systems that show the same phase have similar properties. Ferromagnets have the collective property that the constituent atoms or electrons align in such a way that the magnetic axis of each one points in the same direction. Ferromagnets made of different materials are all ferromagnets. However, a ferromagnet is qualitatively different from an antiferromagnetic phase in which the magnetic axis of one atom points in the direction opposite that of its neighbor. So, systems that belong to the same phase have similar qualitative properties, while systems that belong to different phases have different properties. When quantum mechanics mingles with strong interactions among constituents very strange phases can emerge,  such as the topological phases of the fractional quantum Hall effect; the latter occurs when electrons confined to a two-dimension plane by semiconductors are exposed to an intense magnetic field.<br/><br/>Recently proposed fracton phases of matter are another turning point in this development. These phases have the interesting and distinct property of being hypersensitive to the geometry of the underlying material, for example the way atoms are organized on a lattice, as well as the presence of geometric distortions of the lattice. The PI will undertake a careful study and characterization of these phases, which necessitates the development new concepts and new theoretical tools. New tools will help advance understanding of the physical properties of fracton phases as well as suggest routes for experimental detection of fractions in materials. This is fundamental research; however, fractons could play an important role in developing quantum memory, and suggest new ways to think about quantum computing. Finally, it is already becoming clear that some fracton phenomena may have been discovered long ago in superfluids and liquid crystals, without realizing that these are but a page of a much bigger story. The PI will utilize the new techniques developed in the fracton context to gain new insights into the problems of vortices in superconductors, turbulence, and quantum liquid crystals.<br/><br/>The education component of this CAREER project includes training undergraduate and graduate students. Students will explore how to use machine learning methods to gain insight into theoretical problems. The PI will participate in global efforts to increase diversity in physics through mentoring undergraduate students who are members of underrepresented groups leveraging American Physical Society initiatives. The PI will engage in outreach in local high schools by participating in career days and encouraging students to study science. PI will develop a course aimed at undergraduate and graduate students that will focus on applications of condensed matter physics ideas to deep neural networks.<br/> <br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports joint theoretical research and education to advance the theoretical foundations of strongly correlated topological and geometric phases of matter. The project is focused on the physics of systems that support emergent fracton excitations. These excitations possess two remarkable properties: (i) they are topologically non-trivial and (ii) they cannot freely move through space. The constraints on their motion arise dynamically, while the underlying physical system is translation invariant. <br/><br/>More concretely the research concentrated on three major efforts. (i) Fracton excitations can emerge in gapless correlated spin liquids. The PI will explore how the existence of these excitations affects observable properties of these systems. (ii) The constrained mobility of fracton excitations can be formally imposed by introducing additional symmetries. The variety of all possible mobility constraints roughly corresponds to all possible symmetries of this kind. The PI will develop a general theory of such symmetries and their manifestation in low energy properties of the physical systems constrained by these symmetries.

A solid-solid phase transition refers to a change in the arrangement of atoms or molecules within a solid material, resulting in a different crystalline structure. These transitions are prevalent in various materials and can occur due to changes in temperature, pressure, or other external factors. A typical example is the transition between graphite (a flaky, black material used in pencils) and diamond (a hard, colorless gemstone). Solid-state transitions are of significant interest in materials science, as they can lead to a wide variety of technologically important applications such as diamond and steel production, synthesis of ceramic materials, thermal energy harvesting and storage, rewritable optical data storage, and nonvolatile electronic memories. Historically, considerable progress has been made in understanding solid-solid transitions from a thermodynamic perspective, concerning the relative phase stability, regardless of transition paths between the initial and final structures. However, the kinetics that dictate whether or not the transition can occur in practice under given environmental conditions and which path the transition is likely to take remain poorly understood. This project will advance the atomic-level understanding of the kinetics underlying solid-solid transitions without using empirical data and develop an advanced artificial intelligence method for the fast and accurate prediction of kinetic-related physical properties. The data and methods acquired will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community and the general public through open-source distributions and publications.<br/><br/>Education and outreach activities are integrated into this project with the goal of inspiring and developing a diverse, globally competitive next-generation STEM workforce in computational materials science that will benefit the State of Florida as well as the nation. The research team will (i) develop a new course on ?materials modeling and simulation? for seniors and/or graduate students across all science and engineering departments at the University of Central Florida (UCF) ? a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution, (ii) create a summer research fellowship program to provide opportunities for talented undergraduates majoring in science, engineering, and mathematics to conduct computational materials research, and (iii) foster and expand graduate and postdoc research and education collaborations with UCF?s multiple interdisciplinary research centers focused on ?materials? for applications in environmental, energy, and biomedical sectors.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous phenomena that play pivotal roles in a myriad of technologies spanning physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and engineering. Despite more than a century of study, the fundamental understanding of phase transition kinetics remains predominantly qualitative or phenomenological. The atomistic mechanism underlying these transitions and the essential design rules for controlling kinetics are still crucially elusive. This project will advance the atomic-level understanding of kinetics in solid-solid phase transitions, using a combined method of modern first-principles electronic structure theory calculations, quantitative chemical bond analysis, and machine learning. The specific objectives are to (i) identify the physical principles and structural motifs that control kinetic barriers of polymorphic transitions from first principles, and (ii) develop a bottom-up, physics-driven machine learning method for the rapid and accurate prediction of transition barriers. The study will be carried out on a set of select well-known phase-transition materials that are technologically important for energy and electronic applications. The research will accelerate the design and discovery of new functional phase-change materials where kinetics is essential.<br/><br/>Education and outreach activities are integrated into this project with the goal of inspiring and developing a diverse, globally competitive next-generation STEM workforce in computational materials science that will benefit the State of Florida as well as the nation.

Indiana Tech provides career-focused, professional programs of higher education at 19 locations throughout Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky. Over half of Indiana Tech students are low-income and 47% identify as non-white. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 21 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in cybersecurity, information systems, network engineering, software engineering, computer engineering, and computer science. First-year students will receive up to four years of scholarship support. Scholars will benefit from a robust orientation process, participation in a common first-year experience course, monthly interaction with industry professionals, social events, robust faculty and peer mentoring programs, and experiential learning opportunities with a focus on career preparation. Additionally, mental health support will be available, and students will receive a laptop to ensure that they have adequate resources to complete their degree programs in computing-related fields. A robust evaluation plan will measure the impact of project activities on the participants. The broader impacts of the project include contributions to workforce diversity by adding at least 21 low-income computing professionals to the workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The specific aims of the project are to enroll three cohorts of seven low-income, domestic students who demonstrate academic achievement, talent, or promise and unmet need; achieve a first- to second- year retention rate of 85% and a six-year graduation rate of 75% for Developing Industry and Innovation Scholars in the Midwest (DIISM) scholars; prepare and place 100% of the DIISM graduates in the STEM workforce or a graduate program within six months of graduation; and measure the effectiveness of the programmatic elements in order to move toward institutionalization of the most promising supports. The six majors selected for this project are all fast-growing fields with a large number of career opportunities at salaries sufficient for upward social mobility. A focus on computing majors allows us to develop peer support and networking opportunities to increase engagement with the institution and program. The project team identified four critical needs that will be addressed by the project (1) inadequate preparation for college-level work (time-management, study skills, mathematics preparation, etc.); (2) technology issues, such as students trying to complete an entire course from a phone or iPad or having unreliable internet; (3) time commitments outside of their classes, such having to work at least 20 hours per week to afford college and, in some cases, working full time while also attending classes full time; and (4) an increase in mental health issues. The DIISM project will contribute to knowledge by disseminating the results of the evaluation of project activities in peer-reviewed conferences and journals. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, existing CTF platforms have many pedagogical, functional, and inclusiveness limitations. To mitigate current educational shortcomings, this project will design and host a next generation CTF platform. It will have profound broader impacts, including: (1) enhancing the education and training of the next generation of cybersecurity researchers in topics related to IoT software and systems security; (2) preparing educators and practitioners who will have deep theoretical understanding and practical skills in IoT software and systems security; and (3) involving partner institutions in the project that will utilize the project's outcomes to enhance their cybersecurity curricula.<br/><br/>This project will advance the state of knowledge in IoT software and systems security education pedagogy and platforms. The key intellectual merits include the following. (1) Student-centered pedagogy in software and systems security education that will involve students in designing CTF and defensive challenges, while tracking and supporting students' progress by automating the feedback process.

It all happens within their tiny size of one to ten microns, but these tiny cells are visually transparent. To understand their internal structures and processes in detail while they are doing their work, special agents are needed along with a microscope. One such agent is green fluorescent protein, or GFP, which revolutionized the way biological processes at sub-cellular scale are visualized and understood today. In addition to GFP, countless natural or synthetic proteins are expected to have untapped potential for enabling visualization of live cells as well as for other technological applications. However, identifying a protein structure optimal for a particular technological application is not trivial. The goal of this project is to tackle this challenge and discover new protein materials by characterizing the chemical and physical properties of known protein materials with desired properties. This will be done in combination with the screening of other related proteins aided by machine learning. Finally, this project also provides graduate and undergraduate students with interdisciplinary training in biomaterials field and extends the hands-on research experience to local K-12 teachers through outreach programs.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project aims to investigate a new class of luminescent protein materials. Luminescent protein-metal compounds are important materials with demonstrated versatile applications in imaging, sensing, as well as tracking agents for biological and environmental studies. These compounds exhibit luminescence that is stable in wide range of pH, but via mechanisms that are unknown. In this project, multi-protein time-resolved spectroscopic measurements are combined with pan-protein analyses via machine learning using iterative Bayesian optimization for the model training, prediction, and experiments. The combined analyses allow determination of the mechanistic origin of the luminescence and the structure of the luminophore in proteins. The elucidated mechanism and the structural origin of luminescence enable the ability to identify, design, and develop novel biological luminophores. This project provides graduate and undergraduate students with interdisciplinary research opportunities and training as future workforce in biomaterials field and extends the hands-on research experience to local K-12 teachers through outreach programs at the PI?s university.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous research indicates that extraordinarily generous people, such as people who give kidneys to strangers, tend to be socially close to people who also are unusually generous. However, it is unclear whether this relationship arises due to social selection (generous people selecting close relationships with similarly generous others), prosocial contagion (the generosity of one person influencing close others to develop more selfless tendencies themselves), or a combination of both processes. This project seeks to examine the influence of social relationships on generosity, and conversely, the influence of generosity on social relationships.<br/><br/>To address these questions, this dissertation project collects data from first-year college roommates, as first-year college roommates represent a sample of randomized pairs of people who, over the course of the academic year, will go from being strangers or near-strangers to having a social relationship (which may or may not be a close relationship). Using a quasi-experimental approach, survey data is collected from these roommates at the beginning, middle, and end of the academic year. It also investigates whether roommate pairs with similar levels of generosity are more likely to become close friends. All personality and social decision-making data is used to test the veracity of three hypotheses: (1) Less generous roommates living with more generous roommates will increase in generosity over time if they report increasing social closeness and interaction frequency, (2) roommates with limited interaction with their generous roommates are not expected to exhibit changes in their generosity levels, and (3) roommate pairs with more similar levels of generosity at the start of the year will report higher levels of closeness and relationship satisfaction as the year progresses. This research contributes to understanding the interplay between generosity and the formation of social relationships, addressing critical questions regarding whether and why generous decision-making spreads and how generous people find generous others to form relationships with. Such findings contribute to efforts to promote generosity and increased societal welfare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the accuracy and reliability of age estimation methods based on the human skeleton have limitations resulting from biases in the age, ancestry and sex composition of the collections originally used to develop them. This project advances research on an alternative skeletal age-estimation method based on the analysis of chemical changes that occur in human DNA as we age and can be preserved in the skeleton. To date, applications of such epigenetic methods have been primarily limited to blood and cheek DNA sources. This study advances epigenetic methods that use DNA extractions obtained from bone. Workshops to learn the theory and application of this new method are open to students, faculty and other researchers. Engagement and outreach opportunities are offered through Ohio State University?s Anthropology Outreach Program. These opportunities introduce participants to epigenetic methods as applied to studies of human variation, and aging and health in the past.

However, the accuracy and reliability of age estimation methods based on the human skeleton have limitations resulting from biases in the age, ancestry and sex composition of the collections originally used to develop them. This project advances research on an alternative skeletal age-estimation method based on the analysis of chemical changes that occur in human DNA as we age and can be preserved in the skeleton. To date, applications of such epigenetic methods have been primarily limited to blood and cheek DNA sources. This study advances epigenetic methods that use DNA extractions obtained from bone. Workshops to learn the theory and application of this new method are open to students, faculty and other researchers. Engagement and outreach opportunities are offered through Ohio State University?s Anthropology Outreach Program. These opportunities introduce participants to epigenetic methods as applied to studies of human variation, and aging and health in the past. A high-quality short film about the anthropology of aging and the epigenetic clock is made freely accessible to other researchers and the public.  <br/><br/>This study develops a new method for biological age estimation from the human skeleton, using a genome-wide age-associated DNA methylation approach tailored to damaged/degraded DNA. The project aims to: (1) develop and validate a cost-efficient, robust-to-degradation, genome-scale method for methylation typing, (2) develop a high-quality predictive model of age from methylation signals in bone, and (3) characterize the potential impact of lifestyle factors on any discrepancies between chronological and biological (DNA methylation) ages. Parts 1 and 2 of this study are based on an integrative genomic-osteological analysis of 100 individuals with documented age, sex, and postmortem exposure to various taphonomic conditions from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Donated Skeletal Collection. The project integrates epigenomic, osteological, and lifestyle data, broadening the applications of this method. The study analyzes the relationship between biological and chronological age in the context of osteological signs of aging and stress, differentiating the biological and developmental roots of osteological traits used to estimate age in past populations and individuals.

This research investigates the genomic differences that shape developmental evolution by using closely related marine annelid species that exhibit different development modes. The project combines comparative genomics, gene expression, and hybridization assays to uncover the relationship between evolutionary divergence and development. This approach will inform our understanding of how speciation and developmental differentiation begin at the molecular level. The research is integrated with an education program designed to expand retention of undergraduate students in STEM fields as well as enhance access to early research and mentoring experiences. The education goals include establishing new faculty/student and peer-mentoring opportunities to increase participation of students in evolution, genetics, and developmental fields and providing new opportunities for research in coastal habitats. <br/><br/>Finding the genetic basis of developmental change is a critical component of understanding diversification and evolution. This project identifies the regulatory differences that create phenotypic change during development using a unique set of species, including the emerging developmental model Streblospio benedicti. This marine annelid produces two distinct offspring types that differ in egg size, embryogenesis, and larval life-history within a single species. By identifying genes that are expressed differently based on life-history mode, within and across species, gene expression changes will be linked to developmental consequences. This comparative framework will reveal both the general rules of developmental evolution, and the specific genes involved in life-history switches. The research approach allows for separation of genetic differences that are species-specific from ones that are functionally associated with changes in embryology and life-history. Dissecting gene regulatory evolution at such a fine evolutionary scale will lead to a detailed understanding of how development evolves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Attending computing research leaders at institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions will then share what they learn with their computing research faculty in their institutions. We expect to learn the barriers that computing faculty from institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions have in submitting proposals to NSF CISE. We also expect to learn strategies or actions to reduce these barriers. The ultimate goal of this project is an increase in the number of proposal submissions to NSF from institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions in future years.

In the face of stepped-up international investment, U.S. innovation in night vision technology has largely remained unchanged and the U.S. advantage has been shrinking. This award supports research led by the University of Arkansas to help address this gap through discovery and development of a new and novel family of semiconductors, alloys of SiGeSn, that can potentially beat all current IR technology on both cost and performance. The outcome will have a significant impact on the military ability to see better at night and allow storing and sharing of images wirelessly with other warfighters at a different location, ship, or aircraft. Providing such tactical advantages of night operations to the soldier, aircraft, missiles, drones, robotics of any type, is a key factor in determining the outcome in conflict and perhaps even preventing conflict. The issue, however, is that efforts to realize this potential, have been significantly challenged by the difficulty of fabricating (Si)GeSn with sufficiently high Sn concentrations and crystal quality that are needed for creating a direct bandgap semiconductor with high performance. Currently no one has been able to demonstrate SiGeSn with high Sn content and high-quality material. In partnership with Ukrainian and Latvian scientists, the goal of this research is to demonstrate two new and novel ?Synthesis Methods? for the fabrication of (Si)GeSn thin film semiconductor alloys that manipulate the position of Sn atoms within the thin film to achieve (Si)GeSn with low misfit dislocations and high Sn content for the first time.<br/>Achieving this goal will have an impact beyond national defense since the country that leads in advanced semiconductor IR imaging technology will also lead in the race to market nearly all new game-changing military and civilian IR imaging technologies, from ground to space warfare to cell phones to medical imaging. It also enhances US competitiveness in new and exciting industries from self-driving vehicles to robotics to surveillance to medical imaging. From this perspective, the SiGeSn semiconductors semiconductor is the ideal new material to advance night vision imaging due to greater capability to engineer the bandgap, longer carrier lifetime, larger absorption coefficient, and lower dark current, all adding up to higher sensitivity. An additional advantage is that SiGeSn is compatible with current Si technology resulting in lower production cost compared to current IR imaging systems. These factors emphasize that the advantage of SiGeSn is that it can potentially beat all current technology on performance and cost, - an advantage for each soldier on the battlefield and each American in everyday life. <br/><br/>PART 2 - Goals and scope, methods and approaches and potential contribution. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to overcome current roadblocks to developing high quality, thin film, stable (Si)GeSn alloys on Si for lighter, faster, higher signal-to-noise, and more energy efficient 2-5 m infrared devices as the next generation of infrared technology. While (Si)GeSn is an exciting new semiconductor possibility, efforts to realize its potential through traditional growth methods by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are challenged by the difficulty of fabricating (Si)GeSn with both the needed Sn concentration and high crystal quality. The issue is that a Sn content greater than 6% Sn is necessary for an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition, which is critical for high optical emission, and a Sn content of ~ 20% Sn is needed to span the near and mid infrared (IR) spectral range. However, at Sn concentrations greater than ~ 10% Sn, due to a significant lattice mismatch between SiGeSn and Si and the low miscibility of Sn in Si (1%), the material develops a high density of misfit and threading dislocations defects, followed by Sn segregation, resulting in high optical losses limiting optical applications. Currently, no one can deliver high Sn content and high material quality, limiting application.<br/>In contrast to these more traditional growth approaches, this project integrates the unique expertise and capability of US, Ukrainian, and Latvian scientists to explore a totally new route to extend the Sn content while maintaining high-quality. The proposed methods rely on the epitaxial growth of fully strained high-quality (Si)GeSn with Sn content of about 10% Sn. This is followed by applying two novel methods to redistribute Sn within the thin film to increase the Sn content from 10% to ~20% locally without misfit and threading dislocations and Sn segregation. <br/>The research partnership to fabricate high-Sn high-quality (Si)GeSn directly on Si substrates makes ?monolithic integration? and large-scale manufacturing possible, and at lower cost. The impact reaches well beyond the obvious military applications, impacting high-speed photonics, medical care, surveillance, search/rescue, self-driving vehicles, meteorology, and climatology, each today experiencing an increasing reliance on IR detector technology. Beyond technology, the project will impact developing an engaged semiconductor workforce and strengthen the research, education, and innovation ecosystem. Education will focus on training students who will be experts in semiconductors, the design of novel devices, fabrication principles, and the equipment used to manufacture those devices. Moreover, SiGeSn is a cutting-edge enabling technology that can both give birth to new industries and dramatically transform existing ones, creating opportunities for economic growth and job creation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because chromosome folding occurs over a wide range of length and times scales, a sophisticated combination of experimental and computational approaches is required to unravel genome organization. In this collaborative project, a team from NYU (Tamar Schlick), Harvard (Anna Lappala and Jeannie Lee), and New Mexico Consortium (Karissa Sanbonmatsu) will combine expertise in molecular biology, genomics, computational biology, biophysics and biomolecular modeling in an integrated experimental and computational effort to address key mechanistic questions about X-chromosome structure and function. Inactivation influences X chromosome expression in females and has profound health implications. A better understanding of X-chromosome folding and gene expression will lead to new avenues for treating other diseases related to X-chromosome status. The research program will offer interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary training to young scientists in STEM fields, through hands on mentoring and participation in summer camps, promoting national needs in education and innovation in Science and Engineering. Public outreach will be further enhanced by communicating these scientific and societal advances in the form of a public museum exhibit.<br/><br/>Advances in epigenomic methods have opened new avenues in chromosome folding studies. Yet translating such experimental information into three-dimensional gene structures is complex. The team will focus on X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a balancing of X-linked gene expression between females and males, and will dissect this process at multiple scales ? from nucleosomes to chromosomes. The team will integrate high-resolution genomics data with advanced spatial modeling to unravel XCI dynamics to interpret related gene function and activity. Namely, Lappala?s gene modeling techniques, Lee?s structure / function studies of the X-chromosome, Sanbonmatsu's chromosome dynamics simulations on the macroscale, and Schlick?s gene and chromatin modeling and simulations at the mesoscale will shed light on genome organization and function. Included are delineation of protein-mediated effects by cohesin and CTCF complexes on XCI and development of models of XCI at various spatial and temporal resolutions. The research will deepen our understanding of XCI and related mechanisms of chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation, offering new modeling and simulation tools for genes and chromosomes and advancing the fields of genomics and epigenetics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing literature on the effects of transitional justice is inconclusive; such work is divided between micro-level, single-country studies and macro-level, cross-country studies as well as between studies of post-authoritarian and post-conflict contexts. By collecting comparable survey measures across three countries that vary along several theoretically relevant dimensions and by building a cross-national dataset, this project will bridge these gaps. Further, the researchers will develop and test a novel theory about how public attitudes mediate the relationship between transitional justice institutions and long-run outcomes. Given the widespread use of transitional justice in post-conflict and post-authoritarian countries as well as democracies around the world, there is an urgent need for the field of transitional justice studies to develop a stronger base of evidence for policymaking. This project will shed light on which forms of transitional justice effectively promote peace, democracy, justice, and reconciliation as well as provide insights into how countries? unique histories may shape the impact of transitional justice there.<br/><br/>This project will investigate three questions. First, which kinds of transitional justice do people see as more legitimate? Second, how do people?s perceptions of the legitimacy of transitional justice institutions affect their broader political attitudes concerning the government, principles of democracy and autocracy, and out-groups? Third, do transitional justice institutions perceived as more legitimate contribute to peace and democracy following conflict? To address these questions, the research team will draw on their extensive thematic, regional, and methodological expertise to employ a mixed-methods research design which combines survey experiments in Colombia, Iraq, and Ukraine; qualitative evidence collected from focus groups and elite interviews in the same countries; and original cross-national data. This approach will leverage the strengths of  diverse methodologies by combining (A) micro-level survey and qualitative data that will enable the investigators to assess the effects of varying transitional justice processes on individual attitudes with (B) macro-level cross-national data that will provide insight into the effects of institutions and historical context on national-level outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They produce cellular proteins. Like a computer that can run different programs, a ribosome can make different proteins encoded in the genetic message. The normal ribosome is generally not well-equipped for making specific designer proteins. The objective of this project is to investigate one approach to creating more effective designer protein production. This will involve the construction of a ribosome that is hard-wired for making one specific protein. This will be achieved by incorporating the genetic message into the ribosome itself. The design of the resulting ribosome could then be optimized to efficiently produce the desired protein. Undergraduates and high school students will participate in summer-long research projects supporting this award. <br/><br/>In the cell, ribosomes associate with different mRNAs to synthesize different proteins required for cell growth and proliferation. Expression of designer proteins that do not contribute essential functions for cell metabolism acts to divert ribosomes away from producing those essential proteins. Diverting ribosomes in that way can reduce the fitness of the cell to grow and multiply. The strategy being tested is functional isolation of such ribosomes from ?normal? cellular translation.

The resulting ribosome-mRNA hybrid (iRibo-T) is expected to translate only one specific mRNA and, therefore, is suitable for altering its catalytic capacity and other properties. The new design will be employed for optimizing expression of medically and industrially relevant poly-lysine containing proteins whose translation are problematic for the unaltered bacterial ribosomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing literature on the effects of transitional justice is inconclusive; such work is divided between micro-level, single-country studies and macro-level, cross-country studies as well as between studies of post-authoritarian and post-conflict contexts. By collecting comparable survey measures across three countries that vary along several theoretically relevant dimensions and by building a cross-national dataset, this project will bridge these gaps. Further, the researchers will develop and test a novel theory about how public attitudes mediate the relationship between transitional justice institutions and long-run outcomes. Given the widespread use of transitional justice in post-conflict and post-authoritarian countries as well as democracies around the world, there is an urgent need for the field of transitional justice studies to develop a stronger base of evidence for policymaking. This project will shed light on which forms of transitional justice effectively promote peace, democracy, justice, and reconciliation as well as provide insights into how countries? unique histories may shape the impact of transitional justice there.<br/><br/>This project will investigate three questions. First, which kinds of transitional justice do people see as more legitimate? Second, how do people?s perceptions of the legitimacy of transitional justice institutions affect their broader political attitudes concerning the government, principles of democracy and autocracy, and out-groups? Third, do transitional justice institutions perceived as more legitimate contribute to peace and democracy following conflict? To address these questions, the research team will draw on their extensive thematic, regional, and methodological expertise to employ a mixed-methods research design which combines survey experiments in Colombia, Iraq, and Ukraine; qualitative evidence collected from focus groups and elite interviews in the same countries; and original cross-national data. This approach will leverage the strengths of  diverse methodologies by combining (A) micro-level survey and qualitative data that will enable the investigators to assess the effects of varying transitional justice processes on individual attitudes with (B) macro-level cross-national data that will provide insight into the effects of institutions and historical context on national-level outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a health advisory limit for perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulphonate, perfluorobutanoic acid, and Genx chemicals levels in drinking water that should not exceed single digit parts per trillion (ppt) concentrations. However, current water treatment utilities lack PFAS separation technologies. To meet this requirement, there is a need for effective separation solutions to remove these chemicals from water. This technology presents is a class of aerogel adsorbent media for removal of PFAS for applications in water, wastewater, and industrial effluent water treatment. The goal is to reduce PFAS-contaminated drinking water for the 66% of the U.S. population that is exposed to these chemicals.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of gel and aerogel adsorbent media to promote rapid adsorption of EPA-listed perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) molecules from water.  The adsorbent media have an open-pore architecture with a high specific surface area that adsorbs PFAS with an efficiency approaching 99%. The preliminary research has shown that the media may be tuned to reduce a wide range of PFAS molecules to concentrations below the EPA-mandated limits, outperforming conventional sorbent media. The technology is appropriate for wastewater treatment or residential filters. The polymer gels and aerogels appropriate for this project include, but are not limited to, syndiotactic polystyrene, polyimide, polyurea, polyurethane, and chitosan. Three properties are under evaluation including specific surface area, tunable affinity for different types of PFAS molecules, and the number of small pores that enable confinement of the adsorbed PFAS molecules within the polymer gel. The affinity will be created from the chemical makeup of the gel or from molecular cavities that form.  the gel will be fabricated in different shapes and sizes for easy installation into commercial filtration setups. The technology has the potential to reduce PFAS levels down to EPA limits with rapid kinetics and high selectivity towards short and long chain PFAS molecules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because chromosome folding occurs over a wide range of length and times scales, a sophisticated combination of experimental and computational approaches is required to unravel genome organization. In this collaborative project, a team from NYU (Tamar Schlick), Harvard (Anna Lappala and Jeannie Lee), and New Mexico Consortium (Karissa Sanbonmatsu) will combine expertise in molecular biology, genomics, computational biology, biophysics and biomolecular modeling in an integrated experimental and computational effort to address key mechanistic questions about X-chromosome structure and function. Inactivation influences X chromosome expression in females and has profound health implications. A better understanding of X-chromosome folding and gene expression will lead to new avenues for treating other diseases related to X-chromosome status. The research program will offer interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary training to young scientists in STEM fields, through hands on mentoring and participation in summer camps, promoting national needs in education and innovation in Science and Engineering. Public outreach will be further enhanced by communicating these scientific and societal advances in the form of a public museum exhibit.<br/><br/>Advances in epigenomic methods have opened new avenues in chromosome folding studies. Yet translating such experimental information into three-dimensional gene structures is complex. The team will focus on X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a balancing of X-linked gene expression between females and males, and will dissect this process at multiple scales ? from nucleosomes to chromosomes. The team will integrate high-resolution genomics data with advanced spatial modeling to unravel XCI dynamics to interpret related gene function and activity. Namely, Lappala?s gene modeling techniques, Lee?s structure / function studies of the X-chromosome, Sanbonmatsu's chromosome dynamics simulations on the macroscale, and Schlick?s gene and chromatin modeling and simulations at the mesoscale will shed light on genome organization and function. Included are delineation of protein-mediated effects by cohesin and CTCF complexes on XCI and development of models of XCI at various spatial and temporal resolutions. The research will deepen our understanding of XCI and related mechanisms of chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation, offering new modeling and simulation tools for genes and chromosomes and advancing the fields of genomics and epigenetics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

EEP is one of the main processes contributing to the loss of energetic electrons and has important implications in the interconnected atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system (e.g., changes in atmospheric chemistry, ionization, and conductance) and in space weather (e.g., satellite radiation monitoring, satellite drag, etc.).  These energetic electrons are primarily scattered by plasma waves; however, due to limited data coverage, our comprehensive understanding of EEP is limited.  In this project, by developing a machine learning (ML) model, the team will characterize and parameterize the EEP phenomenon's properties and dynamics. Modeling the spatial and temporal evolution of regions where EEP occurs will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the radiation belt dynamics and temporal dependence of the energy input to the atmospheric system. The project is highly interdisciplinary, as our understanding of EEP directly impacts several fields, from the atmosphere and ionosphere system to the magnetosphere, and even potentially provides helpful information for space weather monitoring of electron radiation in the near-Earth environment. The project has the potential to support collaborative efforts across all these communities. The ML model and its outputs will be released to the public, enabling follow-up research projects.<br/><br/>The lack of global observations of EEP is a major limiting factor in advancing our knowledge on EEP. The team suggest to parameterize EEP by developing global EEP maps through the use of machine learning (ML) techniques. These maps will be based on measurements from the long-lived NOAA's POES/MetOp satellites and will be produced given a time history of geomagnetic activity. The project will address the following science questions: How does the global electron precipitation evolve in time and space with geomagnetic activity? Which plasma waves correspond to the observed enhanced electron precipitation? How does the improved spatial coverage impact the estimates/constraints on the spatial size, duration, and flux intensity of the electron precipitation regions? Analyzing the spatial and temporal evolution of regions where EEP occurs will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the radiation belt dynamics and temporal dependence of the energy input to the atmosphere. Additionally, the team will explore whether there is a clear cause-effect correlation between the location and energy of EEP and two main plasma waves. This provides a more definite understanding of the causal relationship between the wave modes and EEP, possibly demonstrating that EEP maps can serve as a proxy for wave activity.  Finally, by estimating the size and flux of EEP regions, the team will quantify the electron loss of the outer radiation belt and the EEP input that contributes to variations in atmospheric chemistry and ionization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins are the key drivers of cellular processes and are critical for specific function and are implicated in specific diseases. We call these materials Protein-like Polymers (PLPs). PLPs are proteomimetic and enable rapid and scalable emulation of protein behaviors. PLPs are exceptional at entering cells where they can be used to study cellular processes. The focus of this work is to elucidate how this occurs and the mechanism by which PLPs interact with biological membranes and compartments and in turn how they enter cells. These features of PLPs lend them to serving as reagents for the detection of proteins of interest, as probes and as intracellular binders of proteins. Critically, these are features not easily accessible to small molecules or antibodies, both of which make up the vast majority of compounds currently used in this area. This means that PLPs have the potential to be developed as unique modulators of cellular function. With a platform technology in hand for stabilizing peptides, increasing their binding and penetrating cells, we propose a fundamental set of studies to elucidate these properties and how they relate to PLP structure both in solution and at cell membranes. We will study the effect of chemical structure on their performance and determine critical parameters that govern their behavior in biological systems.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The proposed studies develop and investigate Protein-Like Polymers (PLPs). PLPs are large, flexible proteomimetic macromolecules that resemble proteins in form and function. The size and multivalency provide a basis for the development of drugs that can engage the ?undruggable? large, flat, featureless interfaces where small molecules have traditionally struggled and that antibodies cannot access (i.e. intracellular targets). We propose that the PLPs access cells and engage membranes in analogy to the permeability enabled by the kind of flexibility and chameleonic behavior exhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). Indeed, this kind of environment-adaptive behavior wherein molecules can be dissolved in aqueous solution, and also reside within lipophilic environments, is increasingly desirable. The PLP is inherently metaphilic (transiently amphiphilic) with a core polymer scaffold of tunable rigidity and lipophilicity and hydrophilic peptide side chains as brushes, capable of introducing positive charge and ultimately protein recognition function.

It is extremely challenging to achieve this through conventional electronic channelization approaches due to their performance limitations, or through traditional photonics benchtop techniques due to their cost and size limitations. Silicon photonics (SiP), on the other hand, has the potential to provide mm-wave channelizers with simultaneous ultra-wide bandwidth, dynamic tuning, ultra-fast channelization, interferer resilience, and small footprint. This project will utilize photonics components along with integrated electronics to enable mm-wave silicon photonics and fulfill the above challenging requirements. In addition to the technical impacts, the proposed project also promotes outreach activities to increase participation of students in science and engineering, including annual one-week summer camps for teachers and PK-12 students. The research and educational results of this project will be disseminated to academic, industrial, and government sectors.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a novel chip-scale SiP mm-wave channelizer with ultra-wide band, dynamic tuning, ultra-fast channelization, and interferer-tolerance capabilities implemented using hybrid SiP and nanometer CMOS chips. Using electronic integrated circuits (ICs) allows for channelizer optical frequency comb (OFC) generation with flat spectral lines, in-band interference rejection, and compensation of severe SiP fabrication process variations. The proposed research objectives are: (1) definition of a SiP mm-wave channelizer architecture based on integrated dual-OFC heterodyning/demultiplexing and image rejection along with performance analysis, (2) development of a novel SiP unit and its components including both received signal and local oscillator OFCs, filters, demultiplexers and hybrid couplers, and algorithms/hardware for their automatic turning, (3) implementation of a novel nanometer CMOS unit including the dual-OFC generator, image rejection electronic circuitry, and automatic tuning hardware, and (4) hybrid integration and performance tests of the SiP and CMOS chips. The emergence of SiP technology enables the realization of SiP channelizers to achieve mm-wave signal channelization with small size and low power consumption. However, this realization has two main challenges: (a) Generating OFCs with a large number of spectral lines and flat spectrum using SiP process is demanding. (b) The initial responses of photonic components are distorted due to the fabrication process variation of SiP technology, and therefore an automatic calibration methodology of these initial responses is required. In this project, nano-scale electronics will be integrated with SiP components to perform opto-electronic frequency comb generation with flat spectral lines, in-band interferer rejection, and the automatic calibration of SiP components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include cellulose found in cotton and wood, amylose in the starch found in bread and rice, and chitins found in the exoskeleton of insects. Today, polysaccharides are preferred renewable materials for many applications, such as packaging, healthcare, personal care, and agriculture. However, polysaccharides found in nature can vary greatly in structure and purity, making them difficult to study and use effectively. The structures and properties of synthetic polysaccharides could be precisely controlled, but existing methods for synthesizing polysaccharides are often impractical for large-scale production. The goal of this research project is to find a new way to design and make a variety of polysaccharides with precisely controlled structures from natural sugars. In addition, non-sugar units will be blended with sugar units in these polymers to match and even surpass the properties of natural polysaccharides. This project will also establish a meeting called Massachusetts-Missouri Macro-Materials Meeting (5M). This meeting will promote the communication and collaboration of polymer scientists in the states of Massachusetts and Missouri and the nearby regions, and encourage college students from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in STEM.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop novel polysaccharide-based soft materials. Toward this goal, novel approaches to precision polysaccharides through living cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of anhydrosugars will be devised. Precision polysaccharides are synthetic polysaccharides consisting of native glycosidic linkage and well-controlled molecular weight, dispersity, side-chain groups, and chain-end groups. Living CROP of anhydrosugars will be used to generate precision polysaccharide homopolymers with various monosaccharide repeating units, side-chain groups, and molecular weights to establish a comprehensive structure-property understanding. Detailed reactivity studies in the copolymerization of the anhydrosugar monomers and non-carbohydrate monomers will lead to a novel class of statistical copolymers. The knowledge gained through these fundamental studies will enable the additive manufacturing of these materials, amplifying their molecular-scale structural features to the macroscopic level. The nano-to-macroscale understanding of the structure-property relationship will further advance the development of even more sophisticated block copolysaccharide elastomers and mixed graft copolymers with polysaccharide branches. As part of this project, a new Massachusetts-Missouri Macro-Materials Meeting (5M) will be developed to provide a platform to promote research, communication, and STEM education among researchers and college youths.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposal focuses on the latter, that is, enabling the drug to go directly to a desired location so that it can specifically kill the cells that are causing a specific disease. The drug in this case is a tiny protein called a peptide, akin to a short, beaded necklace where each bead is an amino acid. These peptides can be designed, by stringing the beads together in a specific order, to delete bad disease-causing proteins in cells. However, peptides are not specific and are not terribly efficient at getting inside cells. One way to improve their specificity is to attach the peptide to a large targeting protein that transports the drug to the site where it needs to go. To improve their cell entry, another short polymer strand is attached that allows the peptide to slip inside the cell when it gets there. While this sounds like a good plan, the only way it works is if the peptide can detach from the targeting protein at the right time. If it detaches too early before it reaches the cell where it needs to be, it might go to undesired locations and lead to toxic or poisonous effects. If it detaches too slowly, it will be ineffective. This NSF proposal will study how to attach peptide drugs to the targeting protein and how the speed of detachment affects the ability of peptide to exert its functional effect. Studying the mode of attachment and speed of release will be beneficial for scientific progress and will have a significant impact in several biotechnology fields such as antibody-drug conjugates, peptide-conjugation, and peptide delivery, where effective delivery strategies can be used to build better drugs and advance national health. Furthermore, educational and outreach activities will be integrated throughout this research through a common theme focused on promoting peer-to-peer learning and empowering young aspiring scientists to take up leadership positions in communicating STEM ideas to the broader public. Education and outreach goals will include the development of interactive modules for the CATALYST Academy workshop and the 4H Focus for Teens Program.<br/><br/>Technical description <br/>This NSF project will develop a new class of bioconjugates to improve the intracellular delivery of Peptide-based proteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PepTACs) toward their use in proteome-editing applications. PepTACs are bispecific peptide-based ligands that induce targeted protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteosome system. By employing a peptide ligand that recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase and another that targets a protein of interest (POI), PepTACs facilitate the formation of a ternary complex, POI ubiquitination, and subsequently rapid catalytic POI degradation by the proteasome. However, these heterobifunctional peptide-ligands are not cell-specific and their potency is limited due to inefficient intracellular delivery.  Building on the benefits of peptide-based ligands and the clinical success of antibody-drug conjugates, this NSF project aims to improve cell-specific PepTAC delivery using antibody carriers and cell-penetrating oligothioetheramides (CPOTs) for efficient cytosolic delivery. The resulting optimized product, an antibody-PepTAC conjugate (APC), will be designed to enable rapid and efficient intracellular protein degradation mediated by PepTACs. The proposal outlines several experiments to study the impact of conjugation site on APC transport and the release kinetics of PepTAC-CPOT constructs from the antibody within the endosomal compartment. Parameters from these studies will be correlated to APC intracellular transport and protein degradation. By studying these critical design features, this project will lay the groundwork for the effective delivery of PepTACs, unlocking their vast potential as invaluable tools for cell-specific targeted protein degradation. The ability to rapidly engineer and deliver high-affinity protein degraders against any intracellular target will be of great significance to experimental chemical biology researchers seeking to decipher protein interactions and unravel biological networks. This project is particularly impactful as a biological tool, providing an alternative method for achieving protein degradation (knockout) without the need for genetic materials or alterations to the cells genetic content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

EEP is one of the main processes contributing to the loss of energetic electrons and has important implications in the interconnected atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system (e.g., changes in atmospheric chemistry, ionization, and conductance) and in space weather (e.g., satellite radiation monitoring, satellite drag, etc.).  These energetic electrons are primarily scattered by plasma waves; however, due to limited data coverage, our comprehensive understanding of EEP is limited.  In this project, by developing a machine learning (ML) model, the team will characterize and parameterize the EEP phenomenon's properties and dynamics. Modeling the spatial and temporal evolution of regions where EEP occurs will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the radiation belt dynamics and temporal dependence of the energy input to the atmospheric system. The project is highly interdisciplinary, as our understanding of EEP directly impacts several fields, from the atmosphere and ionosphere system to the magnetosphere, and even potentially provides helpful information for space weather monitoring of electron radiation in the near-Earth environment. The project has the potential to support collaborative efforts across all these communities. The ML model and its outputs will be released to the public, enabling follow-up research projects.<br/><br/>The lack of global observations of EEP is a major limiting factor in advancing our knowledge on EEP. The team suggest to parameterize EEP by developing global EEP maps through the use of machine learning (ML) techniques. These maps will be based on measurements from the long-lived NOAA's POES/MetOp satellites and will be produced given a time history of geomagnetic activity. The project will address the following science questions: How does the global electron precipitation evolve in time and space with geomagnetic activity? Which plasma waves correspond to the observed enhanced electron precipitation? How does the improved spatial coverage impact the estimates/constraints on the spatial size, duration, and flux intensity of the electron precipitation regions? Analyzing the spatial and temporal evolution of regions where EEP occurs will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the radiation belt dynamics and temporal dependence of the energy input to the atmosphere. Additionally, the team will explore whether there is a clear cause-effect correlation between the location and energy of EEP and two main plasma waves. This provides a more definite understanding of the causal relationship between the wave modes and EEP, possibly demonstrating that EEP maps can serve as a proxy for wave activity.  Finally, by estimating the size and flux of EEP regions, the team will quantify the electron loss of the outer radiation belt and the EEP input that contributes to variations in atmospheric chemistry and ionization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this goal, we will bring together community residents and diverse stakeholders (state and regional housing authorities, utility service providers, municipal administrations, community action groups, housing developers/landlords) to co-design an interactive cross-platform for smart energy assistants that: 1) Collect and organize community sociotechnical data and create a community-shared knowledge platform; 2) Integrate a counterfactual engine developed using a theory-informed, hierarchical Bayesian approach that reveals causal links between socioeconomic disparities and system determinants; 3) Generate customized policies for interventions that are tailored to the unique needs of each community; 4) Leverage an AI layer empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to interface with residents and stakeholders and the developed tools and databases. Also, the AI layer facilitates effective communication among residents in need and enables stronger connections between community residents and stakeholders, lowering the barriers to residents understanding and accessing energy programs.<br/><br/>Our sociotechnical research will have direct positive impacts in five pilot communities in Indiana with ultimate goal to extend these benefits to 4.5 million affordable housing units nationwide.

Dimorphic fungi are a group of microorganisms that switch between two distinct forms: mycelia (filamentous cells) and yeasts (spherical cells). While some dimorphic fungi produce commercially valuable products, others cause diseases in plants or mammals. These fungi must be able to sense and respond to various environmental cues, such as temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide, to survive and thrive. Despite the importance of carbon dioxide, how dimorphic fungi sense and respond to this gas molecule remains largely unknown. The results from this project will fill this critical knowledge gap and help develop novel antifungal drugs and agricultural fungicides to combat life-threatening fungal infections and reduce crop damage, respectively. This project will be carried out at Rhodes College and undergraduate students enrolled at Rhodes and students attending LeMoyne-Owen College, a local Historically Black College, will participate in this project. To expand undergraduate research opportunities, this project will support a course-based research experience for students enrolled in the Microbiology course at Rhodes. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which dimorphic fungi sense and respond to carbon dioxide using the model dimorphic fungal organism, Histoplasma capsulatum.

Two independent approaches (genetic screen and DNA pull-down assay) will be used to identify genes that regulate the expression of putative carbonic anhydrase encoding genes in Histoplasma. RNA-seq based transcriptional profiling will be performed to identify genes that are upregulated under elevated carbon dioxide and determine whether overexpression of these genes in Histoplasma will result in enhanced amino acid metabolism and/or reduced antifungal susceptibility regardless of environmental carbon dioxide concentrations.

However, several CPS applications demand a high degree of safety, security, and reliability. Thus, the fundamental problem is constructing highly dependable CPS applications from building blocks that are, in themselves, not inherently reliable. There has been enormous progress made in understanding and patching various classes of vulnerabilities in large-scale distributed CPS. However, these efforts at designing and operating resilient CPS have often been stymied by the lack of understanding of the impact of any perturbation to the overall system, under the economic and policy constraints involved in any realistic real-world CPS. We define perturbations as failures due to: (1) unintended errors in hardware/software, (2) security attacks, (3) unexpected interactions among cyber-physical and human elements including natural disasters,  and (4) incomplete cooperation among stakeholders. In this project, we address these shortcomings to challenges to create resilient, large-scale CPS through our CHORUS Frontier award. Chorus will develop rigorous, scientific mechanisms to enable CPS resilience against a large universe of perturbations. Our application domain is Connected and Autonomous Transportation Systems (CATS) and thus, the benefits of CHORUS will be demonstrated through improvements in safety and security in this domain.<br/><br/>We will achieve goals of CHORUS through three interacting intellectually challenging thrusts in the project. Thrust 1 is on Modeling which will create executable specifications of cyber, physical, and human assets, their interconnections, and the economic and policy constraints. The models will capture various stakeholders in the system and their degree of information sharing and cooperation in defense of the target CPS. Thrust 2 is centered on Proactive planning and deployment. We will develop rigorous game-theoretic formulations to model the spread of perturbations (natural and man-made), their effects, and the appropriate resource allocations that can be applied for resilience at the planning stage, i.e., prior to system deployment. We will also consider which defensive investments are feasible under a rational versus a bounded rational behavioral model of the stakeholders. Thrust 3 focuses on Runtime distributed detection and response. We will determine, at runtime, the security state of the system, through novel uses of existing sensors in the system even though they are imperfect. This will then trigger the response mechanisms, which will be proven to be approximately optimal, through analysis and experimentation. In terms of broader impact, the greatest impact will be that CPS owners will gain a higher degree of trust in the operation of the CPS and policy-makers will understand what level of cooperation among multiple stakeholders in a CPS to incentivize. We will create compelling demonstrations of CHORUS on a connected vehicle testbed distributed between our academic institutions and our industrial partner GM. We will also organize an annual student security competition and develop two MOOCS, both having foundational material on resilient CPS and one focusing more on the CATS application domain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Programming for GPUs has been laborious and error-prone due to the need to manage data migration between discrete host and GPU memories. As deep learning models and social networks become increasingly larger, and scientific workloads more data-intensive, it is imperative to relieve programmers of such tasks and make GPU programming more productive and portable. Unified Memory (UM) technologies have been developed to meet this need. Nevertheless, current UM technologies cause significant or prohibitive performance degradation. This award establishes a foundation for efficient and intelligent unified memory design, closing the prohibitive performance gap and harnessing the power of advanced GPU accelerators. It leads to reductions in time-to-production and time-to-completion of various scientific simulations and deep learning workloads, enabling them to scale up to larger problem sizes with ease. The award includes rich education, outreach, and broadening participation activities, offering in-class and out-of-class experiences, as well as team-based undergraduate research and engaged learning spanning multiple semesters. It recruits and supports students from underrepresented groups, including people with disabilities, fostering their inclusion and belonging.<br/><br/>The comprehensive framework, ACCess Pattern ORienteD (ACCORD), includes abstraction methodologies, cost models, and techniques to enable efficient UM algorithms and systems for various workloads and problem sizes. Its key innovation lies in the abstraction of access patterns, which uses metrics obtainable at the system level to capture the spatial distribution and temporal repetition patterns of massively parallel memory accesses. This abstraction empowers the quantitative assessment of their interaction with UM designs and guides the optimization of algorithms and UM techniques to eliminate performance bottlenecks and optimize data movement effectively. The research objectives include: (1) devising the abstraction of access patterns for UM-based GPU-accelerated systems, (2) developing quantitative methods to analyze the cost of various access patterns and their interaction with UM techniques, (3) designing access pattern-oriented UM techniques for online deployment, and (4) integrating ACCORD into real-world UM systems to support various applications.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) core program at the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF)  and  the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the antiquated technology of current payments systems infrastructure, many financial transactions are slower and more expensive than necessary. With modern computing power and cryptography, smart contract-based platforms can automatically execute transactions of various levels of complexity atomically and with real-time settlement. Improved transaction efficiency and instant settlement have the potential to revolutionize our payment systems, particularly in the areas of micropayments and cross-border payments. A high-volume and very low fee platform can support micropayments priced out of the market by the fee schedules associated with current payment methods. The feasibility of micropayments has the potential to substantially change the business model of the internet. For example, users could pay a minimal amount to view a website ad-free instead of using ad-blockers, and content creators could charge small amounts for users to view individual articles or web posts. Smart contracts can also be used to more efficiently process a wide range of transactions.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to achieve throughput over 1 million transactions per second through parallel execution and horizontal scalability. While public blockchain systems have led to significant technical advancement and inspire aspects of our design, they face scalability challenges due to routing all transactions through the bottleneck of a single unparallelizable consensus mechanism. This project?s key innovation and line of research is the ability to execute smart contract transactions in parallel without needing to serialize a global order for all transactions on the platform. Crucially, this design enables horizontal scalability. Platform data is stored as a key-value database stored across multiple geographically replicated shards. When users initiate transactions, they are handled and processed by one of numerous transaction processors operating in parallel. Notably, the platform is compatible a range of smart contracts and other blockchain platforms as well as alternative runtimes. A key aspect of this research will involve on-demand scaling - the ability to bring additional database shards online and distribute keys and transaction activity across the new shards in accordance with transaction volume demands, all while the platform remains online and operational.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies have shown, students of color have lower dropout rates and higher standardized test scores when taught by a teacher of the same race and ethnicity. In STEM classrooms, STEM teachers of color are essential for underrepresented youth to develop STEM identities and broaden participation across the STEM workforce. There is also a growing need to prepare teachers to work with students who have experienced trauma, an urgent issue in high-need districts that can contribute to teacher attrition. The project will recruit from the Dougherty Family College (DFC), a two-year college helping underserved and underrepresented students transition to a four-year institution. It will provide intensive mentoring, academic and social-emotional support, study abroad projects and STEM research opportunities, and trauma-informed pedagogy training. Continued mentoring, trauma-informed education training, a Dinner and Discussion series and social networking will support scholars during their induction years. The project is anticipated to increase the number and diversity of STEM teachers prepared to serve and persist in high need schools.<br/><br/>This project at the University of St. Thomas includes partnerships with the DFC and the high-need South St. Paul School District. Project goals include: 1) recruit and support at least 13 undergraduate scholars over five years from the diverse DFC population pursuing a biology, mathematics, or physics degree; 2) retain and graduate at least 90% of the undergraduate scholars; 3) prepare scholars to work in high-need districts; and 4) provide mentors/advisors at St. Thomas with training in trauma-informed pedagogy to increase scholars? knowledge and its usage within their classrooms. The trauma-informed theoretical framework will provide  a broad, positive impact for scholars, faculty, and staff at St. Thomas and DFC, as well as teachers in the South St. Paul School District, by helping them recognize trauma among students and trauma they may have experienced themselves. Rigorous external evaluation is anticipated to generate new knowledge on the impact of trauma-informed pedagogies and other project components on the recruitment, retention, and graduation of diverse students pursuing STEM teaching certification and serving in high-need schools. The project team will disseminate findings via regional and national conferences, journal articles, social media, and a project website. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Project (Noyce). The Noyce project supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

The validity of every econometric method is grounded in the assumptions placed on the model. In some cases, these assumptions may be fundamental to the identification and estimation strategy, but ultimately unrealistic in real economic settings. Research that uses these strategies to estimate policy effects or causal impacts may be unreliable if these assumptions are not true. This project will provide alternative strategies that are valid without unrealistic assumptions. The project also will develop methods to test for the legitimacy of underlying assumptions. To ensure the usability of the proposed methods, code will be developed for popular statistical software and will be posted in publicly accessible software repositories. By examining what fundamental assumptions are used to identify causal effects, what the implication of these assumptions are, and how to determine if the assumptions are realistic, this project will contribute to the continual improvement of accurate empirical analysis, an essential input for successful economic policy making. In terms of educational activities, the investigator will support the pipeline of women into economics through the development and mentorship of undergraduate student groups and undergraduate research experiences. To facilitate that activity, the investigator will develop and analyze surveys to determine which student activities are most impactful and make available supporting material on public online platforms for other educators to use.<br/><br/>In the estimation of causal effects and policy evaluation, models of endogeneity are commonplace as individuals or states who choose treatment or to enact a policy often are different than those who do not in unobservable ways. The control function approach is a popular method that addresses endogeneity by controlling for the unobserved differences. However, current control function approaches are limited by unnecessary and often unrealistic restrictions in the identification strategy. This research consists of three projects aimed at eliminating these restrictions and developing a more general control function approach. First is the identification of triangular random coefficient models with continuous endogenous variables. Unlike current control function approaches in the literature, this project will develop a general control function approach that does not depend on scalar heterogeneity in the first stage. The second project will extend the first to the setting of binary endogenous variables; i.e., the policy evaluation setting. The current literature depends critically on a monotonicity assumption in the first stage to identify local average treatment effects, whereas the proposed general control function approach will not. The final project will explore the sensitivity of control function approaches to misspecification of nonlinearity and heteroskedasticity as well as provide guidance to empirical researchers on how to compose specifications that are flexible enough to avoid these issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current solutions on the market are expensive, energy and time intensive, hard to implement, and leave behind forever chemical-contaminated waste products, which results in risks of litigation and difficulties in complying with existing and upcoming regulations. The estimated market size for industries that use forever chemicals is over $4 billion, with potential for the market to grow to $6.5 billion by 2030. Since 2012, 6,000+ cases have been filed, with over $6 billion in liabilities for remediation. This technology helps address this problem providing an easy-to-implement system that requires less energy than all competing destruction technologies, helping manufacturers to stop polluting the communities they serve. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a water treatment system that can continuously degrade forever chemicals with Ultraviolet light at room temperature in a single, continuous stream. The reactor contains organic-based adsorbent photocatalysts. These materials make excellent adsorbents due to their hierarchical porous structure that gives them extremely high surface areas. There has been no feasible method of mass producing these photocatalysts until now. This novel technology allows for the absorption of forever chemicals at room temperature for on-site degradation with minimal energy cost and no need for treatment of contaminated absorbent.

This project seeks to overcome these limitations by thoroughly characterizing existing measures and leveraging the resulting insights to develop improved and unified measures of data visualization literacy. <br/><br/>The research plan is organized into three objectives. The first will focus on conducting controlled studies to determine the internal reliability and convergent validity of existing measures of data visualization literacy in demographically diverse samples. The second objective will focus on the development of reproducible procedures for generating new measures that span the full spectrum of tasks and data visualizations used in existing measures, while also overcoming some of their most important limitations, including uneven estimation precision across different components of data visualization literacy. The third objective will administer multiple variants of newly developed measures to multiple diverse samples, providing a strong test of their reliability. Taken together, these activities will generate a suite of well validated and comprehensive measures for assessing data visualization literacy skills. In the future, these new measures can then be used to understand how well core data literacy skills are being learned in real-world educational settings.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program.

These models play a prominent role in many applications. A very important example that will receive particular attention is the evolution of the internal structure (microstructure) of polycrystalline materials, such as most metals and ceramics, during manufacturing processes such as heat treatment (annealing). Polycrystalline materials are very common. They are composed of tiny crystallites, known as grains, stuck together. During annealing, the boundaries between the grains, described by a network of surfaces, start to move as some grains get larger, while others shrink and disappear. The shapes and sizes of the grains making up these materials are known to have profound implications for their physical properties, such as their strength and conductivity. Materials scientists have long had mathematical models that describe the motion of the network of grains; what has been lacking is accurate, efficient, reliable, and flexible numerical methods that would allow them to compare large scale simulations of their models against experimental measurements. In recent years, as experimental measurements of time evolution of the three dimensional internal structure of materials have become available, the need for algorithms to simulate the relevant models have become increasingly acute. The project will take steps to address this need. Resulting algorithms will be implemented in software, which will be made available to the broader scientific community. The project will also support the training and research of one graduate student working towards a Ph.D. in mathematics.<br/><br/>The project will take a new approach to designing level set methods for multiphase geometric motions such as motion by mean curvature of networks of surfaces. It will exploit a precise, mathematical connection between a particular discretization of the level set formulation of motion by mean curvature, known as the median filter scheme, and another class of algorithms known as threshold dynamics. This will allow extending advantages of one method to the other. The advantage of threshold dynamics is its generality and highly developed theory of stability and convergence. In particular, recent advances in our theoretical understanding of threshold dynamics enabled its extension to the more elaborate microstructure evolution models of interest to materials scientists. Via its precise connection to median filter schemes, elements of this theory will be carried over to level set methods. The new level set methods will allow arbitrary, normal dependent (anisotropic) surface tensions and mobilities to be assigned to any interface in the network of surfaces ? a level of generality that cannot even be attempted by most existing techniques. They will also allow subgrid accuracy in locating the interface even when implemented on uniform grids ? a distinct advantage of the level set method over threshold dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this comes with greatly increased complexity of hardware and a large carbon footprint for artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as for natural language processing. This has fueled design trends towards the use of low supply voltages, novel aggressively scaled devices and mixed analog-digital signal processing. The mix of these trends has made the underlying AI hardware vulnerable to operational uncertainties stemming from manufacturing imperfections and noise-induced transient errors. Such uncertainties can cause malfunction of AI driven applications with catastrophic consequences for safety-critical systems such as for transportation and robotics. Consequently, the goal of this project is to develop fundamental algorithms and infrastructure that allow error-resilient operation of AI systems under the above threats across diverse operating conditions, without significant impact on system cost and complexity. This will advance the delivery of highly dependable AI driven systems, so essential for rapid societal adoption of AI as well as for national defense. The project will support inclusive education of graduate and undergraduate students, development of educational and experimental infrastructure, and technology transfer to industry.<br/><br/>To address the uncertainties above, the research team aims to develop methods for efficient post-manufacture testing and tuning of deep neural networks (DNNs) with energy-efficient analog crossbar arrays that have been shown in prior research to be vulnerable to manufacturing process variations, resulting in significant drop in DNN performance. The underlying test methods that target manufacturing variability will also be very effective in detecting hard defects such as electrical shorts and opens. Testing and post-manufacture tuning algorithms that offer significant yield improvement over the state of the art will be developed, with tuning times of the order of seconds as opposed to hours for current techniques, reducing device manufacturing and test cost. In parallel, algorithms for on-line error detection, diagnosis and correction of radiation and noise-induced transient soft errors in digital and analog accelerators for novel Artificial Intelligence computing paradigms will also be developed. The goal is to develop scalable error resilience frameworks for a wide range of learning abstractions including recurrent neural networks, transformers, reinforcement learning algorithms and spiking networks. The key objective is to achieve detection and correction of errors with near-zero latency and minimal computational overhead without extensive retraining of the neural network or modifications to accelerator hardware.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) and Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK12) programs. DRK12 is an applied research program that supports STEM education PreK-12.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Safety qualification is a vital step for approving the use of safety-critical systems such as used in air and railway transportation, cars, medical devices, and space vehicles. Prequalification is the process of preparing hardware, software, and documentation that can be shared and reused by multiple systems that go through safety qualification. The reduction in cost and effort from using prequalified subsystems can have a huge impact on the affordability of safety-critical systems. A successful example of a prequalification process involves the open-source Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS), a real-time operating system used in satellites and space probes. The prequalification reduces the cost to develop and qualify new spacecraft that use the RTEMS software. This project explores the potential to extend the existing prequalification process to space agency requirements and to other systems that require safety qualification. These systems are vital to critical infrastructure and national security. Reducing the time, effort, and costs of their qualification will benefit society.<br/><br/>At present, limited support exists for prequalified open-source products other than the RTEMS software. This lack of support limits the applicability of prequalification to other open-source software products. It is not yet known how difficult it may be to generalize the prequalification approach to other products. This project is organized around three primary tasks. First, surveys and interviews will seek to discover the extent to which prequalification may be valuable more broadly to open-source software projects. Second, the appropriate means to structure, manage, and sustain a prequalification ecosystem are examined through surveys, interviews, and process assessment of the current practice. Third, the project catalyzes the community of contributors and stakeholders to cultivate interest and engagement in the prospect of an open-source ecosystem focused on prequalification. Through these tasks, this project will scope and plan a new open-source ecosystem that can separate the concerns of prequalification from those of the prequalified software products.

Because chromosome folding occurs over a wide range of length and times scales, a sophisticated combination of experimental and computational approaches is required to unravel genome organization. In this collaborative project, a team from NYU (Tamar Schlick), Harvard (Anna Lappala and Jeannie Lee), and New Mexico Consortium (Karissa Sanbonmatsu) will combine expertise in molecular biology, genomics, computational biology, biophysics and biomolecular modeling in an integrated experimental and computational effort to address key mechanistic questions about X-chromosome structure and function. Inactivation influences X chromosome expression in females and has profound health implications. A better understanding of X-chromosome folding and gene expression will lead to new avenues for treating other diseases related to X-chromosome status. The research program will offer interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary training to young scientists in STEM fields, through hands on mentoring and participation in summer camps, promoting national needs in education and innovation in Science and Engineering. Public outreach will be further enhanced by communicating these scientific and societal advances in the form of a public museum exhibit.<br/><br/>Advances in epigenomic methods have opened new avenues in chromosome folding studies. Yet translating such experimental information into three-dimensional gene structures is complex. The team will focus on X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a balancing of X-linked gene expression between females and males, and will dissect this process at multiple scales ? from nucleosomes to chromosomes. The team will integrate high-resolution genomics data with advanced spatial modeling to unravel XCI dynamics to interpret related gene function and activity. Namely, Lappala?s gene modeling techniques, Lee?s structure / function studies of the X-chromosome, Sanbonmatsu's chromosome dynamics simulations on the macroscale, and Schlick?s gene and chromatin modeling and simulations at the mesoscale will shed light on genome organization and function. Included are delineation of protein-mediated effects by cohesin and CTCF complexes on XCI and development of models of XCI at various spatial and temporal resolutions. The research will deepen our understanding of XCI and related mechanisms of chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation, offering new modeling and simulation tools for genes and chromosomes and advancing the fields of genomics and epigenetics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using this innovation, companies within the functional food and beverage, dietary supplement, and skincare (FFBDS) industry including, ingredient suppliers, manufacturers, and consumer packaged goods (CPG) can produce safe and effective products backed by scientific rigor. Additionally, this technology enables companies to quickly and cost effectively assure ingredient consistency and quality. The end result is consumers' access to products that are supported by science, bringing clarity, trust, and ease to the purchasing process in a confusing market. Long-term, the data from these studies can help with understanding which ingredients have the most beneficial effect on human health and can be used to develop personalized nutrition products. The data can also be tied to ingredient traceability insights and to optimize sustainable farming, harvesting, extracting, and manufacturing practices to produce ingredients with the most advantageous biological effect. Ultimately, the outcomes from this project could benefit all stakeholders in the functional ingredient supply chain, from farmers to producers to the end consumers.<br/><br/>The proposed project creates a new testing standard for ingredients used in FFBDS products that measures the ingredient?s biological effect quickly and cost-effectively. Functional ingredients have benefits beyond normal nutrition, including ingredients such as curcumin (turmeric), cranberry, and elderberry. However, companies face challenges sourcing ingredients that are consistent in batch-to-batch quality. Currently available batch-to-batch testing methods fall short, measuring only the amount of ingredients but not their biological activity. In the present proposal, using commercially available human cells, and genomics and artificial intelligence technologies, biological effect benchmarks will be developed for the functional ingredients. Processes and protocols established for turmeric benchmark development in Phase I of this project will be used to optimize cranberry and elderberry benchmark development through this Phase II project. The final product will be a lab test that compares the commercial functional ingredients? biological effectiveness to that of the benchmark. Upon test completion, customers will receive a report detailing the biological effect score of the ingredient, a list of key genes affected with a description of their relevance to human health. This high-throughput, cost-effective test will enable companies to develop products that help build consumer trust and confidence as well as mitigate compliance risk.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current mosquito populations are building resistance to commonly used pesticides, which may increase the spread of pathogens carried by mosquitos that cause diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. This technology provides an alternative that targets mosquito larvae using a formulation that allows for precise application, minimizing environmental impact and avoiding harm to non-target organisms.  In addition, the product is biodegradable and may meet the need for safer and more efficient mosquito control. The goal is to help combat mosquito-borne diseases while providing a sustainable alternative to conventional chemical mosquito control.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a mosquito control technology that uses the natural properties of essential oils to create a safer and more effective mosquito larvicide. The challenge with existing larvicides is that they often harm the environment and are becoming less effective as mosquitoes develop resistance. This solution involves encapsulating essential oils in yeast cells, which are a favorite food of mosquito larvae. Encapsulating essential oils into yeast protects the oils from breaking down and reduces the risk of harming other wildlife. This product has been tested successfully in both laboratory and field trials, as well as against mosquito larvae that have developed resistance to traditional larvicides. The product is non-toxic to humans and other mammals at the doses used, and is made from food-grade materials, which may enhance public acceptance. In addition, this larvicide may play a key role in reducing mosquito populations and the diseases they spread, offering a more sustainable and environmentally friendly solution for public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, when selecting a medical treatment, it is not enough to know that a treatment works well on average; we need to ensure that it benefits a large proportion of patients, say 95%, without causing harm. Current statistical learning methods, however, often overlook such nuanced considerations of risk, leading to a significant disconnect between theoretical advancements and practical needs. This proposal seeks to close this gap by developing a new framework for risk-sensitive decision-making. By incorporating risk assessments into the decision-making process, our research aims to advance scientific knowledge and contribute to the general interest by improving healthcare outcomes, financial stability, and the safety and effectiveness of robotic systems. The project will also support education and promote diversity by providing training opportunities for students at various levels and developing user-friendly, open-source software to make these advanced methods accessible to practitioners.<br/><br/>The research will focus on the development of innovative methods for risk-sensitive statistical learning, aiming to improve decision-making processes in areas where outcomes' variability can significantly impact overall success. The project is structured around four specific aims. The first aim is to develop quantile-constrained statistical learning. A particular example is to optimize average outcomes under constraints that ensure a minimum benefit level across a defined proportion of a population. This involves formulating the problem as a constrained optimization issue with stochastic boundaries, proposing novel algorithms, and deriving asymptotic results for estimator analysis. The second aim is to develop methods for risk-sensitive deep reinforcement learning. This is to create theoretically grounded algorithms that utilize deep neural networks to derive optimal decision rules, incorporating variance and other risk considerations to ensure decisions are robust under uncertainty. The third aim is to address risk-sensitive bandit problems through the development of both frequentist and Bayesian models and algorithms, aiming to achieve optimal regrets while considering risk. The final aim is to extend the methods and results to encompass the broad class of coherent risk measures, thereby enhancing the applicability and impact of the research across various domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Making sure they operate safely, however, remains challenging. RAS code is often messy, and the real world in which these systems operate is complex and unpredictable. This research project focuses on creating a family of methods to find faults in these sophisticated systems by analyzing: 1) the program artifacts they are built from to extract models that can be more easily checked for faults, and 2) the real-world data they encounter (like images taken by cameras) to determine what portions of the environment are worth simulating more accurately.

The research will be integrated into educational curriculum and training. <br/><br/>The key insights enabling the project are two-fold.  First, although robotics code is often messy and complex, model-relevant behavior is typically implemented via a subset of application programming interfaces and configuration files with clearly-specifiable semantics. Second, field data encodes key spatial-temporal physical constraints imposed by the real world, which provides hints on how to steer simulation to reduce the gap with reality. The investigators will leverage these insights to effectively lift useful models from real code to detect compositional faults, identify and construct simulation scenarios that capture constraints imposed by the real world, and inform and validate the evolution of robotic systems.   The proposed work will produce: 1) Techniques to infer rich behavior models with physical attributes from RAS code and artifacts, and to check those models against component and system properties; 2) Techniques to infer specifications from messy real-world  data, to contrast those specifications against simulation states, and to synthesize missing simulation environments; 3) Techniques to inform RAS' evolution, to understand the impact of code, physical, and world changes, and to cost-effectively correct and test changing RAS; and 4) Studies with RAS to assess the techniques, quantifying their effect on the gaps between code and models, between simulation and reality, and during evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, white-nose syndrome (WNS), caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has devastated North American bat populations, killing millions in one of the greatest wildlife disease epidemics in US history. Recent work suggests that bat microbiomes protect their host against WNS but the specific metabolites and environmental triggers for their production have not been identified. By leveraging natural products chemistry, correlative metabolomics, and ecologically inspired synthetic microbial communities, this project aims to understand how bacteria protect against WNS and what metabolites/biosynthetic pathways are responsible for this protection. Results of this study may aid in future conservation efforts and educate the general public about cave microbiology and its impacts on diverse ecosystems. In the near-term, this project will provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research in the PI?s lab and in the form of Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences. <br/><br/>Building upon the team?s prior work screening bacterial isolates from bat skin microbiome, the team has identified 98 bacterial isolates that inhibit P. destructans in vitro. To lay the scientific foundation for developing probiotic treatments, the PI plans to address the following questions. What metabolites govern host-microbiome-pathogen interactions? How are biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that produce antifungal molecules regulated? How might probiotic treatment of vulnerable bats impact existing communities in treated caves? To address these questions, an interdisciplinary research plan with two Aims is proposed that characterizes the metabolomes of bat-associated bacteria, integrates chemical and genomic data to identify antifungal molecules and their BGCs, and elicits formation of ecologically relevant metabolites from silent BGCs using synthetic communities. Answering these research questions will provide the context for building research capacity of the PI and James Madison University and engaging undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research as part of laboratory-based and course-based activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A regional need has been identified for skilled robotics technicians in the Middle Tennessee area. Columbia State Community College (CSCC) recognizes that limited access to local robotics training will not adequately meet the demand for skilled technicians in their service area. To address this growing need, the Certify Future Robotics Technicians project at CSCC and Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) will facilitate and expedite both upskilling and new employment for students at CSCC by developing and implementing a robotics training program focused on gaining industry standard certifications while also earning college credit. This program provides graduates 16 hours of college credit and industry certifications from FANUC Robotics, Cognex Vision Systems, OSHA, and The Smart Automation Certification Alliance.  These industry valued certifications will allow graduates to fill high-demand and high-wage technical positions quickly, with exceptional training setting them up to become future leaders in automation and robotics.  CSCC serves a large diverse population of underrepresented rural and low-income students that will be able to enter the skilled technical workforce.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish a 1-year robotics certificate at CSCC. MTSU faculty will bring their extensive knowledge in robotics and automation through a partnership with CSCC. Eleven robotics modules will be developed to prepare students for industry certifications by bridging theoretical and practical learning methods. These modules will be divided into three fundamental areas: assembling, programming, and troubleshooting. CSCC will host and teach this new robotics program. The project will pair with the existing curriculum at CSCC and can easily be integrated into the 2-year Engineering Systems Technology program. Modules will be developed and vetted in 2024 during monthly meetings with industry partners. Additional adjunct faculty will be hired and trained in Fall 2024. The first group of students will enter the program in Spring 2025 and graduate by the end of 2025 with nationally recognized industry certifications and 16 hours of college coursework. Additional cohorts will enter the program as new students starting in the Spring of 2026. Hands on methods and classroom instruction will ensure that each student can perform programming, maintenance, setup, safety evaluations, and operations with different robotic systems. As a result, CSCC graduates can go directly into workplace settings with confidence. Industry partners in the CSCC service area have committed to using this program to upskill their current employees. Advisory board meetings will take place quarterly throughout the project. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although current computers are extraordinarily powerful and theoretically able to perform a quintillion operations per second (exascale), ESMs currently may obtain only a few percent of this peak in practice. <br/><br/>Therefore, various types of downscaling from coarser resolution runs are required to provide information about local impacts (information which would be improved with higher resolution), and biases which cannot be addressed without higher resolution remain unresolved.  Current projections suggest global ESM resolutions of 1 km will not be attainable until around 2055, which is far beyond the time needed for critical decisions to be made regarding climate mitigation and adaptation.<br/><br/>Consequently, it is prudent to examine the possibility of creating a special-purpose computational system for frontier Earth system science and climate projection for use by the global community. An effective first step forward in such an endeavor is holding an international summit at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in fall 2024.  The computing system would need to accommodate both ESMs and new approaches that couple or tether such models to artificial intelligence (AI). <br/><br/>The summit will assemble international leaders in relevant disciplines from academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations to examine several key questions relating to ESMs and the role of AI in and around them going forward; possible structures of a special-purpose computational system and alternative pathways; strategies for creating such a system; and expected benefits.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include an opportunity to engage a diverse, international audience and provide an opportunity for practicing researchers, as well as students and post-doctoral scholars across all types and sizes of institutions, to learn not only about a special-purpose computational system for Earth system science and climate projection, but also<br/>about the value of using fine-scale model output to inform society more broadly regarding local and regional climate change. Topics to be discussed include economic and social impacts of climate change; risk communication and management; health and epidemiology; international relations; population dynamics;infrastructure; coastal vulnerability; and national security and defense.<br/><br/>The summit will be free, streamed live on the Internet, and recorded for subsequent viewing.

The research will develop a framework to better understand potential attacks and investigate several protection mechanisms. Broader comprehension and mitigation of these attacks hold crucial importance in protecting intellectual property and user privacy in mobile devices.

This project builds upon an attacker framework to extract unique memory-contention-based signatures of victim applications. New profiling and analysis techniques are developed to capture non-linear memory access characteristics of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads. The signatures are then used to create reverse-engineering, information extraction and denial-of-service based attacks. Finally, various countermeasures at architecture- and system-level are developed against the new attacks. The research team investigates the security, performance, area, and energy implications of new memory controller scheduling policies and randomization-based solutions.

Existing latent variable models for network data can capture the structural features of networks; however, they make the unrealistic assumption that connections within the network do not depend on each other. In contrast, for networks from the social and life sciences, the processes that lead to network formation and structure inherently induce fundamental dependencies among the connections within the network. This project will introduce a new class of latent variable models for network data that can model both network structure and important dependence patterns that affect how the networks of our world materialize. The research project provides an opportunity for the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students with a broad range of backgrounds and interests. Furthermore, the methods developed in this project will be introduced into relevant courses. Together with Florida State University, the project will support the formation of a K-12 educational outreach program. The program will establish a data science summer camp aimed at early exposure to statistics and data science disciplines, including an introduction to network analysis. <br/><br/>Latent variable models for network data typically assume that connections within the network are conditionally independent given the latent variables. This assumption may be too strong for many applications of interest, especially those in the social and life sciences, as the social processes that give rise to a network may induce dependence patterns among the connections within the network that cannot be explained solely by latent variables. This project will introduce a new class of latent variable models for network data that do not adopt the almost ubiquitous conditional independence assumptions of the current state-of-the-art by integrating and extending two existing approaches to modeling network data, that of the exponential-family random graph model and the latent space literature, utilizing the strengths of each literature to compensate for known deficiencies of the other. The project will develop accompanying methodology for fitting models to observed network data and theory for establishing the statistical foundations for estimation and inference.  The new methods will be applied to real network data from the social and life sciences. Freely distributed open-source software will be produced to allow practitioners to utilize the developed class of models in applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While much attention has been given to the rapid privatization of land following disaster (a process commonly referred to as disaster capitalism), this project focuses on the post-disaster period when the form of property is not yet determined, private or otherwise. Indeed, after the emergency phase of the disaster has passed, property often remains in flux, caught up in local resistance efforts, political wrangling, and contested legal matters. By focusing on this interim period, this research is able to study the way in which law and legal decisions come to matter in differing claims to property. Privatization is neither a facile nor foregone process, and law is neither always nor the only way that different societies relate to land and their claim to it. As the severity and frequency of disasters has escalated, this research has broad implications by building an understanding of how law impacts society at large and marginalized communities more specifically as they recover and reclaim property. <br/>   <br/>This early concept grant for exploratory research (EAGER) project investigates the process of property formation in the aftermath of natural disaster. The guiding research questions are: how does landownership take shape following a major disaster? And how are laws and legal decisions taken up (or not) when making a claim to a particular model of property? To answer these questions, the researcher will conduct a series of three ethnographic research trips over the course of 18 months. The site of the research is a community that was directly affected by a major hurricane several years ago and is now actively negotiating the shape that property will take in the wake of the disaster, recent landmark legal decisions, and an external push to privatize.

Such a technology can be used in numerous natural resource extraction processes. The ability of mining operators to reduce the freshwater consumption and eliminate the consumption of toxic chemicals could expand the production of metals critical to the energy transition. In the production of lithium from hypersaline aquifers, lithium producers could utilize such a technology to improve the purity of lithium products and reduce the environmental footprint. Additionally, this highly selective separation technology could allow lithium companies to economically extract lithium from domestic resources in the United States. This I-Corps project thus has the potential to reduce dependence on fragile and complex supply chains. The increased supply of lithium and other critical metal products would enable battery manufacturers to advance the performance of their products, decreasing the costs, and increase the adoption of electric vehicles and battery-based energy storage systems.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a highly selective, low-freshwater consuming, and renewable electricity-powered electrochemical separation technology that leverages a novel electrical-switch system to operate continuously. This electrochemical separation technology has demonstrated exceptional selectivity for removing monovalent cations from complex ionic solutions while minimizing energy consumption. Further research is being conducted to investigate membrane and electrode material combinations to improve lithium selectivity, increase cycling stability, and further minimize energy consumption. Novel electrode and membrane materials are also being investigated to explore the efficacy of this novel platform for extracting other critical metals from aqueous solutions including other alkali, alkaline, or transition metals from natural resources.

It is aimed at graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and it comprises four mini-courses on different recent developments in the theory of cluster algebras and related topics. This theory is a relatively young branch of mathematics. The initial motivation was to gain an understanding of certain positivity properties in representation theory, a branch of modern algebra. The theory quickly developed deep connections to a variety of disciplines in mathematics and physics, and it is a highly active research area. Cluster algebras are commutative rings equipped with a combinatorial structure that groups its elements into certain subsets, called clusters, which are related to each other via an intricate apparatus called mutation. This structure turns out to be very natural, in the sense that it is present in a large number of mathematical designs. <br/><br/>The four mini-courses are on the following topics. (1) Cluster structures on Richardson varieties and their categorification, which focuses on a relation between representation theory and cluster algebras in the setting of algebras arising from Grassmannian varieties. (2) Cluster algebras and Legendrian links, a mini-course on a connection between cluster algebras and symplectic geometry, especially the contact structure on positive braids. (3) Maximal almost rigid modules, a new type of modules over gentle algebras that correspond bijectively to triangulations of surfaces. (4) Cluster algebras and knot theory, which is on a fundamental relation to knots and links that gives new insights into both areas. All courses are on recent advances in the field and are taught by researchers who are directly involved in these developments.

Programming for GPUs has been laborious and error-prone due to the need to manage data migration between discrete host and GPU memories. As deep learning models and social networks become increasingly larger, and scientific workloads more data-intensive, it is imperative to relieve programmers of such tasks and make GPU programming more productive and portable. Unified Memory (UM) technologies have been developed to meet this need. Nevertheless, current UM technologies cause significant or prohibitive performance degradation. This award establishes a foundation for efficient and intelligent unified memory design, closing the prohibitive performance gap and harnessing the power of advanced GPU accelerators. It leads to reductions in time-to-production and time-to-completion of various scientific simulations and deep learning workloads, enabling them to scale up to larger problem sizes with ease. The award includes rich education, outreach, and broadening participation activities, offering in-class and out-of-class experiences, as well as team-based undergraduate research and engaged learning spanning multiple semesters. It recruits and supports students from underrepresented groups, including people with disabilities, fostering their inclusion and belonging.<br/><br/>The comprehensive framework, ACCess Pattern ORienteD (ACCORD), includes abstraction methodologies, cost models, and techniques to enable efficient UM algorithms and systems for various workloads and problem sizes. Its key innovation lies in the abstraction of access patterns, which uses metrics obtainable at the system level to capture the spatial distribution and temporal repetition patterns of massively parallel memory accesses. This abstraction empowers the quantitative assessment of their interaction with UM designs and guides the optimization of algorithms and UM techniques to eliminate performance bottlenecks and optimize data movement effectively. The research objectives include: (1) devising the abstraction of access patterns for UM-based GPU-accelerated systems, (2) developing quantitative methods to analyze the cost of various access patterns and their interaction with UM techniques, (3) designing access pattern-oriented UM techniques for online deployment, and (4) integrating ACCORD into real-world UM systems to support various applications.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) core program at the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF)  and  the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before an ML model can be deployed, the model must be ?trained? by repeatedly processing examples. Each example helps the model to make progressively more accurate predictions, ""learning"" how to solve the problem at hand. Unfortunately, this training step requires a large amount of expensive, highly-specialized hardware and can take several hours to complete. Given limited hardware resources, it is not obvious how to allocate (share) these resources across a stream of ML training jobs. The goal of this project is to develop new resource allocation policies that allow us to produce highly-accurate ML models, quickly, and with limited resources. The main challenge in this work is that ML training jobs present a number of unique characteristics compared to other computing workloads. ML training jobs are highly parallelizable, meaning a single training job might run across multiple servers. Each job also has a large number of configuration options that affect how fast the model learns a particular problem. This project uses mathematical modeling to develop new allocation policies specifically designed for ML training jobs. This research will be accompanied by the development of new courses and mentorship programs designed to recruit students from underrepresented backgrounds into research on the modeling of computer systems.<br/><br/>Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly being deployed across a wide variety of applications. The growth in ML models has been accompanied by the development of specialized hardware accelerators that help reduce the training time for ML models. However, there has not been a similar degree of specialization in the scheduling algorithms used to train  ML models on clusters of specialized hardware. The question of how to best schedule ML training jobs is non-trivial. ML training jobs present many unique characteristics compared to other computing workloads. First, ML training jobs vary in their degree of parallelizability (ability to scale out across servers), with some jobs being highly elastic and others being inelastic in their scalability. It is not clear how to allocate (share) hardware resources among jobs with such different characteristics. To make things more complicated, each training job is parameterized by a set of tuning parameters called hyperparameters. The parallelizability of an ML training job varies over time as the job hyperparameters change. Hence, systems which either rely on static resource reservations or existing heuristic scheduling policies are poorly suited for ML training jobs. Finally, the inherent work associated with an ML job is not a fixed quantity. Instead, ML jobs are generally trained until the model meets a desired level of accuracy. Hence, the existing scheduling theory that favors ?short? jobs does not apply in this case. This proposal develops a new theoretic framework for modeling the dynamics of ML jobs running in a shared cluster. This framework will be used to develop scheduling and allocation policies that are specialized to ML training jobs, and to prove performance guarantees on these policies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One important pathway by which these scarce elements are delivered to surface ocean waters is through aerosol particles in the atmosphere. This project will address important questions about the variability in the atmospheric delivery of iron and other TEs to the surface waters of the North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda through aerosol sampling, laboratory experiments, and modeling. Increased accuracy of atmospheric deposition and aerosol iron solubility representation will improve global biogeochemical models and our understanding of how changes in climate may influence the marine carbon cycle through changes in atmospheric iron deposition. The project will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student involvement and support an early-career scientist. Data will be posted on the BCO-DMO website and made widely available to scientists working in similar fields by being included in the SCOR Working Group 167 (Reducing Uncertainty in Soluble aerosol Trace Element Deposition) data compilation. <br/><br/>This project will conduct a two-year time-series of size-fractionated aerosol sampling at the Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory in Bermuda to accomplish four goals: <br/>1.	Analyze temporal variations in the size distribution of aerosol Fe and other bioactive, pollutant, and tracer TEs, as well as major cations and anions over the western North Atlantic Ocean and link these variations to aerosol sources and transport pathways. <br/>2.	Apply a range of chemical extractions to size-fractionated and bulk North Atlantic aerosols to quantify lower and upper estimates of potentially bioavailable Fe and explain trends in bulk aerosol Fe solubility in the context of variations observed in size-fractionated aerosols. <br/>3.	Use elemental ratios, Fe stable isotopes, Fe-mineralogical partitioning and redox state, and air mass back trajectories to directly probe the chemical controls on aerosol Fe solubility as a function of aerosol particle size and source over a two-year period. <br/>4.	Parameterize concurrently measured meteorological conditions to model deposition velocities for each aerosol size-fraction during weekly sampling periods, thereby constraining supply rates of total and soluble TEs to North Atlantic surface waters. <br/>The results of this study will provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing trace element solubility in North Atlantic aerosols and the role that aerosol size distribution plays in these variations. Rates of dry deposition calculated using size-fractionated aerosol collections will give a better understanding of the potential overestimation of bioavailable trace element supply rate that may arise from previous calculations based solely on bulk aerosol concentrations. This project will thus improve representation of atmospheric trace element solubility and deposition flux in global and regional deposition models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data Science competencies are increasingly important for students to be well prepared for professional opportunities and engage in civic discourse. However, most STEM teachers lack the necessary skills to engage students with data in productive ways, especially the ever-expanding forms of data from new digital technologies and in meaningful ways. In addition, STEM teachers often lack the opportunities and support to grow into leaders that can support and influence colleagues in their schools and districts. The project's design includes development of teacher competency, recognition, belonging and identity so that partner teachers become leaders in their local context who contribute to the improvement of STEM education in sustainable and professionally fulfilling ways. This project will develop, implement, and study this innovative program for in-service STEM teachers in grades 5-8. In addition, the program will integrate coursework in leadership and DSE and support teachers in using concepts from these classes in their local contexts through leadership experiences, community building, and recurring reflection meetings.<br/><br/>This project at Middle Tennessee State University is conducted in partnership with Cannon County Schools, Bedford County Schools, Murfreesboro City Schools, and The Concord Consortium. Project goals include the development of a new program for developing teacher leaders in DSE, 16 Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) with new expertise and support to guide colleagues to create novel approaches to data science education in their schools and districts. This project will recruit MTFs from a pool of middle school STEM teachers in partner districts and conduct research on their changing ideas and practices related to DSE and leadership in their local contexts. In partnership with local school districts and The Concord Consortium, this program will center an innovative platform for learning about data science, the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP). CODAP?s development has been supported through multiple NSF grants, and the professional learning opportunities built from this platform will result in a cohort of teacher leaders that will be equipped to make creative and sustainable contributions to their local schools and districts. This project will contribute to STEM education through research findings on how teachers' ideas and practices change as they grow into DSE leaders in their schools and districts. This study will examine MTFs? changing knowledge, practices, and professional identity using interviews, MTF data science lessons, written reflections from MTFs, and their capstone projects. The intellectual merit of this project is the contribution of knowledge about how to develop and support data science education leaders, and the broader impacts will be more leaders in schools supporting students to learn about data and modeling.  An external evaluator will evaluate the project through regular reviews and disseminate the products and knowledge through professional conferences, publications, professional networks, and programming for the Tennessee STEM Education Research Center and The Concord Consortium.

Psychology is the largest undergraduate major at The City College of New York and it has been challenging to engage psychology students from historically excluded backgrounds in research early on, which is key to getting into graduate school and careers in these fields. CAUSE will use early career exposure, scaffolded experiences, and research opportunities to increase the number of students from the target population that continue to graduate school and/or ultimately enter research careers in psychology, with a focus on designing interventions that support all cultural identities and science identity development. CAUSE will create a pipeline of programs for multiple stakeholder populations by expanding an existing partnership with a community college to engage their students, including after they transfer to CCNY. The results of the research proposed by CAUSE will contribute to the literature regarding best practices for how to address the issues that tend to exclude Hispanic, low-income, and other historically under-represented students from entering STEM fields, particularly Psychology. CAUSE will also model ways to partner with community colleges to build a supportive pipeline with multiple entry points into a STEM field. <br/><br/>The specific aims of the project are to: i) develop a scalable, inclusive, and sustainable model for early exposure to research for psychology students in both community college and 4-year campus settings; ii) increase the number of psychology students graduating with research skills; iii) promote a culture of inclusion in psychology departments at CCNY and BMCC; iv) investigate the impacts of early exposure to research and experiential learning on retention and graduation of freshman and transfer students majoring in psychology; v) contribute to the literature on interventions that impact Hispanic and low-income undergraduate STEM students' success in social sciences majors/careers, as well as on student self-efficacy and science identity development.  Using the Research Self-Efficacy Scale, the EPIC survey, and other tools, the proposed interventions will allow us to: 1) study how predictors of retention and success in STEM develop for Hispanic and low-income students; 2) understand how practices lowering the barrier to engagement in research increases the recruitment and retention of diverse undergraduate students; and 3) understand the impacts of interventions to increase the number of Hispanic, low-income, and other historically under-represented students exposed to and entering careers in psychology. Students within the proposed programs will also contribute to research in the field of psychology by working with faculty on research projects.

Currently, the surge in digitalization has led to a staggering amount of electronic waste (e-waste), with approximately 53.6 million metric tons discarded annually, and only 17.4% of which is collected and recycled. This technology addresses e-waste by using a sustainable process for recycling. The goal is to recover base and precious metals from printed circuit boards and other urban waste streams to reduce the need for mining and its associated environmental impact. This approach may minimize material and energy consumption and may create new revenue streams through the recovery of valuable materials from post-consumer electronic waste.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a process for the selective and efficient physical separation of components in e-waste. Current recycling methods, marked by high energy consumption, environmental pollution, and low recovery of valuable materials, typically involve energy-intensive size reduction, hydrometallurgical process. This process departs from current methods by leveraging inherent material properties and differences in malleability and size among e-waste components. This technology efficiently liberates components without the need for intensive energy use. It further capitalizes on physical separation techniques, exploiting differences in size, density, and magnetic susceptibility to isolate high-grade, saleable elements and other products, including base metals (such as copper and aluminum), precious metals (such as gold, silver, and palladium), ferrous metals (such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and manganese), silicon, and plastics. High-purity metals were obtained when the process was tested with a char-metal mixture from e-waste thermolysis. Embracing circular economy principles, this chemical-free and zero-waste approach not only maximizes resource recovery and product quality but also reduces the carbon footprint, offering a sustainable and economically viable alternative to current recycling methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peer+ will add two new ways for students to discuss the question with their peers through (1) a text-chat for answering questions during lecture, and (2) a pseudo text-chat for answering questions after lecture. While there is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of Peer Instruction, preliminary research at the University of Michigan has found that using text-chat during lectures improved learning. Peer Instruction is known to improve retention in STEM classes, especially for students from minoritized groups. Providing new types of peer discussion could further improve retention and thus increase the number and diversity of students who succeed in STEM classes.<br/><br/>The research associated with this project will increase knowledge about effective STEM education and approaches that attempt to reduce barriers to adoption of Peer Instruction.

Since non-scientists regularly communicate about science topics and use scientific information for daily decision-making, it is crucial that they are both scientifically literate and able to effectively communicate. While the field of science communication has made great strides in identifying effective and ineffective communication strategies, additional tools to effectively train and evaluate students are needed. This project will develop an instrument to evaluate non-biology major student knowledge, value, and capacity to engage in science communication. <br/><br/>Drawing on expectancy-value theory, established processes will be utilized to collect validity evidence, including conducting cognitive interviews and confirmatory factor analyses. The instrument will then be used to evaluate a new training in science communication, which will identify key concepts and priorities. Within this project, the training will be implemented in the context of an issues-based introductory biology course for non-majors, where key concepts will be taught in the context of real-world issues and examples. In this class, students will not only learn about biology, but will learn why biology is important in their lives. Student interviews will be conducted to identify any shifts in perception of covered topics and how students value the role of science and science communication in their lives. By helping students better connect to and understand science topics, while also helping them learn to communicate effectively about what they know, this project seeks to create a more informed and engaged society that is able to make decisions on scientific topics.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF?s STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) Program.

At the neural level, many perceptual regions in the brain do not necessarily respond the same way to the same stimuli-activity depends on both the stimulus and on task goals. The ability to focus on task-relevant features and thereby change activity in the brain is called top-down attention. Attention is affected in many neurological disorders, including ADHD and Schizophrenia, and varies across the healthy population. Despite its importance, brain mechanisms of attention are not well understood. One hypothesis holds that a network spanning frontal and parietal cortex supports task-general functions including attention and accumulating or weighing evidence. However, parts of this network respond to visual features of stimuli including motion and shape, and the dual influence of task and stimulus are seldom studied in the same experiments. The goal of this project is to integrate these findings into a coherent computational model. Instead of trying to attribute one function to each parcel of the brain, the researchers aim to quantify the degree to which brain responses across the brain vary with the stimulus, with the cognitive components of the task, and/or with task difficulty. The central aim of the research is to determine the degree to which different tasks change the pattern of activity within and across brain regions. The broader impacts include plans to widen the opportunities for undergraduates to develop computer and data science skills through course development and communication.  There are also plans to recruit students from historically underrepresented groups to participate in the research.<br/><br/>The project seeks answers to these questions in a cumulative series of behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. Participants view moving stimuli on which they perform different visual tasks while their brains are measured with fMRI. For example, they judge whether one object will collide with another object or whether the participant (proxied by the point of view of the camera) will collide with a static object. These tasks serve as an experimental proxy for many natural tasks. For example, driving, walking, and many sports involve estimating one?s own motion relative to static obstacles and moving objects. Importantly, among stimulus-based factors, self-motion is a particularly strong influence on responses in many areas also driven by task-related factors. The project aims to analyze the data using cutting-edge encoding models based on labels for task conditions and motion parameters derived from deep neural networks. Models are compared with variance partitioning, which assesses the relative effect of each factor on brain responses. The models developed in this project can provide a detailed quantitative baseline that enables sensitive measurement of individual differences in attention and task processing in future studies. Finally, since the analytic approach of this project is computationally intensive, another aim is to improve data science education at University of Nevada Reno by developing and teaching an introductory applied research computing course. This course is also intended to teach the ?hidden curriculum? of research computing, including use of the command line, version control, and dependency management. The aim is to help build a community of practice in data science at both graduate and undergraduate levels.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Cognitive Neuroscience and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Imagine getting into the car to drive to a new office. If one is not careful, one might drive the familiar route to the old office instead. Getting to the new workplace requires focusing attention to resolve the conflict between the older automatic responses (e.g., turn right at the first traffic light) and the new, more appropriate goal-directed response (turn left instead). The ability to resolve this conflict has been a focus of many researchers for decades, as it is an ability that is fundamental to human cognition and its dysfunction has been associated with many brain disorders (e.g., ADHD, dementia, depression). To further the understanding of conflict resolution, this project proposes a novel combination of behavioral methods, computational modeling, neuroimaging, and non-invasive brain stimulation. Rather than allowing participants to respond at any point in time, the planned method forces participants to respond at varying times during conflict resolution to interrogate the time course of how conflict is resolved. The project also plans to include undergraduates in research, including those from historically underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The study of conflict resolution has historically relied on analyses of participants? free response times (RT) in classic cognitive control tasks such as the Stroop, Simon, and Flanker tasks. Although this approach has yielded valuable insights, researchers have recently identified critical limitations with using free RT that have led to an impasse in the understanding of the nature of conflict resolution and its underlying neural mechanisms.  The project seeks to address these limitations by combining a forced-response method that generates speed-accuracy tradeoff functions for each participant with a computational model of the response preparation process underlying automatic and goal-directed responding. This project is composed of four research aims: 1) Validate the response preparation model with physiological responses at the muscle using electromyography; 2) Compare the response preparation model against prior sequential sampling models used for conflict tasks; 3) Combine computational modeling with functional neuroimaging (fMRI) and non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) to assess the causal role of lateral prefrontal cortex in conflict resolution; 4) Assess the generality of the conflict-resolution mechanism across tasks with TMS and the response preparation model.  Overall, the results from this project have the potential to deepen our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying conflict resolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PreTeXt-Runestone: Open Textbooks Engaging Undergraduates in STEM project advances our understanding of users' engagement with interactive features embedded in electronic textbooks by describing how such use supports teaching and learning. The project seeks answers to two interrelated questions: 1) How do groups of textbook users (students, teachers, authors, and researchers) work together to write interactive textbook questions designed to elicit multiple ways of students' thinking in classrooms? and 2) How do students and instructors use those interactive textbook questions in real classrooms? The project focuses on open-source PreTeXt textbooks hosted in the learning analytics platform, Runestone Academy. The project addresses the important need to promote student learning through continued engagement with the material they are learning and to provide tools for teachers to engage with the information gathered using those questions - not only their responses but also the various attempts to answer the questions.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to study the design and classroom use of three types of interactive textbook questions, Matching Exercises, Parsons Problems, and Reading Questions. The questions will be added to four widely used interactive textbooks in calculus and linear algebra. Through three design-based research cycles, the project will document the process (strategies and heuristics) through which four Student-Teacher-Author-Researcher development teams create questions that target core mathematical notions or skills tailored to each textbook and that make evident patterns of reasoning among students. Each cycle will include the development, integration, use, and evaluation of the questions in actual classrooms, with each iteration widening the scope of the project, with eight courses in the first cycle, 24 courses in the second cycle, and 40 courses in the third cycle for an estimated total of 72 instructors and at least 1200 students.

Society faces many challenging collective action problems. A broad goal of the research is ultimately to help society by contributing to the improvement of existing institutions for solving these problems. Many fundamental theoretical and empirical questions remain unresolved about how to e?ciently aggregate preferences and information in the face of individual free riding incentives, especially when side payments are not possible. There are many open questions about actual human decision making and behavior under different institutional environments. The theoretical arm of this research is aimed at better understanding the efficient aggregation of preferences and information, using an organizational design approach. The experiments provide information on actual behavior in these institutions, pointing to how they may be modified to improve decision making; and how the theory might be modified in light of behavioral findings from the experiments. The empirical research is aimed at better understanding the forces underlying voter turnout in mass elections. <br/><br/>More specifically, the theoretical research addresses specific questions about the relative performance of different organizational structures, or mechanisms, where measures of performance may include the probability of group success at overcoming the free rider problems, or, more generally, economic e?ciency. The research team first investigates these questions taking a mechanism design perspective that differs from the usual approaches to study ?public goods.? The new perspective studies honest and obedient communication mechanisms, which coordinate the actions of group members without commitment, coercion or monetary transfers. These ?Volunteer Based Organizations? (VBOs) require only very simple binary communication in which members express a willingness to either volunteer or free ride. The research goes on to explore: (1) the e?ciency properties of VBO mechanisms; (2) a ?mechanism equilibrium? when there are multiple competing groups, each of which solves collective action problems which can crowd each other out; and (3) an application of VBO mechanisms to a group-based model of voter turnout. The application to voter turnout also involves an empirical project to structurally estimate the VBO model of group turnout with a new voter-turnout dataset. The researchers then go beyond this static setting and study the dynamics of collective action problems, where individual volunteering or free riding decisions evolve sequentially over time. In many applications, for example international environmental agreements (IEAs), grass root campaigns or uprisings against authoritarian regimes, collective action evolves over time, starting with a small core of activists/volunteers. Individuals who are most willing to volunteer (lowest cost) commit earlier, which in turn can create a bandwagon e?ect inducing higher cost individuals to follow. This fosters coordination and improves e?ciency, allowing individuals in the group to be screened sequentially. Behavior in this environment can be studied as a dynamic participation game; or as a dynamic mechanism design problem if the group can design an honest and obedient mechanism that takes advantage of the dynamic structure. The research studies both approaches and then proceeds to investigate two further extensions: (1) the e?ect of size asymmetries across the group members; and (2) the e?ect of non-stationarities, reflecting changes in the value of group success or costs of participation as time unfolds. The third arm of the research is experimental and involves four laboratory experiments and one large-scale online experiment. Three of the laboratory experiments are directly motivated by the static model of VBOs; the fourth is motivated by the dynamic theory. The large-scale online experiment explores group sizes an order of magnitude large than is possible in the laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With limited access to guidance counselors, particularly in schools serving large minority populations, students often struggle to navigate the complex college preparation, admissions, and financial aid processes. By leveraging the power of gaming technology, this project aims to engage and educate youth about college-going habits and persistence strategies during their recreational gaming time. The innovative gaming system will provide a cost-effective solution to supplement the limited resources available for college counseling at under-resourced middle and high schools. The technology has the potential to become a key factor in the commercial success of the company, with school districts being the initial target market. This initiative not only enhances scientific and technological understanding but also addresses a significant societal challenge by promoting educational equity and increasing access to higher education for underserved communities. Ultimately, this project aligns with NSF's mission to advance national prosperity and welfare by empowering students with the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue post-secondary education and contribute to the nation's workforce.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to shift the college-going culture at under-resourced middle and high schools by developing an innovative video game that educates and prepares students for the college application process. The research objectives are to measure students' knowledge acquisition about college admissions criteria, deadlines, acceptance and enrollment processes, and financial aid options as they progress through the game's levels. The proposed research involves validating and refining the instruments and measures developed during the pilot phase to assess students' readiness based on their performance at each level. The anticipated technical results include a comprehensive set of reliable and valid measures that will enable schools and stakeholders to identify and address students' knowledge gaps, ultimately strengthening their pathways to college. This project is particularly crucial for underrepresented students who often face significant barriers during the college application process.

Numerical analysts develop algorithms for simulating these systems by solving PDEs on a computer; these simulations enable engineers and scientists to develop prototypes and to interpret data from sensors. For example, the NSF-funded Nobel-winning detection of gravitational waves would not have been possible without advances in numerical analysis. In recent decades, numerical analysts discovered that ideas from differential geometry, an area of pure mathematics, can be used to develop good algorithms for solving PDEs. In fact, these ideas help not only for geometric problems in fields of study like computer vision and general relativity, but also for fields like electromagnetism that have little to do with geometry. Although applying differential geometry to numerical analysis has been very successful, thus far this link has been explored only for a small number of differential geometry ideas. In this project, the investigators will continue exploring this link, taking more ideas from differential geometry and applying them to develop new numerical algorithms. These algorithms could then be used both in applied areas, by solving PDEs in science and engineering, and in pure areas, by solving PDEs in differential geometry itself. The project will also support the training of graduate student researchers.<br/><br/>This project focuses on problems at the cusp of numerical analysis and differential geometry.  It deals specifically with the design of finite element methods for PDEs that involve vector fields and tensor fields on Riemannian manifolds.  In the long term, these efforts have the potential to lead to robust numerical methods for solving geometric PDEs like the Einstein field equations, which are useful for studying gravitational wave signals, as well as PDEs like the elasticity equations, which model how objects deform under stress. This project has three main goals. The first is to develop a new family of finite elements for discretizing algebraic curvature tensors and other bi-forms---tensor products of differential forms---on simplicial triangulations. The second goal is to develop an intrinsic finite element discretization of the Bochner Laplacian, which is a basic differential operator in Riemannian geometry that differs from the familiar Hodge Laplacian from finite element exterior calculus. The third goal is to leverage what we learn to design numerical methods for a wide range of geometric problems, such as computing spectra of elliptic operators on manifolds, simulating intrinsic geometric flows, and solving prescribed curvature problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peer+ will add two new ways for students to discuss the question with their peers through (1) a text-chat for answering questions during lecture, and (2) a pseudo text-chat for answering questions after lecture. While there is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of Peer Instruction, preliminary research at the University of Michigan has found that using text-chat during lectures improved learning.

This project builds upon an attacker framework to extract unique memory-contention-based signatures of victim applications. New profiling and analysis techniques are developed to capture non-linear memory access characteristics of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads. The signatures are then used to create reverse-engineering, information extraction and denial-of-service based attacks. Finally, various countermeasures at architecture- and system-level are developed against the new attacks.

The proposed RF probe acts as point transmitter and has a very small form factor (cross section area less than one square millimeter) fed by an optical fiber and thus is electromagnetically non-invasive.  This pioneering technology enables the comprehensive assessment of the electromagnetic response of any receiving system to highly localized applied electric fields, marking the inaugural demonstration of a method capable of experimentally measuring the electromagnetic Green's function of receiver systems. The ability to experimentally measure a system's Green's function would represent a fundamental shift in electromagnetic measurements and characterization, unlocking a multitude of possibilities that were previously cumbersome or unattainable. The proposed probe heralds a new era of experimentation, facilitating endeavors such as: i) Precision measurement of antennas' receiving radiation patterns under any arbitrary incident field, whether in the near- or far-field regions; ii) Identification and localization of manufacturing defects and malfunctioning elements within extensive phased arrays and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, streamlining diagnostics and maintenance; iii) Thorough characterization of electromagnetic interference and compatibility (EMI/EMC) in microwave and millimeter-wave integrated circuits (MMICs) and systems-on-chip (SOCs) with micron-level resolution, enhancing overall system reliability and performance; and iv) Investigation into the effects of RF and microwave radiation on biological tissues, offering high selectivity for applications such as cancer treatment, RF ablation, microwave hyperthermia, and RF dosimetry, thereby advancing medical science and therapy techniques. These examples underscore the broad spectrum of applications and the transformative potential of the proposed probe technology, paving the way for unprecedented advancements in electromagnetic research, engineering, and healthcare.<br/><br/>By strategically maneuvering the localized transmitting probe across the target receiving system and recording receiver output at each excitation point, the system's response to any desired applied electric field can be fully characterized. Comprising three integral subsystems, the proposed measurement probe encompasses an optical modulator and optical fiber to convert the applied RF signal into an intensity-modulated laser light source. At the probe's tip, a series of photo-voltaic cells generate a high reverse bias voltage when illuminated by the optical signal, while an RF avalanche photodiode, also housed within the tip, demodulates the optical signal under the reverse bias from the photovoltaic cells. This process generates a highly localized, robust RF electric field across a miniaturized metallic dipole. Fabricated on a standard 65-nm bulk CMOS process, the probe confines the electric field to an area of 100 m  100 m, achieving field intensities on the order of 10 kV/m. Remarkably versatile, a single probe is capable of measuring system responses from zero to 12 GHz with arbitrary polarization, enhancing its utility across a spectrum of applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A truly accessible interactive Web learning experience requires the expansion of input modalities (beyond the mouse or touch-based events) and output modalities (beyond visual representations and sound effects) to include a broad palette of multimodal features that match the full span of human diversity. In 2023, the PhET Interactive Simulations project at the University of Colorado Boulder launched SceneryStack, an open-source solution for creating accessible Web-based interactive media, such as interactive graphics, simulations, and games. SceneryStack consists of powerful software code libraries and design patterns, with dynamic visual, auditory, and haptic displays and diverse input capabilities. Vast multimodal capabilities available in one coordinated software development framework create new pathways for unprecedented accessibility, creativity, and innovation through Web-based media.  <br/><br/>This POSE Phase II project focuses on expanding the SceneryStack community, improving documentation and onboarding processes, and enacting inclusive governance practices. Through strategic partnerships, community events, and a focus on sustainability, this project fosters a robust ecosystem of developers, educators, and researchers.

The processes that form and shape the chemical and physical properties of the rocks beneath the seafloor are different from those associated with the rapid and voluminous volcanism generated during the creation of large undersea volcanoes and ocean-islands. While many aspects of these processes are well understood, questions remain about the details and causes of the boundary between the stiff rocks (lithosphere) and the weak interior (asthenosphere). It is still unclear how the uplift and emergence of large oceanic plateaus and ocean islands is related to deep volcanism or shallow thermal cracking. These questions will be investigated by using machine learning to image the subsurface of the largest ocean-basin using existing seismic data. Pacific-wide imaging using ground vibrations is expensive and challenging. The seafloor is sparsely instrumented and the data noisy. Artificially intelligent algorithms will be trained to extract useful information from noisy seismic data, and the signals will be used to reconstruct 3D wave speed images of ocean interior. The improved resolution of the ocean subsurface informs tests of models explaining ocean plate genesis and evolution. Students will be recruited and trained using project-based courses that prepare them for research careers in academia and industry using state-of-the-art tools and resources. The educational plan includes two new project-based courses: ?Seismic Signals & Noise? and ?Earth Imaging and Machine Learning,? which closely integrate with the research questions and provide learning and research experience for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Multi-scale deep probabilistic seismic imaging is the process of reconstructing ?uncertainty-aware? images of a planet?s interior by stitching together wave signals extracted from sparse and noisy ground-vibration data (earthquake and ambient noise body-waves and surface waves) using sensor arrays with different space-time footprints (small and large aperture as well as short and long duration deployments). This approach uses artificially intelligent machine learning algorithms to solve data and model prediction steps in the image reconstruction problem. Step 1, cleaner signals: improved wave detection by denoising the long-period (SS, PP) and short-period teleseismic body-wavefield (Ps- and Sp-RFs). Step 2, improved images: joint modeling of the waves through a realistic and adjustable 3-D mesh takes advantage of waves propagating with different sensitivities. Step 3, fast reconstruction with errors: a probabilistic inverse modeling generates a large ensemble of models from which uncertainties can be estimated. This framework requires that many images are generated in step 2 and the process iterated. Again, intelligent algorithms, such as generative AI, are used to speed up, learn, and compress the model ensemble. The software and algorithms developed will contribute to the exploration of planetary interiors in situations where data is often sparse and noisy.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Geophysics program and Education and Human Resources Program in the Division of Earth Sciences and the Marine Geology and Geophysics program in the Division of Ocean Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Imagine plants as resilient heroes that encounter and overcome challenges associated with a dynamic landscape that may include changes in temperature and light levels and the presence of herbivores. A highly reactive class of compounds, reactive oxygen species (ROS), serves as alert signals, triggering plants to activate defense mechanisms. By deciphering how plants interpret and react to these stress signals at the level of protein synthesis, we can potentially develop better strategies for enhancing crop resilience to environmental pressures, ultimately contributing to sustainable agriculture. Beyond its scientific significance, this research endeavor creates opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds to engage in scientific exploration. Through tailored educational programs and hands-on workshops for high school students and educators, the project not only sparks curiosity but also highlights the captivating intricacies of plant stress responses. By igniting passion for science and promoting inclusivity, the project aims to inspire future generations of scientists while fostering diversity in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>This project investigates the mechanisms by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate the highly conserved protein kinase, General Control of Nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), in Arabidopsis thaliana. GCN2 plays a crucial role in regulating protein synthesis (translational control), a fundamental process in all organisms, by phosphorylating the translation initiation factor, eIF2alpha. Despite the well-documented involvement of GCN2 in a wide variety of stress responses, the precise mechanisms of its activation in plants remain elusive. Building upon our previous findings that link ROS accumulation to rapid GCN2 activation, this study aims to elucidate the biochemical pathways mediating ROS-GCN2 signaling. The project involves in vitro and ex vivo kinase assays coupled with advanced proteomics techniques to dissect the mode of ROS-mediated GCN2 activation. Furthermore, genome-wide analyses of mRNA-ribosome loading will be employed to discern the specific impact of GCN2-eIF2alpha signaling on translation control under ROS stress. These investigations will enhance our understanding of plant stress responses and contribute to broader knowledge in translational control mechanisms in plants, as well as across all eukaryotes. Additionally, the project's broader impacts include initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in STEM education, providing valuable training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and engaging local high school educators and their students in hands-on STEM activities.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Division of Biological Infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They often present significant challenges for many existing classes of algorithms due to the presence of multiple suboptimal, undesirable solutions. The methods emerging from this project will circumvent some of these challenges due to their ability of bypassing more efficiently suboptimal solutions using a novel set of techniques. They will contribute to the numerical solution of non-convex optimization problems that can be found in a very wide range of applications, such as computer-aided design (shape and topology optimization), radiation therapy, optimization of manufacturing processes, inverse problems, optimal control of partial differential equations, statistics, and artificial intelligence. Open software will be shared with the community in order to facilitate the reproducibility of the results. One summer undergraduate student and one graduate student will benefit from training in areas that are relevant to topics of current interest to both academia and industry. Special attention will be given to the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The project is centered around developing and analyzing a novel class of first order methods for solving optimization problems, called low-rank-gradient-flow (LRGF). The idea behind the method consists of developing, at each step, quadratic surrogates with low-rank Hessian, and computing analytically the gradient flow on that surrogate. The step will conclude with a line search along the curvilinear gradient flow, with the purpose of finding a point satisfying the Wolfe conditions. Convergence will be accelerated using a multilevel approach based on reduced order models. The convergence properties of the method will be studied, addressing both questions related to global convergence, efficient construction of low-rank models, as well as convergence rates. The method will be applied to maximum likelihood estimation, optimization of hyperbolic partial differential equations, and training of deep neural networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to following simple decision rules across all contexts, these guesses can support flexibility in people?s decision-making, allowing them to use cues in the environment to tune their behavior to interactions with different people. At the same time, when whole collections of decision-makers use similar cues to make similar guesses about others, this can perpetuate disparities in treatment across different social groups. This project aims to generate new scientific understanding of flexible human social decision-making, with implications for understanding social disparities. The plan is to combine methods from psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics to generate predictions of complex social behaviors and to test hypotheses about the neural circuitry that underlies them. This project aims to take a step toward a comprehensive framework that incorporates more of the richness and complexity of the social world into quantitative models of human behavior, advancing efforts in the fields of behavioral economics, social cognition, and decision neuroscience. In turn, it has the potential to generate new understanding of the origins of disparate treatment. Additional goals are to: 1) support the development of a diverse STEM workforce through initiatives aiming to lower barriers to success in the mind and brain sciences, 2) increase public engagement with neuroscience research, and 3) train students in computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, as well as broadly appliable data science techniques.<br/><br/>The broad aims of this project are to: 1) incorporate more of the psychological richness of the human social world into formal computational models of behavior, and 2) use those models to test hypotheses about the cognitive mechanisms and neural circuitry that give rise to social decisions. More specifically, the research plan includes studies that integrate information about social perception (how people see others) into computational models from behavioral economics and cognitive psychology that make predictions about how people value others? outcomes (social valuation), value outcomes at different times (temporal discounting), learn about rewards (reinforcement learning), and value information (information seeking).  The plan is to use information from these computational models with fMRI to better understand the neural basis of decisions in social contexts, with a focus on brain regions involved in social cognition and valuation. These research efforts synergize with educational and outreach initiatives to develop equitable assessment tools, engage the local community on neuroscience topics, and provide students with science mentorship, professional development, and training in broadly applicable statistical and computational modeling techniques. The research plan aims to contribute to a more widely applicable framework capable of making better predictions of human behavior in social contexts, and the results of the research should increase our understanding of specific social decisions, how people value others, and the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing literature on the effects of transitional justice is inconclusive; such work is divided between micro-level, single-country studies and macro-level, cross-country studies as well as between studies of post-authoritarian and post-conflict contexts. By collecting comparable survey measures across three countries that vary along several theoretically relevant dimensions and by building a cross-national dataset, this project will bridge these gaps. Further, the researchers will develop and test a novel theory about how public attitudes mediate the relationship between transitional justice institutions and long-run outcomes. Given the widespread use of transitional justice in post-conflict and post-authoritarian countries as well as democracies around the world, there is an urgent need for the field of transitional justice studies to develop a stronger base of evidence for policymaking. This project will shed light on which forms of transitional justice effectively promote peace, democracy, justice, and reconciliation as well as provide insights into how countries? unique histories may shape the impact of transitional justice there.<br/><br/>This project will investigate three questions. First, which kinds of transitional justice do people see as more legitimate? Second, how do people?s perceptions of the legitimacy of transitional justice institutions affect their broader political attitudes concerning the government, principles of democracy and autocracy, and out-groups? Third, do transitional justice institutions perceived as more legitimate contribute to peace and democracy following conflict? To address these questions, the research team will draw on their extensive thematic, regional, and methodological expertise to employ a mixed-methods research design which combines survey experiments in Colombia, Iraq, and Ukraine; qualitative evidence collected from focus groups and elite interviews in the same countries; and original cross-national data. This approach will leverage the strengths of  diverse methodologies by combining (A) micro-level survey and qualitative data that will enable the investigators to assess the effects of varying transitional justice processes on individual attitudes with (B) macro-level cross-national data that will provide insight into the effects of institutions and historical context on national-level outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work will investigate whether the EEJ weakens or strengthens during substorms. Successful completion of this project will not only resolve this controversy but will also significantly improve our overall understanding of the global current circuit. Understanding how the upper atmosphere at the auroral region couples with that at low latitudes is a crucial step for ensuring space weather awareness and mitigating the harmful effects of geomagnetic perturbations on technology, such as power grids, satellites, and communications.<br/><br/>The investigators will address the questions related to the spatiotemporal characteristics of the EEJ and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions during substorms. These are: (i.) How does the EEJ response to substorms vary with longitude, local time, season, and solar flux? (ii.) How do substorm duration, intensity, onset time, and IMF conditions affect the EEJ response? The methodology hinges on observational data and robust statistical analysis, leveraging NSF-supported projects, the SuperMAG network, and the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO). Based on four well-known substorm lists, the research team intends to examine events during geomagnetic quiet periods and quasi-steady IMF conditions. These stringent criteria allow them to isolate the sole substorm effect and exclude unconnected factors like IMF variations known to impact the EEJ. The resulting magnetic field perturbations will be assessed using a well-established approach based on a pair of magnetometers, one positioned within 3 of the dip equator and the other at an offset location (6-10). They will assess the related electric field variations via vertical ion drift measurements from the incoherent and coherent scatter radars at the JRO. The success of our proposal is sustained by the wealth of data and the expertise of the team. The investigation will provide new insights into the influence of EEJ response to substorms, thus providing new perspectives on how the electric fields penetrate from high to low latitudes, improving their understanding of the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system, and supplying essential parameters for future simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, also known as internet-of-things (IoT), are growing rapidly. These include wearables for health monitoring, video surveillance, manufacturing, and tracking devices. M2M devices are estimated to have reached 14.7 billion in 2023 with a staggering 4.4 billion being mobile. The M2M is the fastest growing mobile category -- even faster than smartphone category. One of the biggest questions related to this growth is: How will mobile M2M devices be powered in the future? There is currently no solid technological solution to address the power needs for mobile IoT devices. The objective of this project is to explore and study an innovative solution to power future mobile M2M devices. The proposed innovative microsystem enables wireless power transfer missions to sensors (chemical, physical or biological) in remote regions operating under low- or no-power conditions. The microsystem is comprised of an antenna array integrated with a resonator on one substrate. Therefore, the device offers a unique platform for studying the direct coupling of electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Two types of sensing mechanisms are made possible with the new microsystem. 1) IoT sensing powered by RF energy harvester: Examples include intruder detection, inventory tracking, wearables, and monitoring patients. 2) Direct detection using on-board antenna or resonator: Examples include angle of arrival measurement, wireless sensor networks, radar, and remote sensing. <br/><br/>Enabled by direct coupling of an antenna array with a resonant piezoelectric transformer (RPT), the new microsystem architecture pursued in this project will potentially replace the rectifying antennas (rectennas) that have dominated the RF energy harvesting research landscape for more than 50 years but still have not achieved high efficiency at low RF input power range (less than ?30 dBm or 1 microwatt). On the other hand, advances in micro- and nano-mechanical devices, have resulted in the realization of high-Q acoustic resonators (Q>1000) operating in the 1-10 GHz frequency band. As opposed to a conventional rectenna architecture in which an antenna is coupled to rectifying diodes, in the proposed architecture, energy is coupled from the electromagnetic domain to the mechanical domain using an antenna array, transmission line, and an array of high-Q RPT. The new microsystem will be the first demonstration of direct coupling of electromagnetic energy into the mechanical domain for energy harvesting purposes. Once the energy is transferred efficiently from free space to a resonator, it is processed in the mechanical domain for unique advantages. Specifically, high passive voltage gain (on the order of 100) can be achieved using resonators of high electromechanical coupling coefficient. As a result of this voltage amplification, RF rectifying diodes are properly biased at higher voltage to operate efficiently. Therefore, RF energy harvesting with high efficiency under low power condition can be achieved. In addition, it can lead to energy conversion in a wide frequency band by coupling two or more efficient RPTs with asymmetric ports that result in a transformer filter with a significant boost in the output voltage to enable much higher efficiency in RF rectifying diodes placed after the RPT transformer filter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be accomplished by 1) documenting and disseminating models of successful introductory physics sequences designed for students with varying levels of math preparation, 2) evaluating the effectiveness of redesigned introductory physics sequences, and 3) developing curricular materials that focus on quantitative literacy in physics contexts that can be easily adapted in introductory physics courses of various styles. The goals of this project align with the vision of NSF INCLUDES to innovate and facilitate collaborative approaches to broaden participation in STEM. The Alliance will collaborate with and build upon the efforts of the NSF INCLUDES STEM CORE Alliance and the NSF INCLUDES PUSH Alliance to mitigate the impact of math preparation as a barrier to entering and succeeding in STEM courses.<br/><br/>The Physics TIPS Network leverages the work of researchers and instructors at three universities that have successfully modified/developed a new introductory physics sequence to support students at all levels of math readiness. These courses reduce mathematics requirements, incorporate quantitative literacy, and offer additional contact hours to support integration of physics and math content. To better understand these existing efforts, project members will conduct a mixed methods study investigating the efficacy of the alternative introductory sequence. The quantitative aspects of the study include descriptive statistics (DWF rate comparison between traditional and transformed sequences), analysis of course performance in sophomore/junior courses (a t-test comparison between students who took the traditional sequence and those who took the transformed sequence), and a two-way ANOVA to determine the success rate for first generation college students versus those that are not first generation college students (as determined by degree completion and type). Qualitative inquiry will investigate student experiences in the transformed sequences, engineering identity after taking the transformed courses, and reflections on the course experience post-graduation. To expand efforts already determined to be successful, this project includes implementation of similar courses within 3 additional physics departments and the development of curricular materials to support quantitative literacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deciphering the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the construction of the forebrain is central to our understanding the development of the central nervous system (CNS) and how the vertebrate brain has evolved. Zebrafish represent a tractable animal to study brain development. Hundreds of externally developing zebrafish embryos are easily obtained, the essential stages of embryonic brain development are completed over 1-2 days, and many genetic techniques are available that enable highly sophisticated microscopy to monitor live zebrafish brains developing over time. This proposal uses the zebrafish to determine whether a transient population of migrating stem cells, known as ?neural crest cells,? directly influences the birth of neurons and establishment of neural connections in the early embryonic forebrain. Neural crest cells are well-known to migrate away from the early forming CNS and contribute to a diversity of tissues, but they are not known to contribute directly to the CNS. This proposal challenges this notation and plans to innovatively employ light-sheet microscopy to record the migratory behaviors of neural crest cells to and within the zebrafish forebrain during commissure formation. Such findings would be paradigm shifting and have a significant impact on our understanding of brain development. The broader impacts activities include fostering collaborations between two different scientific disciplines (developmental and computational biology), new course development, and engaging the public in science communication through a new traveling art show. <br/><br/>The importance of neural crest cells to building the peripheral nervous system, supporting glandular and pigment development, and sculpting the craniofacial skeleton among other roles cannot be understated. Despite this long history of studying the role of neural crest in the development of tissues outside the central nervous system (CNS), their function on the development of the brain itself has been largely overlooked. This proposal hypothesizes that cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) navigate to and pattern commissure formation and neurogenesis in the zebrafish forebrain. The proposal takes advantage of the zebrafish model system to track CNCC migration to the forebrain and test their requirement for forebrain patterning and commissure formation. It will use complementary fate mapping approaches to determine if CNCCs do in fact migrate with pathfinding commissural axons and enter the telencephalon where they directly contribute to neurogenesis. Such findings would be both significant and novel as this would be the first demonstration that CNCCs directly influence axon pathfinding in the CNS, and that they may migrate back into the brain to directly support CNS neurogenesis. The proposal will also interrogate the role radial glia play in restricting most CNCCs from entering the brain. A mechanism of migrating CNCCs transiently influencing the brain in diverse ways would have significant broader impacts on our understanding of CNS development. Additional broader impact activities include development of a neurodevelopment course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) course, fostering collaborations with computational and data scientists, and a traveling art show to engage the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent discoveries have shown that events occurring in early life can impact adult stem cell function many years later. This project will test whether specific early-life events ? mediated by diet or growth/metabolic signaling pathways ? can influence blood stem cell function years later. This question will be addressed by combining stem cell transplantation and sequencing experiments in mice with new mathematical models to predict the dynamics of stem cell populations over time. By jointly measuring the expression of genes and the epigenetic marks present on the DNA of single cells, it will be possible to test the hypothesis that early life events induce a stem cell ?memory? that persists throughout life. If such an effect is found, the investigators will test whether it is possible to reverse it by exposing stem cells to specific molecular factors to partially reprogram the cells to a state in which the effects of early-life signals are erased. The investigators expect the results to provide a proof-of-concept that stem cell memory impacts the selection of stem cell subpopulations during life. These findings will impact our understanding of cell signaling more generally and stem cell memory across other organs and development systems. This multidisciplinary study will also offer diverse training and educational opportunities for students in a variety of settings ranging from K-12 classrooms to medical school.<br/><br/>The maintenance of the blood system throughout life is controlled by an intricate combination of cell-autonomous and extrinsic mechanisms in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Throughout life, HSCs undergo somatic evolution and selection of subpopulations of HSCs occurs. This project will investigate the role of growth signaling in early life and its impact on HSCs by analyzing the influence of early life IGF/growth signals on the installment of epigenetic memory and the selection of molecularly defined subpopulations of HSCs during adult life. HSC transplantation studies will be used to study HSCs perturbed in early life and then implanted into non-perturbed niches (or vice versa) to investigate the extent to which HSC-intrinsic memory effects vs. extrinsic (i.e. niche/systemic effects) dominate stem cell dynamics throughout life. HSC subpopulation selection will be assessed using time-course single cell sequencing analyses of genetic mouse models and dietary interventions that change IGF/growth-signaling during development. Mathematical models will be developed to study how dynamic transcriptional networks change in HSCs of adult mice in response to transient perturbations in developmental growth signals. Finally, transient induction of pluripotency factors (partial reprogramming) will be employed to test whether it is possible to revert memory effects of developmental IGF/growth signaling and whether this would ameliorate developmental influences on epigenetic memory, transcriptional changes, and the selection of molecularly defined HSC subpopulation during adult life.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/German project is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) where NSF funds the US investigator and DFG funds the German partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project analyzes ancient goosefoot seeds which were recovered from archaeological sites. The student will also study current day modern wild populations of the species. This research addresses not only locally specific questions about the original domestication process, but also serves as a case study for assessing how annual plants that exhibit plasticity (flexibility in growth and development) are domesticated. Recently, there have been discussions about the possibility of bringing goosefoot back as a crop or using it to genetically fortify quinoa, which could lead to a new variety of plants resilient to climate change challenges. At a theoretical level multi-disciplinary analysis will speak to broader disciplines concerned with plant domestication and evolutionary theory.<br/><br/>New findings about the variability of seeds produced by modern, wild goosefoot populations complicates current theories about goosefoot domestication. Recent research establishes that variability in seed coat thickness of wild goosefoot is more common than previously assumed, and this is a key trait for understanding domestication of annual seed crops. This project is reframing the current narrative of goosefoot domestication by reanalyzing ancient goosefoot assemblages using the framework of adaptive transgenerational plasticity: the idea that parent plants can shape characteristics of their seeds in response to the environment, providing them with better odds of survival. The researchers are also studying the size and shape of ancient goosefoot seeds from several regions to understand if there were distinct local varieties of goosefoot in ancient times. They examine the size and shape of modern, wild goosefoot seeds for comparison, and collect seeds for future growth experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Making sure they operate safely, however, remains challenging. RAS code is often messy, and the real world in which these systems operate is complex and unpredictable. This research project focuses on creating a family of methods to find faults in these sophisticated systems by analyzing: 1) the program artifacts they are built from to extract models that can be more easily checked for faults, and 2) the real-world data they encounter (like images taken by cameras) to determine what portions of the environment are worth simulating more accurately. If successful, the research findings will inform solutions to challenges faced in the development of RAS, affording a path to improving public safety. The research will be integrated into educational curriculum and training. <br/><br/>The key insights enabling the project are two-fold.  First, although robotics code is often messy and complex, model-relevant behavior is typically implemented via a subset of application programming interfaces and configuration files with clearly-specifiable semantics. Second, field data encodes key spatial-temporal physical constraints imposed by the real world, which provides hints on how to steer simulation to reduce the gap with reality. The investigators will leverage these insights to effectively lift useful models from real code to detect compositional faults, identify and construct simulation scenarios that capture constraints imposed by the real world, and inform and validate the evolution of robotic systems.   The proposed work will produce: 1) Techniques to infer rich behavior models with physical attributes from RAS code and artifacts, and to check those models against component and system properties; 2) Techniques to infer specifications from messy real-world  data, to contrast those specifications against simulation states, and to synthesize missing simulation environments; 3) Techniques to inform RAS' evolution, to understand the impact of code, physical, and world changes, and to cost-effectively correct and test changing RAS; and 4) Studies with RAS to assess the techniques, quantifying their effect on the gaps between code and models, between simulation and reality, and during evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cognitively impaired drivers place themselves and others in danger due to predictable errors in a variety of skill maneuvers compared with cognitively ?normal? drivers. In addition, older adults with late mild to early moderate Alzheimer?s disease and Alzheimer?s disease-related dementias may have an unrecognized lack of self-regulation to accurately self-assess driving risk. To address this challenge, this technology is designed to provide a rapid and objective way to quantify the predictive cognitive risk of driving. The technology will support autonomy and avert Alzheimer?s disease-related dementias driving-related incidents and potential tragedies and property losses. The prevention of cognitively impaired driving may benefit family caregivers of those with Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias, commercial and mass transportation, and those who are cognitively impaired due to illicit drugs not detectable by breathalyzer technologies.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an adaptive cognitive driving risk device to prevent driving and prompt mitigation strategies if cognitive driving risk is detected.  This artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology allows the identification of the least number of tests from seven neurocognitive domains to predict cognitively-at-risk driving with the best accuracy. In addition, the device provides real-time, predictive assessments of cognitive driving risk to support driving autonomy along with a mechanism to halt driving for those who refuse to cease driving after being deemed cognitively unsafe by a healthcare professional. A lab prototype has established the principles for driving prevention with a failed cognitive test.

For a large percentage of the population, caffeine is known to have negative side effects, including anxiety, jitteriness, and negative effects on sleep quality. In the case of anxiety, an estimated 40MM Americans suffer from an anxiety disorder, and the consumption of caffeine in coffee, energy drinks, and other beverages is known to exacerbate stress. Paraxanthine is an active metabolite of caffeine that has similar stimulatory qualities but with potentially fewer side effects. Additionally, paraxanthine has a shorter half-life (i.e., it is cleared from the body faster) as compared to caffeine. Thus, paraxanthine may play a role in contributing to improved sleep quality and mental wellness.<br/> <br/>The proposed project aims to develop a cost-efficient, biological method to manufacture paraxanthine. Producing paraxanthine at low cost is currently a significant technical challenge. The compound is only found naturally in substantial quantities within the human body as the result of caffeine metabolism; it is not produced in plants in above trace amounts. Furthermore, synthetic methods to produce paraxanthine are complex and relatively expensive. The research goals of this Phase II project are to develop and optimize a process using an engineering enzyme to fermentatively produce paraxanthine at high yields and with high volumetric productivities. The approach seeks to employ real-time bioreactor monitoring, enabling rapid iteration of the experimental design-build-test cycle.

With the advancement of technology, there is a growing necessity for these devices to receive various types of information (like images, videos, and texts) instantly and effectively. One promising approach to achieving this is through the use of Geospatial Digital Twins (GDT), which are digital models of physical environments. GDTs are becoming increasingly important as they allow for real-time updates and interactions, making them invaluable for various applications such as monitoring, maintenance, and emergency response. Traditionally, data for GDTs has been collected through automated systems like distributed sensor devices, satellites and drones. However, these methods have limitations, especially when it comes to updating data quickly and covering hard-to-reach areas. To overcome these challenges, this project will develop a novel approach that involves the community through ?human-in-the-loop? strategies. This means using crowd-sourced data, where people provide real-time updates to digital models. This method not only promises to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of the information but also to allow discovery of new information. The project has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with and understand our physical world, potentially making this work a cornerstone for further scientific and educational advancements. The project will also play an important role in education, integrating research findings into university curricula and offering unique learning opportunities for students, including students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish an intellectual foundation for building a real-time crowd-sourced GDT.

Hyperbolic manifolds are multi-dimensional shapes for which, when one stands at any point and looks in any pair of directions, the shape looks like a saddle. While such shapes can be hard to visualize in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, they are abundant in the study of geometry and represent the simplest examples of an important phenomenon called negative curvature. In contrast to other types of shapes, hyperbolic manifolds benefit from rich connections to algebra, via an invariant called the fundamental group, and dynamics, due to the chaotic nature of certain naturally associated dynamical systems. Therefore, in the study of these manifolds, a wide array of perspectives and techniques can be employed.

Illustrative diagrams require deep domain-knowledge and extensive design work. PENROSE is a new diagram format that encodes both domain knowledge and visual design in a reusable way. The PENROSE format contains the source information of diagram design: using PENROSE, diagram authors encode domain-specific concepts and how to visually represent them in plain-text languages. The PENROSE core tools compile this format into static images, animated vector graphics, and interactive web applications. Supporting PENROSE?s expansion into a sustainable OSE would best enable broader societal impacts on education and accessibility. The development of a diverse community of users and contributors from across academic disciplines and industry areas will drive a higher number of high-quality diagrams in research papers, in classrooms, and in public-facing scientific communication efforts. In addition, PENROSE provides the best format to enable user creation of diagrams that are accessible to differently abled groups. The readable plain-text format lends itself to customization for alt text and aural feedback as well as rearranging diagram layout for language localization and color acuity. The project will employ a strategy of open communication, usable and varied forms of documentation, and a culture of highlighting contributions to encourage users. <br/><br/>This project will be used to assess the success of transitioning PENROSE transitions to an OSE in the following ways: gathering data on the nature of contributions to open-source development and diagramming in PENROSE; quantifying and characterizing PENROSE?s adoption and prevalence in published research across domains and disciplines; quantifying and characterizing the impact of PENROSE in educational settings, both for educators and learners; as well as gathering data on the effectiveness of implementations of accessibility foci. To realize the full potential of PENROSE, a standalone diagramming tool is not enough. The aim of this project is to establish a PENROSE ecosystem of open-source diagrams and to integrate PENROSE with other platforms. The primary goals for the ecosystem are to build robust infrastructure for authoring, sharing, and reusing diagrammatic contents and develop a community of expert creators that contribute open-source diagrams in the PENROSE format.

This research focuses on part of the element cycling system: where tectonic plates sink (subduct) into the Earth and heat up, driving chemical reactions among minerals. The reactions release water and other elements. These become part of the continents, atmosphere, and oceans. The research aims to determine the conditions of the reactions. Reactions involving iron, oxygen, water, and other elements affect the planet's composition, and these reactions also affect the planet's habitability. This project uses rocks from places where subducted rocks are at the Earth?s surface. It will determine the composition of two minerals: epidote and lawsonite which contain iron and water. The motivation for the research is the unexpected finding of differences in the state of iron in these minerals and the need to understand the causes and extent of this variation. Two graduate students will be involved (one PhD, one MS) at the University of Minnesota and they will collaborate with scientists in Germany, Australia, and India. The results of mineral analyses in this project add an important dimension to community geochemical datasets.<br/><br/>Lawsonite and epidote are abundant minerals in subducted oceanic crust; both are hydrous Ca-Al silicates that carry water and other elements from shallow to deep levels of the planet via subduction. Lawsonite forms under very low thermal gradient conditions and commonly transforms to epidote-group minerals (EGMs) as a result of an increase in temperature during subduction and/or exhumation. This research is based on two key observations: (1) The composition of lawsonite is a sensitive indicator of fluid sources: oxygen isotope values and trace element content (Cr, V, Sr, Pb) signal mantle (serpentinite) vs. sediment as contributors to fluids that participated in lawsonite-forming reactions; and (2) Although commonly assumed to contain only ferric iron (Fe3+), analysis using X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) has detected substantial ferrous iron (Fe2+) in lawsonite and epidote in high-pressure rocks (blueschists and eclogites), raising questions of what controls the oxidation state of Fe in subducted oceanic crust (pre-subduction rock composition or syn-subduction fluid-rock interaction), whether there are systematic changes as a function of temperature/depth, and whether Fe oxidation state correlates with indicators of fluid sources. This research addresses these questions with an investigation of lawsonite and epidote major, trace, and oxygen isotope composition and Fe oxidation state in rocks recording different pressure-temperature conditions (blueschist, eclogite) and chemical environments (proximity to serpentinite, sediments).

Furthermore, little is known about how the cell distinguishes programmed, physiologically important pauses for proper protein folding and targeting versus problematic, even pathological stalls due to translation errors. To uncover the responsible cellular pathways and molecular interactions, this project will investigate how the conserved, developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein Drg promotes protein synthesis when translating ribosomes slow down. The outcomes of this investigation will provide new insights and establish new principles for regulation of gene expression. In addition, the educational goals of the project include new curriculum development and integration of research and education with an emphasis on creating more opportunities for studnets in STEM.<br/><br/>As an ancient GTPase, Drg protein has co-evolved with the ribosome, and recent findings indicate that it can serve as a new general translation factor. To explore its role in translation, two complementary aims will be pursued in this study. Aim 1 seeks mechanistic understanding of Drg-mediated functions in bacterial and eukaryotic translation through in vitro biochemical studies of fully reconstituted translation systems from E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Translation assays will be utilized to probe the conformation of the peptidyl transferase center and to measure the kinetics of peptide bond formation, which will clarify the nature and extent to which Drg affects translation when ribosomes pause. Aim 2 seeks to uncover molecular interactions important for Drg function. APEX proximity labeling will be used to determine Drg interactomes in E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells, which will be followed by mutagenesis and biochemical studies. The findings from this study will elucidate an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which cells can regulate and fine-tune proteostasis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are numerous books on their properties and behaviors and descriptions as integrals, series, and so on.  They appear in number theory through formulas of Voronoi, Petersson and Kuznetsov.  In particular, the formula of Kuznetsov, also known as a relative trace formula, gives connections between interesting objects in analysis and algebra/geometry.  This research studies the generalizations of Kuznetsov's formula and the generalized Bessel functions that appear in such formulas, with the goal of building a body of knowledge similar to what is known about the classical Bessel functions. This will allow analytic number theorists to explore the applications of these new Kuznetsov-type formulas.  Part of the funding for the project will be used to support undergraduate and master's-level research in analytic number theory.<br/><br/>While the Kuznetsov formula for SL(2) has been the subject of intense research for the past 40 years, much less is known about its generalizations to reductive groups.  These generalizations relate the exponential sums occurring in the Fourier coefficients of Poincare series to the Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms and the integral transforms in these generalized Kuznetsov formulas can, conjecturally, be expressed as kernel integral transforms; the kernels are generalized Bessel functions.  This research aims to extend the study of Bessel functions to groups such as GL(n) and GSp(n).  The immediate goals are to study their differential equations, integral representations and give basic asymptotics of their integral transforms in low-rank groups such as GL(4) and GSp(4).  Long-term goals for the project include extending these results to arbitrary rank and applications such as the arithmetically-weighted Weyl law.  Smaller, associated projects on GL(3) include studying the Poincare series occurring in the GL(3) Fourier expansion, application of the Kuznetsov formula to the supremum norm problem as well as the relationship between vector sup norms and scalar sup norms for Maass forms with weight.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With large environmental and economic impacts, hydrilla is one of the most problematic invasive aquatic plants in the United States. Hydrilla forms dense submerged mats or canopies, which impact native habitats, hydrology, carbon cycling, and recreation. To control the spread of hydrilla, experimental herbicides will be applied to affected areas in the lower Connecticut River in summer 2024. This RAPID project will leverage these herbicide applications as a unique plant-removal experiment to better understand the effects of hydrilla on freshwater ecosystems. The overarching goal of the project is to understand how this invasive aquatic plant can alter carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emission in inland waters. This research is important for understanding the full impacts of invasive aquatic plants on ecosystem function and potential linkages between climate change and invasive aquatic plants via greenhouse gases. Findings will inform aquatic plant management.   <br/><br/>This research will explore how carbon concentrating mechanisms that help invasives like hydrilla outcompete native species can shift ecosystem-scale primary productivity from using only carbon dioxide to also using bicarbonate, a non-gaseous form of inorganic carbon.  Bicarbonate uptake by hydrilla has the potential to transfer carbon from the slow-cycling geologic pool (bicarbonate has geologic sources) to the faster-cycling biologic pool (carbon dioxide in inland waters largely comes from respiration). This study will use oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors and grab samples to compare ecosystem metabolism and carbon cycling in treated and untreated embayments. Weekly samples will be used to assess greenhouse gas emissions. Analyses will determine the extent of bicarbonate uptake by hydrilla and the cascading impacts on carbon cycling processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CREST-PRP awards recognize investigators with significant potential and support their research experiences to broaden their perspectives, facilitate interdisciplinary interactions, and prepare CREST-PRP scholars for positions of leadership within the scientific community. The research project ?CREST-PRP: Soil Arthropods as Biosensors of Environmental in Caribbean Terrestrial Coastal Ecosystems?, will examine how climate change, combined with both historical and ongoing human activities, affect Caribbean coastal ecosystems. The study will focus on soil arthropods, such as insects, spiders, centipedes, and certain crustaceans, which are crucial for several ecological functions, like assisting in forming soil, regulating water within ecosystems, and cycling nutrients, and serve as biosensors to rapidly indicate environmental changes. By studying arthropods and their responses to different environmental conditions in two distinct ecosystems within Puerto Rico's Northeastern Ecological Corridor Reserve, this study aims to understand the complex interactions between climate change, historical land use, and biodiversity, contributing to the broader understanding of how environmental changes affect soil biodiversity. The outcomes will provide information important to ecosystem management and restoration practices and policies at local, regional, and global levels aiming to foster the long-term preservation and health of our ecosystems.<br/><br/>Addressing the impacts that climate change have on critical ecosystems requires an integrated approach, especially in regions like the Caribbean, known for their significant biodiversity. Research and management approaches must consider the baseline of climatic stressors, integrating both historical and current human-induced factors within a spatiotemporal framework. This study will utilize soil arthropods' biodiversity and function as biosensors to assess the cumulative effects of climate variability, land use, and substrate biophysiochemical conditions within representative historically modified Caribbean coastal ecosystems. Organisms? reactions to changes in their environment yield essential information for assessing the health and functionality of ecosystems. Our study will investigate two distinct ecosystems within the Northeastern Ecological Corridor Reserve in Puerto Rico, a dry forest on volcanic substrate and a humid forest on sandy substrate, and will address two primary research questions: 1) How does historical land use and plant cover influence current soil organic matter?, 2) What is the impact of weather variability, substrate physico-chemistry, and plant litter cover on the abundance and richness of soil arthropod functional groups? Five sampling plots will be established in a thirty square meter area for each ecosystem, measuring substrate physico-chemistry and collecting soil samples during various weather periods.

Within the placenta, trophoblasts are the main cellular component and play several biological roles, including invasion into the endometrium to anchor the placenta and to facilitate nutrient and waste transport. The biochemical signals that regulate trophoblast function are unclear. The goal of this proposal is to better understand how the tissue microenvironment promotes cell growth and secreted extracellular vesicles within that microenvironment influence trophoblast invasiveness. Besides potentially transforming our current knowledge of factors influencing trophoblast invasion, the anticipated results may inform molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular invasion in other healthy and disease tissues. In addition, the project will build research capacity by expanding experiential research experiences and fostering didactic training at the intersection of cell biology and biomanufacturing.<br/><br/>In the placenta, there are two main types of trophoblast cells, villous and extravillous trophoblasts, that have important and distinct functions. Villous trophoblast cells are important for nutrient and waste transport, while extravillous trophoblasts facilitate host integration by invading decidualized endometrium. Both types of trophoblasts secrete extracellular vesicles called exosomes, which are thought to play an important role in cellular communication and regulating cell phenotype. The PI hypothesizes that the trophoblast environment influences invasiveness, and that this consequentially impacts exosome production and composition. To test this hypothesis, two objectives are proposed. The first objective will focus on characterizing how oxygen tension and biochemical factors influence trophoblast invasion of extracellular matrix. The second will focus on characterizing how oxygen tension and biochemical factors alter exosomal payload, which in turn alters trophoblast invasiveness. Trophoblast function within the placenta, including their invasive potential, make them an ideal candidate to study the relationship between invasion and exosome-mediated communication. While the anticipated findings will inform placental function, this research will also further knowledge on cell migration and invasion applicable to several cell types that experience similar biochemical cues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, it creates fully functional, battery-free microfliers that communicate with each other to self-organize and coordinate their descent, enabling precise deployment of wireless sensor networks over large spatial scales. Such microfliers could be transformative for large-scale distribution and automated deployment of wireless sensors across applications like environmental monitoring, disease management, and other domains which require deploying sensors across large areas. This interdisciplinary project spans origami design, low-power actuation, power-harvesting, wireless networking, localization, and distributed control and computing to create networked battery-free microfliers that can in an energy-efficient manner actuate, communicate, and coordinate their in-air descent,  achieving  targeted, large-scale sensor deployment. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary research develops a series of enabling technologies towards the goal of creating a network of microfliers that can coordinate their deployment. This includes novel designs of the origami structures, sensors, actuators, and power harvesting that allow microfliers to change their shape and examine how these changes affect their flight dynamics. The research develops techniques for  fine-grained control over the microfliers' fall behavior in mid-air, enabling a new capability for modulated descent that balances between power-intensive flight and passive falling. Additionally, the project develops novel methods that enable fliers to navigate in controlled directions and localize their 3D positions in a power-efficient manner. The research team develops battery-free distributed networking protocols that enable the microfliers to communicate with each other during flight.

In such systems, applications running on different processors store their data on a single shared memory. This project uncovers certain security vulnerabilities that mobile systems with shared memories possess. Leveraging these vulnerabilities, a malicious party could circumvent existing protection mechanisms and extract sensitive information by monitoring data access patterns.  The research will develop a framework to better understand potential attacks and investigate several protection mechanisms. Broader comprehension and mitigation of these attacks hold crucial importance in protecting intellectual property and user privacy in mobile devices. The award contributes to enabling a more secure operation of billions of mobile devices used daily around the globe. <br/><br/>This project investigates a critical side-channel leakage mechanism based on the memory-access contention occurring when multiple applications execute together in a multi-processor system with shared memory. An adversary could exploit this leakage to build attacks and extract intellectual property, such as the hyper-parameters of neural networks used in biometric authentication, without requiring special privileges or comprised hardware. This project builds upon an attacker framework to extract unique memory-contention-based signatures of victim applications. New profiling and analysis techniques are developed to capture non-linear memory access characteristics of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads. The signatures are then used to create reverse-engineering, information extraction and denial-of-service based attacks. Finally, various countermeasures at architecture- and system-level are developed against the new attacks. The research team investigates the security, performance, area, and energy implications of new memory controller scheduling policies and randomization-based solutions.

Precious metal nanoparticles, such as platinum (Pt) nanoparticles, are currently used as catalysts in the energy industries even though they are expensive. This technology is designed to produce multi-metallic nanoparticles with the aim to replace or reduce noble metals used in the energy sector. The business hypothesis is that the multi-metallic nanoparticles will serve as better catalysts and electrodes than the presently used Pt nanoparticles and help energy industries such as oil and gas, fuel cells, and hydrogen production to improve cost-effectiveness, process efficiency, and reliability.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a laser-based technique that enables the ultrafast fabrication of a variety of multi-metallic nanoparticles. This nanosecond laser-processing technology enables the creation of multi-metallic nanoparticles of different sizes, shapes, and compositions covering a large dimensional and compositional space. The technology is based on the rapid shriveling of thin films into nanoparticles through the laser-induced melt-phase dewetting phenomenon, which subsequently accumulates in a droplet shape via thermally-driven mass transport and surface energy minimization. The approach has been tested to manufacture several monometallic noble metal (platinum, gold, and silver), non-noble metal (nickel and cobalt), bimetallic (silver-cobalt, gold-nickel, gold-cobalt, and copper-nickel), and multi-element alloy (nickel-cobalt-chromium and nickel-cobalt-chromium-iron-copper) nanoparticles. The technology produces nanoparticles that exhibit high-quality, contamination/oxidation-free characteristics that may be tailored for intended applications including improved functional properties such as shelf-life, stability, and catalytic activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The success of a transfer pathway is dependent upon state and individual college policies, procedures, and pathways. The New Mexico Bridge to the Baccalaureate Alliance is a collaborative partnership of eight community colleges, led by NMSU Doa Ana Community College, sharing the common goal of significantly increasing the transfer of community college students in STEM by enhancing a culture of research. The Alliance partner colleges are located across the state serving a largely rural population including Central New Mexico (Albuquerque), Luna Community College (Las Vegas), New Mexico State University ? Alamogordo, New Mexico State University ? Grants Community College, San Juan Community College (Farmington), Santa Fe Community College, and University of New Mexico-Valencia. This Alliance will formalize articulation and transfer strategies between institutions, increasing communication, mentoring, and research opportunities for community college faculty and students by developing a formal partnership with six of the four-year institutions comprising the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation STEM Pathways and Research Alliance. <br/><br/>The collective impact of the Alliance institutions' focus on the transfer and graduation of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines contributes to an understanding of developing successful pathways to STEM degree completion at two-year institutions. The goals of the program are (1) to increase the number of Community College URM students participating in mentoring and enrollment in STEM courses that provide undergraduate research experiences; (2) Achieve a significant increase in the transfer rate of URM undergraduate students pursuing degrees in STEM;(3) Conduct a rigorous external evaluation to deepen the understanding of URM student success in New Mexico Community College STEM courses and degree programs; (4) Use Project Evaluation outcomes and findings to inform the project and support data-driven adjustments to activities, dissemination strategies, and sustainability planning. The project aims to implement four project activities selected for proven outcomes for students and their designation as ?high-impact? practices.  The analysis of project outcomes is anticipated to contribute to a greater understanding of four primary questions: 1) Does peer mentoring influence STEM community college student transfer? 2) Does participation in course-based research experiences influence transfer? 3) Does participation in faculty professional development opportunities increase curriculum revision efforts?  4) What impact does student participation in professional development have on transfer? Providing support for faculty and students, the project represents new directions for shifting the culture of STEM education and the role of transfer in a community college. New templates for sustainable teaching improvement and pathway developments that emerge addressing critical transfer points will be broadly disseminated to state, national, and international audiences through publications, presentations, and online venues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerical analysts develop algorithms for simulating these systems by solving PDEs on a computer; these simulations enable engineers and scientists to develop prototypes and to interpret data from sensors. For example, the NSF-funded Nobel-winning detection of gravitational waves would not have been possible without advances in numerical analysis. In recent decades, numerical analysts discovered that ideas from differential geometry, an area of pure mathematics, can be used to develop good algorithms for solving PDEs. In fact, these ideas help not only for geometric problems in fields of study like computer vision and general relativity, but also for fields like electromagnetism that have little to do with geometry. Although applying differential geometry to numerical analysis has been very successful, thus far this link has been explored only for a small number of differential geometry ideas. In this project, the investigators will continue exploring this link, taking more ideas from differential geometry and applying them to develop new numerical algorithms. These algorithms could then be used both in applied areas, by solving PDEs in science and engineering, and in pure areas, by solving PDEs in differential geometry itself. The project will also support the training of graduate student researchers.<br/><br/>This project focuses on problems at the cusp of numerical analysis and differential geometry.  It deals specifically with the design of finite element methods for PDEs that involve vector fields and tensor fields on Riemannian manifolds.  In the long term, these efforts have the potential to lead to robust numerical methods for solving geometric PDEs like the Einstein field equations, which are useful for studying gravitational wave signals, as well as PDEs like the elasticity equations, which model how objects deform under stress. This project has three main goals. The first is to develop a new family of finite elements for discretizing algebraic curvature tensors and other bi-forms---tensor products of differential forms---on simplicial triangulations. The second goal is to develop an intrinsic finite element discretization of the Bochner Laplacian, which is a basic differential operator in Riemannian geometry that differs from the familiar Hodge Laplacian from finite element exterior calculus. The third goal is to leverage what we learn to design numerical methods for a wide range of geometric problems, such as computing spectra of elliptic operators on manifolds, simulating intrinsic geometric flows, and solving prescribed curvature problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collectively, these data serve as key indicators of large-scale ecological changes, land and ocean carbon sinks, and carbon-climate feedbacks. The data generated by this project will be freely available to the scientific community and the public. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students and leverage international collaborations for improved observing of Arctic Ocean biogeochemical change.<br/><br/>Flask samples from each of the three stations will be analyzed for O2/N2 ratio and CO2 concentration.

This project will focus on hexagonal boron nitride crystals (hBN), which are thin, chemically stable materials, that show great promise for improving the performance of quantum sensors. These sensors work by behaving like tiny magnets whose pole directions can be measured. While powders from hBN have a wide range of applications, including as a whitener in cosmetics, hBN crystals will be particularly useful for sensors because of their high purity and highly ordered arrangement of their atoms relative to other materials. This international collaborative project will grow hBN crystals, measure their optical properties, test their magnetic field sensing capabilities, and determine how the devices can be optimally structured. Ultimately, hBN quantum devices will find new medical applications, including the study of biological processes, virus identification and diagnostics, and discovering new drugs. This project will provide students the opportunity to engage with science and technologies that can benefit society including crystal growth, material characterization, and quantum devices. Both the Kansas State University and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique groups will undertake outreach activities to intrigue and excite the public and students in the fields of quantum science and technology.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This project will experimentally investigate the methods for creating, and the properties of, optically detectable spin defects in hBN for quantum sensing of magnetic and electric fields. Freestanding, high quality (low intrinsic defect density) hBN crystals will be grown by precipitation from molten metal solutions. Boron vacancies will be created by nuclear transmutation.  Carbon doping will be achieved during crystal growth by ion implantation. To gain a deep understanding of the fundamental properties of the defects and to optimize the quantum sensor sensitivities, hBN crystals with specific isotopes of boron, nitrogen, and carbon dopants will be studied. Defect energy states in the crystals will be established by deep ultraviolet photoluminescence (3 eV to 6.5 eV) and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Quantum devices will be fabricated, and their performance in detecting magnetic and electric fields tested and optimized. This project will address key questions for optimizing hBN quantum sensing including: (1) Which point defects, are most effective in quantum sensors? (2) What defect densities and defect configurations are needed to optimize device performance? (3) To what extent can quantum sensing be improved by employing hBN with specific boron and nitrogen isotopes? (4) Can the ultimate quantum sensing of magnetic and electrical fields be produced from hBN monolayers?  A priority of this project is to train the next generation workforce in quantum information science and engineering.

To handle environmental uncertainty effectively, decision-making in multi-agent systems often relies on AI techniques, particularly reinforcement learning (RL). RL translates perceptual feedback and shared information into individual control decisions. However, RL-driven control strategies have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial conditions, including small perceptual noise, compromised shared information, agent failures, and self-interested agents. Despite recent empirical efforts to evaluate and enhance the robustness of such strategies, obtaining theoretical guarantees remains an open problem and a crucial challenge for ensuring the safe deployment of AI-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS). This project aims to tackle this challenge. Specifically, the project?s novelties are the design of certification, verification, and robust training algorithms for multi-agent RL (MARL) control policies. If successful, this project will establish the scientific underpinnings for certifiable robust AI-enabled CPS making them suitable for safety-critical applications in potentially adversarial environments. The broader impact encompasses societal applications, facilitating the deployment of CPS in disaster relief, manufacturing, and surveillance scenarios. Additionally, the project will contribute towards educational initiatives spanning K-12 through graduate-level.<br/><br/>To achieve this research goal, three tightly coupled research directions are being pursued. The first objective focuses on training robust MARL control policies and theoretically certifying their robustness against adversarial high-dimensional sensory inputs. The second one focuses on assessing and enhancing the robustness of MARL control policies against adversarial communications and unexpected agent failures/removals. Extending these ideas to non-cooperative settings, the third research direction is explores the existence and computation of robust equilibria. Developing these fundamental analysis and synthesis capabilities for CPS necessitates designing new theoretical results drawing from formal methods, machine learning, and control theory. These research findings will be demonstrated on physical CPS testbeds and photorealistic simulators, using aerial and ground robot platforms, with particular emphasis on manufacturing and disaster relief applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When using Peer Instruction an instructor displays a question that students answer individually. The students then discuss the question with nearby peers and refine their answers. Peer+ will add two new ways for students to discuss the question with their peers through (1) a text-chat for answering questions during lecture, and (2) a pseudo text-chat for answering questions after lecture. While there is substantial evidence for the effectiveness of Peer Instruction, preliminary research at the University of Michigan has found that using text-chat during lectures improved learning. Peer Instruction is known to improve retention in STEM classes, especially for students from minoritized groups. Providing new types of peer discussion could further improve retention and thus increase the number and diversity of students who succeed in STEM classes.<br/><br/>The research associated with this project will increase knowledge about effective STEM education and approaches that attempt to reduce barriers to adoption of Peer Instruction. Since it can be hard for instructors to find the time to adopt new teaching methods, a summer instructor workshop will be offered, and follow-up support will be provided. The project will investigate (1) the effect of three different modes for peer discussion on learning and student satisfaction at four institutions and in a variety of courses, (2) the effect of the Peer+ tool on student retention, and (3) how instructor attitudes towards and knowledge of Peer Instruction change due to a workshop, follow-up support, and use of Peer+.

With the advancement of technology, there is a growing necessity for these devices to receive various types of information (like images, videos, and texts) instantly and effectively. One promising approach to achieving this is through the use of Geospatial Digital Twins (GDT), which are digital models of physical environments. GDTs are becoming increasingly important as they allow for real-time updates and interactions, making them invaluable for various applications such as monitoring, maintenance, and emergency response. Traditionally, data for GDTs has been collected through automated systems like distributed sensor devices, satellites and drones. However, these methods have limitations, especially when it comes to updating data quickly and covering hard-to-reach areas. To overcome these challenges, this project will develop a novel approach that involves the community through ?human-in-the-loop? strategies. This means using crowd-sourced data, where people provide real-time updates to digital models. This method not only promises to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of the information but also to allow discovery of new information. The project has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with and understand our physical world, potentially making this work a cornerstone for further scientific and educational advancements. The project will also play an important role in education, integrating research findings into university curricula and offering unique learning opportunities for students, including students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish an intellectual foundation for building a real-time crowd-sourced GDT. To achieve this goal, we will work toward a fundamental understanding of crowd-sourced multi-modal information collection and processing to account for the underlying human incentives and human-machine integration, which underpin the foundation of crowd-sourced GDT. In this project, we will investigate the design of crowd-sourced GDT to ensure timely, truthful, and unbiased imagery data collection from the crowd. Our efforts will be organized around four tightly integrated research thrusts: 1) ensuring crowd-sourced data freshness for a GDT; 2) integrating crowd-sourced data for real-time GDT updates; 3) guaranteeing truthful reporting in crowd-sourced data collection; and 4) mitigating self-reinforcing bias in crowd-sourced GDT updates.

By linking traditionally separate fields of genetics and neuroscience, the researchers will reveal how sensory systems change over time in the blind Mexican cavefish. The cavefish is a special animal in that it has both blind and eyed populations, thereby providing a unique opportunity to connect basic, fundamental research with a broader understanding of evolution for society (through journal publications, textbook chapters, popular press coverage etc.). The results of this work will generate new techniques and ideas that can be used to better understand how genetic variation contributes to neural processing in naturally evolved populations. In addition, this work on how the hair cell system processes information will provide insight into human auditory and vestibular (sense of balance) systems, as well as inspire engineers seeking to design efficient, low-cost sensors in autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, the researchers will present their work to the thousands of K-12 students who participate in the Whitney Lab?s Scientist for a Day Program, enhancing scientific literacy in Florida. New content on ?sensory brains? will be developed for the YouTube channel, Fish Code Studios (established in 2014), that reaches a global audience, with 11,700+ subscribers and over 450,000 views and will continue to serve as a major public outreach platform.<br/><br/>Researchers will investigate how selection influences sensory detection and modulation by applying powerful physiological and genetic approaches to an emerging model system for neural evolution.  Combining electrophysiology and genome wide analyses of genetic architecture, investigations will reveal how the cavefish lateral line system evolved to enable prey capture. Aim 1 will focus on neurophysiology underlying variation in lateral line sensitivity across development.  The lateral line system in fishes consists of mechanosensitive neuromasts distributed across the body, with the hair cells of each neuromast connected to afferent neurons that relay information to the brain. This information is simultaneously regulated by an efferent feedback circuit to enhance flow signals during swimming. Using in vivo patch clamp recordings, lateral line sensitivity in surface and cavefish populations will be defined to test whether evolutionarily derived changes in lateral line physiology have enhanced the sensory capabilities of cavefish. This will be done for the first time across developmental stages in larval cavefish. Aim 2 will involve a comprehensive genome wide analysis of genetic architecture regulating lateral line-mediated prey capture behavior. To identify the genetic architecture associated with lateral line differences, F2 surface-cave hybrid fish will be generated and the relationships between quantitative genetics and behavior will be measured. Genotyping-by-sequencing and high-resolution quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping will be used to identify genomic regions associated with lateral line function and prey-capture behavior.

Collectively, these data serve as key indicators of large-scale ecological changes, land and ocean carbon sinks, and carbon-climate feedbacks. The data generated by this project will be freely available to the scientific community and the public. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students and leverage international collaborations for improved observing of Arctic Ocean biogeochemical change.<br/><br/>Flask samples from each of the three stations will be analyzed for O2/N2 ratio and CO2 concentration.

Before an ML model can be deployed, the model must be ?trained? by repeatedly processing examples. Each example helps the model to make progressively more accurate predictions, ""learning"" how to solve the problem at hand. Unfortunately, this training step requires a large amount of expensive, highly-specialized hardware and can take several hours to complete. Given limited hardware resources, it is not obvious how to allocate (share) these resources across a stream of ML training jobs. The goal of this project is to develop new resource allocation policies that allow us to produce highly-accurate ML models, quickly, and with limited resources. The main challenge in this work is that ML training jobs present a number of unique characteristics compared to other computing workloads. ML training jobs are highly parallelizable, meaning a single training job might run across multiple servers. Each job also has a large number of configuration options that affect how fast the model learns a particular problem. This project uses mathematical modeling to develop new allocation policies specifically designed for ML training jobs. This research will be accompanied by the development of new courses and mentorship programs designed to recruit students from underrepresented backgrounds into research on the modeling of computer systems.<br/><br/>Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly being deployed across a wide variety of applications. The growth in ML models has been accompanied by the development of specialized hardware accelerators that help reduce the training time for ML models. However, there has not been a similar degree of specialization in the scheduling algorithms used to train  ML models on clusters of specialized hardware. The question of how to best schedule ML training jobs is non-trivial. ML training jobs present many unique characteristics compared to other computing workloads. First, ML training jobs vary in their degree of parallelizability (ability to scale out across servers), with some jobs being highly elastic and others being inelastic in their scalability. It is not clear how to allocate (share) hardware resources among jobs with such different characteristics. To make things more complicated, each training job is parameterized by a set of tuning parameters called hyperparameters. The parallelizability of an ML training job varies over time as the job hyperparameters change. Hence, systems which either rely on static resource reservations or existing heuristic scheduling policies are poorly suited for ML training jobs. Finally, the inherent work associated with an ML job is not a fixed quantity. Instead, ML jobs are generally trained until the model meets a desired level of accuracy. Hence, the existing scheduling theory that favors ?short? jobs does not apply in this case. This proposal develops a new theoretic framework for modeling the dynamics of ML jobs running in a shared cluster. This framework will be used to develop scheduling and allocation policies that are specialized to ML training jobs, and to prove performance guarantees on these policies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One important pathway by which these scarce elements are delivered to surface ocean waters is through aerosol particles in the atmosphere. This project will address important questions about the variability in the atmospheric delivery of iron and other TEs to the surface waters of the North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda through aerosol sampling, laboratory experiments, and modeling. Increased accuracy of atmospheric deposition and aerosol iron solubility representation will improve global biogeochemical models and our understanding of how changes in climate may influence the marine carbon cycle through changes in atmospheric iron deposition. The project will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student involvement and support an early-career scientist. Data will be posted on the BCO-DMO website and made widely available to scientists working in similar fields by being included in the SCOR Working Group 167 (Reducing Uncertainty in Soluble aerosol Trace Element Deposition) data compilation. <br/><br/>This project will conduct a two-year time-series of size-fractionated aerosol sampling at the Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory in Bermuda to accomplish four goals: <br/>1.	Analyze temporal variations in the size distribution of aerosol Fe and other bioactive, pollutant, and tracer TEs, as well as major cations and anions over the western North Atlantic Ocean and link these variations to aerosol sources and transport pathways. <br/>2.	Apply a range of chemical extractions to size-fractionated and bulk North Atlantic aerosols to quantify lower and upper estimates of potentially bioavailable Fe and explain trends in bulk aerosol Fe solubility in the context of variations observed in size-fractionated aerosols. <br/>3.	Use elemental ratios, Fe stable isotopes, Fe-mineralogical partitioning and redox state, and air mass back trajectories to directly probe the chemical controls on aerosol Fe solubility as a function of aerosol particle size and source over a two-year period. <br/>4.	Parameterize concurrently measured meteorological conditions to model deposition velocities for each aerosol size-fraction during weekly sampling periods, thereby constraining supply rates of total and soluble TEs to North Atlantic surface waters. <br/>The results of this study will provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing trace element solubility in North Atlantic aerosols and the role that aerosol size distribution plays in these variations. Rates of dry deposition calculated using size-fractionated aerosol collections will give a better understanding of the potential overestimation of bioavailable trace element supply rate that may arise from previous calculations based solely on bulk aerosol concentrations. This project will thus improve representation of atmospheric trace element solubility and deposition flux in global and regional deposition models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the advancement of technology, there is a growing necessity for these devices to receive various types of information (like images, videos, and texts) instantly and effectively. One promising approach to achieving this is through the use of Geospatial Digital Twins (GDT), which are digital models of physical environments. GDTs are becoming increasingly important as they allow for real-time updates and interactions, making them invaluable for various applications such as monitoring, maintenance, and emergency response. Traditionally, data for GDTs has been collected through automated systems like distributed sensor devices, satellites and drones. However, these methods have limitations, especially when it comes to updating data quickly and covering hard-to-reach areas. To overcome these challenges, this project will develop a novel approach that involves the community through ?human-in-the-loop? strategies. This means using crowd-sourced data, where people provide real-time updates to digital models. This method not only promises to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of the information but also to allow discovery of new information. The project has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with and understand our physical world, potentially making this work a cornerstone for further scientific and educational advancements. The project will also play an important role in education, integrating research findings into university curricula and offering unique learning opportunities for students, including students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish an intellectual foundation for building a real-time crowd-sourced GDT. To achieve this goal, we will work toward a fundamental understanding of crowd-sourced multi-modal information collection and processing to account for the underlying human incentives and human-machine integration, which underpin the foundation of crowd-sourced GDT. In this project, we will investigate the design of crowd-sourced GDT to ensure timely, truthful, and unbiased imagery data collection from the crowd. Our efforts will be organized around four tightly integrated research thrusts: 1) ensuring crowd-sourced data freshness for a GDT; 2) integrating crowd-sourced data for real-time GDT updates; 3) guaranteeing truthful reporting in crowd-sourced data collection; and 4) mitigating self-reinforcing bias in crowd-sourced GDT updates. Collectively, this project will result in new tools for optimization and control that directly contribute to real-time crowd-sourced GDTs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop a technology that transforms this inaccessible data into useful information, drastically reducing the time needed for material selection from weeks to minutes, thereby accelerating scientific and technological advancement and enhancing national prosperity and security. The market for advanced materials is projected to grow to $2.1 trillion by 2025, and the business model for this initiative focuses on providing technological services to materials suppliers, ensuring a sustainable competitive advantage by improving access to and usability of critical data. Initially targeting the semiconductor industry and industries reliant on polymers, the strategy is to achieve significant market penetration, with anticipated substantial annual revenues by the third year of production, underlining its impact across multiple high-value industries. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the critical challenge of ""dark"" data in materials science?valuable data that is unutilized because it is trapped in diverse formats or accessible only to a few experts.

The overall product simplifies image acquisition. It is an application for remote tele-health and enables any ultrasound device to take images without the operator needing to see the images acquired. Any physician, any nurse, and/or novice can acquire images, which can then be made available for experts, human or artificial, to examine. This opens up the bottleneck of high-cost trained sonographers to enable more rapid growth of the market, and can scale rapidly on any of the devices of large ultrasound device manufacturers. The technology can reduce costs associated with training and reduce variability in hospitals and health systems, reach patients in their homes, in primary care or retail clinics, and in urgent and remote care centers. Other needs that can be met include the Veterans Administration in its community-based outpatient clinics currently lacking imaging facilities; and in the Army in battlefield situations where ultrasound in the front lines can now be used due to obviating lengthy training requirements. Scientifically, other coherent imaging methods such as optical, photoacoustic, and thermoacoustic would also benefit.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops low-cost<br/>hardware and software for the acquisition of ultrasound images so that no anatomic training is needed, instead guiding even a lay operator with easily learned graphical clues until data acquisition is complete and can be passed, for example, to an examining physician in a format familiar to her from other radiological images. The central innovation is in signal and image processing that will allow accurate image reconstruction from freehand 2D ultrasound signal data with imperfect information on the position of the probe that comes from low-cost sensors. This is an essential element that enables the low-cost solution envisaged. Instead of the conventional approach of registering two image sets by comparing overlapping images, new methods are proposed so that different scan planes which do not have overlapping sets of images can be co-registered accurately. The key objectives of the research are to implement and test the algorithms for improved localization of an ultrasonic echo return, and then to determine whether these improvements are sufficient to obtain images of clinical quality as deemed by a qualified radiologist.

All students benefit from research and internship experiences because they often result in higher wages and job satisfaction. Due to familial and external circumstances and financial constraints, students who would most benefit often cannot participate. Through partnerships with community colleges, particularly Passaic County Community College, and other institutions, the project will intentionally recruit inclusive cohorts of interns and transfer students who wish to participate in research. Further, Montclair State will create and sustain psychologically affirming internship and research experiences. Specifically, PhD students in Counseling, who are also licensed professional counselors, will facilitate weekly psychoeducational group counseling sessions as part of summer research and internship experiences. Faculty mentors and program managers will participate in their own counselor-facilitated groups to establish best practices for mentoring students. Through integrating a counseling component into research and internship opportunities, project research will study how psychoeducational group counseling influences the experiences of interns, research students, research mentors, and program managers. The team will share the practices broadly within Montclair State and with other institutions of higher education so that they can also integrate counseling into research and internship experiences. <br/> <br/>The specific aims of the project are to increase participation in high quality STEM experiential learning opportunities across Montclair State; embed professional psychoeducational group counseling into internships and research experiences to create more productive experiential learning opportunities with excellent socio-emotional support; and to generate knowledge on the impacts of this counseling intervention on students, faculty mentors, and program coordinators at an HSI. The project's research team will employ a mixed methods approach to answer the following questions: 1) what impact does psychoeducational group counseling have on research and internship experiences; 2) does participating in psychoeducational group counseling influence students' sense of hope; and 3) how does participating in counselor-facilitated, weekly affinity groups impact research mentors and project managers? The hypothesis is that the counseling component will provide students with clarity regarding their career paths; increased group-cohesion; necessary mental health support; and more positive internship and research experiences. This work will increase the number of students who pursue and persist in STEM internships and careers and will be shared broadly to encourage adoption at institutions nationwide.

However, the AI models designed to generate conversation with users can make mistakes, and thus need to be designed to minimize the risk of giving incorrect advice, or using language that might harm vulnerable people with mental health needs. This project's goal is to use trauma-informed care (TIC) principles in the design of mental health chatbots to reduce those risks. TIC is an important approach in mental health support that prioritizes patient safety, trust, peer support, collaboration, empowerment, and cultural/historical sensitivity, holding providers and healthcare organizations accountable during patient care. This project will use TIC principles, along with guidance from both mental health providers and chatbot users, to assess existing chatbots for mental health support as well as how they fit into mental health practice. The team will develop guidelines that embody the TIC framework in chatbots to prioritize user safety, empowerment, and wellbeing, as well as giving more general insight into the application of TIC principles in healthcare technologies. By establishing accountable design practices for AI-driven mental health chatbots, this project seeks to improve care quality, user experiences, and scientific progress in the field.<br/><br/>While the application of AI-based chatbots has significantly increased in health domain, there is no specific regulation and accountability for these platforms to ensure TIC principles are incorporated. The project aims to assess human-chatbot interactions through the lens of trauma-informed care, employing a comprehensive mixed-methods approach that triangulates data from user surveys, semi-structured interviews, and interactive group sessions with providers. This project has three primary objectives. First, the team will systematically explore user perceptions of mental health chatbots through surveys and semi-structured interviews, shedding light on user engagement, expectations, satisfactions, and concerns while seeking support. Second, the team will engage multidisciplinary mental health professionals in interactive group sessions with existing mental health chatbots, characterizing interactions from a trauma-informed care perspective and fostering shared recommendations for chatbot design. Third, the team will develop guidelines for human-chatbot interaction strategies, rooted in human-centered design methods and TIC principles, with the aim of establishing a foundation for accountable and safe AI and chatbot usage in the domain of mental health.

Integrating analog and digital processing directly within the memory's storage and control circuits paves the way for innovations in materials, device architecture, and circuit design. The upcoming workshop is set to gather 40-60 senior researchers and 12 graduate students specializing in the design and fabrication of novel and emerging memory materials, device, and circuit design architecture. Given the wide geographic spread across the US of the research community focused on this topic, this workshop will serve as a vital platform for educational and professional in-person engagement. It aims to bring together a geographically and demographically diverse group of students, each with unique personal experiences and professional goals. These students will have the opportunity to connect with peers and a broader network of mentors within their field of study. <br/><br/><br/>Present-day memory technologies, including DRAM and Flash memory, hinge on charge storage and can retain data without power. However, the quest to scale these technologies below 10 nanometers has surfaced formidable challenges that undermine performance, reliability, and endurance. The industry's ambition is to forge a path toward non-volatile memory systems that excel in speed, durability, and energy efficiency and are scalable to 2 nanometers or below. However, such a solution is only possible by using a new class of materials and devices emerging since 2010. In the past decade, four emerging non-volatile memory technologies have shown considerable promise; Filamentary Memories (RRAM), Phase Change Memories (PCM), Magnetic Memories (MRAM), and Ferroelectric memories (FeRAM). Despite promising developments in these emerging memories, bridging the knowledge gaps has been a protracted endeavor. Distinct challenges thwart the progression: the nuanced requirements of in-memory processing vis--vis conventional storage solutions; the prevalence of inconsistent and unvalidated research findings attributed to less-than-ideal fabrication conditions; and the restricted availability of state-of-the-art fabrication equipment are typically confined to selected industrial and national research facilities. This confluence of obstacles underscores the critical need to convene the relevant research community, including the pivotal participation of graduate students, to engage in discourse, confront these challenges, and ideate on solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory of operator algebras began in the 1930s with the goal of creating a mathematically rigorous foundation for Heisenberg's approach to quantum mechanics.  In Heisenberg's work, observable physical quantities are represented by certain linear operators on Hilbert space (roughly, infinite matrices of complex numbers).  One of the most famous results of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that the momentum and position of a particle cannot be known simultaneously.  The mathematically rigorous version of this statement is that the operators P and Q which measure position and momentum do not commute, i.e., PQ and QP are not equal (there is, however, a precise formula relating P and Q).  Operator algebras is the study of algebraic relations between collections of operators.  Amenable C*-algebras form a particularly important class of operator algebras.  A large-scale effort over the last several decades has shown that, under relatively mild (though still somewhat mysterious) additional hypotheses, the simple (i.e., indecomposable) amenable C*-algebras can be completely classified.  The main goals of this project are to further examine the extra conditions needed for classification, with a view toward more powerful classification results, and to study of the finer structure of the classifiable operator algebras, including their symmetries.  The project will also enhance the mathematics workforce through research opportunities for graduate students, instructional workshops and seminars, and expository material on the main topics of research.<br/><br/><br/>Recent progress in Elliott's Program has shown that separable, simple, nuclear, Z-stable C*-algebras in the UCT class are classified up to isomorphism via their operator K-theory groups, their trace simplex, and the pairing between them.  The Z-stability condition is known to be necessary and is currently the most difficult hypothesis to verify in practice.  The Toms-Winter conjecture predicts that under the other hypothesis, Z-stability follows from an a priori weaker condition known as strict comparison.  Part of the goal of the project is to examine this conjecture.  It is a long-standing open question if every separable nuclear C*-algebra satisfies the UCT.  While the UCT condition is usually easily verified in concrete examples (through a series of deep results in operator K-theory), the UCT continues to be a significant theoretical barrier.  This project will examine the possibility of obtaining classification results without a UCT assumption, at the expense of augmenting the Elliott invariant with KK-theoretic data.  Such classification results without the UCT will be crucial in advancing the structure and classification theory of non-simple nuclear C*-algebras and of group actions on (simple) nuclear C*-algebras.  Indeed, all prior works in this direction suggests that variants of KK-theory accounting for the ideal structure and/or the group action on the C*-algebra will be necessary, and even in most concrete examples, there are no satisfactory analogues of the UCT which account for this extra structure on KK-theory.  It will thus be necessary to work with KK-theory more directly than has been done previously in the (stably finite) classification theory.  Progress in this direction will set the stage for the next stages in the structure and classification theory of nuclear C*-algebras and group actions on such C*-algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include cellulose found in cotton and wood, amylose in the starch found in bread and rice, and chitins found in the exoskeleton of insects. Today, polysaccharides are preferred renewable materials for many applications, such as packaging, healthcare, personal care, and agriculture. However, polysaccharides found in nature can vary greatly in structure and purity, making them difficult to study and use effectively. The structures and properties of synthetic polysaccharides could be precisely controlled, but existing methods for synthesizing polysaccharides are often impractical for large-scale production. The goal of this research project is to find a new way to design and make a variety of polysaccharides with precisely controlled structures from natural sugars. In addition, non-sugar units will be blended with sugar units in these polymers to match and even surpass the properties of natural polysaccharides. This project will also establish a meeting called Massachusetts-Missouri Macro-Materials Meeting (5M). This meeting will promote the communication and collaboration of polymer scientists in the states of Massachusetts and Missouri and the nearby regions, and encourage college students from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in STEM.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop novel polysaccharide-based soft materials. Toward this goal, novel approaches to precision polysaccharides through living cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of anhydrosugars will be devised. Precision polysaccharides are synthetic polysaccharides consisting of native glycosidic linkage and well-controlled molecular weight, dispersity, side-chain groups, and chain-end groups. Living CROP of anhydrosugars will be used to generate precision polysaccharide homopolymers with various monosaccharide repeating units, side-chain groups, and molecular weights to establish a comprehensive structure-property understanding. Detailed reactivity studies in the copolymerization of the anhydrosugar monomers and non-carbohydrate monomers will lead to a novel class of statistical copolymers. The knowledge gained through these fundamental studies will enable the additive manufacturing of these materials, amplifying their molecular-scale structural features to the macroscopic level. The nano-to-macroscale understanding of the structure-property relationship will further advance the development of even more sophisticated block copolysaccharide elastomers and mixed graft copolymers with polysaccharide branches. As part of this project, a new Massachusetts-Missouri Macro-Materials Meeting (5M) will be developed to provide a platform to promote research, communication, and STEM education among researchers and college youths.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins are the key drivers of cellular processes and are critical for specific function and are implicated in specific diseases. We call these materials Protein-like Polymers (PLPs). PLPs are proteomimetic and enable rapid and scalable emulation of protein behaviors. PLPs are exceptional at entering cells where they can be used to study cellular processes. The focus of this work is to elucidate how this occurs and the mechanism by which PLPs interact with biological membranes and compartments and in turn how they enter cells. These features of PLPs lend them to serving as reagents for the detection of proteins of interest, as probes and as intracellular binders of proteins. Critically, these are features not easily accessible to small molecules or antibodies, both of which make up the vast majority of compounds currently used in this area. This means that PLPs have the potential to be developed as unique modulators of cellular function. With a platform technology in hand for stabilizing peptides, increasing their binding and penetrating cells, we propose a fundamental set of studies to elucidate these properties and how they relate to PLP structure both in solution and at cell membranes. We will study the effect of chemical structure on their performance and determine critical parameters that govern their behavior in biological systems.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The proposed studies develop and investigate Protein-Like Polymers (PLPs). PLPs are large, flexible proteomimetic macromolecules that resemble proteins in form and function. The size and multivalency provide a basis for the development of drugs that can engage the ?undruggable? large, flat, featureless interfaces where small molecules have traditionally struggled and that antibodies cannot access (i.e. intracellular targets). We propose that the PLPs access cells and engage membranes in analogy to the permeability enabled by the kind of flexibility and chameleonic behavior exhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). Indeed, this kind of environment-adaptive behavior wherein molecules can be dissolved in aqueous solution, and also reside within lipophilic environments, is increasingly desirable. The PLP is inherently metaphilic (transiently amphiphilic) with a core polymer scaffold of tunable rigidity and lipophilicity and hydrophilic peptide side chains as brushes, capable of introducing positive charge and ultimately protein recognition function. In the proposed work, we aim to study aqueous phase conformations and to map these onto behavior at lipid membranes and ultimately within cells using advanced methods and a set of newly synthesized PLPs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This solution is based on the development of a new methodology to tether new and existing above ground oil storage tanks to prevent failures during floods. Notably, out of approximately 5,000 tanks in the Houston Ship Channel, about a thousand tanks are located within the 100-year flood plain, making them vulnerable to storm surge-induced flood events. The failure of the tanks can lead to catastrophic oil spills. The proximity of the tanks to rivers and oceans increases the spill-induced environmental risks and chances of wildlife habitat damage in the surrounding areas. Furthermore, in many areas, such as the Houston Ship Channel and in Louisiana, tanks are located very close to residential communities. Potential spills caused by the failure of the tanks would expose these communities to hazardous substances. The improved flood safety tanks afforded by this tethering system will help improve the well-being of the surrounding communities and the environment. Furthermore, several regional economies, such as in Louisiana and Houston, TX, depend on industries that use these tanks extensively. The improved safety of tanks can make economies and communities that are dependent on these industries more resilient to floods.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution uses anchor chairs, steel cables, and screw/helical piles to tether new and existing above ground oil storage tanks to prevent failures during floods. The steel cables will connect the anchor char that will be welded to the tank with the helical pile which will be embedded into the ground. The solution will allow controlled flotation of the tank during floods to avoid failure of the bottom plate, located on the underside of the tank. The existing anchor chair designs only consider vertical forces, so controlled floatation of the tanks also requires anchor chairs to sustain horizontal forces. The new design for anchor chairs can sustain a horizontal force of up to 36% of the vertical force. Computer simulations were used to develop the design for the new anchor chair. Industry feedback will be used to further develop this solution and the anchor chair design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All these applications place severe constraints on the size, weight and power of on-board computers and sensors. Yet, to safely operate in unknown complex environments, each CPS should perform several fundamental tasks including: (i) localization: determining its location, typically without any strong external aids such as GPS (Global Positioning System) and (ii) mapping: creating a compact representation of obstacles in the environment. Existing algorithms that enable these fundamental tasks often require large memory overhead for storing temporary variables during computation and are typically executed on general-purpose computers which are too energy hungry. Thus, enabling autonomy on energy-constrained robots requires not only the design of robust and efficient algorithms for localization and mapping, but also their specialized energy-efficient computing hardware. The project will also support the development of a new graduate course that is at the intersection of computer architecture, integrated circuits and robotics, and an outreach program for high school students. <br/><br/>This project explores the co-design of algorithms and hardware for localization and mapping that is efficient, robust, and accurate all at the same time. To achieve energy efficiency, the approach is to develop new algorithms and their computing hardware such that: (i) the number of memory accesses do not dominate the algorithm, and (ii) the amount of memory required during computation remains small enough to be on-the-chip. The team will demonstrate the new methodologies by designing and fabricating a new chip to execute effective localization and mapping tasks in a fraction of the size, weight, and power of the state of the art. The innovation here is the focus on minimizing memory utilization and data flow, as opposed to optimizing the number of computing operations.

However, several CPS applications demand a high degree of safety, security, and reliability. Thus, the fundamental problem is constructing highly dependable CPS applications from building blocks that are, in themselves, not inherently reliable. There has been enormous progress made in understanding and patching various classes of vulnerabilities in large-scale distributed CPS. However, these efforts at designing and operating resilient CPS have often been stymied by the lack of understanding of the impact of any perturbation to the overall system, under the economic and policy constraints involved in any realistic real-world CPS. We define perturbations as failures due to: (1) unintended errors in hardware/software, (2) security attacks, (3) unexpected interactions among cyber-physical and human elements including natural disasters,  and (4) incomplete cooperation among stakeholders. In this project, we address these shortcomings to challenges to create resilient, large-scale CPS through our CHORUS Frontier award. Chorus will develop rigorous, scientific mechanisms to enable CPS resilience against a large universe of perturbations. Our application domain is Connected and Autonomous Transportation Systems (CATS) and thus, the benefits of CHORUS will be demonstrated through improvements in safety and security in this domain.<br/><br/>We will achieve goals of CHORUS through three interacting intellectually challenging thrusts in the project. Thrust 1 is on Modeling which will create executable specifications of cyber, physical, and human assets, their interconnections, and the economic and policy constraints. The models will capture various stakeholders in the system and their degree of information sharing and cooperation in defense of the target CPS. Thrust 2 is centered on Proactive planning and deployment. We will develop rigorous game-theoretic formulations to model the spread of perturbations (natural and man-made), their effects, and the appropriate resource allocations that can be applied for resilience at the planning stage, i.e., prior to system deployment. We will also consider which defensive investments are feasible under a rational versus a bounded rational behavioral model of the stakeholders. Thrust 3 focuses on Runtime distributed detection and response. We will determine, at runtime, the security state of the system, through novel uses of existing sensors in the system even though they are imperfect. This will then trigger the response mechanisms, which will be proven to be approximately optimal, through analysis and experimentation. In terms of broader impact, the greatest impact will be that CPS owners will gain a higher degree of trust in the operation of the CPS and policy-makers will understand what level of cooperation among multiple stakeholders in a CPS to incentivize. We will create compelling demonstrations of CHORUS on a connected vehicle testbed distributed between our academic institutions and our industrial partner GM. We will also organize an annual student security competition and develop two MOOCS, both having foundational material on resilient CPS and one focusing more on the CATS application domain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An ecosystem for behavioral experiments will allow researchers to make their methodological innovations open-source products that can be adapted by other researchers to answer new questions. The goal is to make all kinds of research on human behavior faster, more transparent, more collaborative, and cheaper. The ecosystem created around this software allows researchers to develop and share innovations in this rapidly changing space. It lowers the barriers to access research resources, allowing researchers to run online experiments, facilitating the use of high-impact approaches like citizen science, and reducing the amount of redundant effort that researchers do when creating these experiments. Facilitating research that is built on free and open-source research will accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, multiplying the broader impacts of that work. jsPsych is already used for research that informs social and educational programs and policies, product design, therapies, training and development of artificial intelligence, and many other areas. Online experiments are a powerful tool for cognitive and behavioral research in behavioral economics, human-computer interaction, linguistics, and all branches of psychology. The project will also train dozens of researchers to contribute to open-source software development, building scientific workforce capacity that can be applied to a broader range of projects.<br/><br/>This project grows the open-source ecosystem through several complementary activities. It brings together experts and tool developers who use a variety of online experiment methods to coordinate around a shared framework. For this shared framework, the project creates policies and tools that facilitate shared governance, ensuring that the ecosystem is sustainable. To make it easier for researchers to contribute to development of the software, the project builds developer-focused tools, improves documentation, and conducts both live and remote hackathons for training. To ensure that the software developed by the community is robust and secure, the project develops plans for software testing and verification before public release. Finally, the project includes activities that will permit researchers to provide input on the direction of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

EEP is one of the main processes contributing to the loss of energetic electrons and has important implications in the interconnected atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system (e.g., changes in atmospheric chemistry, ionization, and conductance) and in space weather (e.g., satellite radiation monitoring, satellite drag, etc.).  These energetic electrons are primarily scattered by plasma waves; however, due to limited data coverage, our comprehensive understanding of EEP is limited.  In this project, by developing a machine learning (ML) model, the team will characterize and parameterize the EEP phenomenon's properties and dynamics. Modeling the spatial and temporal evolution of regions where EEP occurs will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the radiation belt dynamics and temporal dependence of the energy input to the atmospheric system. The project is highly interdisciplinary, as our understanding of EEP directly impacts several fields, from the atmosphere and ionosphere system to the magnetosphere, and even potentially provides helpful information for space weather monitoring of electron radiation in the near-Earth environment. The project has the potential to support collaborative efforts across all these communities. The ML model and its outputs will be released to the public, enabling follow-up research projects.<br/><br/>The lack of global observations of EEP is a major limiting factor in advancing our knowledge on EEP. The team suggest to parameterize EEP by developing global EEP maps through the use of machine learning (ML) techniques. These maps will be based on measurements from the long-lived NOAA's POES/MetOp satellites and will be produced given a time history of geomagnetic activity. The project will address the following science questions: How does the global electron precipitation evolve in time and space with geomagnetic activity? Which plasma waves correspond to the observed enhanced electron precipitation? How does the improved spatial coverage impact the estimates/constraints on the spatial size, duration, and flux intensity of the electron precipitation regions? Analyzing the spatial and temporal evolution of regions where EEP occurs will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the radiation belt dynamics and temporal dependence of the energy input to the atmosphere. Additionally, the team will explore whether there is a clear cause-effect correlation between the location and energy of EEP and two main plasma waves. This provides a more definite understanding of the causal relationship between the wave modes and EEP, possibly demonstrating that EEP maps can serve as a proxy for wave activity.  Finally, by estimating the size and flux of EEP regions, the team will quantify the electron loss of the outer radiation belt and the EEP input that contributes to variations in atmospheric chemistry and ionization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mid-band spectrum (now being defined to extend up to 24 GHz) is becoming the workhorse of wireless networks due to the favorable propagation and system characteristics that balance range with bandwidth. Recent spectrum allocations confirm these spectrum priorities: in 2020, the US made available 1.2 GHz of spectrum in the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) on an unlicensed, but shared, basis. Similarly, the CBRS band (3.55 GHz ? 3.7 GHz) is shared with Navy radars. The mid-bands are also very congested, leading to the need for more, and better, spectrum sharing.<br/><br/>Spectrum Sharing Sandbox (S3) will be a data platform that will enable measurements and experiments on deployed 6 GHz and CBRS networks thus enabling the CISE community to develop a better understanding of how different types of sharing are performing in the real world. Commercial CBRS and Wi-Fi 6E devices will be deployed in multiple indoor and outdoor environments on the University of Notre Dame campus and will offer (i) the ability to verify propagation and interference characteristics in realistic deployed environments; (ii) select I/Q captures of adjacent channel and co-channel interference scenarios using software-0define-radios (SDRs); and (iii) rich Layer 1 - 2 data captures for AI/ML algorithm development and testing.<br/><br/>An experimental platform such as S3 does not exist today in academia or industry. S3-enabled real-world experimentation and measurements will drive future spectrum policy in new shared bands, such as the 7 - 8 GHz band.

Globally, Rare Earth Elements (REEs) continue to be among the most important materials for clean energy technologies; in particular Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb, continue to be critical for the electrified economy.  REE recycling from end-of-life devices holds tremendous and growing promise, as magnets within them are rich in highly desired REEs and do not contain undesired REEs. A major unmet challenge is the need for a green, distributed method to efficiently extract and selectively separate desired REE cations from mixtures generated by dissolution of the magnets. The project will study rare-earth element (REE)-Selective Protein-hydrogels to Enable Cation Trapping (REESPECT) for scalable, distributed, continuous REE recovery processes to meet the rapid growth in REE demand to support the green economy. The REESPECT platform is based on hydrogels formed from engineered alpha-synuclein fibrils that contain selective REE binding loops to capture and separate REE from aqueous streams.  The hydrogels will be formed into beads used in packed beds to allow high capacity and selective capture of REEs over non-REE cations, as well as discrimination among specific REEs.  In addition to the potentially transformative impact on REE recovery and providing educational experiences for doctoral students, the project?s outcomes will be leveraged for STEM outreach and undergraduate educational initiatives. For example, demonstrations for Philly Materials Day and NanoDay will be developed. High school students will work with PhD students in the summer outreach program Penn LENS. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited from Penn and from other universities, particularly the University of Puerto Rico, for summer programs such as NSF REU. Graduate students will volunteer for Penn GEMS, a STEM outreach program for middle school students, among others. The team will develop as an undergraduate analytical chemistry lab component based on this research and will develop projects for the CBE engineering design course offered to students interested in technical solutions to problems of broad societal significance.<br/><br/>REESPECTs (Rare Earth Element-Selective Protein-hydrogels to Enable Cation Trapping) are hierarchically assembled hydrogel materials based amyloidogenic proteins in which selective rare earth element (REE) binding loops, termed lanthanide binding tags (LBTs), are presented with exceptionally high density throughout the 3-dimensional hydrogel volume. REESPECT hydrogel beads will be fabricated and fundamentally characterized for binding capacity and transport. REESPECT beads will be exploited in proof-of-concept microfluidics separation processes that can be scaled and are suitable for distributed processing. The REESPECT platform is modular; LBTs for selective separation of particular REE identified by machine learning (ML) approaches will be identified and incorporated in REESPECT for recovery and purification of highly desired REES, including Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb.  This research is highly cross disciplinary and relies on the synergistic interactions at the interface of computational protein design; amyloid protein biophysics and genetic engineering; (bio)inorganic characterization of components and structures for selective cation-binding/triggered release; development of microfluidics/confocal fluorescence microscopy assays, and proof-of-concept separations. The project will address the following four intellectual questions: (1) Is the REEESPECT platform truly modular, allowing incorporation of ML-designed LBTs with tailored REE selectivity (Aim 1)? (2) What are optimal designs for LBT binding structures to confer selectivity and effective separation between REEs, as guided by coordination chemistry and advanced ML methods (Aim 1)?   (3) How do the densities of LBT presentation and hydrogel crosslinking alter REE binding along amyloid fibers (Aim 1) and binding capacity and transport under flow within REESPECT beads (Aim 2)? (4) What are optimal conditions for REE recovery and separation under flow of REE-rich streams in the presence of competing non-REE cations (Aim 3)?  The REESPECT platform is designed to provide a green, all-aqueous, scalable, distributed, continuous process with the potential to transform REE recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For ethane, in particular, the overall process is extremely energy-intensive resulting in huge emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2).  Catalytic processes offer opportunities to reduce the energy demands and associated CO2 emissions, but are hampered by the formation of carbon deposits (i.e., coke) on the catalyst surface, and coalescence of the small platinum (Pt) catalyst particles into larger particles ? both of which decrease the catalyst performance and require frequent catalyst regeneration.  The project addresses both deactivation modes via a novel class of catalysts known as MXenes.  Recently, the investigators developed an atomically thin Pt nanolayer catalyst supported on a molybdenum-titanium-carbon MXene.  The catalyst was evaluated for the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane and propane into ethylene and propylene, and, as compared to Pt nanoparticles, the Pt nanolayer catalyst showed superior coke-resistance, sinter-resistance, high activity and selectivity toward ethylene and propylene.  Nevertheless, further advances in catalyst design are needed for commercial use.<br/>  <br/>The project will advance the basic science of heterogeneous catalysis by addressing a critical gap in understanding the stability of the unique Pt nanolayer/Mo 2TiC2 MXene catalyst.  A multidisciplinary research approach will be undertaken, involving materials synthesis, in situ/operando characterization, theoretical computation, kinetics measurement, and reaction-diffusion model development.

The paradigm is popular, in part because of the promise it holds for protecting privacy of data while still using data from multiple sources to create a powerful central model. Algorithms for federated learning require expensive computations for deriving large sets of hyperparameters (the variables that control learning)  that control their operation. Recently, Adaptive Federated Learning (AFL) is being used, which offers improved training performance and reduced effort for identifying the hyperparameters. Despite these improvements, AFL is still in its early stages and suffers from issues in both communication of large number of hyperparameters and training efficiency. Moreover, the worst-case efficiency of adaptive federated learning also remain largely understudied from a theoretical perspective. The broad goal of this project is to fill this research gap by: (1) providing a provably efficient approach to adaptive federated learning, and (2) building practical adaptive federated learning systems for real-world machine learning settings such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and healthcare.<br/><br/>This project will offer a novel perspective for developing practical and theoretically-sound efficient adaptive federated learning. The core idea of this project is the integration of adaptive federated system design with the perspective of nonconvex optimization, which provides a systematic way to deliver intuitive solutions with theoretical insights/guarantees. Specifically, this project consist of three aims: (i) improving the communication efficiency of adaptive federated learning with new algorithm designs and rigorous convergence guarantees; (ii) improving the training efficiency of adaptive federated learning under heterogeneous data distributions with rigorous convergence guarantees; (iii) building and evaluating the practical adaptive federated learning systems in real-world applications such as IoT and healthcare. Taken together, this project provides new approaches and insights into efficient adaptive federated learning systems design and will promote advances in the fields of machine learning, data mining, and related application field. It will also help develop and culture graduate and undergraduate students with machine learning and federated optimization techniques, recruit undergraduates from diverse backgrounds into research activities, interest K-12 school students for a broader education in computer science and make the proposed research accessible to a broader audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, ASU (a Hispanic-Serving Institution) leads a new collaboration with an AI Institute to pursue shared, complementary goals to unlock untapped talent at ASU for artificial intelligence (AI) education and use-inspired research. The collaboration focuses on joint research between researchers at ASU and IFML on projects that address fundamental challenges of robust/interactive/embedded machine learning in pervasive systems. Pervasive systems are those that integrate computational capability into objects such as wearable technology, mobile devices, and assistive robots as well as built environments such as homes, cars, and workspaces. These technologies are poised to have broader impact in health and wellness by addressing the challenges associated with automation of cost-effective, objective, continuous, and real-time monitoring, intervention, and decision making in pervasive systems in areas such as health monitoring, health assessment, outcome prediction, and intervention automation in.  The project also promises broader impacts in AI education for demographics underserved in this area (including underrepresented minorities and women) by integrating the research activities into new interdisciplinary courses. Broader educational outreach involves graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, including specific targets to include female students and underrepresented minorities in research. <br/><br/>This mutually beneficial partnership in research, education/workforce development, and infrastructure will be centered on addressing challenges in deploying AI-enabled pervasive systems in real-world settings. Because these systems are deployed in highly dynamic environments and in direct interaction with humans, the project will (i) design robust machine learning algorithms that address distribution shifts in the data due to dynamic changes in the system status over time; (ii) design interactive machine learning techniques that incorporate human input and prior domain knowledge for improved model performance and personalized decision making; and (iii) develop embedded machine learning methods for deploying the models on embedded devices with stringent constrained resources. Leveraging the existing AI capacity at ASU and prior research of the collaborators, this partnership between ASU and AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning (IFML) also increase participation in multidisciplinary research, forging new interdisciplinary collaborative opportunities with the newly founded ASU School of Medicine and Advanced Medical Engineering. The collaboration also features educational programs, research oriented interdisciplinary course development, ExpandAI workshops, and the development of new courses, certificates, and course modules in pervasive AI systems to increase access to AI education and career pathways for minority students.

This project's goal is to develop principled methods for studying and designing ASL-based IPAs that allow Deaf ASL users to interact with them through sign. Because computers have trouble recognizing unconstrained ASL communication, the project team will conduct a set of experiments with Deaf users to understand how well interfaces that recognize smaller subsets of ASL can serve their needs, and how much recognition errors affect their utility. The experiments will result in a set of guidelines for how ASL-based IPAs might be designed and implemented, reducing accessibility barriers for those who use ASL.<br/><br/>The project will use a Wizard-of-Oz methodology, in which the experimental team crafts responses to simulate computational tasks that are hard to implement, to study different levels of sign language understanding abilities in an IPA. The first research aim will investigate the potential of an IPA interface that uses only single-sign recognition, with a vocabulary of approximately 100 signs that are synecdoches of common IPA voice query phrases. The second research aim will investigate user satisfaction when using a larger, but still limited, ASL vocabulary set to query IPAs. In this experiment, users will use more natural ASL phrases instead of single signs, but the simulated IPA will have a limited understanding and perform accordingly. A third research aim will vary the level of simulated ASL recognition accuracy in the IPA and investigate the level of accuracy needed for user satisfaction in the context of IPAs that understand ASL but make errors. Together, these Deaf-led human-centered experiments will engage with the Deaf community, empirically investigate criteria for successful ASL IPA interaction and provide foundational research for future ASL-based systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the widespread availability of smartphones, many people are able to document important moments from their personal lives with digital photos, which they can creatively remix and share. Yet these digital photo archives leave out the many moments that unfold via sound, such as the laughter of a friend, or the sound of a loved one cooking a favorite meal. Further, the personal sounds people do collect are often embedded within video files, which focus attention on visual information, and tools for working with audio primarily support music or speech, ignoring the wide range of other meaningful sounds people encounter in daily life. By developing tools that can help people who have no special training to document and interact with the sounds they encounter in their daily lives, this project seeks to empower people to learn new skills for listening as a means to reflect on the role of sounds, and technology, in their lives.<br/><br/>To investigate the untapped possibilities of digital listening in everyday experience, this project aims to develop new technologies for personal digital audio archives that can support sonic thinking and close listening as reflective practices. The project will follow a research-through-design process that incorporates course-based research and participatory design methods. The project will be conducted in four phases. In phase 1, the research team will develop prompts and activities for people to digitally record sounds in real-world contexts and use these sounds creatively and analytically. In phase 2, undergraduate students will perform the activities developed in phase 1, including practicing sound design and audio data science with their personal audio data, in a reflective and social classroom setting. In phase 3, under the guidance of the researcher, students in a human-computer interaction research and design practicum course will analyze the data from phase 2 and use it to develop functional prototypes for recording and using everyday audio data. In phase 4, through a long-term diary study, the researchers will deploy the prototypes from phase 3 to understand how they impact sonic thinking skills and support critical reflection on data and technology. This project will contribute novel interfaces and technologies for recording sounds in daily life. It will also explore new behavioral practices for people to engage with sound in meaningful ways through acts of creation and remixing, building knowledge about how people might use digital listening to reflect on the role of technology in their lives.

While federated learning is an advance over moving data to one place for analysis, machine learning in federated systems creates challenges to privacy consideration at the edges. New machine learning techniques are emerging that can address these privacy concerns at the edges. Federated learning is a prominent distributed learning approach to address the privacy issue through collaborative training. It enables data owners (clients) to jointly train a machine learning model without sharing their private data, orchestrated by a central server. In the real world, data samples within a client often exhibit strong relational dependencies and naturally form a local graph. In this project, we consider learning over such distributed graph data in a federated manner, termed Federated Graph Machine Learning (FGML). Typically, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted for collaborative training over graph data in FGML because they excel at modeling relational information. However, federated training on graphs faces several unique challenges, including (1) data heterogeneity?significant graph data heterogeneity across clients severely degrades the performance of GNN models in FGML; (2) label deficiency?the scarcity of labeled data for each client, when combined with complex graph structures, complicates training GNNs in the federated setting; and (3) data privacy protection?privacy leakage may arise for both attributes and structures, especially when cross-client relations exist. Our proposed framework systematically investigates these challenges and develops innovative algorithms to enhance model utility and strengthen data privacy protection in FGML.<br/><br/>This project will develop novel and significant advances in the scientific fields of graph mining, federated learning, and distributed machine learning. Each advance will dramatically advance current machine learning research in addressing the multifaceted challenges presented in the emerging collaborative training paradigm over graph data. First, this project aims to thoroughly study data heterogeneity in FGML across three different modalities (i.e., label, structure, and feature) and develops novel solutions to address these issues in FGML. Second, this project designs novel algorithms to tackle the label deficiency issue across three scenarios (i.e., few labels, noisy labels, and no labels) to enhance the generalizability, robustness, and effectiveness of GNN models in FGML. Third, this project aims to strengthen data privacy protection in FGML concerning node attributes and graph structures and proposes two effective techniques based on attribute perturbation and adversarial training. This project has the potential to impact a wide range of industries and applications, including social networks, e-commerce, healthcare, and more. Finally, this project will play an integral part in educating and training students. The research will be tightly integrated with existing and new courses related to data mining and machine learning.

Plants absorb P through roots but the scarcity of P in soil often requires the use of fertilizers for optimal crop yields, contributing to unsustainable practices grounded in the depletion of global P reserves.  Therefore, understanding how plants adapt their root system to soil P levels is of paramount importance, especially as P deficiency induces significant changes in root system architecture very early in development. The primary objective of this project is to deepen the fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms governing early root growth in response to P deficiency in a model plant species.  The scientists conducting this project have discovered a crucial gene in a new P signaling pathway regulating early root growth. Based on this important discovery, they aim to determine a complete pathway controlling root growth in a P-dependent manner.  In addition to advancing knowledge, this project aims to disseminate research for education and training, engage under-represented students in research, and connect with high-school students.  The proposed work offers significant opportunities for student training, education, and outreach by integrating research results into undergraduate courses, utilizing program tools for summer internships for high school students and teachers, and communicating the research's importance at various events such as K-12 school fairs and Girls? Math and Science Days.<br/><br/>This project addresses the fundamental question of how plants adapt their growth in nutrient-deficient conditions, focusing on the root responses to P, an essential non-renewable mineral.  The researchers have identified a novel signaling pathway involving Arabidopsis Root-Specific Kinase 1 (ARSK1), a kinase playing a crucial role in controlling early root growth in Arabidopsis in response to low P.  The research focuses on defining the yet-unknown mechanisms for translational and post-translational regulation of ARSK1 dependent on P availability as well as the identity of the genes operating in the ARSK1-signaling pathway.  This project will employ a unique combination of state-of-the-art computational, biochemical, and molecular physiology approaches in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana.  Specifically, this project will investigate:  i) the regulation of ARSK1 expression by specific transcription factors at a molecular level; ii) the regulation of ARSK1 protein levels by a P-induced ubiquitin E3 ligase.  Finally, the research will validate the roles of the newly identified genes and of ARSK1 in regulating early root growth in a P-dependent manner.  The results of this project will increase understanding of the signaling cascade connecting nutrient levels with the control of organ growth.

Both proteins contain two histone reader domains, called TTD and PHD, which recognize the post-translational modification (PTM) status on histone H3 to regulate DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation and gene expression. While these proteins share a high degree of sequence similarity, UHRF1 and UHRF2 have distinct and important nuclear functions that are mediated via chromatin interactions. Although much is known on the detailed histone binding properties by the TTD and PHD of UHRF1, there is still limited understanding of the structure and biological function of the same domains in UHRF2.

This requires developers to gain a deep understanding of foundational concepts in secure programming, and continuously learn and practice defensive, secure, and robust coding. Given the current lack of consistent and comprehensive secure programming training in most computing programs, and the need for any training to evolve to meet new requirements, it is essential to have mechanisms that make secure programming training adaptive and intelligent. The goal for this project is to develop one such mechanism, named SecTutor, which is a dual-purpose adaptive testing and intelligent tutoring system. Using SecTutor, learners will be able to identify their current missing knowledge and areas of misunderstanding in secure programming, and access content to improve learning at their own pace. SecTutor will provide immediate feedback and learning analytics to motivate and guide learners.<br/><br/>The project will take an assessment-driven approach for personalized, self-directed learning: a rigorous assessment tests the learner's level of knowledge and skill so that the intelligent tutoring system can calibrate the instruction directly to the learner. Specifically, the first step of the project will be to construct an adaptive test to diagnose learners' current level of foundational understanding in secure programming. This adaptive test will be based on a rigorously constructed secure programming concept inventory. This test will also diagnose what topics the learner is finding difficult or is fundamentally not understanding. The next step of the project will be to build an intelligent tutorial system that will provide both content and guidance for the learner to master secure programming concepts and skills. The third step will be to incorporate learning analytics into the system that will not only provide feedback to individual learners, but also provide mechanisms for instructors to gather information about their learners, compare them to other demographics, analyze secure programming questions, and adapt their curriculum to address specific challenges or customized requirements. SecTutor will eventually be integrated into other existing secure programming resources and will be adopted broadly for secure programming training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through studying their structure and function, further knowledge will be gained on some of the essential processes that they are involved in such as regulation of the cell cycle and DNA repair. In addition, this project will provide research opportunities for a number of underrepresented students at Eastern Michigan University, a diverse, primarily undergraduate institution that values student-centered and inclusive learning. Over a dozen undergraduate students will be closely trained in research by a strong, collaborative duo of PIs with extensive backgrounds in mentoring future scientists and professionals. An additional 24 students will also receive the benefits of research through the continuation of a CURE-grant proposal Biochemistry Lab writing-intensive course (CHEM 453W). This project will also expand and strengthen an existing High School Research Experience at EMU program, which provides research training during the summer to students in grades 9-12 from the local Greater Detroit community.<br/><br/>UHRF1 and UHRF2 are multi-domain epigenetic proteins that play critical roles in a variety of processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and gene regulation. Both proteins contain two histone reader domains, called TTD and PHD, which recognize the post-translational modification (PTM) status on histone H3 to regulate DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation and gene expression. While these proteins share a high degree of sequence similarity, UHRF1 and UHRF2 have distinct and important nuclear functions that are mediated via chromatin interactions. Although much is known on the detailed histone binding properties by the TTD and PHD of UHRF1, there is still limited understanding of the structure and biological function of the same domains in UHRF2. This project will test if UHRF1 and UHRF2 exhibit distinct mode of histone binding and whether they can be specifically modulated by chemical probes. Elucidating the detailed differences between UHRF1 and UHRF2 will provide a greater understanding of the molecular requirements that dictate binding selectivity by these reader proteins. In addition, novel functionalities of UHRF2 may be uncovered by discovering new histone PTM binding partners and chemical probes that target UHRF2.

The theme of the Conference is ?Advances in Translational Applications of Imaging in Disease Diagnosis, Staging and Therapy.?  Ultrasound is a ubiquitous clinical imaging modality supported by a dynamic and scholarly research community. Until the inaugural Gordon Research Conference (GRC), no conference or professional meeting was explicitly dedicated to basic science ultrasound research with the goal of improving diagnostic ultrasound. The first GRC on in vivo ultrasound imaging found an exceptional reception and outstanding feedback. Discussion among the 2022 participants quickly demonstrated the strong need to propose a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). GRC and GRS will provide an intimate forum for scientific exchange among scientists and researchers whose primary area of research is the development of novel biomedical ultrasound techniques and approaches. The proposed inaugural GRS will feature 3 sessions with dedicated discussion leaders and 11 student speakers selected from abstract submissions. A 4-member panel discussion on mentorship will conclude the GRS and create a transition to the GRC for 5 days of fostering discourse and mentoring between trainees and researchers/educators.<br/><br/>The 2024 In Vivo Ultrasound Imaging Gordon Research Conference and Seminar is divided into two sections, the first section being in the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) format and the second in the Gordon Research Conference format.  This is the second GRC (first held in 2022) and first GRS on In Vivo Ultrasound Imaging.  The GRS, which is designed for graduate students and post docs and will be held prior to the GRC, will highlight innovations and applications of next generation functional ultrasound imaging and include a mentorship session.  The overall structures for both GRS and GRC sessions are the same.   Sessions with three of four speakers will be managed by discussion leaders. Presentations will be followed by ample discussion time.  Both sections host two poster sessions.  For the GRS sessions, 3 discussion leaders and 4 panel experts have been invited and the speakers will be selected from submitted abstracts.  For the GRC, 37 scientists with a focus in ultrasound research have been invited to attend as either invited speakers or discussion leaders.  Topics for the 3 GRS scientific sessions are:  Functional Imaging Modes, Functional Ultrasound Imaging in Therapeutic Applications, and Functional Ultrasound Neuroimaging.  Topics for the 8 GRC scientific sessions are:  Wearable Ultrasound Devices, Materials, and Application; Neuromodulation; Ultrasound Imaging and Therapy in Immunotherapy; Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound; Novel Uses of Contrast Agents; Lung Ultrasound; Applications of Machine Learning in Ultrasound; and Ultrasound Therapy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the other hand, security research quite often only focuses on a specific attack or even sub-components of it with a narrow scope. These constraints severely limit the opportunity in creating holistic, cross-disciplinary cybersecurity solutions. This project aims to develop a learner-centered co-pilot tool leveraging advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce attack scenarios and capture related data, which includes end-to-end attack interactions between the red team attacker and the cyber systems.  The resulting high-quality and structured attack artifact repository will be a highly valuable resource to the cyber security research community, especially for the test and validation of security solutions. <br/><br/>This project adopts large language model (LLM) to help cybersecurity research. Through an LLM adaptation approach, the red-team co-pilot will incorporate techniques such as prompt engineering, reasoning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and few-shot learning to guide users to emulate attack scenarios. The project will develop a curator-friendly methodology to enable the crowd-sourced aggregation of high-quality cyberattack artifacts associated with attack behaviors and system settings, when the tool is deployed in the research community.  The captured dataset contains both functional and behavioral aspects of attacks such as tactics, techniques, and procedures. A successful research outcome, including the tools generated, can help facilitate security benchmarking, AI-based penetration testing, adversarial modeling, and research reproducibility.  In addition, the red-team co-pilot brings a useful tool to cyber security education and workforce development since it offers an accessible, adaptive, reusable, and learner-centric platform for users to emulate attacks and develop cyber defense experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While promising, improvements to system reliability and lower costs are imperative for floating wind farms to begin playing a significant role in the transition to renewable energy sources. Key elements to enable both improved reliability and cost reductions include improved understanding of the complex fluid dynamical interactions between different types of ocean waves, turbulent winds in the marine atmospheric boundary layer, and multiple wind turbine wakes in floating wind farms as well as tools for their prediction. This project will develop and apply novel, accurate, and practical computational and experimental tools to probe these complex fluid dynamical interactions. It will fill knowledge and technology gaps in our ability to predict complex interactions between floating turbine wakes, prevailing winds, and wave fields. The project will help educate graduate students and include outreach activities with the Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Outreach to engage with local K-12 schools in Baltimore and the Oregon Science and Industry Museum in Portland to perform demonstrations of findings to a broader audience through their science communication program. <br/> <br/>The main goals of this project are to: (i) Develop improved and practically applicable surface flux parameterizations required for Large Eddy Simulations of the marine boundary layer above ocean waves. The novel computational framework uses simple non-deforming coarse meshes including a phase-resolving model with computational costs similar to traditional equilibrium wall models that cannot resolve wave phase-dependent phenomena. This approach is generally applicable to any non-breaking wavefield, from monochromatic to multi-frequency/omni-directional ocean-waves characterized by broad spectra. (ii) Improve experiment scaling concepts to better adapt laboratory-scale experiments to accurately reproduce relevant physics of field-scale floating wind farms and to generate pertinent experimental datasets to compare with models. Scaling is based on several newly defined dimensionless ratios involving turbine/platform inertia and flow-dependent parameters. Scaled laboratory experiments will simultaneously capture the turbulent wind velocity field, wave kinematics, and model wind turbine motion and generated power. (iii) Generate high quality experimental datasets under controlled conditions in wind-tunnel/wave tank laboratory experiments to test and validate the new LES wall modeling approaches under conditions of increasing complexity, elucidate conditions under which wind-wave-turbine interactions can increase or decrease power production, wake recovery, and unsteady structural loading strength, and finally, apply the improved computational and laboratory modeling tools to offshore conditions based on field data obtained along the US West Coast (relevant to floating wind energy applications). The outcome will be improved characterizations of floating turbine response such as unsteady loading as function of various wind and sea-states.

This CAREER project explores the postsecondary experiences of Black women currently enrolled in undergraduate computing degree programs to draw attention to racial and gender inequalities that Black women in computing endure. Despite efforts to intentionally increase the recruitment and retention of women in the field of computing, Black women remain acutely underrepresented. Gender-focused efforts have fallen short of increasing the number of Black women in computing because they fail to acknowledge how the intersection of race and gender shape Black women?s experiences, including their retention in the field of computing.<br/><br/>Recent studies reveal that Black women enrolled in undergraduate computing degree programs at predominantly white institutions (PWIs) attest to the lack of support, mentorship, and resources that impede their ability to complete their degrees. Some choose to withdraw from these programs. Such results suggest that additional research explicitly focused on Black women enrolled at PWIs is essential for addressing the underrepresentation of Black women in computing. It aligns with the recent National Academies of Science Report, which recommends examining the experiences of women of color at critical junctures throughout their career. This project leverages Black feminist epistemologies and Black women?s ways of knowing, as critical frameworks of this research. The project utilizes the concept of sister circles to create counter spaces to build community and resist structural oppression. Sister circles amplify the voices of Black women as they engage in intimate conversations about experiences navigating their respective computing degree programs students. Additionally, Black women undergraduate computing students will share information about how structural oppression operates in the context of computing education and devise strategies to resist structural oppression. Results from this research will generate empirical, in-depth knowledge of Black women undergraduate students? experiences in computing degree programs at PWIs, identifying critical inflection points during their progression that predict Black women?s ability to persist in computing. Additionally, a sister circle toolkit will be developed that enables PWIs to build an effective community of support for Black women in computing. This community includes access to near-peer mentors, resources, and information about career development opportunities as a countermeasure to the oppression and trauma that Black women experience in higher education.

One way to study biodiversity is to use functional traits, or physical characteristics, which determine how animals interact with their surroundings. For example, the shape of ankle bones is related to the type of habitat, such as forest or grassland, where animals live. The study of relationships between traits and environments, also called ecometrics, enables researchers to study animals that lived at different times or in different places. Researchers can use the fossil record to learn how animals responded to environmental changes in the past and to predict how animals might respond in the future. This project will facilitate collaboration between two early career researchers, training for two graduate students, and research experiences for undergraduate students. Outcomes of this project will be presented to the public through a student-led exhibit at the South Dakota Mines Museum of Geology.<br/><br/>This project will use the extensive fossil record and the modern natural ecosystems of Wind Cave National Park (WICA) to better understand mammal assemblages and their relationships with the environment across space and time. The researchers will examine four WICA fossil sites spanning several glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) periods over the last ~200,000 years. They will also source data on the mammals living within WICA today. By combining these data, the researchers will generate estimates of the direction and size of change at each site over time and into the future. First, this project will assess changes in community diversity, including the types of species present and the ecological roles they occupy, by studying past mammal assemblages that are housed at the South Dakota Mines Museum of Geology. Second, this project will use ecometric models of functional trait-environment relationships to identify how these mammal communities respond to environmental change through time. Third, this project will use climate projections to estimate what traits might be necessary for future faunal communities to be successful in this region.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Population and Community Ecology cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Biological Infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, ""age"", ""smoking or not"", and ""years of smoking"" are features of a patient, which can be used to describe the patient's physical condition, and furthermore, to predict if she or he is likely to get lung cancer. A combination of features could be more helpful to the prediction, e.g., ""age"" minus ""years of smoking"" can be a new feature to indicate how early the patient starts smoking. This kind of feature combination is called feature generation. In the big data era, there exist enormous numbers of features, and it is not realistic to generate features manually by human experts. This project will build new technologies to automatically generate new features based on existing features, to better describe the objects, and to gain better prediction performance. Additionally, this project aims to substantially improve the traceability, affordability, and explainability during the generation process. The developed algorithms and tools are expected to be generalized and applicable to a broad range of scientific and engineering problems, not just in feature generation, but also in other domains such as data pre-processing, social analysis, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare, and the internet of things. <br/><br/>This project identifies three research tasks: (i) A Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to realize traceability. Two RL agents are used to select appropriate features, and one RL agent is used to select the appropriate operation. The policy network will be decomposed into two sub-networks, i.e., representation network and value network. Different agents will share the value network to improve training convergence. (ii) A heuristic approach to realize affordability. Information theory-based utility scores will be designed to evaluate features and feature sets, and the heuristic selection strategy will be designed in the generation process. (iii) A Large Language Model (LLM) based approach to realize explainability. The tabular data will be serialized into natural language strings, and comprehensive prompts will be designed incorporating feature generation expertise and domain expertise. The LLM can generate features with explanations by fine-tuning it with prompts. Two strategies will be proposed to compress the prompt. The proposed research will provide novel perspectives and methodologies as to how to generate new features by advancing the understanding and designing new generation strategies. They go beyond conventional generation methodologies that are highly dependent on domain knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rechargeable sodium batteries and rechargeable potassium batteries are attractive alternatives to the well-known lithium ion battery, which are widely used in electric cars, electronic, and energy storage.  Research activities will involve graduate, undergraduate, high school, and middle school students.

Carboxylate compounds, with their advantages of lightweight and low cost, stand out as promising anode materials for rechargeable sodium batteries and rechargeable potassium batteries.  However, they can suffer from low Coulombic efficiency and slow reaction kinetics.  Professors Chao Luo and Andre Clayborne plan to overcome these limitations by studying functional groups, heteroatoms, conjugation structure, structural isomerism, and interfacial chemistry in conjunction with computation chemistry and data analytics.  Innovative structure design and facile fabrication approaches will be developed to synthesize carboxylate-based organic anodes.

As a result, these systems are handling an increasing amount of data, including potentially sensitive user data. Concurrently, architectures such as adaptive neural networks show promise in addressing the high memory and workload requirements of deep neural networks. However, these adaptive neural networks are susceptible to a class of vulnerabilities called timing side channels through which timing observations are leveraged to learn sensitive information about private user input. The project's novelties are providing the first investigation into the potential of adaptive neural networks to leak private user information through timing channels and developing strategies to effectively mitigate this leakage while still reaping the benefits of more efficient adaptive neural networks. The project's broader significance and importance are enabling the development of adaptive neural networks able to balance privacy requirements with performance demands, allowing them to be confidently deployed on devices such as mobile phones or small smart devices.  <br/><br/>This project provides the first holistic and systematic approach to understanding timing side channels in adaptive neural networks. The contributions of the project include: (1) defining a threat model under which timing side channels can be exploited by an attacker to gain sensitive information, (2) a machine-learning-based pipeline to effectively utilize the timing channels under this attack model, (3) an automated fuzzing-based approach to guide development of models towards those without potential timing channels, and (4) an online monitoring framework to dynamically check the balance of privacy, accuracy, and performance in deployed systems. The approaches in this project are generalizable across a variety of types of user data and adaptive neural network architectures, and the work will lead to advancements in automated testing of machine learning frameworks for violations of user privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is significant because there is a great need for a more diverse faculty pool in BME to continue to educate and inspire BME undergraduates, a group that is becoming larger and more diverse every year. In addition, diversity of BME faculty increases diversity among research projects, improving the field of biomedical engineering and seeking to assist in decreasing health disparities. A cohort of 25 diverse BME PhD students from all sexual orientations, racial and ethnic groups, socio-economic status and some who are first generation in their family college-bound, will be selected to participate, receive a $500 honorarium, and have their travel and lodging expenses reimbursed. They will learn about the pathways to becoming a BME faculty member and the opportunities they then will have to make an impact on education and research. They will learn about the tools needed to build a successful academic career in BME, and they will meet a diverse group of mentors and future collaborators, expanding their professional network.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, biomedical engineering (BME) faculty nationwide have recognized significant attrition in graduating PhDs with an interest in careers in academia. This has manifested as fewer candidates for postdoctoral research associate positions, a critical period for the transition from student to independent scientist. The associated loss of postdoctoral researchers' talent greatly threatens the vitality of our research workforce in the US and our nation?s ability to broaden the representation of faculty from all sexual orientations, racial and ethnic groups, socio-economic and first generation to college status, and religions. There has been a significant loss of talent within the mid region of the U.S. despite it being a haven for biomedical industry partnerships and startups begun by BME faculty. Initial discussions revealed that BME graduates in the Midwest did not believe it possible to identify career-building post-graduate research opportunities without uprooting partners and families or moving away from their deep community connections. Thus, in June 2022, seven universities across the Midwest region came together to host the inaugural 2022 Rising BME Scholars Regional Career Conference at Washington University, and a second one in 2023 at the University of Minnesota. The goal of this regional conference is to ?inspire, strengthen and diversify the next generation of academic researchers in BME? by encouraging underrepresented Ph.D. students and providing them with the practical skills and confidence needed to apply and succeed in academia. In 2024 we propose to offer a new version of the conference at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), with significant modifications based on feedback from the first two events. Per previous participant feedback, new topics will include alternative career paths for BME faculty in academia, such as focusing on teaching and education research, as well as work/life balance. RSC participants will also learn from BME faculty from UIC and the eight other sponsoring institutions about opportunities to engage in research and education to decrease health disparities. Looking forward, we expect to have a critical mass of prior participants we can survey annually to get their perspective on the conference?s impact and their current career trajectory. We anticipate this conference will not only positively impact its participants, but through follow-up surveys will help us identify programming and strategies that have the lasting impact. The UIC environment is well-suited for this conference as it is among the nation?s top ten most diverse campuses and is designated a Minority Serving Institution (MSI) and Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These changes are driven by the genes of the organisms, their interactions with each other, and their interactions with a fluctuating biotic and abiotic environment. Some organisms communicate with each other about their local environment, and this communication may influence population dynamics. This project uses the small roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans to study communication between animals in populations through chemical signals. C. elegans is a powerful genetic model organism with ideal characteristics for studying population dynamics (e.g., a short lifecycle of three days, can be inexpensively grown in the lab in large numbers). Chemical signals help C. elegans to survive famines by sending some of them into diapause (i.e. a kind of hibernation), but many questions remain about how communication at the individual level corresponds to the properties of entire populations. Studying how populations react to changes in their environment is an important step to improve model forecasting of populations for pest control or conservation of wild species.  Another important goal of the project is to promote a diverse and strong future science work force by enhancing research opportunities for undergraduate students in the researcher?s rural community through paid hands-on experience in the lab. In addition, the project will include outreach to local schools and colleges providing opportunities for students to engage in hypothesis-driven research through computer modeling of population dynamics. <br/><br/>This project aims to understand how pheromone signaling and the dauer diapause stage of C. elegans influence population dynamics in different environmental conditions. Two recently established research tools will be used to (1) determine the effect of dauer pheromone communication on C. elegans population dynamics in a laboratory system, and (2) define the impact of responsiveness to dauer pheromone and starvation on C. elegans population dynamics in a realistic agent-based computer model. Mutant strains and wild isolates with variations in genes that influence pheromone signaling will be used to rigorously test the function of pheromones for population dynamics.

While promising, improvements to system reliability and lower costs are imperative for floating wind farms to begin playing a significant role in the transition to renewable energy sources. Key elements to enable both improved reliability and cost reductions include improved understanding of the complex fluid dynamical interactions between different types of ocean waves, turbulent winds in the marine atmospheric boundary layer, and multiple wind turbine wakes in floating wind farms as well as tools for their prediction. This project will develop and apply novel, accurate, and practical computational and experimental tools to probe these complex fluid dynamical interactions. It will fill knowledge and technology gaps in our ability to predict complex interactions between floating turbine wakes, prevailing winds, and wave fields. The project will help educate graduate students and include outreach activities with the Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Outreach to engage with local K-12 schools in Baltimore and the Oregon Science and Industry Museum in Portland to perform demonstrations of findings to a broader audience through their science communication program. <br/> <br/>The main goals of this project are to: (i) Develop improved and practically applicable surface flux parameterizations required for Large Eddy Simulations of the marine boundary layer above ocean waves. The novel computational framework uses simple non-deforming coarse meshes including a phase-resolving model with computational costs similar to traditional equilibrium wall models that cannot resolve wave phase-dependent phenomena. This approach is generally applicable to any non-breaking wavefield, from monochromatic to multi-frequency/omni-directional ocean-waves characterized by broad spectra. (ii) Improve experiment scaling concepts to better adapt laboratory-scale experiments to accurately reproduce relevant physics of field-scale floating wind farms and to generate pertinent experimental datasets to compare with models. Scaling is based on several newly defined dimensionless ratios involving turbine/platform inertia and flow-dependent parameters. Scaled laboratory experiments will simultaneously capture the turbulent wind velocity field, wave kinematics, and model wind turbine motion and generated power. (iii) Generate high quality experimental datasets under controlled conditions in wind-tunnel/wave tank laboratory experiments to test and validate the new LES wall modeling approaches under conditions of increasing complexity, elucidate conditions under which wind-wave-turbine interactions can increase or decrease power production, wake recovery, and unsteady structural loading strength, and finally, apply the improved computational and laboratory modeling tools to offshore conditions based on field data obtained along the US West Coast (relevant to floating wind energy applications). The outcome will be improved characterizations of floating turbine response such as unsteady loading as function of various wind and sea-states.

Microplastics have been the subject of significant concern in recent years due to their potential incorporation into the food chain and their capacity to harm plants and animals. Microplastics can degrade further into environmental nanoplastics: particles of plastic waste smaller than a biological cell. Because they are so small, nanoplastics have been hard to isolate from the environment and have proven a stubbornly difficult class of materials to study. This project will develop a library of laboratory-created nanoplastic particles that mimic the size, shape, and composition of nanoplastics isolated from river water. This library will facilitate a detailed study of how nanoplastics can interact with, damage, and degrade the lipid bilayer membrane that serves as the boundary of cells. There is much evidence that engineered plastic nanoparticles can damage cell membranes, but these engineered particles are uniform in shape and composition. Environmental nanoplastics on the other hand are highly irregular and diverse. Identifying how these characteristics of irregular shape, size, and chemical composition control the interactions between environmental nanoplastics and cells is key to understanding how plastic pollution can be biologically harmful. The research project will incorporate a set of training and outreach efforts designed to train undergraduate and high-school students in the physical biology of environmental plastics. These efforts will include a summer undergraduate research program in collaboration with the Wrigley Institute at the university that will take students from field studies of plastic waste to laboratory investigations of nanoparticle-membrane interactions. Two high-school interns will engage in afterschool research in each year of the project.<br/><br/><br/>Sub-millimeter particles of plastic waste are broadly distributed in the environment, with particularly high concentrations in waterways, lakes, and oceans. Environmental nanoplastic particles are particularly concerning due to their capacity to infiltrate biological tissues on the sub-micron scale and to interact on the cellular level. In understanding these interactions, it is critical to consider how nanoparticles encounter and damage the key cellular interface?the plasma membrane. Research has demonstrated that nanoparticulate materials interact with cell membranes: they can deform, permeate, and damage cell membranes. The particles that have been studied so far, however, are engineered materials that are perfectly spherical, uniformly sized, with surface ligands that control charge and stability, and made of only polystyrene. Environmental nanoplastics are radically different: irregularly shaped, polydisperse in size, with surface properties determined by their environmental history, and with a diverse chemical makeup. This project leaps over this gap?transforming the understanding of membrane-nanoparticle interactions by putting real-world environmental nanoplastics under the literal microscope. This project executes three tasks: (1) Develop tools for creating plastic particles that mimic environmental nanoplastics and isolate these nanoplastics from environmental sources. (2) Discover how as-isolated mixtures of environmental nanoplastics can alter cell membrane morphology, integrity, permeability, and rigidity. (3) Understand how specific environmental nanoplastic characteristics (shape, size, protein coating) contribute to cell membrane damage. To accomplish these objectives, the team will use a suite of tools for understanding engineered nanoparticle-cell interactions and leverage new resources being developed at the University of Southern California to study environmental plastic pollution. The research project will incorporate a set of training and outreach efforts designed to train undergraduate and high-school students in the physical biology of environmental plastics. These efforts will include a summer undergraduate research program in collaboration with the Wrigley Institute at the university that will take students from field studies of plastic waste to laboratory investigations of nanoparticle-membrane interactions.

Malicious attackers target even encrypted devices to steal confidential information using advanced techniques. Side-channel attacks, which exploit various sources of leakage such as power consumption, timing data, and electromagnetic (EM) emissions from a computing device during data handling processes, are commonly utilized to breach the security of integrated circuits (ICs). Due to their cost-effectiveness and potentially non-intrusive methods, these attacks pose a significant threat to the confidentiality of personal, commercial, and military data. This project leverages the synergetic collaborative effort between the USA and Indian research teams to provide security against power and EM side-channel attacks at different abstraction levels, including EM analysis, circuit/logic/layout design, and architectural/system-level choices. The project develops secure libraries and tools that can be used by circuit design engineers and a scientific methodology to evaluate EM and power side-channels in custom ICs. The outcome of this project makes a positive impact on the electronics industry through security-aware design, pre-Silicon side-channel vulnerability analysis, and quantifying security using commercial design tools. This project also provides integrative, multidisciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students on a multitude of technical areas such as security-aware circuit, layout and package design, development of custom tool flows, and characterization/quantification of security on hardware devices. This project also fosters increased collaboration between USA and Indian researchers, potentially setting the foundations for long-term engagement and scientific partnerships.<br/> <br/> <br/>The project team's technical approach entails a massive co-design of electromagnetics, materials, circuits and architecture for secure IC design. To this end, this USA team conducts the research on modeling of the EM and power side channels for various real-world devices, along with the design and analysis of on-chip side-channel countermeasures.  The Indian research team leads the pre-silicon side-channel security analysis for EM and power, as well as standard cell library design for security enhancement. The design of the side-channel secure standard-cell library utilizes a novel split-pole based CMOS design methodology that creates complementary dipoles to cancel EM emanation at the gate level. This effort is complemented with side-channel aware on-chip global routes utilizing dipole, quadrupole, and higher order EM emission characteristics, which helps in reducing EM side-channel leakage resulting from long on-chip metal lines. Designing encryption cores with the side-channel secure standard cell library is further benefitted from a configurable, design-tool-friendly version of a custom current-domain signature attenuation circuit. The research team is also exploring design-tool-aware and timing-aware clock path optimization techniques to reduce the EM and power side-channels.

Traditional monitoring methods only identify toxins after a HAB event has occurred, thus reacting to rather than preventing the outbreak. Recognizing the urgent need for proactive environmental monitoring strategies, this ERI project will address this critical gap and introduce a transformative approach utilizing a novel biosensing technology, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The overarching goal of this project is to develop a highly sensitive and selective biosensor based on CRISPR-Cas12a technology coupled with a novel magnetic bead-based reporter for the early detection of the microcystin synthetase gene (mcy), the prerequisite in the production of the most prevalent cyanotoxins (i.e., microcystins) during HABs. The successful completion of this project will benefit society by advancing our capability to predict cyanobacterial HABs in a timely and accurate manner with the goal of reducing their adverse impacts on public health, ecosystems, and the economy. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through educational outreach activities and student training, including the mentoring of one graduate student and two undergraduate students at Clarkson University.<br/><br/>Microcystins produced by toxic cyanobacteria during Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) pose severe threats to human health and ecosystems and lead to enormous economic loss. Current monitoring methods focused on microcystins do not have proactive features as the toxins become detectable usually after the outbreak of a HAB event. A breakthrough in the monitoring methodology is identifying the microcystin synthetase (mcy) gene, the prerequisite of microcystin production by microcystin-producing strains. However, the mcy gene detection by conventional PCR-based methods requires significant capital investment, high operational costs, experienced personnel, and a long lead time. The goal of this ERI project is to develop a highly selective and sensitive biosensor for rapid and simplified detection of the mcy gene by implementing the revolutionary clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technique with a novel magnetic bead (MB)-enhanced reporter. The specific objectives of the research are to 1) design and optimize the CRISPR-Cas12a/crRNA complex for the mcyE gene detection; 2) develop an MB-based reporter for enhanced CRISPR-Cas12a-derived fluorescence signals; 3) investigate the matrix effects and demonstrate the MB-enhanced CRISPR-Cas12a-powered biosensing system using lake water samples.

Over recent decades, climate change-induced ocean warming has resulted in worldwide bleaching and death of corals, with the loss of more than 30% of coral reefs. However, there is wide variability in coral response to heat stress; some corals have developed resilience to thermal stress due to an unknown combination of genetic and gene expression effects. Current conservation efforts are breeding heat-resistant corals to create more resilient stocks, but this could take decades with the slow growth rate of corals. Coral reefs are running out of time. This project proposes an approach to increase the resiliency of coral reefs that will quickly impart physiological changes that improve the corals? survival to heat stress. This project focuses on developing optical imaging techniques that can understand the role of gene expression in heat stress resiliency. This project also trains undergraduate and predoctoral students to improve the retention of underrepresented groups in STEM careers.<br/><br/>Increasingly frequent and intense climate change-derived ocean warming episodes have caused coral bleaching and mortality worldwide, resulting in the collapse of many reef ecosystems. However, because coral species show differential bleaching responses to thermal stress, their potential for acclimatization or adaptation warrants investigation. Coral thermal tolerance involves an unknown combination of genetic effects (adaptation, such as inheritable ?heat-resistant genes?) and epigenetic effects (acclimatization, such as changes in overall gene transcription not caused by changes in the underlying DNA). While current restoration efforts are accelerating adaptation by breeding heat-resistant corals, this process can take decades due to the slow growth of corals. Instead, this project proposes development of an epigenetic-based method to increase coral?s transcriptional plasticity and survival in heat stress. Recent advances in mammalian cells have identified the key role chromatin remodeling (changes in the DNA-protein complex structure that regulates gene transcription) plays in gene expression plasticity. This project seeks to test the novel frontier field of regulating transcriptional plasticity in corals by engineering chromatin structure to increase their resilience to heat stress. The project will develop several complementary biophotonics (nanoscale optical imaging and nanosening) technologies for image chromatin remodeling. The project will also develop a model that relates transcriptional plasticity with chromatin conformation and bleaching survival, which can integrate chromatin remodeling imaging with state-of-the-art transcriptomics and chromatin sequencing techniques during a simulated coral heat stress event under controlled conditions. The overarching objective is to use transcriptional reprogramming as a tool to build coral reef resilience to thermal stress as global climate change intensifies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While animal host-microbiome research has focused on captive mammals, the diversity of wild reptile species and populations have been largely neglected. This project will investigate the acquisition, assembly, and function of microbial communities within Puerto Rican reptiles, spanning all twelve families native to the island. Long-term monitoring sites will be established where entire reptile communities can be regularly surveyed and will contribute genetic samples and voucher specimens to track community changes over time. Beyond scientific advancement, the project entails broader impacts that foster diversity and inclusion in STEM fields. Undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups will gain training and experience in fieldwork and molecular methods, as well as animal care and experimental design thereby broadening participation in science and preparing students for STEM careers. The project will establish course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagez, offering hands-on field and laboratory training. Outreach efforts will extend to K-12 schools and local communities, providing real-time demonstrations and opportunities for high school students to engage in summer research assistantships. Ultimately, this research will contribute not only to scientific understanding of microbiome function and host conservation but also to the cultivation of a more inclusive scientific community.<br/><br/>There are currently no community-wide microbiome surveys of reptile hosts, and this project will fill this critical knowledge gap. The project seeks to address questions that reveal the roles of host ecology, evolutionary history, and geographic location in shaping reptile microbiomes, the mechanisms of microbiome transmission and impacts of emergent pathogens through data collection from next generation DNA sequencing. Sampling from natural populations will test whether both epithelial ectodermal and endogenous (gut) microbiome communities from reptile host species assemble predictably according to island size. Hosts? microbiomes will be analyzed to determine whether ecological drivers, like niche specialization, geographic distribution, diets and captive environments, or evolutionary (phylogenetic) history are strongly correlated with variation among associated microbiome communities.  Laboratory experiments will test whether the mode of acquisition of microbiomes by reptile species differs between oviparous and viviparous life histories. The role of the microbiome in host-pathogen dynamics in captive and wild populations will be assessed along with monitoring of emergent disease in reptiles of Puerto Rico. The project not only informs host-microbiome dynamics of Puerto Rican reptiles but will provide baseline data for species with high invasion potential, thus informing conservation strategies on a global scale.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Biological Infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, much of the progress in AI has come from training on massive publicly available datasets, such as, all of the images and text found on the Internet. By contrast, many important real-world problems depend on scarce or highly specific data that still must be captured manually. For example, consider the task of monitoring a crack in the foundation of an aging bridge, where the goal is to predict whether and when repairs should be made to ensure the safety of travelers. Or the case of monitoring a patient's wound outside of hospital settings. Solutions to these problems cannot be found on the Internet; they require specific knowledge about a specific subject at a specific time. This project focuses on developing mobile applications to help regular users capture information that experts - e.g., doctors, scientists, and engineers - need to make important decisions. The project will also integrate research with education and outreach to high school students and teachers from underrepresented communities.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the development of applications for domain-specific data capture on ubiquitous devices. The project will combine novel interaction design with adaptive tracking and registration strategies to build systems that help users capture target distributions of field data important to different downstream tasks. These systems will include tools that make it easy for experts to define target distributions of important observations, which can then be used to guide the collection of field data by non-experts using custom mobile applications. These applications will also allow the capturing users to update and adapt target distributions according to evolving field conditions. The project will further leverage guided capture systems to enable new types of visualization and analysis and develop tools to efficiently label captured data. The research integrates three key components into the design of these novel systems: (1) mobile tracking and registration; (2) reconstruction, visualization, and analysis; and (3) user interaction design and real-time guidance through Augmented Reality (AR). The integration of these components will help enable new applications. For example, new mobile tracking and registration abilities make it possible to register mobile devices against more complex target distributions, allowing us to offer more precise guidance for a broader range of downstream tasks. This integration makes the work highly interdisciplinary, with contributions in computer vision, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction, as well as collaboration with domain experts in downstream application domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For ethane, in particular, the overall process is extremely energy-intensive resulting in huge emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2).  Catalytic processes offer opportunities to reduce the energy demands and associated CO2 emissions, but are hampered by the formation of carbon deposits (i.e., coke) on the catalyst surface, and coalescence of the small platinum (Pt) catalyst particles into larger particles ? both of which decrease the catalyst performance and require frequent catalyst regeneration.  The project addresses both deactivation modes via a novel class of catalysts known as MXenes.  Recently, the investigators developed an atomically thin Pt nanolayer catalyst supported on a molybdenum-titanium-carbon MXene.  The catalyst was evaluated for the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane and propane into ethylene and propylene, and, as compared to Pt nanoparticles, the Pt nanolayer catalyst showed superior coke-resistance, sinter-resistance, high activity and selectivity toward ethylene and propylene.  Nevertheless, further advances in catalyst design are needed for commercial use.<br/>  <br/>The project will advance the basic science of heterogeneous catalysis by addressing a critical gap in understanding the stability of the unique Pt nanolayer/Mo 2TiC2 MXene catalyst.  A multidisciplinary research approach will be undertaken, involving materials synthesis, in situ/operando characterization, theoretical computation, kinetics measurement, and reaction-diffusion model development.  Collectively, the research thrusts will provide foundational insights related to the stability and coking resistance of MXene-supported Pt-group catalysts, thus providing a basis for improved catalyst formulations and designs.  Beyond the technical aspects, the knowledge gained from this project will foster the development of a skilled technical workforce and drive innovation in the chemical and petroleum industries. The multidisciplinary research and the integration of research and education will provide both undergraduate and graduate students with a unique training experience in materials science, catalysis science, reaction engineering, computational chemistry, and kinetic modeling.

Notable challenges include processing emotional speech and speech in noisy environments and generating speech that represents the characteristics and expressiveness of specific speakers such as personality traits, mood, prosody, and emotional state. These challenges are exacerbated by a limited availability of data. Improving such capabilities will have a wide range of social impacts ranging from giving natural voice to patients who have lost it to rendering comprehensible and speaker faithful renderings of old poor quality recordings that have become hard to understand to generating seamless speech translations in real time communications while staying faithful to the voice characteristics of the speaker. To address these challenges, the project proposes to explore and expand theories about speaker identity, emotion, and expressiveness in challenging conditions. Practically, this means studying how factors like background noise, emotions such as stress, cultural differences or other idiosyncratic ways of speaking affect a system?s ability to recognize and render faithfully the speech of a specific individual. This work will enable a second aim of this project which is to create voice technology that can be used for safeguarding ethical and responsible use of voice generation. Sophisticated voice conversion techniques can be used to detect and prevent spoofing and other fraudulent activities and make it challenging for unauthorized users to mimic or imitate target speakers. Besides security and defense other areas that will benefit from this project include security and defense, accessibility and healthcare assistive technologies, medical voice preservation, speech therapy and rehabilitations as well as entertainment and gaming.<br/><br/><br/>This award aims to develop novel algorithms utilizing deep learning techniques to advance voice conversion models with the ability to represent faithfully the characteristics and emotional states of individual speech. The project includes the following key areas of research. The first research target is to explore learning speaker identity and emotion representations for robust voice conversion with self-supervision. By investigating joint representations, this project seeks to develop a deeper understanding of how speaker characteristics and emotions can be effectively transformed. The second research target is to investigate voice conversion solutions for challenging conditions such as noisy environment, emotional speakers, and limited training to enhance the expressiveness and naturalness of the converted speech. The third research target is to investigate novel deep learning techniques for the detection of synthetic voices and joint training strategies to further improve voice conversion performance and evaluation. By exploring the synergies between transformation and detection of synthetic voices, this project has the potential to significantly impact society with a) accurate and expressive voice-based applications and b) applying the same techniques to detect when speech is naturally occurring or synthetic for the prevention of spoofing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consent is important when people interact, especially in contexts such as relationships where unwelcome behaviors might become physical or sexual harms. Often these harms are not intentional, but occur because of misperceptions of consent: for instance, when people make assumptions about other people's comfort with certain behaviors. These harms occur online as well as offline, as relationships can be enacted in a range of systems from discussion forums to dating sites to virtual worlds, while existing tools for managing behavior such as language filters or contact blockers do not address the underlying issue of helping people establish agreement to interpersonal behavior. This project seeks to fundamentally transform approaches to preventing harms that happen unintentionally through designing, developing, and evaluating use of consent technologies: devices, applications, and interfaces for giving and receiving permission around interpersonal behavior. The knowledge produced through this project will benefit the public through creation of entirely new approaches to reducing harms like sexual violence, ultimately leading to a safer society. <br/><br/>The research plan is organized around three main activities. The first involves new computer-mediated consent models that explicitly address the actions of humans and technology in determining consent around interpersonal behaviors. These consent models would be developed through bringing together consent experts and technology users from demographics at disproportionate risk of being either victims or sources of sexual violence. The second activity involves development of interpersonal consent technologies created in collaboration with anticipated users to discover factors driving user acceptance and usability, including in emerging mediums such as augmented reality and virtual reality. The third activity includes empirical studies of the consent technologies' impacts on interpersonal behavior in settings in which individuals looking for romantic and sexual partners will use the technologies across online and in-person interactions and then report on their experiences. Along with the research, the project team will develop educational materials for both undergraduate students and the general public to increase awareness of the problem and the work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This influence is evident during El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Interannual ENSO variations in the tropical Pacific drive large shifts in global weather patterns, including regional rainfall extremes that can lead to floods, droughts, and wildfires. Decade-to-decade changes in the tropical Pacific also have large impacts on global climate, including the rate and pattern of global warming. Thus, to predict future changes in global climate and weather extremes we must know about the long-term state of the tropical Pacific and about changes in ENSO variability. However, the impacts of human activities since the start of the Industrial Revolution on conditions in the tropical Pacific are poorly known. This limits our ability to predict climate for the coming decades. Direct climate observations from the central equatorial Pacific are sparse prior to 1950, but this data gap can be filled by records of climate from geologic archives such as corals, tree rings, and ice cores. This project will use precisely dated coral records from the central equatorial Pacific to produce a record of ocean temperature since about 1800. This temperature record will be compared with climate model simulations to understand the observed trends and variability in ocean temperature, and their impact on climate. The project will support research by both graduate and undergraduate students. It will also develop outreach videos aimed at K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/><br/>The project aims to generate up to 20 new precisely-dated records of monthly-resolved sea-surface temperature and hydrological variability in the central tropical Pacific during the period from 1800-1950CE using paired oxygen isotope and trace element measurements in modern and fossil corals from Kiritimati Island (2N, 157W). The proposed work builds on the success of recent ""ensemble"" approaches to coral-based climate reconstruction that allow for the development of high-fidelity, monthly-resolved records tropical Pacific climate with explicit quantification of uncertainties, grounded in calibration of modern corals against instrumental climate records over recent decades. Moreover, the application of paired coral d18O and Sr/Ca analyses allows for the separate identification of temperature and hydrological trends over the last centuries - filling critical data gaps and allowing for detailed data-model intercomparison with advanced ocean state reanalyses products. The proposed work includes the application of a wide variety of strategies to assess the robustness of the coral-based climate records, including detailed analysis of sample preservation, as geochemical alteration can introduce significant artifacts into coral-based climate reconstructions if it goes undetected. If successful, the proposed work would provide a blueprint for the extension of the short instrumental climate record throughout the Pacific Ocean, utilizing samples from extensive coral rubble fields that are present on many ocean islands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, this project is funded by the Division of Environmental Biology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>All multicellular organisms pass through different stages in their life cycle. These stages may differ in the number of cells, the number of chromosomes per cell, or the arrangement of genetic information on the chromosomes.  For example, humans have two life stages: the haploid stage consists of eggs or sperm, and the diploid stage extends from embryo to adult.  These alternating stages make a life cycle.  Across the natural world, there is an amazing diversity in the duration and complexity of life cycles.  This project will expand our understanding of this diversity by linking predictions about life cycles and reproductive variation.  Understanding the convergence of these two fundamental organismal traits ? the life cycle and reproduction ? is crucial for predicting how species are likely to respond to environmental challenges.  Common garden experiments and DNA analysis of a widespread seaweed will allow the investigators to explore these connections. The research plan is enhanced by a month-long field course for undergraduates, in which students learn about algae in marine and freshwater ecosystems.  Students in this course also collect data for the two main research aims. In addition, research is coordinated with the Alabama Water Watch and the Cahaba River Society.  Coordination with these groups increases scientific and environmental literacy in Birmingham and across Alabama.<br/><br/>The researchers leverage a widespread seaweed that has become invasive where it has been introduced in the Northern Hemisphere.  Upon invasion, the diploid stage predominates.  The project investigates how the life cycle of this alga has responded to the process of invasion, thus permitting a test of the connections between life cycles and reproduction.  Two sets of experiments address two major questions.  The first set of experiments distinguish between predictions of ecological and genetic models.  Here, researchers carry out common garden experiments to reveal how different genotypes respond to environmental conditions important to an intertidal alga, such as salinity and temperature. According to ecological predictions, the two life stages should respond differently.  The second set of experiments evaluates how the relative length of the diploid and haploid stages affect the reproductive system. To investigate this question, DNA is sampled from natural populations of the seaweed?s native and introduced range.  Population genetic analysis determines whether a prolonged haploid stage affects seaweed reproduction.  Specifically, it can detect whether the seaweeds mate by outcrossing, self-fertilization or asexual propagation, and whether this reproductive strategy varies depending on the different type of life cycle.  Together, the results of these experiments provide unique insight into the ways in which life cycles and reproductive strategies are interdependent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In elementary schools, science is often taught utilizing English language arts best practices. Children read about and memorize science facts instead of engaging in science practices to develop scientific knowledge. In efforts to build prospective elementary science teacher understanding of, ability to, and preparedness for teaching using model-based inquiry (MBI) the project aims to situate MBI into a physical science course. The Modeling for Understanding Physical Phenomena and Engaging Teachers in Science (MUPPETS) project will develop a physical science course for prospective elementary teachers (to be taken prior to the science education methods course) in which the preservice teachers are learners of science in an environment that utilizes science education research-based pedagogical approaches. Pre-service teacher gain experience learning science using techniques well suited for elementary students and in accordance with the Next Generation Science Standards. When prospective elementary teachers enter the science education methods course, the physical science course experience is a familiar context to draw upon, an opportunity not typically found in elementary education teacher preparation programs.<br/><br/>The purpose of the MUPPETS project is to determine how prospective elementary teachers engage with model-based inquiry (MBI) that centers on gathering and making sense of data and peer-to-peer discourse. More specifically, this project seeks to understand how making sense of phenomena through collaborative discussions influences the composition and substance of models and explanations across model iterations to establish the impact on their understanding of (1) physical science, science, and universal epistemological views; (2) meta-modeling knowledge; and (3) modeling practice. Data is analyzed using a mixed-methods approach employing a quantitative analysis of pre-and post-survey data to assess prospective elementary teachers? views of knowledge (epistemology) and meta-modeling knowledge before and after engaging in MBI. The qualitative data component of the research includes the observed written explanations and think-aloud protocol to characterize types of modeling practice that pre-service elementary teachers use to explain phenomena through the visual, written, and oral representations they create across five sets of iterative models. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

While genetically engineered crop genes can give helpful traits like pesticide resistance to crops, some can also be harmful if they are released in the environment. Antibiotic resistance genes (?ARGs?) and silencing RNA genes are two examples of genes that are potentially harmful. ARGs can increase the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment, which is a threat to public health. Silencing RNA genes can affect the genetic material of other organisms and the behavior of these genes in the environment is not well understood. Persistent pollutants like microplastics have been shown to make these genes more stable in the environment, making it more likely that they can be transported widely and negatively affect beneficial organisms. The goal of this research is to assess the transport, persistence, and uptake of ARGs and silencing RNA genes that are attached to microplastics in the environment. Understanding how genetically engineered crop genes behave in the environment is important for many fields including agriculture, medicine, and water treatment. The results have strong potential to advance knowledge and benefit society through the development of risk-based management policies to protect health by minimizing the spread of harmful genes. <br/><br/>The use of genetically engineered (GE) crops has remained controversial due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate fate and potential impacts the engineered genes can have on the surrounding environment. Common transgenes contained in modern GE crops include ARGs and silencing RNAs that have recently been detected in wastewater treatment plants and other environments. These findings are concerning because transgene contributions to global antibiotic resistance and their potential impacts to gene expression in environmental microbes are highly uncertain. Transgenes have also recently been shown to adsorb to the surfaces of micro- and nano-scale plastics (?MNPs?) that are frequently found in wastewater treatment plants and soils, suggesting their transport potential and resistance to degradation in the environment may be greater than currently estimated. The goal of this research is to understand how MNPs impact the transport of GEs in the environment. This goal will be achieved using a combined modeling and experimental approach to: i) Quantify transgene adsorption kinetics to MNPs, soils, and wastewater biosolids; ii) Assess the effects of key environmental factors on the persistence and uptake of GE transgenes; and iii) Evaluate transgene transport and transformation of model soil bacteria in agricultural soils. Successful completion of this research directly addresses important research gaps concerning transgene adsorption to MNPs, their behavior in the environment, and translation of experimental data to modeling frameworks that can be utilized by diverse stakeholder groups. Benefits to society result from interdisciplinary research training for graduate and undergraduate students to improve the Nation?s STEM workforce. Additional benefits result from enhanced scientific literacy through learning modules for undergraduate classes and development of outreach materials focused on microplastics in the environment for K-12 schools in the Palouse region of Washington State.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The adoption of support-promoted and surface-engineered catalysts with low temperature activity can have a global impact for the industrial applications in automotive catalytic converters and many industrial operations including electrical power plants, refineries and chemical plants, and surface coating facilities. Personnel involved in this project includes one graduate student and undergraduate students, who will gain innovation, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship experience. <br/><br/>This project combines a continuous thermal spray inline coating technology with surface-engineered catalytic washcoat materials to enable a 90% pollutant emission conversion rate below 150 C in automotive catalytic converters. Current emission control catalysts are relatively ineffective during the cold start period because the cold start temperature is lower than the light-off temperature of catalysts, leading to significant levels of pollutants emitted into the ambient air. By tuning the shapes and surface defects of cerium oxide (CeO2) supports and activating the metal-support interface, the surface-engineered catalysts offer low energy barriers for the formation of key intermediates and open reaction pathways as well as an increase in active sites for pollutant gas conversion at lower temperature.

While problems in this area are often simple to state, they can be fiendishly difficult to solve. The subfield of function field number theory aims to obtain insight on these problems by considering a kind of model or parallel universe where numbers behave differently. We consider what happens when we add or multiply numbers as normal but, except, instead of carrying digits, we simply drop the excess. Certainly arithmetic is a little easier with this modified rule, but more surprisingly, some of the most important problems in number theory become easier as well, with even some of the most difficult ones becoming solvable. (Technically, we should work in binary, or any prime base, rather than our usual base 10, for this.) Alternately, we can describe this variant arithmetic as the addition or multiplication of polynomial functions in a single variable. In this setting, we can connect number-theoretic questions to geometry, by viewing the graph of the polynomial as a geometric object. In this award  the PI's research uses geometric tools to solve new problems in this area.<br/><br/>The PI's research has resolved function field analogues of classical problems in number theory, including the twin primes conjecture and Chowla's conjecture (both joint with Shusterman), cases of the Ramanujan conjecture (joint with Templier), and conjectures about moments of L-functions. In this award the PI will continue along these lines, proving additional results about the distribution of prime numbers, L-function moments, and automorphic forms, and work in further directions such as non-abelian Cohen-Lenstra heuristics. These works are all based on etale cohomology theory, where the foundational result, Deligne's Riemann Hypothesis, allows many different analytic problems (problems about proving some inequality) to be reduced to cohomology problems (problems about calculating some of the cohomology groups of a variety or sheaf). The relevant varieties are high-dimensional, and calculating the necessary cohomology groups requires techniques like vanishing cycles theory and the characteristic cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the extent to which these data management requirements have resulted in more and better use of project data remains an open question. This project thus investigates the National Science Foundation?s DMP mandate as a national science policy and examines the broad impacts of this policy across a strategic sample of five disciplines funded by the National Science Foundation. It considers the organization and structure of DMPs across fields, the institutions involved in data sharing, data preservation practices, the extent to which DMPs enable others to use secondary project data, and the kinds of data governance and preservation practices that ensure that data are sustained and accessible. Systematic investigation of the impact of DMPs and data sharing cultures across fields will assist funding agencies and research scientists working to produce reproducible and open science by identifying barriers to data archiving, sharing, and access. The principal investigators will use project findings to develop data governance guidelines for information professionals working with scientific data and to articulate best practices for scientific communities using DMPs for data management. <br/><br/>This project aims to enhance understanding of the role data management plans (DMPs) play in shaping data lifecycles. It does so by examining DMPs across five fields funded by the National Science Foundation to understand data practices, archiving and access issues, the infrastructures that support data sharing and reuse, and the extent to which project data are later used by other researchers. In phase I, the investigators will gather a strategic sample of DMPs representing a wide range of data types and data retention practices from different scientific fields. Phase II consists of forensic data analysis of a subset of DMPs to discover what has become of project data. Phase III develops detailed case studies of research project data lifecycles and data afterlives with qualitative interviews and archival documentary analysis to help develop best practices for sustainable data preservation, access, and sharing.

This project aims to improve the ability of future climate projections in this region by using numerical model simulation and proxy derived records of water tracers of tropical hydroclimate to identify pan-tropical and regional responses to climate drivers under different boundary conditions. The investigation will focus on the last deglaciation period which is characterized by large shifts in atmospheric greenhouse gases concentrations, seasonal insolation, ice sheets, and sea level. Thus, the configuration of the last deglaciation creates a unique opportunity to study the tropical hydroclimate changes under different boundary condition than today.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to gain new insight into the large-scale dynamics and controls on tropical hydroclimate through (1) syntheses of tropical water isotope records to characterize the spatiotemporal changes of tropical isotope hydrological records during the last deglaciation, and (2) testing critical hypotheses about the impact of external forcings and internal feedbacks on tropical rainfall. To accomplish this goal, the researchers propose a comprehensive pan-tropical data model comparison through integrating water-isotope based proxy-data, proxy system models, and new simulations with a state of-the-art isotope enabled transient climate model (iTRACE). Further, the researchers will perform new sensitivity experiments under different boundary conditions with isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model to test the influence of land-ocean configuration on orbital and millennial-scale variability across the tropics.<br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a better understanding of the spatiotemporal changes and regional drivers of tropical hydroclimate during the last deglaciation.

In particular, third, fourth and fifth generation cellular systems saw advancements in the use of multiple antennas at the base-station infrastructure and multiple antennas in the devices. A main application of these antennas was to support multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, which is known to increase spectral efficiency and thus the data rates that can be achieved by devices in a given bandwidth. The numbers of antennas and the ways the antennas are used can vary across device models even from the same manufacturer. At the same time, the types of devices supported in cellular systems is growing beyond smartphones to include other highly mobile platforms like aerial vehicles, automobiles, and robots. The differences in the hardware between devices, coupled with the high device mobility, makes it challenging to configure the antennas to provide MIMO communication with the highest performance. This project develops machine learning-inspired solutions to empower devices to learn optimal configurations collaboratively. <br/><br/>System-wide Operation via Learning In-device Dissimilarities is a cooperation among experts in wireless communications at North Carolina State University (NC State) and Tampere University (TAU). The overall objective of the proposal is to employ machine-learning-assisted collaborative solutions for MIMO beam prediction and codebook optimization in a large-scale dynamic system. The key challenge of such networks is the extreme diversity of the devices? hardware (e.g., antenna designs and configurations). The existing distributed ML approaches do not explicitly include this type of client heterogeneity and do not fully support the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of data, network resources, and deployments. The project team will develop a novel integrated-learning and wireless-networking framework, which will enable the design and optimization of advanced MIMO beam-management solutions specifically tailored to the highly diverse and dynamic system. This project will result in new algorithms for collaborative device-centric beam management for 5G+/pre-6G MIMO communications in non-stationary environments with highly mobile and heterogeneous agents. The specific technical contributions occur in several directions: (a) Distributed user-centric learning for optimizing codebook-based MIMO communications; (b) Novel representation of device heterogeneity in an ML-friendly way; and (c) Network-resource optimization to facilitate distributed learning. The immediate impact will be improved communication efficiency in 5G+/pre-6G networks.

On one hand, it enables revolutionary new applications such as personalized medicine and disease prediction.  On the other hand, it runs the risk of revealing said personal data to unwanted parties.  For example, using personal data on today?s processor chips can reveal that data through traces that the processor leaves behind.  To make matters worse, different processors leave behind different traces, revealing different information, depending on how they were designed.  This project will develop techniques to prevent data leakage through processors, for existing and future processor chips.<br/><br/>The technical approach is to design a Distinguishability Set Architecture (DSA) for existing and future processors.  DSAs are peers to existing Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs).  Whereas the ISA specifies the functionality of each instruction, the DSA specifies under what conditions each instruction reveals secret information.  With a DSA, programmers or compilers can tune sensitive programs to avoid leaking secrets.  The first project thrust will develop DSA foundations, answering questions such as what should a DSA look like and how to capture leakage through various processor optimizations.  The second thrust will develop compilers and hardware that use DSAs to improve program security.<br/><br/>By precisely describing when and how processors reveal secrets, DSAs will unlock innovation on both software and hardware fronts.

Speech measures combined with artificial intelligence can serve as valuable biomarkers for mental health conditions, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet, in order for artificial intelligence to truly succeed in a future-of-work landscape in which clinicians will be expected to work side-by-side with artificial intelligence systems, both clinicians and patients need to calibrate their trust in the algorithms that power this decision-making process. The goal of this project is to design reliable machine learning, notably for speech-based diagnosis and monitoring of mental health, for addressing three pillars of trustworthiness: explainability, privacy preservation, and fair decision making. Trustworthiness is critical for both patients and clinicians: patients must be treated fairly and without the risk of reidentification, while clinical decision-making needs to rely on explainable and unbiased machine learning. This research program further provides a fertile ground for training high school and college students providing them with the knowledge about (and inclination toward) ethically applying computing research in sensitive populations. The tangible applications developed as part of this research serve as a vehicle to encourage students to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, and prepare them to work in transdisciplinary settings for solving real-world problems.<br/><br/>This project seeks to design explainable, anonymized, and fair speech biomarkers for mental health, integrating aspects of speech acquisition, transparent modeling, and unbiased decision making. The work is divided into three technical objectives. The first objective designs novel speaker anonymization algorithms that retain mental health information and suppress information related to the identity of the speaker. The anonymization algorithms learn a mapping between the original speech and a latent space, which embeds information about speaker identity, mental health, and phonological sequence through deterministic and probabilistic operations. The second objective improves explainability of speech-based models for tracking mental health through novel convolutional architectures that learn explainable spectrotemporal transformations relevant to speech production fundamentals. The third objective examines how bias in data and model design may perpetuate social disparities in mental health, and designs new machine learning to mitigate unwanted bias in speech-based mental health diagnosis. Through a series of experiments this work further contributes to understanding ways in which human-machine partnerships are formed in mental healthcare settings along dimensions of trust formation, maintenance, and repair.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These applications provide, in part, the means to create an immersive experience for work, education, and healthcare which helps to bridge the gap in experience between in-person interaction and video telephony. Achieving the high data rates, though, requires going to higher radio frequency bands than are currently used for cellular communications. In the last five years, cellular communication has embraced the lower millimeter wave spectrum, which refers to radio frequencies from about 25 GHz to 100 GHz. Indeed, millimeter wave communication has become one of the defining features of fifth generation cellular communication systems. Going to terabit-per-second data rates will require higher bandwidths that are available above 100 GHz, in what is known as the sub-THz band. This collaborative project establishes fundamentals that will help realize sub-THz communication and drive the future of wireless technology. It develops new hardware and algorithms that help to create the required high data rate communication links to serve the applications highlighted above. For example, it develops technology that helps sub-THz communication signals better go around obstacles, by instrumenting the environment with smart reflective surfaces and reconfigurable antenna arrays. The results of the project will contribute to the development of new wireless technologies that are beneficial for personal communication, safety applications and industrial deployments. Industry impact and technology transfer will occur through frequent communication with the partners of the sixth generation North Carolina program. The project will lead to more undergraduate and graduate students with expertise on new and important technologies for wireless communications.<br/><br/>Sub-THz Augmented Routing and Transmission for 6G is a collaboration among experts in wireless communications at North Carolina State University (NC State) and Yonsei University (YSU). It addresses the design of reflective surfaces and reconfigurable arrays for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication at sub-THz frequencies. It devises methods for configuring the beams formed or reflected from those arrays in a way that routes around obstacles. It creates algorithms that exploit new levels of reconfigurability in the arrays to obtain higher throughput and more robust communications. Finally, it results in the creation of joint real-time hardware (H/W) and software (S/W) testbeds for sub-THz communications. The uniqueness of this project lies in the multi-domain approach for improving sub-THz communications. The intellectual merit will occur in several directions. (a) Intelligent reflective surfaces constructed from state-of-the-art meta-materials / meta-devices. (b) Reconfigurable antenna arrays with adaptable structures that are mechanically and electrically controlled. (c) Directional-beam-based initial access and beam routing algorithms that leverage channel map information. (d) Models of reconfigurable antennas arrays and performance limits of those arrays. (e) Algorithms that leverage true time delays to reconfigure those arrays to support high bandwidths. (f) A suite of evaluation scenarios that test the developed hardware and algorithms. The immediate impact will be to identify the most relevant approaches for enabling large arrays for communication and reflective applications, as well as algorithms that leverage those arrays to enhance communication at sub-THz frequencies. The long-term impact will be in the development and realization of sub-THz communication as part of 6G wireless communications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will generate a dataset of 40 trace elements on suspended particles and surface sediment samples collected on the GEOTRACES GP17-ANT cruise to the Amundsen Sea, West Antarctica. The Amundsen Sea hosts the most productive polynya per unit area in all of Antarctica, with biological carbon uptake ten times higher than the average for the Southern Ocean. Over the past 30 years, this region has become a primary locus of increased freshwater input, as the fastest melting glaciers in West Antarctica deliver huge and increasing volumes of freshwater to the Amundsen Sea. The major contribution of this region to global sea level rise is well documented, but the impact of accelerated additions of meltwater and associated chemical constituents on the biogeochemistry of the Antarctic shelf waters, and in particular on the cycling of trace elements, has not received comprehensive investigation. Hypotheses addressing four key components of the biogeochemical system in the Amundsen Sea will be tested, and results will closely mesh with complementary efforts proposed by other GP17-ANT investigators. The project will support a graduate student and several undergraduate interns, with a focus on broadening participation in STEM. The investigators will also work with established programs to create meaningful out-of-school science experiences for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is to quantify and interpret the distributions of particulate trace elements in approximately 500 samples covering a large swath of the Amundsen Sea shelf, including waters influenced by five major ice shelves, and in the adjacent iron-limited Southern Ocean waters bounded by 100W and 135W, and south of 67S. The investigators will use size-fractionated sample collection, total acid digestion and weak acid leaching, and well-established mass spectrometric methods to determine concentrations and probe the physico-chemical state of the particulate trace elements. The team will use the new data to investigate the following issues: 1) the role of phytoplankton, with a focus on Phaeocystis and diatoms, dominant taxa on the Amundsen Sea shelf, in driving element cycling in the upper water column while experiencing variable degrees of iron stress; 2) the ?meltwater pump? which generates vigorous and particle-rich outflow from ice shelf cavities; 3) the bottom nepheloid layer of resuspended sediments as a reaction zone that determines the composition of the sedimentary paleo-record and also modulates of chemical fluxes at the sediment-water boundary; and 4) the rare earth elements (REE), which the team proposes carry unique geochemical information about terrigenous particle provenance among the geologically diverse glacial drainage regions, and also includes a labile particulate fraction whose magnitude and inter-element ratios may serve as a relative index of element scavenging intensity that can be applied to predict regions of maximal scavenging for other particle-reactive elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The detailed information is obtained through the sequential process of imaging (reading), digitally storing, and laser-based manufacturing (writing) of the tissue architecture. Data obtained from this process will be uploaded onto an accessible data repository to facilitate broad dissemination.

Among the advantages of UMW over conventional fusion welding techniques are the ability to join dissimilar metals, energy efficiency, short welding cycles, and environmental friendliness, making it a promising joining technology for the advanced manufacturing of electrified and lightweight vehicles. Nevertheless, UMW has a relatively narrow operating window and is very sensitive to unpredictable, uncontrollable environmental conditions. This longstanding knowledge gap in the underlying process mechanisms makes the prediction and control of joint quality difficult, which limits its use. This project will take advantage of the emergent information-centric transformation of manufacturing science by leveraging advances in process physics, microstructural analysis, and data science. By establishing dynamic, stochastic relationships between process conditions, microstructural weld attributes, online sensing data, and weld performance, the research will advance the fundamental understanding of process mechanisms in UMW. The knowledge gained will be used to establish a suite of machine learning-based decision-making tools that will ultimately enable smart UMW. This grant will also support diverse educational and outreach activities that contribute to the education of the U.S. smart manufacturing workforce. <br/><br/>It is a widely accepted hypothesis that UMW process conditions influence the joining performance via the dynamic evolution of micro-scale weld attributes and the weld formation process generates a signature, as reflected in parameters that can be sensed online. Nonetheless, there exist no studies to date that adequately model or quantify the inherent dynamic, stochastic process-attribute-data-performance (PADP) relationship. The overarching goal of this research is to create a PADP modeling framework that consists of innovative machine learning and statistical models. The framework will be completed in two steps. First, spatiotemporal models incorporating uncertainty quantification will be built to characterize the process-attribute-performance relationship. Second, a tensor-based correlation and regression analysis will be performed to investigate the attribute-data relationship. This framework will be further employed to develop a series of physics-aware, machine learning tools for process control, including process optimization, online quality monitoring, and real-time control. Finally, the project will investigate the use of a transfer learning methodology to provide a cost-effective way to build PADP models and decision-making strategies for related products or product families. This learning capability will be an essential component in the cloud intelligence that enables the smart manufacturing paradigm.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Efforts to remedy these disparities often use focused professional development (PD) to support educators in more effectively teaching diverse students. PD covers a wide array of topics, such as culturally responsive instruction, inclusive practices for students, and strategies for engaging students who have experienced adversity. What unites these diverse PD approaches is an intentional and explicit focus on understanding the issues facing students with diverse experiences and needs, and on equipping educators with skills to overcome these challenges and support student success. While focused PD is in high demand, little is known about its effectiveness. Many focused PD programs have little to no effect, and some may be counterproductive. For example, these programs can create a sense of psychological threat among educators, leading to feelings of being excluded, judged, or disadvantaged. These outcomes can result in resistance and backlash that undermine program goals.<br/><br/>For focused PD to be successful, it needs to attend to educators' experiences. This project conducts studies that examine how three common sources of psychological threat in focused PDs (identity, culture, and pedagogy threats) shape how educators engage with and use focused PD content in their classrooms, and how this use improves students? academic experiences and performance. Two studies use focus groups and survey designs to examine these issues among a national sample of educators who have participated in a wide variety of focused PD experiences. Three additional studies use randomized controlled experiments to test strategies for mitigating identity, culture, and pedagogy threats among educators. Together, this work provides insight for creating focused PD environments where all teachers feel valued, equipped to engage with challenging ideas, and capable of growing their classroom skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes increased hazards to Arctic communities from permafrost thaw and associated slope instability and the destruction of river and coastal habitats from higher sediment and nutrient yields in Arctic rivers. While it is clear that Arctic landscapes are sensitive to climate change, a gap exists in our knowledge about how changes in temperature will affect the ways in which sediment is transported across a watershed. In order to address this knowledge gap, the investigators will be conducting a field- and remote sensing-based study of Arctic watersheds in the Aklavik Range of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, where numerous First Nations communities are situated. The research team will test the specific hypothesis that climate change in the Arctic is leading to faster production of sediment within mountainous regions and causing subsequent increases in sediment delivery to hillslopes and rivers. <br/><br/>This is an interdisciplinary project that involves three Early Career tenure-track faculty, multiple local collaborators, as well as the Ehdiitat Gwich?in. The investigators will study two small bedrock watersheds (where sediment is produced) and their associated fan deposits (where sediment is stored) along a north-south climate gradient. Prior geomorphic work on these fan deposits was conducted in the 1960s to 1980s, making them an ideal location to quantitively assess change over time. The major objectives are to: (1) conduct fieldwork to understand how sediment is produced and the processes by which it moves across this landscape; (2) perform laboratory analyses on samples collected in the field to quantify rates of sediment production and transport over decadal to millennial scales; (3) use remote sensing techniques to extend local findings to the broader region over the last several decades; and (4) to use these data to calibrate sediment production and transport models so that we can predict future Arctic landscape response to anthropogenic warming scenarios. Many of the dating and remote sensing techniques have greatly advanced in the last several decades, but have not been applied to an integrated Arctic study spanning an entire watershed. Once proven in this study, this combination of methods could be used in other landscapes (both in the Arctic and at low latitudes) to better quantify how changes in rates of one geomorphic process (e.g., breakdown of bedrock) affects changes in rates of another (e.g., rates of sediment delivery to a river).

One possible approach to address this challenge is through direct air capture technologies (DAC). DAC technologies can extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere to be stored permanently. Traditional methods for separating gaseous mixtures involve either adsorbing high-pressure gases onto a solid surface and releasing (desorbing) them when the pressure is reduced (known as pressure swing adsorption) or using temperature changes to achieve separation (known as temperature swing adsorption). However, these methods are unsuitable for DAC systems because the concentration gradient, which drives the mass transfer of CO2, is very small. As a result, these methods are highly inefficient in terms of energy usage. Additionally, the current state-of-the-art sorbent materials based on amines or ionic liquids require a lot of energy to desorb the CO2 and regenerate the sorbents. Furthermore, since most sorbent materials have low thermal conductivity, externally heating them for regeneration is inefficient and leads to additional heat losses. It is crucial to develop new materials and technologies that can address these drawbacks and enable the successful implementation of large-scale DAC systems. This project will investigate a class of CO2 sorbent materials that can be induced to release the adsorbed CO2 by applying an external magnetic field. The magnetic field generates local heat within the material, so external energy input is not required. The research will yield new insights into the fundamental energy and mass transfer mechanisms in these magnetic field-responsive sorbents (MF-RSs). The project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate student research experiences, curriculum development, and K-12 STEM outreach at the Missouri University of Science & Technology and the University of Southern California.<br/><br/>The purpose of this work is to gain a fundamental understanding of energy and mass transfer mechanisms in MF-RSs for use in DAC systems, namely, composites of F3O4 magnetic nanoparticles and microporous metal-organic frameworks (F3O4/MOF-amine) or mesoporous aminosilicates (Fe3O4/SiO2-amine). The external magnetic field generates local heat due to the static hysteresis and dynamic core losses of the magnetic nanoparticles. The adsorbed CO2 is desorbed without external heating, overcoming the issue of low thermal conductivity of most sorbent materials and avoiding the heat losses accompanying externally heated methods. Computational and experimental investigations will be conducted to understand the factors affecting CO2 release and system regeneration in MF-RSs. The intermolecular attractions that result in the low-energy release of CO2 from magnetic sorbents upon exposure to an external magnetic field will be characterized. Specifically, the research will probe the extent of electron transfer perturbation upon magnetic field induction. The study will also elucidate the effects of heat capacity-magnetization tradeoffs on diffusive thermal and molecular transfers. Finally, the magnetic field-triggered CO2 transport mechanisms during sorbent regeneration in the presence of oxygen, nitrogen, and water will be investigated. A host of experimental and computational techniques will be applied to reveal the energy and mass transfer mechanisms of CO2 adsorption and desorption from MF-RSs in the presence of an external magnetic field. These techniques include molecular-level in-situ spectroscopic measurements and transient desorption tests such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), zero-length column (ZLC), and magnetic induction swing adsorption (MISA), which will be combined with density-functional theory (DFT) and nanoscale molecular dynamics simulations. The investigation will open new avenues for developing low-energy sorbent regeneration systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students? sense of belonging is key in retaining and graduating STEM undergraduates, especially STEM students from populations marginalized in STEM. The project plans to adapt questions from an existing tool, as well as develop new questions about STEM department climate and culture based on student interviews and focus groups with STEM department stakeholders. After initial development in three institutions, the project team intends to implement the tool in STEM departments in multiple institutions across the country. Additionally, the project plans to develop a handbook to guide departments in using this tool. This project should advance understanding of STEM student experiences in STEM departments and support efforts to retain students in STEM.<br/><br/>This project at Florida International University (FIU) aims to develop a research-based assessment tool to measure undergraduate STEM students? sense of belonging to their department, as well as their perceptions about departmental climate and culture. FIU is a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and will collaborate with California State University, Fullerton and California State University, San Marcos, which are also HSIs. The project plans to adapt an existing assessment tool that examines sense of belonging and to develop new items to probe departmental culture and climate through input gathered from student interviews and focus groups with a diverse population of faculty, staff, advisors, and other departmental stakeholders. In addition to traditional closed-ended Likert-type questions and open-ended written assessment probes, the project plans to develop items based on visual narratives to probe students? perceptions of departmental climate and culture. The new assessment tool will be piloted with a sample of ~1,400 undergraduate students in biology, chemistry, and physics departments across the three collaborating institutions to gather evidence of validity. Once initially validated, the assessment tool will then be implemented across at least 14 additional STEM departments, with data from the study returned to departments for reflection and discussion. Project evaluation will be guided by a 5-member advisory board composed of scholars from across different institutions and multiple relevant disciplines. Dissemination efforts include conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and development of a departmental handbook to guide use of the tool. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also supported by the NSF IUSE:HSI program, which has the goals of enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education, and increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate?s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From ancient cave paintings to modern digital graphics, such technologies lie at the heart of some of our most significant inventions, including art, writing, and mathematics. Despite the importance of such technologies, little is known about how the human mind is capable of using them in such varied ways. Perhaps the most basic and versatile of these technologies is drawing, which can be used to convey information about the visual world at many levels of abstraction, ranging from realistic illustrations to simplified diagrams. This project will harness large datasets and advanced data analysis techniques to develop a rigorous understanding of the mental processes involved when people use drawings to communicate visual concepts in different ways. Results from this project will advance our understanding of why people prefer to use certain kinds of images in some contexts and not others, with implications for how to design effective visualizations for a variety of applications, including STEM education and research. This project?s focus on the problem of how abstract ideas can be communicated in clear and accessible ways extends to its education plan. This plan encompasses two initiatives to develop inclusive learning experiences that promote computational literacy among K-12 and undergraduate students that have historically faced systemic obstacles to this training.<br/><br/>Aim 1 of this project seeks to resolve a classic debate concerning whether drawings derive their meaning by resembling objects in the world (i.e., are image-like) or by being composed of discrete symbolic expressions (i.e., are language-like). The proposed experiments will evaluate the hypothesis that drawings are neither purely image-like nor purely language-like, but can vary strongly depending on what the illustrator can see, what they know, and what information they wish to communicate. To test this hypothesis, the proposed analyses will employ crowdsourcing and computer-vision techniques to measure the degree to which different drawings preserve perceptual information and/or are organized into discrete symbolic units. For example, some drawings may contain rich visual details that resist summarization in words, while other drawings may be entirely composed of simpler marks that can be readily described using words. Aim 2 will investigate the process by which people come up with new ways to visually communicate with each other over time. The proposed experiments will evaluate the hypothesis that drawings that initially resemble a concrete object tend to become increasingly abstract and symbol-like when people repeatedly communicate about it, reflecting shared goals and knowledge between communicators. The proposed analyses will measure consistency and variability in the resulting drawings, providing quantitative insight into the factors that affect the development of new symbolic systems for communication. Aim 3 seeks to better align the scientific training undergraduate psychology students receive to the reality of modern scientific practice in psychology. Specifically, it will integrate teaching of open-science best practices, exploratory data visualization, and model-based data analysis into the introductory statistics curriculum in Psychology at University of California San Diego, as well as collaborative final research projects to help students synthesize what they have learned and hone their communication skills. Aim 4 strives to broaden access to general education about artificial intelligence (AI) in historically underserved communities by partnering with local K-12 schools to develop learning experiences that illustrate the relevance of AI to students? everyday lives, as well as how AI intersects with other disciplines, including the arts, psychology, medicine, and law.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The efficiency of this technology is vital in enabling energy sustainability and reducing humanity's carbon footprint. Conventional electric motors rely on bearings to support their shafts. Unfortunately, these bearings have critical lifetime, reliability, and efficiency shortcomings that limit the electrification of transportation systems, the utilization of renewable generation technologies, and the efficiency of fluid handling infrastructure. This project will investigate a new type of motor that does not use bearings. The new bearingless motors will utilize electric current to create controllable magnetic forces that function as set of bearings. The new motors will look and behave in fundamentally different ways that will enable new, extremely efficient, and ultra-reliable systems. This project targets a 9% reduction in US electric energy consumption by enabling new concepts in compressor systems, electrified transportation, renewable energy generation, and energy storage. To translate these research outcomes into the real world, the project incorporates engagement of both the technical community and general public.  Beyond the research outcomes, the team's outreach activities will facilitate development of the diverse STEM workforce needed to maintain US leadership in electromechanical power conversion. The team will develop interactive public exhibits of motor and levitation technology and host STEM-enriched experiences aimed at increasing interest and participation in STEM opportunities for middle and high school females and youth from rural, economically disadvantaged regions.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The objective of this research is to overcome fundamental challenges of both conventional motor bearings and magnetic bearings. While today's electric motors utilize and control only one degree of freedom (rotation) this project will develop a new generation of electric motors that are precisely actuated in all six degrees of freedom. These new motors will utilize magnetic field forces that are already present within the motor to create a completely bearingless motor that levitates its own shaft. Modelling, control, and design techniques will be developed to unify the science of electric motors and magnetic levitation. The project will use analytic and numeric modeling approaches to create a framework that models the normal and tangential magnetic stresses on the rotor's surface. This framework will be used to determine the required stator currents needed to produce exact force and torque vectors on the motor's shaft. The project will research optimal design of these new motors and test prototypes to validate this new science. The team will develop the science of bearingless motors for both high speed motor systems (industrial compressors and power grid flywheel energy storage) and low speed motor systems (large diameter, rim-driven motors for flight electrification). The outcomes of the research will be disseminated through the standard channels of academic research (presentations and papers) as well as through the construction of a portable bearingless motor prototype that will be exhibited in public demonstrations, conferences, and visits to research institutes. The team will also develop open source, interactive laboratory electronics kits to demonstrate the principles of magnetic levitation and electromechanical power conversion that will be promoted to allow youth to develop county fair exhibits, lifelong learners to explore electromechanical principles, and teachers to adapt the material for their curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The timing of plant phenology not only affects the fitness of individual plants, it also impacts the fitness and behaviors of organisms dependent on plants, which in terrestrial ecosystems includes nearly all animals, either directly or indirectly. Thus, changes in plant phenology can trigger dramatic, and sometimes devastating, consequences for ecosystems and human economic interests and health. Plant phenological data are therefore indispensable for understanding ecosystem function, detecting ecosystem changes, and predicting the impacts of ongoing climate and land use changes. Given the importance of plant phenology, continuing local, regional and national data collection efforts have generated large volumes of phenological data. However, these data are surprisingly heterogeneous, difficult to integrate, and thus remain largely inaccessible for broader research. At the same time, community science and specimen digitization infrastructure have produced massive, rapidly expanding collections of herbarium specimens and in situ plant photographs, which contain a wealth of virtually untapped historical and contemporary phenological information. This project will use machine learning approaches to extract phenological data from plant photographs and digitized specimens. These data will then be integrated with phenological monitoring resources to create an open access, global plant phenology database ? Phenobase. During this project, one postdoctoral researcher and several graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in programming and data science skills. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to support community needs for generating and delivering high-precision, harmonized and semantically integrated plant phenological data at unprecedented taxonomic, geographic, and temporal scales, along with new tools to help scientists and the public engage with these data. To achieve this goal, this project will develop a global, standardized knowledge base by integrating different phenology observation networks around the world; expand this knowledge base by using computer vision (CV) techniques to generate new, high-quality phenological data from the rapidly growing collection of community-submitted plant photographs on iNaturalist and Budburst; add critical historical data by using similar CV techniques on herbarium specimens available through iDigBio and GBIF; develop tools for data query, access, and visualization delivered via the Web and as software packages; and foster compelling, community-driven use cases showcasing the use of Phenobase for new research and for public good. These approaches will not only meet current growth in imaging, but scale to meet continuing, exponential growth into the future. By weaving together phenologically relevant outputs from monitoring projects from around the globe, including the efforts of millions of community scientists, Phenobase will support and empower phenological research that is currently impossible.

This sector has expanded rapidly over the last two decades. This project will construct an extensive database and conduct the first systematic analysis of the BDC sector. The project will focus on these new lenders and provide insights into an important yet understudied segment of the U.S. economy - the middle market, which accounts for a third of private-sector employment. Specifically, the project will investigate the impact of nonbank lending on middle-market firms and economic growth. Overall, the project will have important policy implications for the role of financial intermediation in the economy.<br/><br/>By constructing a novel database, this project will advance the body of knowledge on nonbank lending. First, the project will investigate the causes of the BDC sector growth and analyze their role in financing middle-market firms. The granularity of the dataset will additionally allow to characterize the borrowers targeted and lending solutions offered. Second, the project will use the location information of BDC portfolio companies to estimate the real effects of these direct lenders on middle-market firms and, more broadly, on local economic growth. Third, the project will investigate how access to capital markets affects investment activities of direct lenders. Finally, since BDCs provide funding to firms without relying on deposit insurance, they put forward a new lending model that may offer an improvement to the current deposit-based banking system. To understand the effects of this alternative lending mechanism, the project will develop a quantitative framework to conduct a welfare analysis of transitioning to a new lending environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each alternative involves trade-offs in its social acceptability, economic feasibility, environmental sustainability, and circularity. For example, biodegradable plastics may seem to be most desirable if they decompose to become biological nutrients. However, if these materials have a large life cycle environmental impact, their adoption will not eliminate the end-of-life, but simply shift the environmental burden along the life cycle. Solutions for E3P need to be sustainable by being environmentally benign, economically feasible, and socially desirable. The overall goal of this project is to develop holistic and systematic methods and tools for assessment, design, and innovation toward Sustainable and Circular E3P (SCE3P). <br/><br/>The research team will conduct synergistic research in polymer chemistry, reaction engineering, and molecular simulation to determine properties of depolymerization and valorization processes under practical conditions of contamination; process design to model the cost and physical flows of current and emerging technologies; supply network modeling to determine the effects on the wider chemical industry; behavioral studies to discern and influence the role of consumers; and life cycle and circularity assessment to estimate environmental effects across global value chains. The resulting framework will consider the entire plastics life cycle, including thousands of combinations of alternatives at each step to select the ""best"" pathway. This framework will be able to assess existing products, design new products and pathways, and encourage innovation toward SCE3P. The framework will be useful for all types of plastics, but the project's experimental focus will be on polystyrene (PS) and poly(ethylene terepthalate) (PET) due to their large market. The SCE3P framework will be applied in the project to plastic products in the food service industry, with case studies done in collaboration with industry consortia and other stakeholders. The project is formulated to contribute to the convergence of chemical engineering, sustainable engineering, and behavioral science, for assessment, design, and innovation toward a sustainable and circular economy of plastics. A target is to develop new knowledge about the chemistry and engineering of various depolymerization and valorization approaches for PS and PET products. The research team will also bring together knowledge about steps in the plastics life cycle to contribute to an innovation roadmap for SCE3P. A spatial model of the U.S. chemical industry will be extended by including the plastics industry and emerging technologies for SCE3P. Behavioral studies will improve the understanding of spillover effects of other decisions on choice of plastic products and their responsible disposal. New data and methods will be developed for assessing and designing circular systems, evaluating their resilience, and identifying hotspots to focus innovation. Application to food services will guide progress toward goals of zero waste and carbon neutrality. The outcome of this project is to be a software prototype of the SCE3P framework, which will be disseminated widely via a university-based website, webinars to industry and other stakeholders, and university courses. Collaborators will provide access to over a hundred companies across the world.

With the considerable benefits in energy efficiency, there are significant interests in leveraging optical computing into applications, such as medical sensing, security screening, drug detection, and autonomous driving. Specifically, optical computing offers unique advantages in power efficiency and extreme computation speed, leading to significant performance improvements compared to digital computing systems for ML tasks. This project aims to develop an end-to-end design infrastructure to advance optical computing for ML, covering from low-level physics to algorithms to full-stack system design. This will generate broader impacts in cross-disciplinary research and real-world application fields from physics to computer science to ML. This project will produce an open-source design infrastructure, LightRidge, and conference tutorials to facilitate technology transfers and fruitful industry-academia interactions in a multidisciplinary community.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop an open-source, end-to-end design infrastructure, LightRidge, to explore and advance Diffractive Deep Neural Networks (DONNs) in real-world ML tasks. DONNs utilize the free-space light diffraction to form an optical feed-forward network like conventional DNNs architecture, which can host millions of neurons in each layer that are interconnected with those in neighboring layers, offering orders of magnitude energy efficiency improvements over general-purpose processor and domain-specific accelerators. However, there are several critical technical barriers in the design, training, exploration, and hardware deployment of DONNs. Thus, this project will produce an agile end-to-end design and fabrication programming framework LightRidge, consisting of precise, versatile, and differentiable optical physics kernels powered by domain-specific high-performance-computing developments, with novel physics-aware hardware-software codesign methodologies to strengthen the correlations between algorithm modeling and physical hardware. This project will also develop an intelligent and efficient design space exploration (DSE) engine LightRidge-DSE, to enable architectural and fabrication parameters exploration, monolithic on-chip DONNs integration, and demonstrate real-world all-optical ML tasks. Finally, LightRidge will be fully released as an open-source hardware project, which will contribute to multidisciplinary research domains such as physics, electrical engineering, computer science, and can be used as a new education platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
