To increase national security for the U.S. and meet its workforce needs, cybersecurity education must develop new knowledge and skills. To address this need, the Cyber Up! Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) project at Coastline Community College in California will research, create, adapt, adopt, and implement a suite of course content that supports a Certificate of Achievement and an Associate of Science degree. As a Center for Academic Excellence-Two Year (CAE2Y), the implementation of DFIR has the potential to be transformative, bringing about needed and important change to U.S. education and security. Thus, the program expects to increase the availability and readiness of qualified cybersecurity technicians in the U.S. workforce, resulting in greater global competitiveness for the U.S. economy and increased national security. A comprehensive project evaluation will measure the DFIR program's effectiveness, which will in turn support adaptation and replication by other institutions. <br/><br/>The project will focus on the development of curricula that will teach students and professionals the cybersecurity knowledge and skills of digital forensics and incident response, which need to be deployed in real-time and are dynamic to changing situations during and in response to cyberattacks. Through the DFIR program, the project intends to create adoptable educational resources; form academic, government, and industry partnerships; and prepare qualified cybersecurity technicians and professionals for entry into, or advancement within, the U.S. workforce. The DFIR distance education modalities will be designed for a national reach and assist in preparing students for successful employment. It will work towards providing cybersecurity advancement through its various modalities since the content, courses, certificate, and degree will all be available online. The project will also develop virtual labs and faculty resources. The DFIR program will aim to reach educators, institutions, and diverse populations with important new knowledge and skills in digital forensics and incident response. Faculty development will provide educators new knowledge and enhance their abilities in these new technological and pedagogical skill-sets, leading to enriched educational structures at the institution. Because of the adoptable, modular content, other institutions can benefit through adoption into their programs, creating pathways to greater skills and knowledge for students and professionals. Increasing skills and knowledge in diverse and underrepresented populations in cybersecurity will help to assure increased participation of women, minorities, and special populations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and in the STEM workforce. Thus, the program will strive to generate important new knowledge and skills to share with students, professionals, and the academic community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this site is to give students an opportunity to engage in research projects on model-based reasoning. Modeling is an important practice of science as models provide bridges between ideas and observations of the physical world.  Models are simplified versions of real-world systems that allow scientists to ask new questions, test new hypotheses, and communicate explanations to a broad audience.  Major STEM education reform initiatives in K-12 and higher education support opportunities for students to engage in the practice of modeling throughout the STEM curriculum.  These reform initiatives must also be supported by a research base that includes well-defined goals, assessment tools, an understanding of common student difficulties, and effective curricular approaches.  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Model-based Reasoning in STEM Education will give students an opportunity to engage in novel research projects in this exciting and important field.<br/><br/>Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER) combines disciplinary expertise in a STEM field with education research methodology that undergraduate students can do, if provided with preparatory work and mentoring. This DBER REU program will enable STEM students to apply their growing disciplinary knowledge to important problems in education research.  Over the next three years, the program will select 30 diverse undergraduate students to join the RIT STEM research community. During the program, students will engage in rigorous education research projects with the support and collaboration of research mentors. The program will help students prepare for DBER and/or scientific research careers  and graduate programs. These potential future educators will be introduced to teaching, learning, and assessment of the core scientific practice of modeling. Students in this program will disseminate their findings at conferences and through scholarly publications. To support program objectives, this DBER REU program has four core components: Mentored Research projects, Professional Development Workshops, DBER Methods Workshops, and Cohort-building Activities.  The project will contribute to research around the development and assessment of students' abilities in modeling, which is essential for the efficacy of educational initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems directly interact with the physical world, so a successful attack can have serious consequences: for instance, a compromised chemical plant could have severe environmental consequences, and a compromised medical device could result in injury or death. Contemporary security mechanisms, however, can be inadequate for at two reasons. First, current defenses tend to be quite heavyweight, which makes them difficult to apply to resource-constrained infrastructure systems. And second, timing is critical: current defenses tend to focus on preventing systems from 'doing the wrong thing' or 'failing to do the right thing', as opposed to preventing systems from 'doing the right thing at the wrong time', which is often just as damaging. To address this problem, this project creates stronger defense mechanisms tailored specifically for infrastructure systems. The new mechanisms explicitly take timing into account, are expected to have lower cost, and will initially be applied to automotive systems in collaboration with a major car manufacturer. The principal investigator will organize tutorials for practitioners, and will enhance the curriculum of the Master's in Embedded Systems program at the University of Pennsylvania with more coverage of Internet-of-Things security. She is also developing a series of outreach activities to improve the representation of women and minorities in the real-time systems community. Collaborations with the law school and the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania will investigate how to use the new techniques to improve the legal framework for infrastructure systems, by offering better accountability for product defects, for example, and how to apply them to improve the security of medical systems. <br/><br/>This project pursues an approach called bounded-time recovery. Unlike many existing techniques, bounded time recovery does not attempt to mask all symptoms of an attack, which existing defenses do at great cost; rather, it leverages the fact that many systems cannot change their state arbitrarily quickly, due to properties such as inertia or thermal capacity, and can thus already tolerate brief disruptions, provided the system quickly returns to a correct state. This approach seeks guarantees that 1) the system will meet its timing requirements in the absence of an attack, and that 2) when under attack, the system will return to a correct state within a bounded amount of time, potentially after reconfiguring itself to exclude compromised nodes. The goal is to provide these guarantees in the Byzantine model, that is, without a priori knowledge of what the attacks will look like, or which nodes will be attacked. To achieve this goal, the project will construct practical algorithms for (provably) detecting attacks within bounded time, based on techniques such as tamper-evident logs and cryptographic evidence; create methods for recovering from detected attacks within bounded time, using ideas from multi-mode systems; and produce reusable implementations of the new techniques that will be widely disseminated and made available under an open-source license.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent events, both domestically and internationally, have highlighted the critical nature of foundation resilience in ensuring continued infrastructure function following natural disasters.  The framework to be developed will be capable of providing next-generation resistance formulations for infrastructure foundations capable of reliably and holistically assessing the behavior and response of deep foundations under multiaxial loading.  The framework will offer more accurate and parsimonious design solutions which will reduce overdesign, and require less material.   It will spur the introduction and implementation of novel instrumentation technologies and sustainable materials.  In addition, research findings will accelerate the transition to use of high-performance materials with permanently integrated integrity assessment capabilities by providing a validated design platform to accurately characterize foundation response behavior. This will potentially result in substantial reductions in the cost of building foundations. The CAREER educational objectives focus on stimulating interdisciplinary curiosity and growth through diverse curricular efforts and industry involvement in geo-structural undergraduate and graduate classroom training. It will cater to the increasing demand for technical rigor and a global mindset in engineering graduates.  Professional career development activities will supplement the technical educational activities to increase the retention of diversity in geo-structural engineering in academia and industry, and stimulate a lifelong interest in research and development.  The latter part of the educational plan will specifically target female engineers, and is aligned with NSF INCLUDES.<br/><br/>The core of the CAREER research consists of executing well-coordinated, large-scale experimental- and risk-informed numerical simulations to generate baseline knowledge that aids the development of integrated, performance-based assessment metrics.  Specifically, this research will enable the (i) derivation of robust, next-generation loading-response formulations; (ii) development of creative experimental tools to holistically evaluate damage evolution; (iii) validation of models for design and post-hazard integrity analyses, and (iv) risk-driven sensitivity studies to connect all components into a unified decision-making framework.  In addition, the experimental studies will fill vital data gaps through prototype-scale testing of soil-pile systems for which limited research has been performed, i.e., specifically targeting piles with complex structural fixity conditions at the pile head and pile tip.  Another aspect of the research will develop innovative experimental tools to improve our fundamental understanding of complex three-dimensional (3D) soil-structure interaction (SSI) by extracting volumetric measurements in deep foundation systems via 3D printed, cast in place instrumentation technologies.  The research program will benefit the profession by implementing new understanding in software tools usable for individual component and system analysis for a broad spectrum of infrastructure beyond deep foundations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Safety is ensured by designing our aerospace, civil, and marine structures to withstand operational, environmental, and expected or unexpected extreme loads throughout their designed service lifetimes, and now many such structures are being pushed to serve society well past their design life. Although the structural health monitoring (SHM) field has brought new technologies, algorithms, and methods to improve damage detection, quantification, and assessment, what is missing is the ability to translate detected damage data into actionable information for stakeholders and owners to act on to ensure structural safety and performance, given relevant constraints. Information obtained through this new paradigm of Designing for Safety is crucial for informing design, repair, retrofit, and/or replacement of other existing similar structures or for future, new designs, thereby feeding back to attain the vision of Safety by Design. This research will directly address the challenge of acquiring and interpreting appropriate data streams (whether obtained through numerical modeling, experimental tests, and/or operational measurements) to synthesize information and create actionable knowledge that will enable accurate assessment and improvement of structural design, health, and performance. To achieve this goal, this REU Site at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) will recruit and train 12 diverse U.S. scholars for eight weeks each summer, recruited from across the nation with emphasis on broadening the participation of underrepresented minority, women, and economically-disadvantaged students. These students will conduct research alongside six professors and their graduate students. In addition to immersing REU students in an intensive summer research program, a plethora of career development, lab tours, graduate school application preparation, seminars, and social activities are also planned to provide each U.S. scholar with a life-changing, multidisciplinary, summer experience. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this NSF REU Site is to immerse students in a meaningful and highly interdisciplinary research environment within the structural engineering domain and to teach them that design does not end with construction. Instead, designing for safety embodies: quantifying potential load conditions, damage mechanics, and uncertainties; monitoring for anomalies during operations; processing this information through cyber-modeling via digital surrogates; and translating the information to actionable knowledge for improving current and future system designs. First, from concept inception to defining performance metrics to structural design, transformative research and education are needed to devise methods for aggregating and fusing computational and experimental data to inform the capabilities of different designs and the probabilities of exceeding certain safety-states. Second, once deployed, SHM/prognosis is central to achieving total structural state awareness through the integration of sensing data from multiple sources (""Internet-of-Things""), cyber modeling, and statistical pattern recognition. Finally, information acquired throughout design and operations, when combined with innovative optimization methods and a multi-scale, multi-physics, digital surrogate twin of the structure, is crucial for realizing future structural designs that outperform its predecessors. Research results generated through this project will bridge key knowledge gaps revealing the interrelations between damage formation, propagation, detection, structural modeling, model-updating, assessment, and design optimization. The planned student activities will equip young U.S. scholars with multidisciplinary technical skills and diverse perspectives so that they are uniquely poised to tackle complex, interdisciplinary, and systems-level grand challenges throughout their entire careers. The students' contributions to research and their summer experiences will raise awareness and stimulate interests in pursuing future STEM careers, which will stimulate a positive feedback loop so that novel solutions for Designing for Safety and Safety by Design will arrive sooner rather than later. UC San Diego is uniquely positioned to host this REU Site, since it is the only institution in the U.S. with programs in SHM and prognosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports an integrated research and education effort on developing and applying computational methods for understanding how nonlinear optical materials respond to light. How nonlinear optical materials respond to light depends on the intensity of the light which leads to interesting phenomena that can be used in technological applications. For example, the dependence of the index of refraction on light intensity can cause a nonlinear optical material to function like a lens causing a light beam to narrow or collapse as it passes through the material. <br/>These materials have applications in, for example, noninvasive imaging for medicine, optoelectronic devices, and advanced sensitive quantum mechanical sensors. Understanding and accurate prediction of strong light-matter interaction at microscopic level would help enable the design of novel materials with tailored nonlinear optical properties for specific applications.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and apply methods that starting from knowing the identity of the constituent atoms to predict how specific nonlinear optical materials will respond to light.  Emphasis will be placed on novel two-dimensional materials and topological materials which can have metallic states with exotic properties that cover surfaces and edges of the material. This work will elucidate the fundamental role of symmetry, topology, surface/edge, and spin-orbit coupling in nonlinear light-matter interactions.

This award supports an integrated research and education effort on developing and applying predictive first-principles methods for understanding nonlinear optical responses of materials. Materials and nanostructures with tailored nonlinear optical properties are not only important for understanding, probing, and ultimately controlling light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, but highly desirable for many applications such as ultrafast nonlinear optics, biosensing, all-optical transistor and computer, and optical quantum teleportation, communication, and computing. Recently, giant nonlinear optical processes such as second and third harmonic generation were discovered in two-dimensional crystals and topological materials, which challenges the current understanding and requires fundamental investigation at the microscopic level. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to advance fundamental understanding and theoretical prediction of nonlinear light-matter interaction in materials. The research will focus on developing and applying first-principles density-functional-based methods and approaches to investigate and eventually predict second and third order nonlinear optical responses of materials. Spin-orbit coupling, crystalline symmetry, causality, electron-hole interaction, quasiparticle energy, and quasiparticle lifetime due to carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon interactions will be included in this first-principles theoretical framework. Particular emphasis will be placed on elucidating the role of symmetry, electronic topology, surface/edge, and spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional materials and topological materials. The results obtained will generate new knowledge of nonlinear optical processes and contribute materials design principles for control of light-matter interactions.<br/><br/>To integrate outreach and education with the research, the PI will host and train high-school students from under-represented groups and secondary school teachers in scientific computing and simulations during summers to motivate the aspiration and curiosity of the students in science and engineering. The PI will also integrate the research into undergraduate and graduate curricula, provide multidisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students, disseminate the developed computational tools in computational materials science summer schools, and promote women in materials science and engineering through seminar series. The graduate students working on this project will acquire a solid interdisciplinary background in physics, materials science, and high-performance computing. In addition, the computational methods, codes, and data generated from this project will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community, the industry, and the general public through open-source distributions with the intent to benefit the broader research, education, and outreach in the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the path to AM as a viable and safe alternative in applications where structural components must carry loads (in some cases, where components must sustain repetitive loading over long periods of time) is at a critical junction. The widespread incorporation of this transformative manufacturing technology is hampered by the fact that it is currently not possible to predict when and why an additively manufactured metal component might fail, and to design the component accordingly to mitigate risk of failure. This presents a major problem for many industries that are looking to use AM to produce metal load-bearing components. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to address this pressing need and to enable the expanded, yet safe, use of metal AM in many industries, including aerospace, automotive, biomedical, manufacturing, and national defense. The research is closely integrated with a unique outreach program that will engage students across different age levels and backgrounds, including middle-school students from rural locations in Utah.<br/><br/>The research supported by this CAREER award is a fundamental step toward expanding the use of AM to fatigue-critical applications through the discovery of 3D, microstructure-sensitive, fatigue-crack driving mechanisms in additively manufactured aluminum. Two parallel research thrusts will be carried out. One thrust will focus on experimentally characterizing the microstructural features in 3D neighborhoods of fatigue cracks observed in aluminum specimens produced by laser powder bed fusion. The second thrust will focus on numerically characterizing the local micromechanical fields that evolve in 3D as a function of underlying, manufacturing-induced microstructure and defect distribution, with particular focus on residual-stress incompatibility, porosity, and surface roughness. Data-driven approaches will be leveraged across the experimental and numerical data sets to provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for fatigue failure among the specimens. While the research focuses on aluminum alloys, it is anticipated that the findings regarding the relative importance of geometrical defects, like pores and surface roughness, versus intrinsic material defects on fatigue failure of additively manufactured parts could be broadly applicable to other metals as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this urgent need various assistive robots have been developed to improve gait training outcomes, and impedance control (controlling the force of resistance to external motions that are produced by the environment) has been widely employed in these robots to ensure safe human-robot interaction.  However, it is difficult to personalize the virtual impedance for such robots due to the complex nature of human neurological and musculoskeletal dynamics.  On the other hand, a physical therapist can provide adaptive assistance to a patient at the correct moment in a gait cycle based on real-time sensory feedback and clinical experience.  Inspired by this observation, one could imagine designing an assistive robot control system by learning from therapists' demonstrations, but such a purely data-driven approach could lead to significantly degraded performance with new gait patterns, which creates safety risks for users. This research will develop a hybrid assistive robot control approach, which integrates model-based impedance control with machine learning from therapists' behaviors so that the resultant robot assistance is safe yet adaptive.  Project outcomes will include a novel algorithm framework for physical human-robot collaboration that exhibits both performance guarantees due to the model-based control and intelligent adaptation resulting from robot learning.  The new technology will have a wide range of applications in many other safety-critical human-robot collaboration scenarios, including collaborative manufacturing, (semi) autonomous driving, and service robots.  The broader impacts of the work will be further enhanced by tight integration of the research with educational activities including new modules in existing robotics classes, research opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, and internships for local high-school students.<br/>  <br/>The scientific contribution of the work will include: 1) integration of heterogeneous wearable sensor data to build the robot learning model from therapists' demonstrations, and human knee impedance characterization to build the robot impedance control model; 2) a robot planning approach based on a fusion of learning from demonstration and impedance control, with the weights determined by the degree of confidence in the robot learning model; and 3) automatic requests for new demonstration data and incorporation of subject feedback to refine both the robot learning and impedance control models.  Performance of the approach will be assessed in biomechanical simulations, in lab tests with healthy subjects, and in a pilot study with stroke and Parkinson's disease patients.  It is envisioned that project outcomes will make assistive robots highly intelligent so that a therapist could work with multiple patients simultaneously and even remotely, which could significantly reduce both the therapists' labor intensity and cost of rehabilitation training for patients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(3) How might one quantify the relative robustness of various proposals? The project aims to generate novel theoretical results that advance the frontiers of both statistics and optimization theory. New algorithms will be devised for high-dimensional statistical estimation with guaranteed accuracy under a broader set of model assumptions. The theoretical analysis will involve studying a variety of non-convex estimators of independent interest in the optimization community, with emphasis on objectives and optimization algorithms that give rise to statistically consistent solutions. The research project will also address long-standing open questions in robust statistics involving optimization of low-dimensional non-convex objective functions, and the investigator will examine a variety of new problem settings arising in machine learning applications, including adversarially contaminated data, non-iid observations, and mislabeled datasets dichotomized into training and testing data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to conventional machining, where parts are made by cutting away unwanted material, additive manufacturing -- also called 3D printing -- builds three-dimensional objects of unprecedented complexity by progressively adding small amounts of material. Powder bed fusion (PBF), in which new material is added to the part being fabricated by applying and selectively melting a powdered feedstock, is a popular form of AM for fabricating complex metallic or high-performance polymeric parts. This project supports fundamental research to create new thermal modeling, sensing, and control algorithms that will lead to precise and reliable PBF. The modeling task will enable fast and accurate prediction of heat flow and temperature distribution during powder fusion. The resulting knowledge on directing heat flow is essential for achieving a desired three-dimensional shape. The sensing task will formulate new signal processing algorithms that discard unnecessary information to make full use of data-intensive sensor sources like high-speed video. Finally, these results will be integrated with new control algorithms in order to counteract process variations and provide repeatable, low-cost, high-quality parts. AM offers untapped potential in a wide range of products for the energy, aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and biomedical industries. PBF parts are increasingly preferred in applications ranging from advanced jet-engine components to custom-designed medical implants. Therefore, the outcomes of this project will facilitate fabrication of products to benefit the US economy and improve quality of life. Broader impacts of the project will be augmented by dissemination of educational results via a network of twenty-four collaborating universities, to inculcate skills for innovative problem solving into undergraduate engineering education.<br/> <br/>The powder bed fusion process exploits precision heating and rapid solidification, together with layer-by-layer adjustments to feedstock application, and scan speed and path of lasers or electron beams. This project will expand knowledge at the interface of modeling and process controls, to consider the main obstacles to precision manufacturing with AM. Specifically, the project will address (1) the lack of tractable online models that capture multi-scale thermomechanical interactions, and (2) the need for control strategies in the presence of limited-bandwidth sensor feedback. A dynamic real-time model will be produced through separation of the cross-scan and cross-layer dynamics, allowing currently intractable powder fusion dynamics to be treated in real time, using computation-friendly primitives. Then the structure of the process dynamics will be used to enable a feedback controller for laser energy deposition. Controlling the proper energy deposition is critical for ensuring quality and reproducibility. The approach will be based on modeling and adaptation methods originally developed in precision mechatronics, in conjunction with a formulation of multi-rate control that can reject structured thermal disturbances at a fast, user-configurable sampling rate. Collectively, the project will add the needed new knowledge on quality assurance to future repetitive and layer-by-layer thermomechanical processes, by (1) establishing a physics-based, control-oriented modeling approach to understand and engineer the layered thermal interactions, and by (2) creating a foundation for closed-loop control solutions to produce desired uniform temperature fields in periodic and near-periodic deposition of thermal energy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is daunting to identify a material that enables independent control of chemical composition, surface topography, mobility of functional groups, mechanical properties, and charge.  Polymer coatings comprising macromolecules linked at various locations via so-called crosslink points attached to surfaces may fit the bill.  A major obstacle that has hindered widespread application of such materials is the need for chemical synthesis of specialty polymers.  This project overcomes this limitation by turning a wide variety of polymers into surface-anchored crosslinked polymer coatings using a family of simple crosslinker molecules that are either commercially available or are very easy to synthesize.  Thus, anyone can utilize the proposed method in combination with a variety of starting materials to fabricate functional surfaces with controlled composition, softness, surface topography, and other important physico-chemical characteristics.  The processes leading to the formation of such surfaces have been designed to be highly scalable, so that they could be, in principle, applied to coat large-area surfaces.  This research project will also contribute to education of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in science and engineering.  These involve scientific training and communication, presentation skills, as well as ethical principles in science and technology.  Outreach activities in both local venues (high schools and colleges in the Research Triangle area) as well as at elementary school in Ararat, VA (located in one of the most rural areas of our country) will take place.  Local K-12 students and teachers will be encouraged to participate in the research/educational activities through individual mentoring and via programs organized by NC State's Science House.  Current efforts and future plans for organizing scientific and outreach meetings for academe, industry, and general public in the Research Triangle region are included.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to create functional surfaces by attaching polymer network films with highly tailorable characteristics onto solid substrates.  These polymer networks comprise arrays of long chain molecules (i.e., macromolecules) connected mutually at several nodes (i.e., crosslink points).  The polymer networks are generated by crosslinking macromolecules using small functional molecules (SFMs) equipped with two functional groups, A and B, wherein A forms a chemical bond with a neighboring polymer chain, and B groups from two neighboring SFMs (or/and the substrate) form either a chemical or a physical bond, depending on the nature of the B units.  This method makes any polymer, regardless of its functionality, amenable to chemical crosslinking and immobilization on surfaces.  Importantly, the SFMs are either available commercially or can be readily synthesized.  The immediate scientific and technological impact lies in providing a source-agnostic framework to design and produce surfaces with controlled chemical composition, tuned (and erasable) topology, tailorable softness and friction, and other relevant physico-chemical interfacial characteristics.  The simplicity and tunablity of the network-forming process makes it ideal for scientists and engineers without requiring high chemical expertise, and broadens its scope to biomedical and healthcare sciences, security, or national defense.  The project description outlines tasks that aim at testing the proposed hypothesis of network generation and establishing structure-process properties.  Specifically, the structure and kinetics of network formation will be established for a series of different SFMs, different annealing times, and annealing temperatures.  Functional polymer network coatings that alter mechanical properties of topography in response to external magnetic fields will be generated by incorporating magnetically-responsive nanoparticles into the SFMs.  The proposed effort also outlines new ways of forming bilayers featuring hydrogels (i.e., polymer networks that swell in water) and silicone elastomers (i.e., flexible rubbers that do not require solvent to remain flexible).  These laminates are frequently used in biomedical, shape-changing, and deformable materials, yet their preparation currently relies on harsh physical treatment of the elastomer component.  The proposed methodology removes this limitation and enables novel, cleaner, and reproducible manufacturing of these important composite materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Planning problems for conservation and sustainable development have huge numbers of states and actions, and significant modeling uncertainty. This career-development project supports an integrated program of research, teaching, and outreach to develop new algorithms to convert data into knowledge and decisions for global-scale ecological sustainability.

With a long-term perspective, archaeology is well-suited to assess resource management strategies because what is successful in the short-term may not be successful over hundreds or thousands of years. Turbulent times do not affect all people equally, and this project will address how degrees of access to resources change as political and ecological environments change. Throughout the course of this research project, both Belizean citizens and Northwestern University undergraduates will be trained in archaeological methods.

The city flourished from 750-1100 CE, a time when many large Maya cities were abandoned due to a combination of drought and political upheaval. Important resources within the city of Aventura were pocket bajos, small non-draining depressions in the land that were either used for water management or agriculture in the past. This research will determine how pocket bajos were used and who had access to the resources they provided. The project will assess how commoner access to pocket bajo resources changed as drought and political instability increased regionally. The research team will conduct systematic excavations of a commoner household and take soil cores from a pocket bajos in Aventura.

Nationally, there are many regions in which seismic hazards are especially uncertain because the return periods of earthquakes are longer than the historic record.  In other words, it is known that earthquakes have and will continue to occur, but because prior earthquakes predate human records and/or the advent of seismic instruments, the expected characteristics of future earthquakes are highly uncertain.  In these locales, soil liquefaction caused by past earthquakes, termed ""paleoliquefaction,"" may provide the only evidence from which information about the seismic-hazard can be determined, including earthquake magnitudes, locations, and recurrence-rates.  As a result, U.S. building codes are heavily influenced by paleoliquefaction evidence, and in turn, so too is public safety.  This award supports fundamental research to improve the analysis of paleoliquefaction, which at present suffers from limitations that can lead to highly erroneous results.  The findings will not only advance paleoliquefaction analytics, but will also benefit the understanding of liquefaction hazards in general, thus further reducing earthquake impacts on the built and natural environments.  In addition, an educational research component will investigate links between seismic risk perception and socio-psychological bias, leading to more effective educational platforms in natural hazards engineering. <br/><br/>This CAREER project aims to remove ubiquitous barriers to the accurate inverse-analysis of paleoliquefaction, which will be achieved by bridging fundamental knowledge-gaps at three distinct scales.  The research includes: (1) micro-scale physical-numerical investigation of the mechanics controlling the formation and morphology of fluidized dikes and sand boils; (2) meso-scale formulation of a coupled, mechanically-consistent liquefaction triggering and manifestation model; and (3) a macro-scale approach to probabilistically geolocate seismic sources from paleoliquefaction and assess their rupture magnitudes.  An analytical framework developed from the fundamental research will then be applied to paleoliquefaction evidence in regions where enigmatic seismic-hazards significantly impact society.  These include the Cascadia Subduction Zone of the Northwest U.S.; the New Madrid Seismic Zone of the Central U.S.; the South Carolina Coastal Plain of the Eastern U.S.; and Coastal New England in the Northeast U.S.  Aided by physical and numerical multi-scale modeling, field testing, and unprecedented case-history data, this research will advance both paleoliquefaction analytics and the understanding of liquefaction hazards in general, thus reducing future earthquake impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With sufficient data and the appropriate statistical tools, researchers can now hope to recover structures in the data that were once deemed too intricate to identify with traditional ""small"" data.  Extracting complex hidden structures in massive data often requires flexible nonparametric methods; however, there are several fundamental challenges that make existing nonparametric methods impractical or inadequate.  At the core of these challenges is a conflict between two essential aspects in big data analysis: (i) the need for flexible methodology for capturing complex features and (ii) the cost, both computational and statistical, associated with this additional flexibility. Effective resolution of this fundamental conflict requires new paradigms of nonparametric inference. The long-term research objective of this project is to develop inference paradigms, including theory, methods, algorithms, and software, for nonparametric inference and learning that effectively resolve this fundamental conflict.  The research will lead to the development of statistical tools that meet urgent needs for scalable nonparametric data analysis in a wide range of fields, including biology, economics, astrophysics, chemistry, and information technology. The project will address the integration of research with educational activities through teaching and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to students from local colleges.<br/><br/>This project will develop and investigate a particularly promising paradigm, multi-scale divide-and-conquer, to address the fundamental conflict between flexibility and cost.  Specific inference problems to be addressed cover a wide range of nonparametric inference and learning objectives, and can be organized into three research thrusts: (i) joint nonparametric modeling of multiple data generative processes; (ii) characterizing dependency between random variables/vectors; and (iii) response-domain ensemble supervised learning. Beyond addressing these specific objectives, the proposed research will introduce theoretical and computational devices for evaluating and improving the statistical and computational efficiency of multi-scale divide-and-conquer methods in general. The output of the research will include practical methods and algorithms for carrying out a variety of important nonparametric inference tasks on massive data, as well as general guiding principles for effective multi-scale statistical analysis.

However, the need to propagate uncertainty through the system when estimating state-of-the-art risk/resiliency metrics significantly hinders, if not precludes, the use of such models. This difficulty becomes exasperated in risk-based decision-making where multiple building design solutions must be evaluated and compared over several hazards. The research goal of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award is to overcome this fundamental limitation through the investigation of a new simulation paradigm based on the optimal fusion of low-/intermediate-fidelity metamodels with high-fidelity structural models. By defining the metamodels through domain independent approaches, multi-hazard assessment will be naturally encompassed and will enable new approaches for rapidly identifying the optimal tradeoff solutions to multi-hazard risk-based decision problems. These advances will provide models and procedures for enabling a full transition to optimal risk-based design, while promoting the rational use of computational resources through rigorous optimization. Risk-based design will benefit national welfare and prosperity through enhancing the safety of the built environment against wind and seismic events to better protect life and property during extreme events and to maintain essential services and business continuities during response and recovery. The educational goals of this CAREER award are to increase the number of women in engineering and professionals with expertise in wind loss mitigation. This will be achieved through a high school outreach program that leverages the link between risk-based engineering and societal benefit to inspire a diverse student pool to pursue careers in engineering, the development of an undergraduate wind engineering program at the University of Michigan, and undergraduate student research opportunities. To implement the high school outreach program, project-based learning modules that connect risk-based engineering and societal benefit through basic science will be created. Dissemination of these materials will be achieved through a teacher training workshop. Data from this project will be archived in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>This research will create a new class of parametric metamodels (surrogate models) through identifying orthogonal subspaces for each high-fidelity computational model of the simulation environment. This will provide a setting in which both physics-based and data-driven reduced-order parametric metamodels can be defined through hyper-reduction and machine learning. The combined space of the high-fidelity and parametric metamodels will provide an enriched simulation environment in which multi-fidelity uncertainty propagation models can be defined for rapidly estimating high-fidelity probabilistic risk/resiliency metrics. The parametric nature of the metamodels will enable the creation of new adaptive multi-objective optimization schemes that will allow the rapid identification of high-fidelity multi-hazard Pareto fronts, which are central for effective risk-based decision-making.

The investigator plans to produce a workload classification schema in preparation for developing adaptive, workload-aware automated storage tuning and provisioning framework. The project has two main goals, (1) learning what to measure by creating a parameterized taxonomy of the model workloads; and (2) learning how to measure by creating a framework to infer and categorize functionally distinct workloads.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to understand how these genetic pathways function, one must identify and understand the patterns of DNA elements that ultimately control these genes. To address this fundamental scientific challenge in biological informatics, this project will use pattern recognition techniques in order to develop a detailed understanding of the way in which plant genes are controlled by DNA-encoded information. In order to do this, we will develop specific computational techniques for building and interpreting pattern recognition models. The most important aspect of this research is creating algorithms with the ability to recognize when a number of different DNA element patterns provide biologically relevant solutions for gene control. The algorithms, models, and biological outcomes developed by this project will be made available to the scientific community, including the plant science community. The underlying computational methods are expected to be applicable in many other fields of science and engineering. Teaching and training modules developed by this project will include outreach to our underserved communities of rural Oregon, including hands-on science experiences for high school students, as well as teacher training. The modules will draw special attention to the need for computationally trained researchers in the plant sciences, and to the need for a dramatically increased understanding of plant gene regulatory networks as a foundation for new drug discovery, agricultural, and materials biosynthesis challenges. <br/><br/>The combinatorial control of gene expression by Transcription Factors (TFs) is one of the most fundamental regulatory mechanisms across the eukaryotic tree of life, from plants to humans. The DNA region surrounding the start of a gene, called the promoter region, contains short regulatory sequence elements known as Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs). In plants, despite the many exciting potential advances that hinge on a detailed understanding of plant gene regulation, relatively little is known about the specific TFBS patterns that lead to gene expression. This project uses and extends a machine learning model developed by the Megraw lab that is able to predict the presence of Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) with high accuracy and resolution. A primary advantage of this model is that it suggests specific sets of TFBS:promoter interactions which have the potential to 'turn on' a particular gene. This model makes novel use of currently available high-throughput TSS data to examine the global structure of promoters in the model plant Arabidopsis, and in preliminary research suggests striking unanticipated differences between plant and animal DNA regulatory codes. The goal of this project is to rigorously test and expand this promising new computational approach for dissecting which TFBS sets are optimal predictors of gene up-regulation in a biological sample. The relative simplicity of the Arabidopsis genome makes this challenge tractable, yet capable of providing transformative insight into gene regulation in a multicellular organism.

However, it is challenging to provide effective personalized help, particularly online. Synchronous tools such as video chat enable interactive help but limit scheduling flexibility, which is a key advantage of online courses. Asynchronous tools such as discussion forums provide flexibility and allow students to learn from prior questions but are less interactive and lose important contextual information about the learner's question.  This project aims to design, build, and test ""semi-synchronous"" tools to combine the best of both help styles. The idea is that capturing snapshots of the program's code and output should allow learners to ask clearer questions and let instructors form a more complete picture of the problem that should improve their answers, while integrating chat features with the code and tracking how code changes as the discussion progresses should help other learners make more effective use of prior questions.  Building and testing these tools will advance knowledge about how to develop scalable collaborative systems, useful information repositories, and more effective support resources for programming courses.  Further, it will have practical impacts on software education, particularly for students with lower socioeconomic status who could benefit most from better support in online courses.<br/><br/>The project is organized around the evolution and evaluation of an existing prototype semi-synchronous tool called chat.codes.  On the development side, there are two major activities.  The first is integrating version tracking with the existing chat interface and developing tools to visualize how code changes along with conversational turns during a help session.  The second involves developing tools to archive, search, and view past conversations based on specific discussion topics, code keywords, or instructor-created tags.  The evaluation has four main phases.  The first is a one-hour lab study pairing students and instructors on simulated programming tasks that require students to learn a new concept from the instructor, aimed at evaluating the usability of chat.codes relative to other synchronous help systems.  The second is a lab study to test the archiving, search, and visualization features, assigning students to a programming problem and giving them access to the help sessions from the first experiment but not a live instructor to see how well the archived conversations both help solve the programming problems and convey the underlying concepts.  Results from both studies will be used to improve chat.codes, which will then be deployed as a remote support tool for two semesters in a large in-person introductory undergraduate programming course.  This deployment will be open-ended and students and instructors will not be required to use the tool but will be encouraged to do so; the project team will use a combination of interviews where they ask users to compare chat.codes to other support tools, along with analysis of logged help sessions, to better understand the strengths and weaknesses that come with integrating the code and chat elements.  The team will then develop a final version of the tool that will be deployed alongside existing online programming courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Galaxies were just beginning to form from the matter created in the Big Bang, and the intense radiation emitted by these galaxies was burning away the fog of hydrogen gas permeating deep space.  In less than one billion years the fog had cleared, and the young galaxies lived in a Universe where ultraviolet radiation could travel freely through space.  This transformation of the gas in deep space is known as ""cosmic reionization"", and it was a landmark event in the early Universe.  By studying reionization we learn not only about the history of matter in the Universe, but about the formation of the first galaxies.  The goal of this project is to connect the changes we see happening in deep space during reionization to the characteristics of the first galaxies themselves.  How can we combine observations of galaxies and deep space to learn more about this era of cosmic history?  What imprints on the Universe does reionization leave behind?  The PI will use the world's largest telescopes to directly probe both galaxies and intergalactic gas over the same regions early in cosmic history.  The observations will be combined with state-of-the art computer modeling to better understand how cosmic reionization occurred and the ways in which it impacted early galaxies and the matter in deep space.  Building on this research, the PI will integrate his observational expertise into local high-school and undergraduate education.  A key element of this program will be the creation of a campus observatory at UC Riverside.  This will be one of the few such facilities in the country to offer spectroscopy, one of the most broadly used techniques in science and industry, and will be used to promote STEM engagement among underserved groups in Southern California.<br/><br/>Roughly one billion years after the Big Bang the Universe underwent a global transformation.  The first galaxies formed in a Universe filled with dark matter and cold, neutral gas.  As the radiation from these galaxies permeated deep space, however, the gas was ionized and heated, rendering the Universe transparent to ultraviolet photons.  Thirteen billion years later the gas in deep space is still highly ionized.  The early transition from neutral to ionized was therefore the last phase transition of matter in the Universe.  Known as ""reionization"", this transformation was a key event in cosmic history.  <br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to determine when and how reionization occurred by simultaneously studying the gas in deep space and the galaxies embedded within it.  The PI will use the word's largest telescopes to study galaxies (via wide-field imaging) and intergalactic gas (via absorption-line spectroscopy) in the same cosmic volumes during and after reionization.  Spectroscopy will also be used to study the gas in and around galaxies themselves.  These will be the first observations to directly connect the evolving conditions in deep space to the sources driving the evolution.  By further combining data with state-of-the-art modeling, this project will provide a better understanding of how cosmic reionization occurred and the ways in which it shaped early galaxies and intergalactic matter throughout the Universe.

A further objective is to promote connections to statistical physics and computer science, where random csps are fundamental models. Indeed, recent progress on random csps has crucially relied on the exchange of ideas among several disciplines: probability, statistical physics, combinatorics, and computer science. The proposed research will endeavor to advance this dialogue, which has potential to open new research avenues in those disciplines. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature: its primary focus is in the development of probability theory, but it is expected that the research approach will be much influenced by developments in statistical physics and computer science. The educational component of the proposal seeks to further promote this interdisciplinary aspect, in classroom education as well as in mentorship of graduate students. With the proliferation of statistical inference problems on large datasets, the development of fast algorithms for combinatorial problems becomes an increasingly urgent problem. At the same time it becomes more important to quantify fundamental barriers in these problems, in terms of information-theoretic and algorithmic limits. This study is complemented by proposing to develop more robust techniques to handle a wider range of problems, including some concrete problems of interest for network theory and machine learning. The educational component involves curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate special topic course development, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorial search/optimization problems are prominent in a wide range of scientific contexts. Broadly, the defining feature of these problems is that the a priori solution requires exhaustive search over a combinatorial state space such as {0,1}^n. A major challenge is that many such problems are expected to be computationally intractable in worst-case instances (np-hard). In response to this, significant attention has been directed towards random problem instances - they represent natural average-case scenarios, and serve as a useful practical benchmark. A deeper understanding of obstacles in the random setting has potential to inspire algorithmic advances. Practical considerations aside, random problem instances are of deep theoretical interest, and full of rich connections among diverse fields of research. In probability theory, random csps have contributed numerous long-standing open problems - especially ones concerning various phase transitions, conjectured either from numerical simulations or from physical heuristics. A notable problem of this type is the location of sharp satisfiability thresholds. It is a widely held belief that for many random csps, the solution space has a complicated geometric structure; and that this is precisely what obstructs standard probabilistic approaches for analyzing phase transitions. Moreover, it is conjectured that essential features of the solution space geometry are universal to a large class of random csps. Some components of this conjectural picture have been validated by recent progress in the theory of random csps, including results on satisfiability thresholds and partition function asymptotics. However, many key aspects of this picture - particularly ones relevant to algorithmic challenges - remain at the level of conjecture. One of the main goals of the current project is to shed light on these questions: to this end, specific research problems are posed regarding asymptotic properties of the solution space (in the search context) and energy landscape (in the optimization context).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through this process, individual components (for example, molecules) that are guided merely by local binding rules coalesce to form complex structures.  This process is integral to the formation of many vastly complicated structures such as snowflakes and even biological organisms like viruses.  Using self-assembly, scientists are developing a bottom-up manufacturing approach to nanotechnology where instead of starting with raw materials and extracting a desired structure, molecular building blocks are designed so that these building blocks selectively bind in such a way that the desired structure self-assembles with molecular- (if not atomic-) level precision.  While many mathematical models have been defined to serve as a theory for the design and analysis of engineered self-assembling systems, as self-assembly is also a naturally occurring phenomenon, models of self-assembly are useful in modeling natural systems.  A common important feature of many naturally occurring examples of self-assembling systems is that these systems are driven by the complex interaction of distributed components. In order to describe the balancing act observed in the distributed components that play a role in many biological functions, this project will use mathematical models of self-assembly to study how complex sequences of communication between self-assembled components can yield functionality that surpasses functionality of a single self-assembled component. By supporting many undergraduate research assistants, this project will impact the campus and departmental research environment, as well as the quality of undergraduate education.  Moreover, the project will increase awareness of interdisciplinary research at University of Wisconsin-River Falls by means of an interdisciplinary research seminar targeting a general audience and advertised to undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>The project proposes the study of fundamental questions that initiate the development of rigorous frameworks for modeling systems which exhibit distributed behaviors, leading to techniques that could directly be applied in defining tile assembly systems which mimic biological functions.  Ultimately, studying distributed systems in models of self-assembly leads to further understanding of the complex behaviors as well as potential novel uses of distributed systems in self-assembly - uses that can be employed in engineered self-assembling systems.  The project will use active tile assembly models such as the Signal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM) to define and analyze systems, which overcome defined constraints to exhibit algorithmic behavior, by necessarily relying on this behavior being distributed among the individual assemblies of the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This relationship, observed in dozens of species in scores of habitats, consistently shows that the number of surviving offspring produced per female declines as the number of individuals in the population increases. Managing the harvest of these species depends on understanding this relationship because the largest harvests are sustained when populations are neither too big nor too small. Despite the importance of density dependence to hunters, pastoralists, and ranchers worldwide, the mechanism producing this relationship remains poorly understood. The goal of this project is to improve our general understanding of the mechanism causing density dependence in herbivore populations.

The resulting designs are highly optimized for their application, enabling lightweight high-performance structures. However, the designs tend to have an intricate organic-looking structure making them challenging to manufacture reliably and economically. Prior attempts to impose manufacturing constraints during the topology optimization process have had limited success. Furthermore, current methods cannot directly consider manufacturing costs, making it difficult for designers to factor in economic objectives or constraints. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to formulate the first framework to systematically incorporate geometric design rules and manufacturing cost in topology optimization, and to integrate this framework with educational activities that improve the attitudes of underrepresented minorities towards STEM fields. This research will enable the conceptual design and optimization of lightweight, high-performance, and economically-viable structures with applications across a wide range of engineering industries. The new design capabilities will have the potential to significantly reduce manufacturing and R&D costs and thereby increase the economic competitiveness of American manufacturers. This award will also positively impact underrepresented minorities through an integrated education plan aimed at increasing student self-efficacy and stimulating their participation in STEM. The educational program includes an engaging, virtual-reality based after-school program for middle school students. This program will also engage and impact K-12 teachers and undergraduate and graduate students, and it will be a conduit to communicate research outcomes to the wider public and the research community.<br/><br/>Although topology optimization is a successful technique for structural design, its impact is limited by challenges in incorporating manufacturing constrains and economic considerations into the optimization process. These gaps are rooted in the difficulty to express many manufacturing-driven geometric requirements in terms of the design representations used by existing techniques, the discrete nature of some geometric features, and the fact that manufacturing cost can be a non-smooth function of the design. This CAREER project will make three major intellectual contributions to the computational design of structures, namely the coupling of feature-based design representations with 1) global optimization methods to escape entrapment in undesired local minima in the presence of many geometric design rules; 2) discrete optimization methods to accommodate discrete geometric features; and 3) parametric cost models and non-smooth optimization methods to incorporate cost in the topology optimization problem.

Today's data sets, from areas such as machine learning, are often massive and high-dimensional: for example, when trying to classify news articles, each article may be represented as a point where the frequency of each word is a different dimension. This leads to geometries that are hard to grasp intuitively and hard to work with computationally (the ""curse of dimensionality""). Finding a smaller and lower dimensional subset of the data points that approximately preserves geometric structure not only reduces computation time but also can improve results by suppressing extraneous features. Representing inter-point distances of a general space in a more structured space can support new operations, such as data visualization by mapping the 2-D plane of the screen, or more efficient computation by mapping to the hierarchical structure of a tree. This project takes the age-old practice of teasing out geometric structure and applies it to the large- and high-dimensional data sets of the modern world. By taking a geometric approach to foundational problems in areas such as big data and machine learning, this project seeks to more closely connect computational geometry and these other areas, in turn both modernizing the classical field of computational geometry and advancing these other areas. The educational goals of this project will be achieved by directly supporting student research on the outlined topics, incorporating topics into developing new courses, and organizing regular seminars in order to grow the visibility and interdisciplinary nature of algorithms and theoretical computer science at the awardee institution.<br/><br/>Given a data set, the goal is to specify its geometric structure, use this structure to summarize and embed into simpler spaces where computations can be done efficiently, and when this is not possible, identify how to minimally fix the data to facilitate these tasks.

This will lead to a paradigm shift in the optimization and design of higher quality diverse engineering systems ranging from nano-mechanical oscillators, to vibratory energy harvesters and civil infrastructure systems at reduced cost. The results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society in general.  The diverse education and outreach plan will also impact the advancement of next-generation researchers and practicing engineers, as well as students and educators via the teaching and learning innovations. <br/><br/>Available techniques for solving the governing equations and determining the stochastic response of dynamical systems can be broadly divided into two categories: a) those that exhibit high accuracy, but can handle a very small number of stochastic dimensions due to prohibitive computational cost, and b) those that can readily treat high-dimensional systems, but provide reliable estimates for low-order response statistics only (e.g. mean and standard deviation). In comparison to the current state-of-the-art techniques, the path integral methodology will exhibit superior accuracy and computational efficiency. To achieve high accuracy the research approach is to account for higher order terms (fluctuations) in related path integral expansions. At the same time the error of the methodology will be quantified. To achieve high computational efficiency and account for a large number of stochastic dimensions (>100), the research approach is to explore highly sparse representations for the system response in conjunction with appropriate optimization algorithms. The methodology will also be versatile, accounting for cases of complex stochastic excitation and system modeling including fractional derivatives, and non-Gaussian, nonlinear, and hysteretic response behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research deals with the question of whether a given dynamical system has rigidity properties, namely whether different trajectories must display a lot of common patterns. The principal investigator will conduct research on the topic, collaborate with other researchers, work with graduate and undergraduate students, and disseminate ideas developed in the project.

Phase transitions are commonly found around us; for example, in the boiling of water, or in the reverse process of condensing water vapor into rain. In some semiconducting materials, a remarkably similar phase transition may occur. When exposed to the energy a continuous laser beam, electrons in the material get excited from their normal quantum state into another. However, the excited electron in its new state feels an effective attraction to the ""hole"" it left behind, i.e. the place where it used to be. If enough electrons get pumped into the excited state, they - and their hole counterparts - can undergo a gas-to-liquid-type phase transition. This phase transition, although its constituents are electrons and holes, has characteristics similar to the one found in water. However, a significant difference is that this happens on ultrafast time-scales (nanoseconds), and it involves a driving laser. Importantly, because the constituents are manifestly quantum objects, a host of exciting and interesting properties arise.<br/><br/>The materials in question form two-dimensional sheets, which means they may be incorporated into flexible electronics. On top of this, there is now the possibility of switching their behavior within nanoseconds from being a straightforward semiconductor (which are typically transparent materials) to being an object that is metallic and reflecting. This has promising applications for solar-light harvesting and for bypassing Moore's law through photonics. The project involves substantial development of algorithms and software, which will be disseminated to the community as open-source code.<br/><br/>In addition to the research, this CAREER award will support the improvement of STEM education in the U.S. by partnering with the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) to turn their successful ""Bootstrap for Computational Modeling in Physics First"" workshop into a distance-learning course.

The development of a distance-learning version will enable reaching a much larger set of participants, in particular from rural areas which may not have ready access to long in-person workshops.

This version of the workshop will initially be deployed in North Carolina, and will be further disseminated through AAPT across the country.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports research and education in theoretical and computational investigations of ultrafast out-of-equilibrium phase transitions. The research team will study the transition into an electron-hole liquid (EHL) that occurs at room temperature upon high photoexcitation in transition-metal dichalcogenides. Due to the ultrafast nature of the phase transition, time-domain approaches are critical. This project will determine the conditions for creating and sustaining the EHL, its response to external stimuli and proximity-coupled emergent orders, its tunability, and its transport and transfer dynamics. This understanding will enable the use of the electron-hole liquid in novel devices, and, in particular, in applications for solar-light harvesting and for bypassing Moore's law through photonics.<br/><br/>The project exploits an opportunity for high-impact science through theoretical study and computational method development for nonequilibrium science. One essential aspect of the problem is that it must be tackled in the time domain, rather than resorting to the usual equilibrium analytic techniques. The PI will address this challenge through nonequilibrium many-body theory and through collaboration with the experimental community. The research team will consider the concept of a nonequilibrium phase transition without reliance on ergodicity by performing self-consistent calculations in the broken-symmetry states in the time domain. Through these approaches, the research team will re-evaluate how we think about nonequilibrium processes and phase transitions in quantum materials, and break the reliance on equilibrium concepts. The algorithms and software created throughout the project will be disseminated to the community as open-source code.<br/><br/>In addition to the research, this CAREER award will support the improvement of STEM education in the U.S. by partnering with the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) to turn their successful ""Bootstrap for Computational Modeling in Physics First"" workshop into a distance-learning course.

(2) How does students' commenting and debugging compare and change depending on if they analyze worked examples before or after their play? (3) How does students' commenting and debugging of worked examples relate to their explaining and correcting errors in mathematics problems in addition to computer coding?  (4) How does the intervention affect students' early attitudes toward programming and knowledge of the role of programming in STEM professions?

This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will advance the science of automated computational design by creating new algorithms capable of generating and optimizing multi-body systems.  Starting with only a mathematical description of design materials and physical environment, the algorithms will automatically generate assemblies for compound machines that combine multiple basic components such as levers, hinges, wheels, and axles, which together form the foundation of all mechanical design. This work will enable a new level of automated computational design not previously possible under existing design frameworks.

This innovative technology holds great potential to usher biotechnology into a new era of precision medicine and tissue engineering. However, to date, neuroscientists have largely focused on the associated biological phenomena, with little attention to microvascular dynamics of nanoparticle transport, thus limiting the translation to clinical practice.

The research plan is to first create two dynamic models: one will capture the magnetic transport behavior of ultra-small nanoparticles within a microvasculature; the other will describe cytoskeleton dynamics within brain microvascular networks. Combined, a microvascular dynamic model of nanoparticle transport will be established to discern which parameters are needed for directing target-selective magnetic stimulation to produce a reliable and steady therapeutic tool by applying a pre-defined magnetic field on the nanoparticles. For the first time, cytoskeleton dynamics associated with growing neurons will be analyticaly modeled by perturbing a nanoparticle diffusing in a potential well with a slowly drifting minimum position. Importantly, this model will be constructed to track the individual growing behaviors of thousands of neurons, and perform high-throughput/low-cost sensitivity analyses to identify the key parameters in a complex brain microenvironment.

Smoke from these fires exposes millions of individuals to unhealthy air quality each year. In spite of this, fire is an essential component of many natural ecosystems where fire suppression has proven to be an unsustainable practice that harms the natural balance. The PI will develop computational tools and innovative assessments to help US land managers lessen the impact to human health of air pollution from smoke, while at the same time restoring the natural fire cycle to improve ecosystem health. Concurrent with this applied research initiative will be an educational program to train specialized environmental engineers and inform different segments of the US public about the benefits and challenges associated with wildland fire. <br/><br/>Wildland managers routinely manipulate fire, through prescribed burns and mechanical land treatments, to reduce the risk of hazardous wildfire and achieve important ecological objectives; however, these fire projects often fail to quantitatively account for the health impacts of smoke exposure. In contrast, air quality regulations seek to mitigate the negative effects of air pollution on public health but can overlook the value of active land management. Through computational modeling, environmental engineering education, and outreach the PI aims to align these air quality and land management objectives. To pursue this aim, the project includes the following goals: 1) enable fire management based on potential health impacts; 2) incorporate air pollution externalities into prescribed fire planning; 3) develop integrated land management and air quality scenarios; and 4) change perceptions of fire and smoke through environmental engineering education.  New modeling tools that encompass aspects from emissions to air pollution exposure will facilitate fire project management while minimizing potential health impacts. High-performance computing and ensemble modeling will be used to generate geographic assessments of the public health externalities of prescribed fire, facilitating their inclusion in regional wildland fire planning. The PI will also develop integrated land management and air quality scenarios that jointly consider wildfire risk, land treatments, air quality, and public health impacts. These scenarios will provide a basis for comprehensive integrated assessment modeling of wildland fire beyond smoke impacts.

As an example, for repairing broken bone, knowledge of the evolving damage determines how the polymeric biomedical implant can provide proper support and commensurately degrade and absorb into the body, while a broken bone heals. Currently design engineers lack the information necessary to predict the load carrying capacity of degradable polymeric components and, therefore, the designs are not optimal.  The results of this research will generate experimental data, mathematical models, and simulation tools that will uncover the relationship between chemical constituents and applied load on the degradation behavior of polymeric materials. That knowledge will enable improved engineering design in numerous applications where polymeric degradation occurs, thus advancing national prosperity and welfare along with scientific progress.

This general pattern has been known since the 1920s but the role of the clouds in cyclone evolution, and the effects of the cloud pattern on atmospheric circulation and climate, are still under study. The topic is of practical as well as scientific interest as clouds can only be represented in approximate form in current weather and climate models, and cloud errors limit the quality of simulations and forecasts. Results of the work have direct bearing on the quality of weather forecasts and climate projections used to provide guidance to decision makers and the public. In addition, the educational activities supported under this CAREER award advance science teaching at the high school, college, and graduate levels.<br/><br/>The research focuses specifically on cloud radiative effects (CREs), meaning the cooling caused by clouds as they reflect shortwave solar radiation back to space and the warming effect when they intercept outgoing longwave radiation emitted by the earth. In the deep clouds found in the eastern sector the longwave and shortwave effects show large cancellation, while shortwave cooling dominates in the low clouds on the western side. Preliminary work by the PI shows that, at least in the Southern Hemisphere, CRE evolves over the lifecycle of the cyclone, forming a north-south dipole during the decay phase with warming on the equatorward side. The north-south CRE dipole in the decaying stage could affect the meridional temperature gradient along the SH storm track, possibly helping to reestablish the meridional temperature contrast after cyclone passage and thus promoting further cyclone activity or influencing the latitude of the upper-level jet stream. The radiative effect of clouds around cyclones could also influence the behavior of low-frequency climate variability and secular climate change, both of which involve latitudinal shifts of jet streams and storm tracks. The work considers the dynamic and thermodynamic controls on the clouds as well as the influence of clouds on the midlatitude circulation. It is conducted through a combination of observational analysis and model simulation.<br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes efforts at the high school, college, and graduate level. At the high school level, the PI works with education experts at the Center for Teaching Excellence on the UVA campus, the Environmental Studies Academy (ESA) at Western Albermarle High School, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The goal is to develop a teaching module to introduce high school students to the role of clouds in the climate system. The module will be disseminated nationally through the web portal at UCAR. Undergraduate education is promoted through the development of a course on climate modeling and analysis. One issue addressed by the course is the lack of computer skills commonly found among undergraduates, which limits their ability to engage in scientific research. The course involves training in the use of data analysis software and hands-on projects conducted by groups of two to three students. Students from the class are recruited to conduct research in the summers, with emphasis on the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities. On the graduate level, the project supports two students who, in addition to their research and classwork, serve as mentors for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intergranular fracture is a specific failure mode common in structural materials throughout the automotive, aerospace, energy, and petrochemical industries. This fracture mode is associated with segregation of elemental species to the area that separates two orientations of crystals, referred to as a grain boundary (GB). The directionality of the bonds formed by these segregated species are believed to influence the fundamental manner in which the fracture occurs. We will explore bonds that are parallel to the GB, perpendicular to the GB, or non-directional, using segregation of elements such as chromium, molybdenum, or sulfur, in iron. We can utilize novel, nano-sized mechanical testing techniques to confirm this effect. However, reducing the mechanical test sample volume to the nano-scale can itself alter the fracture mechanism. We can use irradiation to maintain realistic and appropriate fracture mechanics. These results potentially establish irradiation as a means to alleviate fracture between grains and reduce the impact of materials' fracture across numerous industries. We will also create a research and educational partnership with a local community college in order to boost community college student transfer and retention rates, and fill a STEM workforce need. We will give a lesson and interactive assignment on the societal importance of fracture in a pre-engineering community college course. Community college students will also participate directly in this research through an 11-week summer research internship. Best practices from this program will be shared via the PI's service in professional societies, and this model for a university-community college partnership can be extended to other universities.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>Intergranular fracture is a common failure pathway in structural alloys and recycled steels, especially those subject to high temperature operation or cyclic loading, in a multitude of industries. Recent advancements in computational materials science have provided tremendous insight into grain boundary embrittlement and intergranular fracture of metallic alloys. However, experimental approaches have not advanced correspondingly, preventing validation of mechanisms and hence limiting our ability to mitigate this crucial fracture path. Intergranular fracture is associated with solute segregation to grain boundaries (GBs), which is believed to increase the GB surface energy and decrease the GB cohesive energy, culminating in GB decohesion or cleavage. But there is mounting theoretical evidence that for segregating solutes exhibiting highly directional bonds with host atoms at/across the GB, fracture is not attributed to simple bond-breaking arguments, but rather to the inhibition of dislocation nucleation. These theories have not previously been verified because the direct observation of dislocation nucleation during crack propagation is extremely difficult. While the recent development of transmission electron microscopic (TEM) in situ mechanical testing enables such observations, reduced specimen volumes inhibit realistic fracture mechanisms. However, irradiation produces a sufficient defect density so as to reduce the characteristic length of the specimen, enabling bulk-like fracture mechanisms. Irradiation also drives solute segregation to GBs. Hence, we utilize irradiation to enable direct observation of GB separation and/or dislocation nucleation in real time with TEM in situ fracture testing. These results will validate cohesive finite element method (CFEM) models to develop predictive capabilities for intergranular fracture based on bonding anisotropies. Success of this project can lead to transformational irradiation-based approaches for mitigating GB embrittlement. We also develop a model for a university-community college research and education partnership to enhance community college student efficacy and build a diverse workforce having a breadth of skills, abilities, and education levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While originally bounding theoretically the rate at which data may be transmitted over an imperfect channel, or how far an information source may be compressed, the foundational nature of these inequalities has led to their widespread applications in quantitative fields ranging from computer science to physics. This may be attributed, in part, to these inequalities being dimension-free, that is, the sharpness of the estimate does not degrade with the data dimension, thus making them suitable for analysis and inference in high-dimensional settings that are characteristic of modern problems in statistics, optimization and data science.  Broadly speaking, this project seeks to further elucidate these foundational underpinnings of information theory, and to extend their applicability to modern problems in statistics and data analysis that seek to uncover information from large data sets. The research is coupled with a plan to integrate research and education at multiple levels: the project will train researchers at the interface of statistics, information theory and mathematics, preparing them to enter academic and industrial careers in data science, and skillfully adapt to new fields as national priorities change. Other aims are to promote collaboration within the broader research community through development of thematic workshops and tutorials. <br/><br/>This project will undertake a systematic investigation of information inequalities. This goal will be achieved through an integrated research agenda that seeks to: (i) quantify high-dimensional statistical phenomena; (ii) characterize extremal properties of information inequalities; and (iii) discover new concentration and isoperimetric phenomena through linking information- and transportation-based quantities on graphs and other discrete spaces.

The ultimate objective of the project is to rival the ability of animals to navigate daunting obstacles in order to reach a desired goal. In contrast to standard quasi-static approaches to robot path planning, these bio-inspired methods will allow highly dynamic behavior -- that is, during its motion the robot will be able to pass through positions that would be impossibly unbalanced if the robot was standing still. This may occur as the robot makes a continuous series of jumps, without pausing at the intermediate points. Numerical efficiency, provided by a hierarchical decomposition into well-behaved subproblems, will allow the trajectories to be computed as they are needed. First, solutions will be generated based on a greatly simplified dynamic model, in terms of ""global"" quantities that describe the translation and rotation of a robot-fixed reference frame. Of particular interest are the force pulses generated during the instants when the jumping robot is in contact with other objects. Possible solution trajectories will be grouped by the number of hops required to reach the destination and the foot locations on the obstacles. Finally a detailed solution will incorporate the ""shape"" variables that describe the configuration of the robot components with respect to the robot-fixed frame. The findings from this study will help lead to the creation of legged robots for use in inhospitable or dangerous real-world environments, including for disaster response, military applications, and exploration of inaccessible or inhospitable locations. The project will also build upon the appeal of agile legged robots for education and outreach to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, including underrepresented minorities, to encourage the development of the next generation of engineers. <br/><br/>The objective of this study is to establish close connections between the mathematical modeling of legged robot systems, trajectory planning strategies, and the hardware design principles needed to create highly dynamic legged robots navigating complex unstructured environments. To realize the goal, this project will develop a hierarchical understanding of the dynamic behavior of position variables (global position and orientation) and shape variables (internal configuration) under the application of contact forces. Based on this understanding, a multilevel process will be sought for designing a collision-free feasible trajectory for the position variables, and then deforming the trajectory while gradually taking into account the effects of the shape variables. This will be achieved by (1) introducing model structures for legged robot systems that provide a hierarchical understanding and abstraction of complex dynamics, (2) establishing a trajectory-planning framework that combines approaches from convex optimization and numerical continuation methods by utilizing the newly obtained model structures, and (3) exploring hardware design principles that are tightly integrated with the trajectory-planning framework for rigorous validation and demonstration of the methods using torque-controlled robotic quadrupeds.

Soft robots are intelligent machines with a highly compliant physical structure -- that is, the body of the soft robot will bend when relatively small forces are applied to it. High compliance makes soft robots much safer around people than traditional rigid robots, and also allows soft robots to attain a variety of shapes and to move in many more ways than robots with only a small number of discrete joints. Because structures that are easy to bend cannot carry large loads, a major challenge in soft robotics is to create variable-stiffness structures that are compliant only in certain directions, or only at specific times. This project presents a new approach to engineering variable-stiffness soft robots, inspired by the art and science of ""origami,"" or paper folding. Origami-inspired soft robots use thin sheets of relatively stiff materials that are made bendable along designated fold lines; the folding pattern can be used to create very precise and complex equivalent mechanical properties. This engineered flexibility contrasts with soft robot structures made of materials such as rubbers and foams, which are limited in their achievable strength by the intrinsic softness of the material itself. In this project, origami-inspired folding patterns are used to create modules with a specified compliant behavior. Larger and more capable robots can then be built up by combining many such modules. Examples of the potential of modular origami-inspired robots include soft tentacle-like manipulation in confined spaces, whole-body and passive conformal grasping, and controllable shape change. The results of the project will advance the national health and prosperity, by enabling origami-inspired soft robots to be used in homes, hospitals, and manufacturing sites, as care-givers, co-workers, and self-morphing structures. Educational activities integrated with this project will use origami-inspired robots as teaching tools for students of all ages through outreach activities, high-school internships, and undergraduate projects. <br/><br/>This project will establish modular and scalable design and fabrication methods, characterize and model mechanical properties, and test control algorithms for lightweight origami-inspired modular continuum soft robots to intelligently perform manipulation, grasping, and shape-change tasks. A comprehensive integrated research and education plan will address (1) modular origami design, fabrication, and modeling, to study the mapping between mechanical properties of origami-inspired modules and their design/fabrication parameters, electrically addressable actuation using distributed tendons, distributed soft sensing of 3-D deformation and external forces, and computationally efficient clothoid formulation of continuum section deformations under external loads for dynamic modeling; (2) Control methods that endow soft robots with intelligence, to enable safe force/position interaction with the environment, synergistically combining motion planning and control at the state space, and hyper-redundancy of large scale modular systems to morph into desired shapes with minimal actuation and sensing requirements. Results will be evaluated through validation case studies in continuum arm manipulation, whole-body wrapping and utilizing conformal contact for grasping, and shape change and stiffness control by very large degree-of-freedom origami actuation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The emergence of particles with a size as tiny as a billionth of a meter (nanoparticles) can provide even more flexible and stronger materials with superior properties as billions of these particles can be incorporated into polymers to yield nanocomposite materials.  Modern chemistry can modify these nanoparticles at the molecular level, which leads to a substantial impact on their material behavior, often with unknown and novel properties. The challenge is to develop a relationship between molecular manipulations and macroscopic properties. This project approaches this task by controlling and varying the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles and by modifying the polymer molecules attached to the surfaces of these particles. The effects of nanoparticle confinement under these conditions will then be studied using advanced experimental techniques.  The project includes the understanding of the relationship between mechanical properties of the nanocomposite materials and the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles, as well as the theoretical description at the molecular length-scale.  This research is also integrated with education of students and exposing them to a variety of advanced experimental techniques.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The effects imposed by nanoconfinement on polymer melts will be studied in this research.  Emphasis will be on the manipulation of the chain dynamics by nanoparticle dispersion, surfaces, and the influence of chains grafted to surfaces. The current understanding is limited by knowledge gaps, which include a missing theoretical understanding of chain dynamics and how to distinguish effects of the particle dispersion and polymer chains. A holistic approach involving small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), dielectric spectroscopy (DS), and rheology, will be used to develop a theory based on recent progress to simultaneously describe the dielectric properties and rheology of polymer melts. Composites of NTPs (tethered chains on nanoparticles) dispersed in polymer matrices will be studied. The dispersion of the NTPs can be controlled by the grafting density, the molecular weight of free chains, and the corresponding characteristics of the NTPs. The static structure factor by SAXS can be used to obtain a phase map of systems with agglomerated and non-agglomerated particles, and to provide information on the length-scale of the confinement. The influence of the additional confinement imposed by nanoparticles on the chain dynamics will be explored, together with a change of the tube diameter of the polymer caused by surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need for improving EPN resiliency is underscored by the surge in the extent and number of power outages due to the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and blizzards. The failure of aging EPN-supporting infrastructures, particularly during these weather events, can lead to widespread service disruptions, delays in emergency response, and significant economic losses. This research will have significant broader impacts on national prosperity and welfare, i.e., community and regional resiliency, as it will address the growing national need for the resilient design of critical civil infrastructures, such as EPNs, over their expected service life. The research will investigate the key attributes contributing to the resiliency of a transmission system within an EPN and will develop a robust, risk-informed design methodology to increase this resiliency. This will be achieved through a systematic incorporation of the physical performance assessment of individual transmission line components into a network-level functionality analysis. The project will include an integrated research and education plan, to train the next generation of natural hazards engineers and researchers, consisting of the following elements: (1) interactive educational components for high school students to foster their interest in the field of natural hazard engineering, (2) new curricula to prepare future engineers for the design and management of resilient infrastructures, (3) activities, including a multi-tiered mentoring program, to recruit and retain women and underrepresented minority students in the field of natural hazard engineering, and (4) university-industry partnerships to advise the research strategy and facilitate implementation of the research findings.  Data from this project will be archived and shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org).     <br/><br/>The research outcomes will foster a paradigm shift for the design of EPNs, which are recognized as one of the most critical spatially distributed infrastructure systems.  With a multiple threat perspective (windstorm and aging effects), the project will contribute to enhancing the resiliency of EPNs at both component and system levels. This will be achieved by: (1) fundamental advances in high-fidelity computational models supported by large-scale experimental testing, (2) investigation of uncertainties associated with changes in loading demand (due to extreme weather events) and structural capacity (due to aging mechanisms), (3) characterization of cascading effects at multiple tiers from a component failure to a network outage, (4) development of metamodels for EPNs under regional natural hazards and environmental stressors, and (5) integration of a system reliability analysis into an optimization platform to capture the consequences of possible failures and adjust the design requirements accordingly.

The synthesis will examine how these factors have influenced the costs and benefits of social life within prairie dog colonies. Two products of the research will result: a book that will present the synthesis to a wide scientific audience and a website featuring decades of images, audio recordings, videos, and datasets directed at high school students, undergraduates, and other curious naturalists of all ages. Finally, the researcher will continue to collaborate with four television companies - including National Geographic Television - that have recently documented his research with prairie dogs. This research provides insights into the evolution of common, but poorly understood, social behaviors in mammals; the products will be of broad interest to behavioral ecologists, wildlife managers, and conservation biologists.<br/><br/>Social species exhibit several initially puzzling behaviors, and this project aims to pull together four decades of data on prairie dog species to understand three such behaviors: non-parental infanticide, alarm calling, and polyandry. Each of these behaviors seems detrimental to fitness on the surface and hence requires focused investigation to understand. This project will leverage long term data following the behavior of individuals over their lifetime and their reproductive success to understand these phenomena. In particular, the synthesis will include new analyses focused on the role of colony density on the frequency of infanticide, the costs and benefits to an individual that gives an alarm call, which may draw a predator's attention, and the costs and benefits of multiple matings by females. This will be the first study to elucidate the consistency and contingency of these behaviors over a life time and the consequences for fitness. The analyses will clarify the maintenance of coloniality despite these apparent costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While various solutions have been developed to tackle misconfiguration, they mainly focus on invalid configurations, which violate some correctness criteria. Unfortunately, many misconfigurations are technically valid, yet cause severe production problems such as poor performance. These are called specious configurations.

Informed by this study, this project will then design algorithms and techniques for modeling the risk of a configuration change by using static analysis and selective symbolic execution to construct parameterized impact tables and then enhance them with offline profiling data. Based on this model, this project will develop an online risk assessment tool which can alert expert operators about specious configuration before production.<br/><br/>Specious configuration is frequently cited for lost productivity.

This study will allow researchers to anticipate new associations between parasites and host species, which is important to conservation science, public health, and the food industry. This research program will train undergraduate and graduate students and school teachers in the use of existing databases and computational software for addressing pressing ecological questions.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to use the Global Mammal Parasite Database and other data sources to examine the association of mammals and their parasitic hosts following their introductions into novel geographic areas. Statistical and modeling approaches to disentangle the role of climatic similarity, phylogenetic compatibility, and parasite traits (transmission mode, level of specialization and prevalence) will be developed to explain the loss and gain of parasites by introduced mammals. This work addresses a fundamental question in community and disease ecology by exploring the factors that promote the intimate associations between species pairs. Given the geographic scope of this study and breadth of introductions examined, the results of this research will provide a global context for assessing the risk of emerging infectious diseases of animals and humans due to the redistribution of introduced hosts and their parasites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their dried, pressed specimens are of multidimensional importance: they are documentation of plant occurrence through space and time; markers of taxonomic and nomenclatural identity; evidence of plant-animal interactions; and sources of DNA for molecular studies. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the acknowledgement of the importance of natural history specimens to modern biological research. Despite this resurgence and broad application of specimens in research a number of herbaria in Louisiana have recently closed and the collections orphaned. The Shirley C. Tucker Herbarium at Louisiana State University (LSU) has been the recipient of a large portion of these orphaned collections.  This has resulted in a near doubling in the size of the collection, from 207,500 specimens in 2015 to an estimated 400,000.  This project will result in the integration and consolidation of these specimens into the Tucker Herbarium's infrastructure, as well as completion of prior digitization efforts. This project will not only ensure that Louisiana's botanical heritage is available to interested researchers, but also foster an understanding of the importance of plants and natural history collections via outreach projects aimed at the broader public, undergraduate students, and the academic community.<br/><br/>The incorporation of multiple orphaned herbaria at LSU presents an opportunity to restructure the Tucker Herbarium into a regional hub for Louisiana botany.  This project will integrate the recently acquired herbarium specimens into LSU's compacted herbarium infrastructure, as well as consolidate multiple digital data sources.  Both of these steps are crucial for the maintenance and maximum utility of the much larger collection that will be housed at the Tucker Herbarium by 2020.  Challenges related to the integration of different filing schemes and database structures will be addressed by project personnel and their solutions will be presented at national conferences.  Additionally, continued digitization efforts will result in a nearly complete online database with image records of the Louisiana flora.  All associated data will be publicly accessible and linked to multiple consortium and data aggregation efforts, including SERNEC, iDigBio, and GBIF.  Integration and digitization activities will be coupled with the development of a rotating public exhibit to feature Tucker Herbarium research and activities, the inauguration of an annual plant biology seminar at LSU, and the establishment of a stronger presence, both online via social media campaigns and on campus via participation in outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award establishes a new mode of manufacturing for low temperature fabrication of high quality two-dimensional nanomaterials, which allows early adoption of these new materials into the semiconductor industry and supports continued improvements in electronic device performance, including information storage capacity and computational power, all while lowering the energy demands of these devices. These materials are also promising components of quantum information processing devices, thus aligning well with NSF's Quantum Leap effort. The results of this research benefits society and the national economy through the advancement of innovative solutions to the nation's increasing energy and computational demands. Additionally, this research advances engineering knowledge and trains the next generation of scientists and engineers in advanced manufacturing and prepare them for careers in industry.

The key challenge to deploying these materials in memory and logic devices is the ability to synthesize them in their 2D form at device compatible temperatures with minimal substrate interaction, control over the number of layers, and control over the chemical composition for heterostructure formation and doping. Selective-area atomic layer deposition (ALD), in a unique van der Waals growth mode, can overcome the current limitations for synthesis of the 2D nanomaterials. Typically, 2D materials are grown by chemical vapor deposition at high temperatures, which is not suitable for high aspect-ratio structures. Low temperature ALD produces amorphous films, which requires high temperature annealing to generate the desired microstructure, which is not suitable for some semiconductor devices. This research is to provide the knowledge necessary to synthesize crystalline 2D atomic layer materials at backend-compatible low temperatures through selective-area or seeded ALD with van der Waals bonding to the underlying substrate. The research team employs in situ and ex situ experimentation combined with first-principles computation to understand the chemical reactions critical to both promoting and inhibiting the nucleation and growth of 2D materials on engineered surfaces for high volume semiconductor device manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, the geological, biological, and chemical processes taking place there remain poorly understood. Advances in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technology in the past decade mean that we can now send these vehicles to the seabed in water depths of several miles where they collect data from just above the seafloor. AUVs are often equipped with a high-resolution compressed-high intensity pulse (CHIRP) sonar, which can capture centimeter-scale-resolution, cross-section images of the sediment that blankets the seafloor. These thicknesses can then be used as proxies for the length of time a feature has been exposed on the seafloor. Despite this potential, time constraints and a lack of an easily available sonar data processing scheme means that these CHIRP data are often under-utilized.  This research develops a standard workflow and software for processing EdgeTech CHIRP sonar data, for use both at sea and on shore, using already existing AUV-acquired CHIRP surveys of sediment from a specific location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and other associated imaging data. Application of the processed data will be used to measure sediment thickness in an area where knowledge of this parameter advances our understanding of the interplay between the faulting and volcanism at mid-ocean ridge axes.  Broader impacts of the research add value and capability to the existing US AUV fleet and advance our understanding of crustal formation at mid-ocean ridges.  The methods and outcomes of the work will be incorporated into professional development workshops for in-service teachers in the highly diverse San Diego Unified School District, providing resources for lessons that can be widely used throughout the school system and support an early career investigator.<br/><br/>In areas far from terrestrial sources, sediment thickness in deep sea marine environments is a rough proxy for the amount of time a feature has been exposed on the seabed. Thus, this provides a way to constrain the timing of geological events, such as volcanic eruptions and/or slip on faults.  At young features, such as mid-ocean ridges axial valleys, sediment is typically only a few meters thick and so cannot be picked up by other shipboard geophysical/seismic imaging tools. These sediment thicknesses, at present, can only be imaged using near-bottom sonars such as those carried by AUVs. Use of these tools is particularly useful at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges where the interplay between low-angle faults, know as detachments, and volcanism remains poorly understood.  Although it is now clear that vast areas of seafloor are created under the influence of detachment faults, the relationships between detachments and magmatism and melt supply remain uncertain.  This project uses already existing CHIRP data, acquired during fourteen dives of AUV Sentry at latitude 16.5N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in 2013. Research goals are to provide new CHIRP processing protocols that can be used to more quickly process CHIRP sonar data and to use the existing data to quantitatively determine variations in sediment thickness and, thus, establish the relative timing of detachment fault slip and volcanism in the study area.  The research adds significant value to an existing dataset that was acquired in an inaccessible part of the deep ocean and will deliver an open-source software tool to the scientific community and the public in a cost-effective way.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because an offline attacker can validate each password guess by itself using stolen password hashes from a data breach it is not possible to ""lock out"" an offline attacker after several incorrect guesses. The attacker is limited only by the computational resources necessary to mount a brute-force attack. To mitigate the risk of an offline attack the goal of a secure password hashing algorithm is to ensure that a brute force attack is prohibitively expensive even if the attacker has access to customized hardware such as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) that is optimized for password cracking. Memory hard functions (MHFs), functions whose computation require a large amount of memory, are a crucial cryptographic tool to achieve this goal since memory is expensive even on an ASIC. This project advances scientific understanding of memory hard functions and will directly impact future cryptographic standards for password hashing.<br/><br/>The project is developing improved cryptanalysis techniques to evaluate the security of an MHF resulting in a deeper understanding of currently deployed MHFs. A main goal of this work is to design practical constructions of MHFs with provably optimal memory hardness in terms of bandwidth hardness, sustained space complexity, and amortized area-time complexity.

These larvae spend days or weeks feeding on tiny algal particles to fuel their development until they can metamorphose into juveniles. In nature, however, the plankton includes not only edible particles, but also many particles that are too large to be eaten but which may interfere with feeding on edible particles. These include, for example, large algal particles, eggs and embryos of other invertebrates, re-suspended sediment, and anthropogenic nano- and micro-plastics. When larvae encounter large inedible particles, they may respond by altering their swimming behavior to avoid them, or by capturing and then rejecting them. Such interactions reduce the rate at which larvae can capture edible particles, which forces them to either spend more time feeding before metamorphosis (increasing their overall risk of dying due to planktonic predators), or to metamorphose with less energy, producing juveniles in relatively poor condition. This project examines how large inedible particles affect feeding, time to metamorphosis, and juvenile condition in the larvae of diverse marine invertebrates. The project has the potential to dramatically change our understanding of how larvae feed and survive in natural communities, and thus our understanding of the population dynamics of these important organisms. The project will support research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at California State University Long Beach, a primarily undergraduate institution, as well as summer research internships for students at two local community colleges. Project data will be integrated into laboratory modules in undergraduate courses. Finally, data on the reproductive biology of diverse California marine invertebrates will be added to a public website that is widely used by members of the public, students, and biologists interested in the development, life histories, ecology, and evolution of these common animals.  <br/><br/>The factors that control planktonic duration and juvenile condition in marine invertebrates with feeding larvae have long been recognized as critical to understanding their ecology and evolution. Larval feeding environment is clearly one of those factors, but previous work has focused almost exclusively on one feature of that environment, the abundance of food. This project will evaluate the importance of another potentially critical dimension of the larval feeding environment ? the presence of large inedible particles, which are frequently abundant in natural plankonic communities. It takes a comparative approach to address two key questions about the effects of large inedible particles on larvae (including those of echinoderms, annelids, and molluscs) that feed using several different particle capture mechanisms. First, do large inedible particles present in natural plankton reduce larval feeding rates? And second, does the presence of large inedible particles extend larval planktonic duration or result in the production of lower quality juveniles? Feeding rates of larvae will be measured in short-term experiments in which larvae are exposed to both food and to natural or artificial large inedible particles over a range of concentrations. Effects of large inedible particles on planktonic duration and juvenile quality will be measured by culturing larvae through their entire life cycles in the presence of large inedible particles at various concentrations. Because feeding performance is an important determinant of planktonic duration, larval survival, and juvenile condition, the project will add greatly to our understanding of how conditions in the plankton affect the population dynamics of the many marine invertebrates with feeding larvae.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these apps provide better customized services using users' personal data, certain behavior of the apps is less than desirable or harmful. For example, if an app's user interface (UI) has no texts or images to indicate that it will access users' personal data (e.g., GPS data), but the app discloses users' personal data when an action is performed (e.g., pressing a button), then red flags should be raised. Thus, it is crucial to understand the intents of the app to determine whether the app will perform within the user's expectation. Various research efforts have been dedicated to understand apps' intents via analyzing the semantics of texts in UI. However, images, especially icons, remain unexplored. In apps' UIs, icons are often used in interactive widgets (e.g., buttons) to express the intents to use sensitive data. It is often difficult to analyze the semantics of icons due to the varieties in image styles and the lack of descriptive texts.<br/><br/>The proposed research will build a knowledge base of icons' semantics via collecting icons from apps in major smartphone markets, and develop a framework to infer the semantics of icons based on the collected icons. More specifically, the PI proposes to adapt computer vision techniques to develop icon recognition techniques that identify similar icons based on the collected icons, and leverage program analysis techniques to check the compatibility between the icons and the program behaviors. Furthermore, this research will combine the semantics of both texts and icons to better detect undesired behavior in apps. The proposed research in understanding apps' intents improves mobile app security, which will have tremendous economical impact on society due to our increasing reliance on mobile apps.

Natural gas hydrates form on the seafloor and in marine sediments beneath the seafloor when water depths exceed ~500 m. Worldwide, marine methane gas hydrates are estimated to store 20% to 50% of Earth?s mobile carbon. Perturbations to temperature and pressure cause gas hydrates to dissociate into methane gas and water. Due to the large reservoir of carbon in methane gas hydrates, the metastability of these minerals, and the fact that methane is a strong greenhouse gas, many scientists have theorized that methane liberated from natural gas hydrates may be a key player in many of Earth?s large global warming events.   However, the amount of gas hydrate locked in marine sediments is not well known, with present estimates varying by four orders of magnitude. This research uses well logs from publicly accessible academic and industry geophysical information and well logs from cores drilled into marine sediments in conjunction with new mathematical approaches to evaluate, model, and estimate the amount of methane gas hydrates in a broad spectrum of different marine settings.  This information is then used to provide crucial, first-time information on the occurrence, distribution, amount of naturally occurring methane gas hydrates in the seafloor, worldwide.  Broader impacts of the work include information that can be used by the petroleum and natural gas industry in discovering and assessing economically feasible natural gas occurrences; the integration of research and education involving large numbers of students who will be involved in the data analysis and interpretation parts of the project; will complement previous gas hydrate assessments in the Gulf of Mexico; and complements a pending research cruise funded by the National Science Foundation- supported International Ocean Discovery Program.

Recent advances in understanding the molecular-scale structure associated with block polymers has led to innovative new applications in numerous areas of technology including batteries, cardiovascular stents, tough versatile plastics for use in packaging and health care products, and manufacturing of computer chips. Surprising new states of nanoscale molecular organization have recently been discovered in the simplest type of such compounds known as ""diblock copolymers"", which contain just two polymer molecules linked end-to-end. When designed with an asymmetric composition these diblock copolymers form a variety of ordered structures that mimic the behavior of metals and alloys. This research program aims to uncover the fundamental molecular phenomena associated with this remarkable phase behavior, with the goal of establishing the basic principles responsible for the development of low-symmetry phases including quasicrystals in self-assembled soft materials. Students and post docs will synthesize useful quantities of model diblock copolymers and investigate the structure and dynamics of these materials using a host of experimental tools including X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, mechanical spectroscopy, and optical methods. This research will simultaneously train future leaders in the field of polymers while advancing the fundamental base of knowledge enabling expanded application of block polymers to myriad technologically advanced products that serve society.

Recent advances with diblock copolymers, the simplest molecular architecture in this category of self-assembling materials, have exposed extraordinary new concepts regarding order and disorder in the limit of asymmetric molecular architectures leading to the formation of discrete, nominally spherical particles. This project outlines an ambitious experimental program designed to uncover the basic principles responsible for the formation of tetrahedrally close-packed Frank-Kasper phases and quasicrystals in diblock copolymer melts. Model materials will be synthesized in nearly monodisperse form and characterized structurally using small-angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy. The molecular transport phenomena that govern phase transition dynamics will be assessed using time-resolved techniques including small-angle neutron scattering, optical methods and dynamic mechanical spectroscopy. This program will establish the principles that govern the formation of low symmetry phases as a function of molecular architecture, dispersity, compositional and conformational asymmetry, and molecular weight in pure block copolymers and blends.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the significant growth in the wireless data traffic has initiated the need for expanding the range of frequencies used for wireless communication. Visible Light Communication (VLC), where light is used as a medium for communication, has garnered significant attention over recent years due to its potential for ultra-high speeds. However, with rapid advancements in VLC, the communication speeds achieved so far are orders of magnitude less than its potential Terabits-per-second (Tbps) capacity. There is an urgent need for a breakthrough in VLC data speeds, and this project attempts to move toward it through a novel system architecture to support ultra-high data rates. The project will take advantage of industry meetings to disseminate outcomes and provides a variety of appealing educational activities involving high school and undergraduate students. This project makes an experimental VLC kit available to the community and makes the hardware, software implementation and data generated available to the public.<br/><br/>Theoretical models estimate VLC information capacity to be of the order of Tbps, however, practical limitations in receiver designs have limited state-of-the-art VLC prototypes to data rates that are lower by orders of magnitude. To achieve high-speed reception, this project combines the fast sampling nature of photodiodes and the noise isolation property of imaging array structures into a unified structure that emulates a high-speed image sensing receiver. This project designs a novel VLC receiver architecture integrating a photodiode and an LCD array that acts as a pixelated shutter. Through this unified design, the receiver selects the exact area over which the transmitted signal is detected on the array, thus isolating actual light signal from ambient noise reaching the photodiode, resulting in a dramatic increase in the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).  The signal isolation and SNR enhancement is enabled by the spatio-temporal mechanisms for selective signal reception and tracking on the LCD array. To achieve a larger field-of-view for reception, the receiver is fit with an 180-degree panoramic lens. This project develops a model to understand the relationship between spatial mobility and the light signal's location on the array and its strength and sets a baseline for designing signal tracking mechanisms to address mobility in high-speed VLC systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Continued performance of civil structures in daily use and after a natural hazard event is critical to the resilience of our communities and the US economy. The integration of sensor networks and physical systems is essential for maintaining this continued performance of civil structures while facing challenges in aging, energy, and the environment. The interaction of these cyber-physical components impacts almost every endeavor today and is indispensable in tackling today's broader challenges and continued US economic growth. This research project will identify optimal network systems for infrastructure applications through the integration of virtual and physical sensors and actuators. Unlike current approaches that are limited to specific measurement technology, function, and/or application, the new network approach is scalable to monitor large structures, as well as to provide insight on performance limits and maximize the reliability of the selected network configuration. Experimental modules will be developed based on the framework of this research through student's design projects and will be used to create an interactive outreach platform for students in secondary school.<br/><br/>Effective implementation of sensor and actuator networks necessitates that limited sensor resources provide the most informative measured data and are reliable in the face of uncertainties. The objective of this research is a framework to identify the bounds of algorithm performance for structural health monitoring and control applications through optimization of sensor placement, type, and configuration in the presence of uncertainties. The multi-objective optimization sensor approach will be validated with results from physical tests ranging from laboratory-scale monitoring and control experiments through in-situ deployments. Key results include: (i) a sparsity-promoting algorithm to determine near-optimal sensor requirements for effective response and parameter estimation, (ii) insight into the performance bounds for estimation-based algorithms, and (iii) a novel experimental approach for validation of the technique under repeated, non-idealized conditions to establish the reliability of estimation-based approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Educational aspects of this project are designed with formal learning activities (field work at the Congaree National Park, design and construction of experimental installations for education, and the introduction of a new undergraduate level course on sustainable river engineering practices into the curriculum) to build an educational environment using collaborative learning pedagogy in which students learn how to work in a diverse, interdisciplinary, and international group.

Recent evidence shows that learning math language (e.g., concepts such as more, few, less, near, before) during preschool supports this development. The purpose of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to examine the process by which math language instruction improves learning of mathematics skills in order to design and translate the most effective interventions into practical classroom instruction. The first objective of this project is to examine if quantitative and spatial math language effect the development of different aspects of mathematics performance (e.g., numeracy, geometry). The second objective is to examine how quantitative math language versus numeracy instruction, either alone or in combination, effect numeracy development. The findings from this study will not only be used to improve theoretical understanding of how math language and mathematics skills develop, but the instructional materials developed for this study will also result in practical tools for enhancing young children's math language and mathematics skills.  <br/><br/>This project is focused on evaluating the role of early math language skills in the acquisition of early mathematics skills. Two randomized control trials (RCTs) will be conducted. The first RCT will be used to evaluate the effects of different types of math language instruction (quantitative, spatial) on distinct aspects of mathematics (numeracy, geometry). It is expected that quantitative language instruction will improve numeracy skills and spatial language instruction will improve geometry skills. The second RCT will be used to examine the unique and joint effects of quantitative language instruction and numeracy instruction on children's numeracy skills. It is expected that both types of instruction alone will be sufficient to generate improvement on numeracy outcomes compared to an active control group, but that the combination of the two will result in enhanced numeracy performance compared to either alone. Educational goals will be integrated with and supported through engaging diverse groups of undergraduate and graduate students in hands-on research experiences, training pre- and in-service teachers on mathematical language instruction, and building collaborative relationships with early career researchers. Intervention materials including storybooks developed for the project and pre- and in-service teacher training/lesson plan materials will be made available at the completion of the project.<br/><br/>The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.

This research on ion conduction and dielectric constant of polymeric energy materials aims to understand the structure-property relations in polymers that conduct only one type of ion, such as lithium for advanced batteries and perhaps larger mobile ions for supercapacitors, sensors, and mechanical actuators.  A way to increase the mobility of the conducting ions is to add ""zwitterions"", which are small molecules containing both positive and negative charges, to single-ion conducting polymers. Although the method of adding zwitterions to polymeric materials has shown promise, fundamental insight is needed to design materials for specific functions for future applications.  If successful, the fundamental knowledge generated from this research will result in the understanding needed to design polymeric materials for a variety of specific energy applications, including advanced batteries, fuel cells, solar cells, ionic actuators, supercapacitors, and energy harvesting devices (each of which require maximizing ion transport).  Each of those applications has the potential to change current technologies and improve the lives of humans across the globe.  This project will also provide advanced scientific training and exposure to interdisciplinary research to graduate and undergraduate students, as well as opportunities for outreach.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/> <br/>Ionomers are an important class of energy materials for applications that require single-ion conduction, yet their structure-property relations are only beginning to be explored.  In this research, three novel types of materials are being made: (1) High molecular weight polycations with conducting counter-anions that are homopolymers, random copolymers and diblock copolymers, (2) high molecular weight polyanions with conducting counter-cations that are homopolymers, random copolymers and diblock copolymers, and (3) polar small molecule zwitterions that are non-volatile plasticizers for both types of ionomers to boost ionic conductivity.  A key fundamental question is how mixtures of ionomers and zwitterions can be optimized by careful molecular design of the two.  If successful, this research will reveal the design rules for the codesign of ionomer and zwitterion. By fully understanding the dielectric response of these materials (including the temperature dependence of dielectric constant and ionic conductivity) and using X-ray scattering to detail their morphology, the effects of systematic variations in zwitterion structure in such mixtures will be understood in detail.  By exploring the parameter space of ion content, counterion type and polarity (dielectric constant) of the zwitterion, the potential of this class of energy materials, in terms of highest possible dielectric constant and ionic conductivity, will be determined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ultimate goal of this work is to improve fundamental understanding, and eventually enable better prediction, of the material properties that ultimately control complex processes in nature, many of which have enormous impacts on people and on society. For the three-year grant period, one emphasis will be on the effects of high pressure on the structure and properties of silicate melts that represent magmas in the Earth, and hence are tied to many geological processes including the formation and eruption of volcanoes. A second major activity will be further development and application of methods to measure the distribution of minor and major elements in some of the most important silicate minerals in the Earth's crust and mantle, in order to improve models that describe their chemical behavior in nature, and thus better our ability to glean clues about geological evolution from natural samples. Results and methods developed in this project should continue to be of major interest outside of the Earth sciences, particularly for researchers working to develop and optimize silicate glasses and ceramics for advanced technologies, such as materials for data processing and transmission, computer displays, substrates for photovoltaics, fuel cells, and many other applications. Education is central to this project, since most of the research will be part of the training of Ph.D. and postdoctoral students on their ways to careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The approach taken in this research is to identify important problems where critical details of short- to intermediate-range structure are needed and can be elucidated by laboratory measurements, collect accurate data on synthetic or natural materials, and determine the consequences of the results for key chemical and physical parameters. The most important experimental approach that will be used is solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which can reveal quantitative details about the structure around many of the components common in minerals and magmas, such as silicon, aluminum, oxygen, phosphorus, and sodium. A variety of compositions of glasses (representing the high temperature molten materials in natural magma systems) and crystalline materials will be synthesized, and measurements made of how their structures change with composition, temperature and pressure. One particular emphasis will be to continue to extend the applicability of NMR, traditionally used to look at abundant constituents of non-magnetic materials, to minor and even trace components and to materials containing substantial amounts of magnetic components. These data should be particularly important in helping to develop more accurate, physically-based models of mineral and magma properties and behavior, which are especially important in the Earth sciences, as many processes take place in regimes of temperature, pressure, and time that are inaccessible to direct observation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wind-resistant design of buildings plays an important role in securing the nation's welfare and prosperity through reduced building damage, fatalities, societal disruptions, and business discontinuities during these extreme events. Considerable challenges arise as an increasingly large portion of the nation's building inventory is located in urban environments with exposure to extreme wind events. Interference effects, caused by interactions between different building geometries, can increase the local wind speed on buildings by 50% or more compared to the undisturbed atmospheric boundary layer wind speed. Routine calculations for design wind loads do not account for these interference effects and, therefore, significantly can underestimate the wind loading on buildings and result in inadequate building design. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award is to advance fundamental understanding of wind flow phenomena for the design of resilient and sustainable buildings and urban environments through establishment of computational frameworks that can quantify and, where possible, reduce the uncertainty in computational predictions of these phenomena. The capability to make well-informed decisions based on computational predictions and uncertainty quantification will lead to optimized designs for more wind-resilient and, thus, safer buildings and cities. High school, undergraduate, and graduate students and high school teachers will participate in the research program.  The experimental and numerical data sets resulting from this research will be leveraged to establish active learning modules for wind engineering for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Workshops held during years two and five of the award will support the education of a diverse community of engineers to understand the complexity of urban flow and wind loading phenomena and the strengths and weaknesses of computational models, wind tunnel tests, and field experiments. The research will use the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Wall of Wind facility at Florida International University and archive project data in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>This research will establish computational models to quantify the influence of the surrounding built environment on the local wind speed and turbulence and the resulting interference effects on the wind loads on buildings in urban environments.  The research plan will involve a comprehensive program of field measurements, wind tunnel tests, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with uncertainty quantification and data assimilation. The Engineering Quad on Stanford's campus, which is representative of an urban environment, will serve as a test bed for implementing the research plan. Rather than pursuing a traditional deterministic investigation, novel stochastic methods will be explored to enable comparison of experimental and numerical results with confidence intervals.  Specific focus of the research will be on: (1) using data assimilation algorithms to reduce uncertainty related to the inflow boundary conditions, (2) systematic quantification of the effect of geometrical simplifications, and (3) using multi-fidelity algorithms to reduce turbulence model form uncertainties. The research results will provide essential new information on the fitness-for-purpose and integration of models with different levels of fidelity and will indicate the potential of leveraging urban sensor networks to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The research program will result in a fundamentally improved understanding of interference effects and enable considerable advances in CFD modeling for urban flow and wind loading. More broadly, the novel computational strategies resulting from this research will benefit other sustainable urban design problems influenced by wind, such as street canyon and building ventilation, outdoor and indoor air quality, harvesting renewable energy resources, and urban planning for heat island mitigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, attentional demands are high on such teams, raising questions of how to both monitor those attentional demands and develop systems that adaptively provide needed information not just through visual displays that are often overloaded, but through other senses including touch and sound.  Most existing work on adaptive multimodal interfaces for situational awareness focuses on individuals; this project will address how to do this work for teams, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) search and rescue as its primary domain.  This includes developing conceptual models that connect individual and team-level situational awareness, algorithms that use eye gaze data to assess both situational awareness and workload in real-time, and multimodal display guidelines that adaptively present information to the most appropriate team members through the most effective modes.  This work will fundamentally advance research on understanding and designing to support team interaction, leading to practical improvements in a variety of safety-critical domains.

The first involves collecting baseline data through a study where pairs of novices are trained to carry out simulated UAV search and rescue tasks using a standard visually-focused interface; the team will collect situational awareness (SA) assessments using existing validated surveys, eye gaze data, and team interaction data and member characteristics.  This data will be used to build two main models.  The first is a model that relates team dynamics and individual member characteristics with levels of SA and performance, using qualitative analysis of recorded observational and audio data, along with focus group interviews with participants.  The second is a quantitative model that attempts to predict SA using eye gaze data, using both a factor analysis of eye gaze data and Markovian models of how teams and their members transition their visual attention between interface elements and tasks to predict levels of SA.  These models will support unobtrusive assessments of SA that avoid the interruptions imposed by existing surveys and are necessary for developing the adaptive multimodal interfaces that are the other main thrust of the project.  This second thrust will use the models of attention and problematic tasks and contexts identified in the first study to iteratively develop a pilot suite of multimodal interfaces that combine visual, audio, and tactile information channels.  These multimodal interfaces will be evaluated using a series of studies similar to the first set, with the goal of developing cost-benefit models for presentation modes and types of information that minimally interfere with teams' existing visual workload while still providing information that raises individual and team SA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How fibrous composites fail is not understood either for engineering materials of this type or, of course, for the more complex material in the human spine.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will contribute to our understanding of the mechanical behavior of these complex material composites.  Fiber-reinforced composites provide materials with greater stiffness due to the fibers and large deformations from the softer extrafibrillar matrix. Fiber composites are important in commercial and military applications, but also to understanding the mechanical properties of human bodies. Many body tissues are fibrillar composites. Understanding the mechanical behavior of the material under its working environment and how load is transferred between neighboring tissues is a significant challenge to understanding multiple diseases.  In particular, ""slipped disc"" of the human spine is a failure of the fibrillar composite structure that we don't understand. Traditional material testing techniques require specimens to be removed from their working position, significantly altering the loading environment and boundary conditions. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging provides a noninvasive approach for determining the composition of a spinal disc in a live person without injury.  This project will support fundamental research on how biological tissues change their mechanical properties as a result of changes in composition. The work will be based on magnetic resonance imaging methods because, later, the results of the project can be used in living people as a noninvasive, safe way to assess changes in mechanical behavior of body tissues. The project will help to advance the field of disc mechanics, and the research results should apply to other soft tissues of the body. Outreach to the community includes a plan to enhance STEM engagement for girls based on the Principal Investigator's ongoing efforts in local Oakland, CA and Berkeley, CA K-12 schools. Involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the outreach activities substantially amplifies the impact.<br/><br/>Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging in combination with finite element modeling addresses many limitations with current approaches for understanding the mechanical behavior of composite structures, such as the intervertebral disc. The disc includes a soft gel-like material surrounded by a fiber-reinforced material. Hydration and swelling are important for the mechanical function of the disc and changes with degeneration are known to alter disc composition and mechanics. Changes in tissue composition result in altered residual stresses, tissue anisotropy, and failure mechanics. The disc provides an excellent model for understanding changes in stress distribution between two distinct materials. The research team will use quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to directly measure special changes in water and proteoglycan composition, which will be used to develop a subject-specific computational model that will be validated through joint- and tissue-level experiments. The knowledge gained will be important for 1) understanding changes in soft tissue mechanics with injury and degeneration, 2) developing innovative tools for studying soft material mechanics, and 3) understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern load distributions in complex soft materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computational modeling of DTES can reveal the hidden event evolving mechanisms and improve the performance of endpoint analytical tasks such as sequence forecasting and grouping. Conventional approaches for analyzing DTES are typically based on strong statistical assumptions and may not work well in practice. Motivated by the recent empirical success of deep learning methods in various application domains, the objective of this project is to develop interpretable deep learning approaches for modeling DTES. This project validates the utility of the developed algorithms in various medical applications. It incorporates the resulting research outcomes into curriculum development and courses, to train a new generation of machine learning and data mining practitioners. In addition, special training opportunities are provided to high school students and community college students for a broader education of modern data analysis techniques.<br/><br/>This project consists of three synergistic research thrusts. First, it develops a series of approaches for integrating external domain knowledge into the modeling process. This guarantees the learned models align well with the domain knowledge and at the same time provides effective regularizations to avoid overfitting. Second, it devises approaches based on mimic learning and pattern dissection to interpret the knowledge hidden in the learned models. This makes the learned models much more practical and reusable. Third, effective model and data sharing mechanisms are developed to transfer the knowledge across similar learning tasks.

Adjacent binding sites in the DNA interact with the multiprotein complex for efficient binding. Yet, both protein domains and clusters of binding sites are encoded as one-dimensional arrays in the genome. This project tests the hypothesis that, in order for specific and correct interactions to occur, there are optimal distances between these functional units and that they are maintained across evolutionary time. Since insertions and deletions of DNA (indels) change the distance between these functional units, the genome will be under evolutionary constraint against indel mutations that affect the distance. To test this hypothesis, the investigator will develop software to systematically estimate and compare the changes in distance between functional elements and statistical models to test the likelihood of the events observed. Upon project completion, the scientific community will have tools that identify distances that are conserved, and will be able to predict the effect and importance of indel mutations occurring in these genomic regions. The investigator will hold workshops for girls in grades 6-12 to develop software games that model the concept of evolutionary constraint. She will also develop undergraduate and graduate classes with hands-on activities on molecular evolution and computational sequence analysis.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to utilize the variation in rates of indels to infer the evolutionary constraint on the distance between functional elements in the genome. Experimental evidence has been accumulating on selection against indels in the loops and linkers within proteins, or in the space between binding sites of regulatory elements. But, studies on the evolution of these sequences are almost nonexistent, due to the difficulty in aligning these sequences. This project addresses these challenges by applying methods that can model variable indel rates across sites or methods that model length instead of relying on alignments. Using these methods, the investigator will produce phylogenetic, and quantitative estimates of indel rates on a significant proportion of the genome that has been neglected so far. In Objective 1, using a new software the investigator has developed, variable site-specific indel rates will be estimated across loops between protein motifs to identify structural motifs with strong constraints on their distance. In Objective 2, the investigator will develop a new software based on birth-death processes to estimate indel rates without relying on alignments. Using this software, she will test the hypothesis that there is stronger constraint on the distance between tandem homologous domains, compared to non-homologous domains. In Objective 3, the investigator will use the software described above to test the hypothesis that there is stronger constraint on the distance between binding sites of homodimers, compared to the distance between binding sites of heterodimers. This study will integrate the knowledge gained in the fields of structural biology and developmental biology into a phylogenomic context, and provide tools for the community to test specific evolutionary hypotheses on distance between functional elements of interest.

With Uri Andrews, Knight is interested in the problem of when an elementary first order theory that is well-behaved from the point of view of model theory has a computable model.  Andrews and Knight have a result for ""strongly minimal"" theories, with conditions on the complexity of fragments of the theory guaranteeing that the countable models all have computable copies.  For some cases, the models are produced by ""workers"" constructions, involving nested approximations.  Knight is interested in applying the techniques of computability to uncountable structures.  There are different approaches.  Some involve changing the definition of what is computable.

Both initiatives are investing heavily in generating high-resolution data, which once analyzed properly, can yield insights that will pave the foundations of advanced treatments for genetic and nervous system disorders. To fully maximize the potential impact of collecting such data, this proposal develops a new framework for identifying complicated underlying patterns in multiway arrays. Specifically, the project fills a gap in nonparametric estimation of low-dimensional structure and geometry in big and noisy data arrays. The PI plans to develop a training program based on applications of the proposed research to recruit and retain talented high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups for potential careers as innovative data scientists. <br/><br/>Modern data matrices present two challenges to their analyses: (1) they are transposable in the sense that both their rows and columns are often of interest and may contain non-trivial dependencies among them, and (2) they may be very large. The first challenge has only partially been addressed by existing biclustering or co-clustering methods. These methods can identify only very simple coupled structures that organize the rows and columns. In order to flexibly model and extract more complicated patterns in large data matrices, in which both rows and columns are high-dimensional, one requires a new co-manifold learning framework that can discover a wider range of intrinsic geometries of the rows and columns. To meet the first challenge, this project develops a framework for performing joint nonlinear dimension reduction on the rows and columns.  The proposed methods construct multiscale distances that are invariant to row and column permutations, equipping practitioners with a means to estimate the intrinsic organization of the rows and columns of a data matrix without prior information on any row or column orderings. To meet the second challenge, this project formulates the key computations as optimization problems that admit distributed parallel algorithms with nearly linear speed-up. The framework also generalizes naturally to the higher-order generalization of matrices, multiway arrays or tensors. Finally, the estimated intrinsic geometries possess stability guarantees, namely small perturbations in the data due to noise or adjustments to input parameters cannot lead to disproportionately large variations in the estimated intrinsic geometry. The proposed procedures have the potential to enable practitioners to extract complicated patterns stably from massive data tensors with non-trivial dependencies along their modes or axes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Valencia College Engineering Technology Supply Chain Automation ATE project located in Central Florida aims to advance research on effective practices in engineering technology (ET) workforce education through a new curriculum framework and innovative approaches to teaching supply chain automation (SCA). The need for the project was driven in consultation with the National Center of Supply Chain Automation and with input from nationally recognized regional employers who reinforced the national and regional labor shortage. The new SCA-specialization will seek to provide a model for community colleges across the country, contributing to a growing movement for businesses and industries to become more efficient in distribution and supply chain automation practices. As the first program offered in the state of Florida, working closely with local business, industry, civic, and government partners, the program plans to attract and graduate a diversity of students, including underrepresented minorities (URMs) and women, to the growing field of supply chain technician jobs. The project is designed to demonstrate that the SCA-specialization within the ET associate degree (A.S.) program is a viable two-year degree option that will serve the community through partnerships with industry, leading to high wage employment opportunities in high-demand occupations, and generating new knowledge on the skills and competencies identified by industry to meet the workforce needs in SCA. Following a rigorous evaluation, Valencia will share best practices, curriculum and insight with other ATE centers and projects and collaborators to add knowledge to benefit the whole. <br/><br/>The project will support building a robust workforce within demographics that will impact the future vitality of the technically-trained workforce. Through a replicable model, the project aims to develop this new SCA-specialization and college certificate and offer rigorous technical courses that will be taught in creative ways, using approaches proven to engage all students. Project objectives are to (1) develop and implement the new specialization within the state ET associate degree curriculum framework; (2) provide professional development for faculty and secondary education teachers aimed at improving instructional practices and learning outcomes, and having faculty obtain industry-recognized credentials; and (3) collaborate with high schools to develop a pathway to the SCA specialization with evidenced-based teaching and learning practices that increase early awareness and exposure to ET pathways for a wide diversity of students. Project deliverables will target (a) increased industry connections, (b) the development of a new SCA-specialization and college certificate, (c) increased secondary education partnerships, (d)  professional development for a minimum of eight high school teachers a year who participate in the SCA trainings to learn best-practices on the engagement of URM and female students in ET pathways, and (e) faculty preparation for a minimum of four faculty who will complete the trainings to be prepared with the necessary skills and credentials to teach the SCA curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mangroves are a predominant vegetation type of tropical and subtropical coasts around the world. They support diverse, highly productive food webs, and provide valuable ecosystem services such as nursery habitat for fishery species, wintering habitat for migratory birds, protection of coastlines from storm surge, and below-ground storage of large stocks of carbon. Despite the considerable value of these ecosystems, mangrove habitats are severely threatened by coastal development, pollution, and conversion to aquaculture. A central goal of this research project is to enhance our ability to predict the responses of mangrove ecosystems to both natural and human-caused disturbances; this knowledge will help guide efforts to restore these highly valuable ecosystems. This goal will be achieved by identifying general mechanisms underlying these ecosystem responses through analyses of data from long-term experimental and observational studies, and from the predictions of a mathematical model of forest dynamics. Information about the rich biology of these systems, and the findings of this and similar studies in the region will be shared with other ecologists, their students, and amateur naturalists in a PI-authored book on the ecology of neotropical mangrove forest communities. This project will also involve undergraduate student assistants, maintaining the investigator's long commitment to training young scientists and guiding them to careers in science.<br/><br/>The first phase of this research will complete comprehensive analyses of data from long-term observational and experimental field investigations of the factors that control the structure and dynamics of the study forests. Forest demography and composition have been documented by monitoring the fates of individually marked trees in six forests plots that were established in 1993. These observational data are complemented by two long-term field experiments, initiated in 1995 and 1999, that test the independent and interactive effects of competition and herbivory on light gap regeneration and the spatial distributions of species along the tidal gradient. The results of these analyses will be synthesized with a spatially-explicit model of mangrove forest dynamics, parameterized with tree demographic data collected from the forest plots and field experiments. Model simulations will predict changes in forest composition and age/spatial structure under a range of environmental scenarios. The final phase of the project will be devoted to designing and writing a photo-illustrated book on the ecology of neotropical mangrove forest communities. It will be the first of its kind for the region. While focusing on the rich biology of these systems and key ecological processes that shape their structure and dynamics, the book will highlight the dire circumstances faced by mangrove ecosystems and discuss approaches to their protection and sustainable management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It builds upon previous work at the University of Rochester to develop teacher leaders.  It also takes advantage of a newly formed Consortium of the University of Rochester and several school districts in upstate New York, that are working together toward district-wide digital conversion.  The project will develop a group of teacher leaders, known as Master Teaching Fellows, to guide district-wide digital conversion efforts in high-need school districts.  Digital conversion is a comprehensive process that that provides each student with a tablet or laptop computer and uses these computers to enhance student learning.  Each Fellow will engage in a five-year program involving 41 credit hours of graduate coursework accompanied by related mentored experiences.  Completion of this program will lead to an Advanced Certificate in Digitally-Rich Teaching in K-12 Schools, which is approved by the New York State Education Department.  In addition, the Master Teaching Fellows will receive annual salary supplements, as they persist as classroom teachers who demonstrate effective use of digital resources.  Through its project evaluation, the project will generate knowledge about how to prepare teacher leaders who can support implementation of high-quality, technology-enriched STEM instruction by others.<br/><br/>Twenty experienced and exemplary mathematics and science teachers with master's degrees will be recruited from six high-need, small school districts (including three primarily rural districts) that are members of the Western New York Digital Conversion Consortium.  This project will capitalize on the long-standing partnership established in previous Master Teaching Fellow projects between the University of Rochester (through its Warner School of Education and STEM departments), the Geneva City School District, the Newark Central School District, and the non-profit Rochester Museum & Science Center.  It will also add new partners: East Irondequoit Central School District, a local pioneer in digital conversion, and three additional high-need rural districts from the Consortium (Dansville, Penn Yan, and Auburn).  With more rigorous learning standards and the challenge of integrating new technology with instruction, it is imperative that researchers and practitioners collaborate to develop deep understanding of what is needed to achieve the full potential of digitally-rich teaching to improve student achievement, especially in STEM.  This project will contribute evidence to the STEM education community about preparation of STEM teacher leaders to integrate digital resources into instruction, to lead their districts in digital conversion efforts, and to use technology to improve STEM instruction and increase student engagement.  This program for the preparation of ""digitally-rich STEM master teachers"" has the potential to serve as a replicable model by other universities in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The deformation can be elastic, so that when the force is removed the material recovers its original shape. Alternatively, the deformation can be plastic, whereby the material undergoes irreversible changes that may subsequently lead to breakage. Many materials of technological importance exhibit a combination of these two types of deformation depending on the applied force, and are called elasto-plastic. One example are bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys that have an amorphous atomic arrangement in contrast to most metals. BMGs have desirable properties, such as the ability to be processed like plastics, making them attractive candidates for many applications (e.g. next-generation smartphone cases) due to considerable improvements in manufacturing efficiency. However, experimental measurements of BMG breakage properties show wide variations, limiting their usage. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop predictive theoretical and computational models of BMG elasto-plasticity. This project is based on a surprising similarity between the equations for elasto-plastic materials and the equations for incompressible fluids. Using this similarity, computational approaches that were originally developed for fluid flow will be translated to elasto-plasticity. These computational methods will be used in collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture properties of BMGs. The ultimate aim is to provide a practical engineering tool for predicting when elasto-plastic materials will break, and how to best design structures using them. This work will be undertaken as part of an integrated program of research, teaching, and mentorship, and will involve outreach activities in New England, including a local library lecture series.<br/><br/>The projection method of Chorin (1968) is a well-established approach for simulating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. This proposal is based on a surprising mathematical correspondence between fluids in the incompressible limit and elasto-plastic solids in the quasi-static limit (when inertia can be neglected). In this proposal, this correspondence is harnessed to translate several modern numerical approaches derived from Chorin's projection method to quasi-static elasto-plasticity, resulting in a practical and powerful set of new simulation tools for a different class of physical problem. Compared to existing techniques, the resultant numerical methods are likely to be especially well-suited to problems involving large plastic deformations. An example type of elasto-plastic material are the bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys with many favorable properties such as excellent strength and wear resistance. The numerical methods developed here will be used in a collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture toughness properties of BMGs, with the aim of predicting BMG toughness over a wide range of experimental conditions. The PI plans to expand the graduate curriculum in numerical methods to address a pressing need in this area. Open source software will be released as part of this project, and the PI will train students in best practices to make software accessible to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, a course on computer-aided design and research opportunities will be provided to students at the University of Central Florida. <br/><br/>The robustness and power consumption of a clock network is mainly dependent on the topology of the network.

In high performance modes, the required robustness to variations is provided by reconfiguring the clock network into a near-tree topology. In low-performance modes, the power consumption is reduced by reconfiguring the clock network into a tree topology. Moreover, the proposed clock network structure has no short circuit current, regardless of whether the topology is reconfigured to be in the form of a tree or near-tree. No short circuit current is introduced in the proposed structure because there is only a single gate driving each net of interconnects.

At the same time, certain structural properties of statistical models, such as sparsity or low-rank structure, have proven to be crucial for obtaining meaningful and accurate results in high dimensions. In addition to being highly scalable to large datasets, some optimization algorithms have the desirable property that they directly promote the aforementioned valuable structural properties of models. This project involves developing, analyzing, and implementing novel optimization algorithms that have such beneficial structure-exploiting and also memory-efficiency properties. This project directly involves the mentoring of graduate students, as well as integration of research results into an undergraduate level machine learning course and a graduate level course in optimization and statistical learning.<br/><br/>The foundation for this project is the Frank-Wolfe Method, a particular structure-exploiting first-order gradient optimization algorithm, and the related methodology of in-face directions. In-face directions automatically promote well-structured near-optimal solutions and have encouraging memory-efficiency properties. This research will investigate conditions whereby methods with in-face directions, as applied to convex relaxations of matrix completion and more general atomic norm regularization problems, are guaranteed to have a low memory footprint. Furthermore, this project will extend the reach of methods that incorporate in-face directions to new problem classes, including non-smooth objective functions, non-convex objective functions, and stochastic gradient estimates. The proposed optimization framework and in-face methodology applies very generally, and has potential for broader impact in several areas, including recommender systems, bioinformatics, customer segmentation, sentiment analysis, and medical imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically, thin-film stability is desirable, such as in the application of coating materials.  However, controlled dewetting or thin-film rupture can also be beneficial, for example in printing and other lithographic processes. Most of the existing studies have involved nonvolatile and nonpolar thin films. The stability of polymer thin films prepared from a volatile and polar liquid, such as water, has practical and fundamental significance and should be investigated. This research involves the fabrication of thin films of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH), a water-soluble and non-toxic polymer, on silicone-coated silicon substrates using a new method called adsorptive spin casting. This method allows the spontaneous adherence of PVOH polymer to the silicone surfaces from water as well as the controlled rupture of PVOH thin films due to directional water evaporation. The study will systematically investigate under- or unexplored areas in polymer thin film stability, such as the (de)stabilization effect of a polar solvent, unconventional thin-film rupture patterns, and the effects of substrate mobility and polarity. As an educator and a female scientist in the longest-standing liberal arts college for women, the PI is committed to improving the representation and retention of women in the STEM disciplines. She will recruit and mentor a diverse group of undergraduate women to carry out new, relevant, publishable, and productive research proposed herein.

Studies of polymer thin films prepared from aqueous solution have been limited due to the particular challenges involved in elucidating the effects of drying dynamics and solvent polarity on thin-film stability. In the proposed research, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) thin-film dewetting on silicon wafer-supported polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) will be studied using a new fabrication method, adsorptive spin casting. This method combines the spontaneous adsorption of PVOH at the PDMS-solution interface and the generation of ordered PVOH dewetting patterns by directional drying. PVOH is chosen because of its tunable crystallinity which will allow the study of a range of dewetting morphologies, from conventional droplets to structures with unique fractal features. Silicon wafer-supported PDMS is the substrate of choice since it will permit the probing of substrate mobility and polarity. The novelties of the research include the design of a new polymer thin-film fabrication method and the systematic exploration of relevant yet under-explored areas in polymer thin-film stability.

In this project, Boise State University will collaborate with Caldwell, Jerome, Kimberly, Kuna, and Vallivue school districts to identify, recruit, and then support students interested in pursuing STEM teaching careers. During students' first two years of study, opportunities for support include an on-campus Living and Learning Community and STEM education summer internships in students' home communities. Students will complete Boise State University's four-year BS/certification program for the STEM disciplines (IDoTeach). In addition to scholarship support in their last two years of study, the project will support their transition into STEM teaching careers with an induction program that prepares new teachers to be teacher-leaders. This project aims to prepare teachers to enter the profession with knowledge of the systemic barriers that limit equitable instruction for a range of students, so that they are better advocate for the interests and needs of their increasingly diverse communities.<br/><br/>This proposal's merits lie in its efforts to increase the number and quality of STEM teachers for Idaho's secondary schools.  Concomitant with these efforts is the goal to identify mechanisms that support an increase in the number of teachers, particularly with respect to the needs of rural, isolated districts. The theory of action behind this proposal is that explicit attention to students' geography in recruitment, internship placement, preparation, and ongoing support will close a loop: Students will be recruited from, prepared to teach within, and ultimately hired to serve as STEM educators for their rural home communities.

Therefore, understanding how protein sequence describes function and structure is a fundamental problem in biological research. Yet, the traditional interpretation of protein sequences is 3ased on either manual identification of sub-sequence patterns or some arbitrary dissection of a sequence into subsequences of fixed size; neither approach can accurately recognize all of the semantic components in a protein sequence that are relevant to its structure and function. In this project, powerful artificial intelligence methods, based on deep learning, will be designed such that they can automatically map protein sequences into high-level semantic features that are meaningful when related to protein structure and function. This will not only improve the accuracy of predicting protein structural and functional properties, but also provide a new way of representing and interpreting proteins biological function, transforming how protein data are interpreted. The impact of the basic research will be broadened through open source software dissemination to other researchers, seminars on deep learning and bioinformatics, student training, involvement of minority and female students, publications, presentations, workshops, and outreach activities for high school students, as well as thoughtfully crafted communication with the Missouri state legislature, and other members of the general public.<br/><br/>During the research, novel deep one-dimensional (1D), 2D, and 3D convolutional neural networks will be developed to translate protein sequences or structures of arbitrary size into high-level features under the guidance of improving the prediction of multiple residue-wise local structural/functional properties (secondary structures, solvent accessibility, torsion angle, disorder, contact map, disulfide bonds, beta-sheet pairings, and protein functional sites) as well as global properties such as folds. The 1D convolutional neural network for interpreting protein sequence data will also be supplemented by the long- and short-term memory networks. The comprehensive deep learning models will be trained by innovative multi-task learning and transfer learning to enhance prediction performance. The 1D, 2D and 3D convolutional networks will be further integrated to improve the accuracy of analyzing protein sequence, structure and function. The 1D and 3D convolutional neural networks are completely original, and the new 2D convolutional architecture is more comprehensive and versatile than existing approaches. In addition to advancing the classic protein prediction tasks through the novel deep learning architectures, the hidden features automatically extracted by the deep learning models will provide a new semantic representation of proteins, which will likely transform various protein bioinformatics tasks such as classification, clustering, comparison, and ranking.

Because of their specialization, individuals in this scenario are adapted to utilize resources in different ways. However, matings between individuals from differently specialized populations are expected to produce intermediate forms that may not be able to survive well in any environment. One solution to this problem is achieved when variation within a species becomes completely associated with variant, or altered, forms of a chromosome. When variant forms of a chromosome contain multiple genes that are inherited as a single unit, this chromosome region is known as a ""supergene"". A growing body of evidence suggests that supergenes play key roles in innovation across the tree of life. Under the influence of a supergene, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta displays two social forms that differ in how many queens inhabit the ant colony and many other individual, colony, and life-history traits. Many of these differences relate to distinct strategies of colony founding by young queens. This research program will assess how variation in diet, nutrition, and supergene presence shape variation in behavior and reproduction in fire ant queens. This will shed new light on supergene origins and function in fire ants, a model for how supergenes can mediate variation in behavior and reproduction in this and other species as well. Broader impacts of the program include partnering with a local high school to offer experiential learning modules and summer research assistantships, integration of resulting data into undergraduate coursework, and providing new insights into the reproductive biology of an economically important invasive species. <br/><br/>This project will explore the extent to which gene expression differences between queens of alternate social forms in Solenopsis invicta reflect convergence with nutritional plasticity, and thus implicate genetic accommodation. In other words, the research will test the hypothesis that a nutritional ground plan played a key role in the origin of queen polymorphism (and, hence, colony social polymorphism) in S. invicta. This work will provide important insights into the proximal basis of queen polymorphism (i) by decoupling gene expression differences due to variation in nutrition and supergene genotype in individual tissues of S. invicta and (ii) by decoupling the effects of queen genotype (endogenous genetic effects) and colony worker genotypes (indirect social genetic effects) on the mediation of queen polymorphism. Taken together, this work will greatly improve our understanding of how phenotypic plasticity and supergenes mediate a complex behavioral polymorphism important in ant social evolution. Broader impacts of the research program include providing fundamental new information on the genomic and epigenomic factors that regulate the reproductive biology of an important invasive pest species, partnering with a local high school biology teacher to develop new experiential learning modules and to provide summer research assistantships for students in the investigator's laboratories, and integrating the data generated by the project into undergraduate coursework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low-dimensional topology is the study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, which are the dimensions that are substantially least understood. One-and two-dimensional spaces are ""small"" enough that nothing interesting can happen; five-dimensional spaces are ""large"" enough that interesting things have room to become uninteresting. A major question in low-dimensional topology is the structure of the homology cobordism groups, groups of three-dimensional spaces with many algebraic features in common with the three-dimensional sphere. This group has deep connections to the substantial difference between the topological and smooth categories in four-dimensions, and to structural issues in higher dimensional topology. In the past thirty years, substantial progress on this and other central topological questions has been made using invariants from gauge theory (which deals with solutions of partial differential equations from physics) and Floer theory (which deals with rigid curves in spaces with a notion of area). This project will use tools from Floer theory to study the homology cobordism groups and other topological questions, and to undertake new theoretical work in Floer theory that will produce useful tools for low-dimensional topology. In parallel to the research component, the project includes plans to further the PI's mentoring and outreach efforts, with a focus on increasing the accessibility of mathematics at early stages and on building pedagogical and mentorship skills in young researchers.  These plans include an extending Michigan State University's existing undergraduate research program, running mathematics day camps for middle school students, and arranging for workshops for building academic communication skills. <br/><br/><br/>The tools of this project are equivariant versions of invariants from Floer theory. The first part of the project uses an equivariant version of the three-manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology constructed by the Principal Investigator and C. Manolescu, which gives new invariants of homology cobordism. The Principal Investigator plans to construct a refinement of this theory, in analogy with work done in parallel gauge-theoretic invariants, and use it to address questions of torsion and indivisibility of elements in the homology cobordism group. The second part of the project focuses on Lagrangian Floer homology, the symplectic geometry construction underlying Heegaard Floer homology and many other topological invariants. Equivariant versions of Lagrangian Floer cohomology that incorporate the information of a Z/2Z-symmetry have been extensively and fruitfully developed in the past six years, including by the Principal Investigator. However, the literature lacks an analogous theory for Z/pZ-symmetries. With R. Lipshitz and S.

Yet long-standing questions remain regarding how networks of microorganisms work together to accomplish the complete breakdown of organic carbon in marine sediments. Sediment microbes interact in a myriad of ways that couple their metabolism to the break down of organic carbon, including by sharing products of metabolism. Accumulating evidence further suggests that some microorganisms can interact by transferring electrons directly to other unrelated microorganisms. This ability occurs across diverse microorganisms and appears to be widespread in the biosphere, particularly in anaerobic environments such as marine sediments. This project addresses emerging questions about the identity and metabolic linkages between microorganisms that work together in natural anaerobic marine and estuarine sediments to break down organic carbon. The investigators approach these questions by focusing on the influence of a keystone bacterium on its surrounding microbial community. ""Cable bacteria"" are a recently discovered group of long filamentous bacteria that act as electrical conductors in aquatic sediments providing a conduit for electrons to commute from deeper sulfidic sediments up to the surface oxygen layer by the process of centimeter-scale electron transport. Since their discovery about 6 years ago, these bacteria have been observed in a wide range of depositional sedimentary environments, often at extremely high cell densities. Where these bacteria are abundant, such as in coastal marine muds, they drive intense localized changes in pH and strongly influence the mineral cycling. This research explorew the direct and indirect influence of cable bacteria on the metabolic activity of associated microorganisms. This project also advance the education and training of two early-career investigators, two PhD students, and undergraduate students. The skills and expertise gained from these PhD research projects will enable the students to be competitive in academic pursuits and in bioinformatics and technology applications relevant to private industry. The scientific discoveries emerging from this work is being incorporated into undergraduate and graduate level courses in marine microbial ecology. The research team will reach out to the broader community by hosting public lectures promoting a better understanding of environmental microbial ecology. <br/><br/>The proposed work is to investigate the role of cable bacteria in structuring sediment microbial communities. Due to their growth strategy and morphology, cable bacteria are particularly amenable to experimental manipulation, providing an outstanding opportunity to better understand community interactions among microorganisms in a natural and complex anaerobic environment. The investigators will explore the interactions and relationships between cable bacteria and their associated microbial community by manipulating the growth and activity of cable bacteria and quantifying the resultant microbial community response. Specifically, this project aims to (1) identify microorganisms whose growth is enhanced by cable bacteria, (2) identify metabolic processes linked with cable bacteria activity using metatranscriptomics, (3) test specific metabolic links between sediment microorganisms and cable bacteria activity using a DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) approach, and (4) visually confirm the identity and quantify key microorganisms associated with cable bacteria using microscopy. As more is learned about the identity and the mechanisms by which microorganisms are metabolically linked in anoxic sediments, we will be better able to understand and make predictions about how microorganisms function in their environment and how they can be utilized in bioengineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Apart from structural engineering applications that is the main focus of the project, the findings can be also used for a plethora of applications involving intelligent, automated, autonomous decision support frameworks. This project will also educate the next diverse generation of engineers and scientists, who, in addition to other skills, need increased computational competence. The planned activities impact a wide audience including school students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, faculty and practicing engineers.<br/><br/>In this project, engineering decision-making is suggested to be approached from a stochastic optimal control and reinforcement learning perspective, embracing and fully integrating predictive physics-based stochastic models and uncertain life-cycle observations. Owing to the vital role of decision-making in engineering problems, this viewpoint leads to condition-based estimation rules for structural systems and an enhanced new meaning of performance-based analysis. The traditional approach to structural design, analysis, retrofit, recovery and maintenance is also reconsidered, from a conventional static optimization problem to an integrated lifelong controlling process of ever changing structures. The central stochastic control component is based on fully and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, asynchronous dynamic programming and deep reinforcement learning techniques. Several theoretical pursuits and advances are needed to enable such a decision-making approach to aging structures and infrastructure systems in the presence of risks and uncertainties. In this project, answers to main challenges will be investigated, such as the curses of dimensionality and history, together with solutions for multiple objectives and decision makers, incorporation of nonlinear filtering, structural reliability updating, and generalized fragility functions, among others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Drawing upon this evidence to make decisions or inform policies therefore requires perusing relevant articles and manually extracting the findings of interest. Unfortunately, this process is time-consuming and has not scaled to meet the demands imposed by the torrential expansion of the scientific evidence base. This work seeks to design novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that can automatically ""read"" and make sense of unstructured published scientific evidence. This is critically important because decisions by policy-makers, care-givers and individuals should be informed by the entirety of the relevant published scientific evidence; but because evidence is predominantly unstructured -- and hence not directly actionable -- this is currently impossible in practice. Consider clinical medicine, an important example which serves as the target domain of this proposal (although the framework and models will generalize to other scientific areas). Roughly 100 articles describing trials were published every single day in 2015. Healthcare professionals cannot possibly make sense of this, and thus treatment decisions must be made without full consideration of the available evidence. Methods that can automatically infer from this torrential mass of unstructured literature which treatments are actually supported by the evidence would facilitate better, evidence-based decisions. Toward this end, this research seeks to design NLP models capable of mapping from natural language scientific articles describing studies or trials to structured ""evidence frames"" that codify the interventions and outcomes studied, and the reported findings concerning these. NLP technology is not presently up to this task. Therefore, this project will support core methodological contributions that will advance systems for data extraction and machine reading of lengthy articles; these will have impact beyond the present motivating application. <br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the focus of this work concerns developing novel, interpretable (transparent) neural network models for extraction from and inference over lengthy articles. Specifically, this project aims to design models that can automatically identify treatments and associated outcomes from free-texts, and then infer the reported comparative effects of the former with respect to the latter. This pushes against limits of existing language technology capabilities. In particular, this necessitates models that perform deep analysis of individual, potentially lengthy, technical documents. Furthermore, model transparency is critical here, as domain experts must be able to recover from where in documents evidential claims were inferred. New corpora curated for this project (to be shared with the broader community) will facilitate core NLP research on such models. To realize the aforementioned methodological aims, the researchers leading this project will develop conditional and dynamic ""attentive"" neural models. Specific methodological lines of research to be explored include: (i) Models equipped with conditional, sparse attention mechanisms over textual units that reflect scientific discourse structure to achieve accurate and transparent extraction of, and inference concerning, reported evidence. (ii) Neural sequence tagging models that take multiple 'reads' of a text, exploiting iteratively adjusted conditional document representations as global context to inform local predictions.

A self-organizing process, SSID is a versatile method for fabricating bi-continuous metal-metal composites and porous metals at nano/meso scales. SSID opens a new route to synthesize such structures, particularly in non-noble metals. SSID may also potentially be used to create high surface area metal/metal oxides with high thermal stability and chemical reactivity. The processing-structure-property correlations in these materials will be characterized by in situ synchrotron techniques. A multi-modal approach will be implemented by combining different X-ray techniques at NSLS-II. The research objectives of this proposal are 1) to create a new class of nano/meso metal-metal composites and porous metal films via this SSID process, 2) to understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern its material evolution in morphology, structure and chemical composition, and 3) to correlate processing and structure with the thermal and chemical properties.

Epitaxial growth of these materials with various mechanical boundary conditions provides control over the superstructure and thus the properties.

The chemical kinetic models for describing HHC combustion are highly complex, comprising thousands of elementary reactions involving hundreds of chemical species. To effectively predict these combustion behaviors, we must automate the construction of kinetic models.

Failure of structural materials by fatigue -- the accumulation of damage under cyclic loading -- remains one of the major challenges in mechanics and materials science. Crucially, the mechanisms through which applied mechanical loading distributes between regions called grains within the microstructure are not fully understood. The novelty of the computational approach to be used in this project is to explicitly target the grain boundaries, which will inherently connect multiple scales relevant to fatigue crack nucleation and growth. Knowledge of the correlations between the microstructure and fatigue crack driving forces will enable tailored material design. Recent advances in additive manufacturing technology have enabled control of microstructure during material deposition. This research will yield a theoretical and computational framework for designing structural components to capitalize on this flexible manufacturing technology. Thus, the research will advance national health, prosperity, welfare, and defense, while progressing science. The research outcomes of the project will be integrated with specific K-12 and underrepresented minority outreach activities as well as support foundational research in vectors education. Making physics concepts easier will empower students to succeed and bring new perspectives to their future STEM careers. Curriculum enhancements will directly impact courses at the 11th grade up to graduate level; broader impact is achieved through teaching new pedagogies to educators.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to advance the understanding of microstructural and textural influences on fatigue behavior of polycrystalline materials by understanding how stress applied at the bulk scale is redistributed at the grain scale. The primary research objective is to discover how grain interactions, called the neighborhood effect, influence the distribution of local stresses that drive fatigue crack nucleation and growth. The novel approach involves decomposing the balance of forces and displacement jumps along grain boundaries into contributions from the granular uniform field (mesoscale) and fluctuation field (microscale). A multi-resolution Discontinuous Galerkin method is developed to measure the neighborhood effect that is ideally-suited for capturing discontinuities along grain boundaries, allowing contributions from mesoscale and microscale to be distinguished but not having to be separated. Hypotheses are pursued to reveal the relative zone of influence of mesoscale versus microscale stress components, thereby elevating the empirical nature of fatigue threshold design to account for microstructural and textural features that increase resistance to small crack growth. Insight as to how these local effects propagate through the microstructure and affect material fatigue would provide a better understanding of why some flaws nucleate cracks while others do not.

In the extreme, the accumulation of harmful mutations can lead to population extinction. The genetic information in mitochondria - the main source of energy production in most complex organisms - is usually passed intact from parents to offspring. Thus, the mitochondria should be especially prone to the buildup of harmful mutations. However, mitochondria have maintained their function for more than one billion years; how and why is an important question in evolutionary biology. This research uses a model snail system to address these questions. It takes advantage of the fact that some lineages of snails pass both their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes on to their offspring without any genetic shuffling; a process that accelerates the accumulation of mutations in these snails. By contrast, there is shuffling of genetic material between parents and offspring in other lineages of the same snail species. This project will compare different lineages of snails, some with genetic shuffling and some without. In doing so, this research will explore how harmful mutations are cleared from populations. Reducing the impact of harmful mutations is important for keeping organisms healthy. In turn, healthy organisms can guard against population extinction. It is possible that harmful mutations in the mitochondria are compensated for by mutations in nuclear genes. This hypothesis will also be tested by this research. Because functional mitochondria are important to the health of many organisms, the research will be relevant to the biomedical and agricultural communities. The research will also train a new generation of scientists and broaden participation in biology. The broader impacts include collaborations with high school students and museums. The project will also extend an award-winning partnership with the National Center for Science Education to new audiences.<br/><br/>The research combines genetic and functional methods to test for signatures of mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution in the New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. In this snail system, some lineages are sexual and others are asexual. Crucially for this study, the asexual lineages of P. antipodarum have higher mitochondrial substitution rates than the sexual lineages. This contrast in mitochondrial substitution rates permits the study's two objectives. Objective 1 will test the hypothesis that higher mitochondrial substitution rates in asexual versus sexual lineages drive stronger mitochondrial-nuclear molecular coevolutionary dynamics. One prediction of these coevolutionary dynamics is that substitution rates for proteins encoded by the nuclear genome that are then targeted to the mitochondria will be higher than the substitution rates in control nuclear gene sets. Objective 2 will test for functional effects of mitonuclear interactions on mitochondrial respiration and snail metabolic rate. Since temperature can impact snail metabolic rates, the second objective will include four different temperature treatments. Results of this research will contribute to our understanding of the mitochondrial-nuclear interactions that define eukaryotes. Furthermore, they are of broad relevance to genome evolution, speciation, and the functional and evolutionary consequences of reproductive mode variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet long-standing questions remain regarding how networks of microorganisms work together to accomplish the complete breakdown of organic carbon in marine sediments. Sediment microbes interact in a myriad of ways that couple their metabolism to the break down of organic carbon, including by sharing products of metabolism. Accumulating evidence further suggests that some microorganisms can interact by transferring electrons directly to other unrelated microorganisms. This ability occurs across diverse microorganisms and appears to be widespread in the biosphere, particularly in anaerobic environments such as marine sediments. This project addresses emerging questions about the identity and metabolic linkages between microorganisms that work together in natural anaerobic marine and estuarine sediments to break down organic carbon. The investigators approach these questions by focussing on the influence of a keystone bacterium on its surrounding microbial community. ""Cable bacteria"" are a recently discovered group of long filamentous bacteria that act as electrical conductors in aquatic sediments providing a conduit for electrons to commute from deeper sulfidic sediments up to the surface oxygen layer by the process of centimeter-scale electron transport. Since their discovery about 6 years ago, these bacteria have been observed in a wide range of depositional sedimentary environments, often at extremely high cell densities. Where these bacteria are abundant, such as in coastal marine muds, they drive intense localized changes in pH and strongly influence the mineral cycling. This research explorew the direct and indirect influence of cable bacteria on the metabolic activity of associated microorganisms. This project also advance the education and training of two early-career investigators, two PhD students, and undergraduate students. The skills and expertise gained from these PhD research projects will enable the students to be competitive in academic pursuits and in bioinformatics and technology applications relevant to private industry. The scientific discoveries emerging from this work is being incorporated into undergraduate and graduate level courses in marine microbial ecology. The research team will reach out to the broader community by hosting public lectures promoting a better understanding of environmental microbial ecology. <br/><br/>The proposed work is to investigate the role of cable bacteria in structuring sediment microbial communities. Due to their growth strategy and morphology, cable bacteria are particularly amenable to experimental manipulation, providing an outstanding opportunity to better understand community interactions among microorganisms in a natural and complex anaerobic environment. The investigators will explore the interactions and relationships between cable bacteria and their associated microbial community by manipulating the growth and activity of cable bacteria and quantifying the resultant microbial community response. Specifically, this project aims to (1) identify microorganisms whose growth is enhanced by cable bacteria, (2) identify metabolic processes linked with cable bacteria activity using metatranscriptomics, (3) test specific metabolic links between sediment microorganisms and cable bacteria activity using a DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) approach, and (4) visually confirm the identity and quantify key microorganisms associated with cable bacteria using microscopy. As more is learned about the identity and the mechanisms by which microorganisms are metabolically linked in anoxic sediments, we will be better able to understand and make predictions about how microorganisms function in their environment and how they can be utilized in bioengineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undergraduate students from the research apprenticeship program at the University of California, Berkeley will be trained in museum curation and work-study students will be trained in databasing and digitization of natural history collections. <br/><br/>To accommodate these collections, compactors with 44 new cabinets will be installed and archival boxes purchased to house haustoria.  Specimens will be imaged and label information will be captured for incorporation into the UC/JEPS herbarium portal (http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/specimens/) and will be shared with GBIF (https://www.gbif.org/) and iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), making these collections accessible to the public and researchers across several platforms.

Even when it is possible to design a robotic system to complete such a task, the resulting system can be too costly and/or lack the robustness required for industrial use. For example, produce picking remains a labor-intensive endeavor for the agriculture industry because variability in the operating environment and fragility of the produce have thus far prevented the design of an economical mechanized solution. Other examples can be found in numerous industries, including semiconductor manufacturing, healthcare and biomedical engineering. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to advance mechanical systems design in this setting. The research will lead to a new geometric design methodology that results in robust mechanical systems and motion paths for uncertain operating environments and manipulating uncertain objects. Research outcomes will advance national health and prosperity by impacting industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and healthcare. An innovative educational program will create a cross-disciplinary research-oriented course for lower division undergraduates at a Minority Serving Institution, engage female high school students through a robotics-themed summer program and develop activities to facilitate the transfer of underrepresented community college students to four-year engineering degrees.<br/><br/>This CAREER award applies robust geometric design principals to mechanical systems to explain complex motion in mechanism-object/environment interaction and uncertainty: two critical foci not explicitly captured in existing design methodologies. In this context, uncertainty refers to variations in the object/environment geometry and/or in the realizable mechanism motion paths. The results will yield a novel framework for the design of mechanisms for interaction with uncertain objects/environments. This will be accomplished through a general mechanism-environment contact geometric model formulation and its validation. The design framework will be assessed through designing and experimentally testing industry-related showcase prototypes in the areas of mechanical and biomedical engineering. The central hypothesis is that incorporating mechanism-environment interaction and uncertainty conditions into the design task formulation results in a robust design methodology that is better than existing approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The emphasis is on those who did not migrate but become urban through city expansion as they have been the least studied to date. The questions investigated concern how people understand local belonging, which people and what places are viewed as truly urban and local, who is viewed as part of an in-group or out-group, and who is deemed worthy of local citizenship rights and shared public spaces.

Spatial methods such as mental mapping exercises and city walks complement approximately 140 interviews: 40 interviews with each of the three kinds of city residents and 20 interviews with urban planning experts, drawn from different parts of the city. The interviews investigate how residents subjectively define the spatial and sociocultural boundaries that distinguish the urban and non-urban, the local and non-local, and the deserving and undeserving in their minds.

Many natural materials have geometrical microstructures which make them stronger and tougher than their base materials.  This research will provide the needed knowledge so that these mechanisms can be incorporated in soils using additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) techniques in which soils are ""printed"" into structural components or cellular patterns to improve their load carrying ability.  Bio-inspired structures like the honeycomb have been studied for metals and other solid materials; however, an understanding of the effectiveness of these load transfer mechanisms in particulate materials like soils is lacking.  Improving a soil's ability to carry load will result in more sustainable and cost-effective geotechnical practice by reducing the amounts of concrete and other materials needed for a project.  The fundamental understanding gained in this project will also move additive manufacturing further towards becoming a viable option for building shelters and other infrastructure in remote and underdeveloped locations, and in disaster relief or war-torn areas.  Additionally, this project seeks to promote interdisciplinary education through a new course and the participation and retention of diverse students through activities such as K-12 outreach focused on exploring engineering principles in nature, visual-spatial workshops, and recruitment of high quality researchers through the University's Engineering Career Awareness Program. <br/><br/>Hierarchical microstructures give many natural materials strengths which are orders of magnitude greater than their constituents.

However, developing such systems is challenging. System developers must account for the differences in users and hardware platforms, and anticipate how a system will respond to the changing operating conditions. For example, a hearing aid may use its onboard processor to augment speech in relatively quiet surroundings but rely on more powerful cloud computing resources to enhance speech as users encounters more noisy environments. Today, developers lack effective programming languages and tools to help them create and improve such IoT systems.<br/><br/>This project investigates how adaptive IoT systems may be developed using policy-driven software adaptation and synthesis.  Central to our approach is to separate the functionality of a system (encapsulated in software components) from its run-time adaptation (specified as a policy).  Developers will be provided with a language to write policies that control when components are executed, their concurrency, and dynamically selects which alternate component implementation should be used. The policy language will be combined with data-driven techniques that integrate simulation, program analysis, and machine learning techniques to configure the parameters of a policy as well as synthesize new policies.<br/><br/>The research undertaken as part of this proposal will provide a solid foundation for building adaptive IoT systems. The primary research activities will help reduce the development time and improve the robustness of IoT systems, bringing this technology closer to fruition.

In the extreme, the accumulation of harmful mutations can lead to population extinction. The genetic information in mitochondria - the main source of energy production in most complex organisms - is usually passed intact from parents to offspring. Thus, the mitochondria should be especially prone to the buildup of harmful mutations. However, mitochondria have maintained their function for more than one billion years; how and why is an important question in evolutionary biology. This research uses a model snail system to address these questions. It takes advantage of the fact that some lineages of snails pass both their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes on to their offspring without any genetic shuffling; a process that accelerates the accumulation of mutations in these snails. By contrast, there is shuffling of genetic material between parents and offspring in other lineages of the same snail species. This project will compare different lineages of snails, some with genetic shuffling and some without. In doing so, this research will explore how harmful mutations are cleared from populations. Reducing the impact of harmful mutations is important for keeping organisms healthy. In turn, healthy organisms can guard against population extinction. It is possible that harmful mutations in the mitochondria are compensated for by mutations in nuclear genes. This hypothesis will also be tested by this research. Because functional mitochondria are important to the health of many organisms, the research will be relevant to the biomedical and agricultural communities. The research will also train a new generation of scientists and broaden participation in biology. The broader impacts include collaborations with high school students and museums. The project will also extend an award-winning partnership with the National Center for Science Education to new audiences.<br/><br/>The research combines genetic and functional methods to test for signatures of mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution in the New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. In this snail system, some lineages are sexual and others are asexual. Crucially for this study, the asexual lineages of P. antipodarum have higher mitochondrial substitution rates than the sexual lineages. This contrast in mitochondrial substitution rates permits the study's two objectives. Objective 1 will test the hypothesis that higher mitochondrial substitution rates in asexual versus sexual lineages drive stronger mitochondrial-nuclear molecular coevolutionary dynamics. One prediction of these coevolutionary dynamics is that substitution rates for proteins encoded by the nuclear genome that are then targeted to the mitochondria will be higher than the substitution rates in control nuclear gene sets. Objective 2 will test for functional effects of mitonuclear interactions on mitochondrial respiration and snail metabolic rate. Since temperature can impact snail metabolic rates, the second objective will include four different temperature treatments. Results of this research will contribute to our understanding of the mitochondrial-nuclear interactions that define eukaryotes. Furthermore, they are of broad relevance to genome evolution, speciation, and the functional and evolutionary consequences of reproductive mode variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emerging chips integrate different types of processor cores, which are specialized for various functions including graphics processing and pattern recognition.  Availability of many cores creates a task scheduling problem for a software program, namely which portions of the software should execute on what type of core. Given that the capabilities of the cores are not equal, a task may take different amounts of time to finish depending on which core it was assigned to.  In a real-time system, while mapping tasks to cores, deadlines should be met, which may not always be possible. Further, the consequences of missing a deadline are not the same for all tasks. Some are more forgiving than others. Consequently, tasks can be classified broadly based on their criticality. This research will investigate an efficient scheduler for mixed-criticality real-time systems.  <br/><br/>In a resource constrained system, consequences of failure to meet a deadline may range from catastrophic to Minor. Consequently, there are varying penalties associated with missing deadlines. The investigator plans to address the scheduling problem of mixed-criticality real-time systems. This scheduling problem is NP-hard; the proposed approach involves an artificial neural network (NN)-based scheduler.  The investigator will experiment with parallel NNs for faster convergence, and develop a prototype system to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of this solution.

Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute (HBOI) at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) has a long history of exploring the ocean biodiversity. These efforts have produced a unique collection of specimens designated as the Marine Biotechnology Reference Collection (MBRC). The MBRC is a taxonomically and geographically diverse collection of more than 31,500 preserved benthic marine invertebrates and macroalgae (seaweeds). This collection is unique in that nearly 30% of the samples were selectively collected by the manned Johnson-Sea-Link submersibles at depths of more than 150 m, from locations that are otherwise difficult to access by trawling or dredging due to rugged topography or reef habitats. Collection by submersible means that these specimens are relatively intact compared to those traditionally collected with trawl or dredge. This collection is also unique in that it includes in situ photographs and videotapes.  Collections that were made over a period of 30 years or more provides an opportunity to study changes over time. Research on the specimens, data, images, and videos has already contributed to a better understanding of evolutionary biology, ecology, characterization of marine habitats, and resource management, and has been vital to HBOI's drug discovery program. A goal of this project is to provide the scientific community access to these unique samples and accompanying data. The excellent condition of the specimens makes them useful for molecular analyses, and the videos provide important data to characterize poorly known marine habitats, some of which support commercially and recreationally important fish and invertebrate species.   <br/><br/>An outcome of the project will be a web-accessible version of the collection database, including photos and annotated video clips, for use by researchers, students and the general public worldwide. The collection consists of a complete set of fully digitized dive logs and specimen photographs and thousands of hours of video recordings. Collection data will be verified for accuracy.  Specimens will be barcode labeled for ease in accessing; they are currently organized by collection date in a temperature-controlled environment.  Digitized videotapes will be annotated and linked to the specimen database.  Links to the specimen database will ensure that the complete set of data - specimens, field notes, collection data, photographic images, and videos - can be made publicly available on-line.  Results of this project will be shared and made available to researchers, resource managers, students, and the public through the HBOI-FAU website and through iDigBio.  Digitizing the MBRC and publishing the data on the web will expand the availability and impact of the collection beyond the limitations of an internal, static repository, and will promote teaching, training, and learning in basic and interdisciplinary research in a variety of STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It serves as a ``gatekeeper'' for waters intruding onto the Antarctic continental shelf, such as the warm Circumpolar Deep Water that supplies heat to melt the bases of Antarctica's ice shelves, and for waters escaping the continental shelf, such as the dense water outflows that fill more than one-third of the global sub-surface ocean. A series of high-resolution numerical ocean simulations will be conducted to assess whether past and ongoing regional models and observational campaigns are capturing the ``hot spots'' of heat transport toward the continent, and identify which small-scale/high-frequency processes must be resolved to capture this heat transport. The educational component will substantially broaden participation of undergraduates in oceanography by combining field trips and research-based exercises which have been shown to increase student learning and retention compared to conventional teaching methods. The educational initiative will engage hundreds of undergraduate students per year in research cruises to the local continental shelf and slope off the coast of California. A captain/technician will be recruited to facilitate dozens of cruises annually using the UCLA Zodiac research vessel. The project investigator will develop organizational and educational materials to support the research cruises, with students guided to form their own research hypotheses and analyzing their own data using scientific computing tools. By the end of the project period this educational program will become self-sustaining, drawing from a combination of course fees, research/education grants, donations and direct support from UCLA. The project will also provide research training for a graduate student and support for an early-career faculty member.<br/><br/>Practical constraints imposed by Antarctica's climate and the small scales of variability have limited previous quantification of cross-slope exchange processes to localized regions. There remains a substantial gap in understanding how continental-scale exchanges of water between the open ocean and the shelf seas are modulated by seasonal variability in atmospheric conditions, hetereogenous bathymetry, and small-scale/high-frequency sources of variability such as eddies, tides, overflows and topographic waves. The project investigator proposes to close this gap in understanding by developing the first ocean/sea ice model simulations of the entire Antarctic margins, including the ocean beneath the floating ice shelves, that can resolve small-scale variability and tides. Using analysis techniques based on multiple separation of time scales, the cross-slope exchanges of mass and properties will be quantified and thereby identify regimes in which the Antarctic Slope Front serves as a ``barrier'' vs. a ``blender''. The same framework will then be used to diagnose the dynamics of the Antarctic Slope Current, for example the energy and vorticity budgets, to distinguish the relative roles of atmospheric forcing, bathymetric steering and small-scale variability in localizing exchanges across the Antarctic Slope Front. Finally, idealized process models will be constructed to explore specific hypotheses derived from the circum-Antarctic model simulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These new materials are two-dimensional (2D) oxide-based structures that are built by alternating oxide layers and electronically conductive layers, such as graphene-based compounds or transition metal carbides (MXenes). The resulting structures exhibit characteristics important for battery electrodes: space that allows ion movement, and conductive layers that enable fast transport of electrons. Combining layered metal oxides and carbon-based compounds in high quality layer-by-layer architecture offers an opportunity to discover and investigate new phenomena occurring at interfaces. This fundamental understanding is important for the creation of batteries with improved energy and power capabilities. The materials and methods developed in this work are relevant to a wider range of applications, including energy storage, electrochromics (responsible for reversible changes of colour), sensing, actuation (or control of movement), and water treatment. The interdisciplinary nature of this project attracts diverse undergraduate and graduate students to research. The project integrates synthesis and properties of 2D structures into the engineering curriculum at the PI's institution and enriches outreach programs through the creation of educational videos on synthesis and electrochemical properties of materials. A variation on the gameshow Family Feud focused on electrochemistry is being used to attract more students to STEM fields.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research is focused on understanding how face-to-face heterostructured interfaces can be created and controlled in layered materials. The aim is to produce 2D oxide-based heterostructures with high electron and ion transport leading to improved energy storage capabilities in Li-ion, Na-ion and K-ion batteries. Layered transition metal oxides show high redox activity in intercalation reactions and relatively high working potentials, making them especially attractive for use as cathodes in energy storage devices. However, the low electronic conductivity of most oxides limits their performance. To overcome this limitation, layered oxides are combined in unique heterostructured architectures with electronically conductive 2D compounds by controllably alternating atomically thick layers of different individual materials. The 2D heterostructure electrodes are constructed using a sol-gel assisted transition metal oxide synthesis process through (1) chemical pre-intercalation of organic molecules followed by pyrolysis, or (2) addition of solid nanoflakes of conducting phases (graphene or MXene) during the sol-gel process. The improved understanding of the transport of ions and electrons and charge storage mechanisms in layered heterostructured materials achieved in this work is expected to lead to better electrodes and open exciting new research directions. The tailored 2D heterointerfaces make it possible to design new ceramic materials with tunable structures and compositions that exhibit high ion storage capability, rapid electron and ion transport, and enhanced electrochemical stability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing the number of bilingual and underrepresented STEM teachers may improve student performance as well as lead to a more diverse pool of students graduating from high school, pursuing STEM majors, and either teaching STEM or working in a STEM field. The need for STEM teachers in the areas surrounding Molloy is expected to increase as a large percentage of current teachers approach retirement age. Further, bilingual teachers are in high demand as English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLLs) in Molloy's nearby counties are a steadily growing subpopulation, accounting for 14% of all ELLs/MLLs in the state. The goal of the Noyce Ambassadors Program is to produce newly certified STEM teachers, with two-thirds from underrepresented backgrounds, first-generation college students, and/or bilingual. The Noyce Ambassadors Program will include a variety of activities to recruit high-achieving STEM students and inspire them to become teachers in high needs school districts. Activities include a two-week introductory research boot camp held for one week on Molloy's campus and for one week on Nassau Community College's (NCC) campus. At this research boot camp, students will learn from faculty as well as in-service teachers. Once admitted into the program, the Noyce Ambassadors will participate in two summer internship experiences, one on Molloy's campus and another at Molloy's Center for Environmental Research and Coastal Oceans Monitoring (CERCOM) field station. The CERCOM field station is dedicated to the captive breeding of horseshoe crabs, exploration of global coastal environments and nearshore oceans, and interpretation of these environments through data analysis. These experiences will show the Noyce Ambassadors how to apply and teach STEM concepts in the context of real-life problems. During the academic year, the Noyce Ambassadors will complete an intensive curriculum and school-based field experiences that are tailored to prepare them to be highly effective teachers. Molloy will also provide professional development to support Noyce Ambassadors as they complete their teaching requirements.<br/><br/>The Noyce Ambassadors Program aims to produce 18 new STEM teachers, and will recruit students majoring in mathematics, biology or earth and environmental science. Molloy will collaborate with NCC to recruit high school and community college students. Through this partnership, the project aims to form a pipeline of future STEM students and teachers, as well as potential Noyce Ambassadors. Molloy and NCC will also collaborate with four Local Education Agencies:  Freeport and Uniondale school districts in Nassau County, and Brentwood and Amityville school districts in Suffolk County. These agencies will serve as sites for clinical teaching experiences. This project will conduct a research study to assess effectiveness of strategies that are intended to sustain each Noyce Ambassador in the classroom. This research seeks to benefit the STEM teaching and education communities by providing insight into what supports and activities are most effective, why teachers opt to leave high-needs teaching settings, and what academic skills and experiences lead to higher teacher retention in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include biological soft-tissue replacement materials such as those found in the meniscus of the knee or the intervertebral disc of the spine, separation membranes for selective removal of chemical or biological contaminants, durable and rapid ion-transport membranes for battery technology, and materials designed to provide long-term impact protection (military, athletics) while retaining high elastic flexibility.  Reduction to practice, however, has been plagued by materials with limited ability to meet the mechanical demands required of such applications, being subject to rapid decay in elasticity and susceptibility to failure by fracture. This project is focused on using a new paradigm in swollen elastomer network design to create mechanically robust polymers capable of sustaining repetitive stress dissipation without fatigue while suppressing susceptibility to fracture and failure needed to ensure long-term performance.  The scientific advancement efforts in the project will be integrated with interdisciplinary education of students.  It will also be accompanied by development of workshops aimed at building collaborations among top soft-matter synthesis and mechanics groups around the world, in an effort to push the frontiers of science, explore new ideas, and accelerate the untapped potential of these unique polymeric materials. The workshops importantly will provide a forum to encourage talented, yet underrepresented young researchers, and provide them access to and mentorship from leading materials researchers in the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Creative efforts in polymer network design over the last decade have led to numerous impactful improvements in hydrogel mechanics. Notable examples include both highly elastic hydrogel networks in which fatigue is minimal but very little energy is dissipated, and highly dissipative hydrogel networks in which toughness is maximized but fatigue is rapid and recovery is subject to long recovery times (minutes to days). Effective integration of both dissipative capabilities and efficient elastic recovery, however, appears limited using current design strategies. The principal objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the ability of junction point morphology (nanostructure) and strand-level organizational control to maximize non-plastic energy dissipation, recovery rate, and fatigue resistance simultaneously in swollen polymer networks. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that synthetic integration of non-bond rupturing dissipative interactions into every molecular strand of the network, combined with implicit coupling of the dissipation mechanism to its own driving force for elastic recovery, will add substantial dissipative capability without sacrificing the rapid elastic recovery or the exceptional fatigue resistance. The project involves the synthetic development of uniquely designed ABC and ABCBA block copolymers which upon heating self-assemble into highly efficient network structures based on core-shell sphere morphologies. The objectives are to explore the ability of the B block domain size and degree of hydrophobicity to successfully tune the magnitude of dissipated energy (e.g., through measurement of fracture toughness) and understand its dependence on strain and strain rate. If successful, this project will transform our access to hydrogel materials that exhibit both fatigue resistance and toughness (bulk and fracture), at rates of recovery far exceeding the most advanced hydrogel systems developed to date.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is focused on studying the fundamental materials properties for a platform of energy-absorbing polymers and developing a toolbox to introduce molecular mechanisms to increase toughness, energy dissipation, and the potential for nanoscale self-healing that will increase the lifespan of the material. This platform is based on polymer network materials called ""thiol-ene network thermosets"". They can be made through chemistry that offers fast reaction times and highly homogeneous networks, like a chain-link fence, resulting in high energy absorption capacity. Previous work in the Savin group has demonstrated the ability to make molecular-level changes in the network and have this translate into macroscopic changes in the physical properties of the materials.  These changes can be done in a modular way using facile chemistry.  The resulting materials have applications in sound damping, shatterproof coatings, personal protective equipment (e.g., mouthguards and multi-impact foams), and ballistics protection.  Advances in scientific discovery will be incorporated into the education and training of students, integrating a broad range of disciplines including chemistry, physics, biochemistry, and polymer science.  Group members will gain a comprehensive understanding of polymers in many areas of synthesis, characterization, morphology, scattering and rheology, from both a fundamental and an applied standpoint.  This multidisciplinary approach is beneficial not only for education, but also to produce well-rounded graduates who are attractive to a variety of employers in both academic and industrial settings. Diversity and involvement in K-5 elementary science outreach are also strongly emphasized. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to study the fundamental materials properties for a platform of energy absorbing polymers based on thiol-ene network (TEN) thermosets. Previous research on TENs has shown the ability to make molecular-level manipulations through chemistry and have this translate to changes in macroscopic performance and function. The goal of this research is to exploit advances in TEN modification to synthesize new monomers where we introduce mechanisms to increase toughness, as well as the potential for self-healing that will ultimately increase the life span of the material. This will be done for both slab (Aim 1) and foam (Aim 2) materials. In the proposed research, we will introduce these molecular-level mechanisms for energy dissipation and toughness through dynamic-covalent sacrificial, mechanochemical linkages, and incorporation of photo-responsive, liquid crystalline azobenzene substituents. Building a toolbox of network modifications will allow us to discover materials that have the potential to transform the field of energy-absorbing materials by expanding functionality. The modified TEN materials platform that will be developed in this proposal is completely modular and can be applied to applications such as personal protective equipment, curable coatings, ballistics protection, dental restoratives, and polymer composite materials. Successful completion of the proposed research will yield a platform of materials with improved impact-energy absorption properties, as well as an understanding of how molecular design and manipulation translates into dynamics and macroscopic function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-dimensional and massive data are now emerging in scientific areas including biomedical engineering, environmental science, financial econometrics, array signal processing, and social networks, among many others. An important associated research challenge is to develop efficient methods to extract information and quantify its uncertainty for a large number of variables and measurements. Data-driven statistical inferential procedures for uncertainty quantification via the bootstrap methods are often computationally intensive for high-dimensional large-scale datasets. On the computational side, this research project will make use of distributed inference via the parallel high-performance computing technique, which is an essential ingredient to speed up bootstrap calculations. On the statistical side, this research will introduce a general framework for studying the performance of various bootstrap methods. This research project aims to lead to a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental tradeoff between statistical and computational concerns in quantifying uncertainty for a broad class of inferential procedures, thus providing guidance to practically optimize statistical accuracy and computational cost in potential real applications. Both undergraduate and graduate students are involved in the project.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research project is to provide new insights and deepen the theoretical understanding of strengths and fundamental limitations of fully data-dependent inferential procedures (such as bootstraps) in the high-dimensional and massive data framework on two classical problems: i) change point detection and identification; ii) computationally-aware statistical inference for U-statistics. The research aims to develop statistically correct and computationally scalable inferential procedures when the dimension can be larger (or even much larger) than the sample size. In contrast to existing work, the methods under development have strong theoretical guarantees, are robust under mild assumptions, require no tuning, and are easy to parallelize. Of practical interest, the research will develop needed software tools for researchers from disciplines with applications of high-dimensional and nonparametric statistics. Theoretical contributions of the proposed research include establishing new approximation and coupling theorems (under weaker regularity conditions than existing literature) in high-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces of increasing dimension and complexity, where classical probability tools such as the central limit theorem and extreme value theory are no longer applicable. The mathematical theory is of independent interest and will provide powerful new tools to analyze other statistical procedures on high-dimensional and nonparametric models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using advanced synthesis tools which permit the combination of atomic layers of materials with different compositions, the atomic deviations can be effectively manipulated to produce novel effects. In this project, high-intensity X-rays are used to image the atomic-scale structure of the interfaces of layers of thin crystalline oxide films. The information gained from imaging these materials is required to help scientists and engineers understand why some oxide materials lose their useful magnetic properties when their thicknesses are reduced to a few atomic layers. The X-ray results are combined with high-resolution electron microscopy, magnetic and transport measurements, and theoretical calculations to design specific combinations of oxide materials to achieve magnetism in single layers of oxide materials. This project has exciting implications for the design of novel materials and devices for information processing, quantum computing and low-powered sensors. This project provides a highly collaborative environment and access to advanced technical resources for training undergraduate and graduate students in the development of the next generation of advanced nanoscale materials. The project provides low-cost tools for visualizing abstract concepts related to crystallography to foster the public understanding of the development of new technologically-relevant crystalline materials.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project uses state-of-the-art synchrotron X-ray facilities at the Argonne National Laboratory and the Berkeley National Laboratory to carry out three-dimensional non-destructive atomic-scale mapping of the atomic, electronic and magnetic structures of magnetic perovskite oxide surfaces and interfaces. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental interactions which occur at the interfaces between atomically-thin magnetic oxide films and other polar and non-polar perovskite materials and establishes a link between the observed interactions and the physical properties of these systems. A combination of first principles theory, high-resolution electron microscopy and temperature-dependent magnetic, transport and element-specific synchrotron X-ray magnetic dichroism measurements is used to design novel oxide heterointerfaces for achieving the confinement of ferromagnetism in two-dimensional oxide layers. These materials have applications in novel spin-based electronic devices. The wide range of cutting-edge research tools utilized in this activity are used to enhance the education of undergraduate and graduate students to prepare them for careers in scientific research and materials and device engineering.

These algorithms are used, for example, to send data to mobile devices and to simulate fire and water in movies. Many of the most classical algorithms, and particularly those with applications in linear algebra, have been extremely useful for decades, if not centuries. Yet, some of these algorithms are poorly understood -- they can fail catastrophically, but rarely do. In other words, the worst-case behavior is poor, but the average-case behavior is good. This research will advance the understanding of this phenomenon by employing techniques from the ever-expanding field of random matrix theory (RMT). In turn, this research gives rise to new questions within RMT. A substantial feature of this project is the extensive educational component that integrates research and education. This integration is achieved via a three-pronged approach including a summer workshop on random matrices, high school engagement, and undergraduate/graduate student mentoring.<br/><br/>Two natural ways to employ RMT within numerical linear algebra also coincide with the two most common themes in numerical linear algebra: Algorithm analysis and algorithm development. For example, remarkably detailed estimates from RMT such as rigidity and edge universality have found concrete applications within numerical linear algebra giving average-case performance for the classical power method. Randomized algorithms have found great utility in the big-data age. This research will employ both of these themes with applications to data science, psychology and beyond.

While these universal laws are very well studied, there are numerous mysterious laws that are frequently observed, but not at all understood, especially those arising from random systems with complicated component correlations.

Organic solutions of lithium salts have become ubiquitous to science and engineering, through their use in energy storage, pharmaceutical formulations, and industrial chemical processes. Lithium salts contain positively charged lithium ions (""cations"") and negatively charged ions (""anions""). How the molecules of the solvent are arranged around the cations and anions of the salt determines the properties of the solution, for instance its electrical conductivity.  Observing such molecular arrangements is difficult because the molecules and ions are always moving quickly throughout the solution.   Professor Kuroda's group uses advanced laser spectroscopies to instantaneously probe the spatial arrangement of the lithium salt components in the liquid. These studies are advancing scientists' general understanding of the structure of ionic solutions, and may ultimately help engineers design lithium salt solutions for different technological applications.<br/> <br/>Prof. Daniel G. Kuroda and his research group utilizes an array of infrared laser spectroscopies, including two dimensional infrared spectroscopy, to obtain dynamics and structural information about lithium salts in the organic solvents.

Thus, the experimental methodology allows one to obtain a comprehensive molecular picture of lithium salts in different organic solutions, including the formation and dissociation of ion pairs. The research products also serve as guides for the rational design of the lithium salt solutions in applications, such as electrochemical storage systems.

Servers store information, permit computing resource sharing, connect fax machines and printers over networks, support digital video and audio file streaming, and much more. Physically, a server may be a large single device or a collection of such devices that run continuously without direct user input. At the other end of the scale are small servers, computers that connect a network of users for a particular purpose, such as a private email server. Server location, ownership, and operation are critical to the privacy and security of the data they hold. But despite being indispensable, servers work in the background of our lives and remain essentially distant and hidden for the average user. In the research supported by this award, which trains a graduate student in methods of conducting empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, the researcher investigates how users understand this ""invisible"" but indispensable technology, and how that understanding affects how users actively relate to, interact with, and protect the servers on which they depend. The research is important for social scientists wanting to understand how ideas of time and place are changed by modern technologies, as well as for policy makers concerned to understand technology's political and social effects.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted by University of California, Irvine, anthropology doctoral student Evan Conaway, who is supervised by Dr. Tom Boellstorff.  Because there is such a wide diversity of server types and users, the researcher has chosen to focus on the servers used by one particular user community. This will allow him to study the issues in greater depth than would be possible if he attempted to cover all servers and all users. The community he has chosen are those who employ servers for role-taking activities. The researcher will explore how and to what extent a regionally stratified sample of these users experience servers as places in and of themselves; as machines for the storage and practice of memory; and as meaningful cultural objects. He will further examine how those experiences affect how the users deploy servers as well as how they understand time, place, and property.  Mr. Conaway will conduct twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork with three groups connected not by a direct network of interest, but by this common engagement with servers. He will collect data through participant observation, interviews, surveys, and archival research. Findings from the research will address debates and controversies around the location of internet infrastructure, data ownership and security, and emerging issues in intellectual property law.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The atmosphere can be an important source of material from rain and from dust. In some parts of the oceans, input of elements such as iron from dust (and possibly rain) can play an important role in stimulating the growth of phytoplankton, the base of the marine food chain. This study will involve collection and analysis of a two-year time-series of filtered air samples from two locations in the subarctic North Pacific, aimed at understanding the inputs of metals to the ocean surface from Alaskan and Asian dust and from fossil fuel combustion. The dust time series observations and analyses proposed will provide insight that will aid the interpretation of observations from the 2018 U.S. GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect expedition. This project will support a graduate student for two years and will be the basis of his or her Ph.D. research.<br/><br/>The investigators will collect atmospheric dust samples from two land-based locations well suited to capture the flux to surface waters of the subarctic North Pacific. One is on the northern side of the Aleutian chain, and the second is an island to the northeast (Middleton Island), at the shelf break, in the northern Gulf of Alaska. Sampling will be carried out year round at Middleton Island using an automated sampling system, while high-volume sampling will be carried out for one month at each of the two locations during targeted known seasonal events. These will help infer and characterize inputs from Asian dust, known to occur primarily in the spring, and from Alaskan dust, known to occur primarily in the autumn. Samples from large events will be made available to the GEOTRACES research community for analyses. The HYSPLIT model will be used to simulate dust transport and deposition, for comparison to observations. Previous work documents substantial interannual variability in dust fluxes from Alaska and from Asia, and volcanic ash input is even more variable. Given the seasonality and interannual and spatial variability of the dust sources, and the short residence time of Fe and other trace elements and isotopes in surface waters, this history of deposition from dust and fossil fuel combustion, and its geochemical characterization, will help to distinguish the various inputs more comprehensively than is possible with a single research cruise.&#8232;A variety of size fractions will be collected and analyzed to infer the particle size range that contains each of the metals. Analyses will be carried out on over twenty elements, including Fe, Al, the REE, the isotopes of Pb, Sr and Nd (the tracers that best distinguish the dust source end members), and metals including V and Ag to infer contributions from fossil fuel combustion. Activities in air of the natural radionuclides lead-210 and beryllium-7, and their depositional fluxes, will be determined to convert elemental concentrations in dust into flux estimates to surface waters. Experiments will evaluate the control of different organic ligands on the solubility of iron and other metals in surface seawater, the relative solubility of different size fractions, and the relative solubility of dust- versus fossil fuel-derived metals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural language interfaces open new opportunities for non-expert users to control complex systems and increase the accessibility of current systems. However, existing methods are limited in expressivity and, more often than not, disappoint users. This Faculty Early Career Development Grant will fundamentally transform how this problem is addressed, and provide new avenues to build systems with robust natural language understanding and ability to improve and learn through interaction with users. The project's five-year goal of grounded language understanding directly connects to robotic agents and autonomous cars, and will enable new interdisciplinary applications and research directions.<br/><br/>The goal of the research program is to create a new framework for mapping natural language instructions to actions. Instead of taking a modular approach, this work adopts a single-model view, where input text and raw visual observations are directly mapped to actions. While the approach includes components that can be trained and re-used separately, it does not require any intermediate symbolic representation, and does away with the need for different types of training data, as required to train conventional modular systems. The five-year goal of this project is a continuously learning reflective autonomous agent following natural language instructions in realistic environments.

Coastal erosion and land loss is threatening many sections of the U.S. coastlines and coastal communities.  Extreme events such as hurricanes driving storm waves and surges, as well as sea level rise are accelerating coastal erosion.  The prediction and assessment of coastal erosion has advanced significantly over the last decades.  However, significant knowledge gaps exist with regard to the characterization and mechanics of impacted coastal soils.  This award supports fundamental research to advance the understanding of soil behavior in response to waves, currents, tides, and associated morphodynamics in the coastal zone.  This knowledge will contribute to the improvement of the prediction, assessment and mitigation of coastal erosion and stability of coastal infrastructure.  The award involves several disciplines including geotechnical engineering, coastal sciences and engineering, geophysics, and oceanography.  The multi-disciplinary approach will feature field and laboratory experiments.  The education plan includes a field research experience for freshman undergraduates with an emphasis on students from low-income backgrounds.  It also includes an adult education program to educate the public about risks to coastal infrastructure associated with sea level rise, coastal inundation and erosion.  The education plan will help to train a new generation of coastal and geotechnical engineers, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in civil engineering, and raise public awareness for risks associated to sea level rise, coastal inundation and erosion, and is aligned with NSF INCLUDES.<br/><br/>The role of geotechnical soil behavior for coastal erosion processes is still not fully understood, mostly resulting from a lack of geotechnical data in coastal areas affected by energetic hydrodynamics and morphodynamics.  This research is to fill this knowledge gap by: 1) measuring sediment strength and pore pressure of coastal and nearshore sediments under hydrodynamic forcing and morphodynamics, 2) testing a new formulation of the Shields parameter integrating shear strength and pore pressure, and 3) investigating the impact of variations of geotechnical soil parameters in coastal areas on erodibility during inundation and flood events.  The research objectives will be achieved through multi-disciplinary field and laboratory testing programs, enabling simultaneous observations of geotechnical parameters, morphodynamics, and hydrodynamics.  The knowledge gained will contribute to improving the understanding of the interaction between soil mechanics and subaqueous sediment transport processes, as well as to the improvement of current prediction methods for coastal erosion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The success of deep learning has attracted significant research interest from hardware and software communities to improve training speed and efficiency. Despite the great efforts and rapid progress made, one important bridge to connect software and hardware support with deep learning domain knowledge is still missing: efficient configuration exploration and runtime scheduling. Both the quality of deep learning models and the training time are very sensitive to many adjustable parameters that are set before and during the training process, including the hyperparameter configurations (such as learning rate, momentum, number and size of hidden layers) and system configurations (such as thread parallelism, model parallelism, and data parallelism). Efficient exploration of hyperparameter configurations and judicious selection of system configurations is of great importance to find high-quality models with affordable time and cost. This is however a challenging problem due to a huge search space, expensive training runtime, sparsity of good configurations, and scarcity of time and resources.<br/><br/>The objective of this research work is to systematically study the unique properties of deep learning systems and workloads, and establish new modeling and scheduling methodologies for improving deep learning training. The PI aims to improve the efficiency of discovering high performing models through a dynamic scheduling methodology driven by a novel hyperparameter configuration classification approach. The PI aims at developing an accuracy- and efficiency-aware hybrid scheduling methodology that makes judicious scheduling decisions based on a global view of both the time dimension (accuracy potential) and spatial dimension (efficiency potential) information. This research work integrates techniques in workload characterization, performance modeling, resource management, and scheduling to dramatically speedup the training process while significantly reducing the cost in time and resources. More broadly, this project will gain foundational knowledge about the interaction between software-hardware support and deep learning domain knowledge. This knowledge can help design next generation deep learning systems and frameworks, making deep learning training handy for researchers and practitioners with limited system and machine learning domain expertise. This research will help enhance curriculum and provide research topics for both undergraduate and graduate students, especially students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The outcomes of this research effort are expected to improve the state of the art in defenses against advanced exploits, and achieve substantial practical impact by shielding existing vulnerable applications against exploitation, benefiting both end users and security researchers.

This CAREER project aims to investigate new high thermal conductivity materials and understand the fundamental transport phenomena and mechanisms associated with the chemistry and structures of such materials. The PI is using complementary approaches, including multiscale modeling, advanced synthesis and characterization methods. These less explored materials are theoretically predicted to offer new paradigms to enable advanced electronics, optoelectronics, thermal energy conversion and management. The research components of this project are closely integrated with various education and outreach activities, offering cross-disciplinary training beyond traditional educational boundaries, and involving the participation of underrepresented and diversity groups. This is accomplished through industry-academia collaborations, development of a new interdisciplinary course curriculum, and establishment of a Nano-Energy outreach program.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The principal investigator and his research team are investigating a new class of high thermal conductivity materials (such as BAs, BP, GeC) to address the critical challenge of heat dissipation in modern electronics and photonics. Some of these unique materials have been predicted recently by ab initio theory to have ultrahigh thermal conductivity, over 1000 W/mK, enabled by multiple factors, including a large mass ratio of the constitutive atoms, acoustic bunching, and isotopic purity. This CAREER project aims to experimentally realize these high thermal conductivity materials through a synergistic growth-measurement-model approach to investigate the optimum growth conditions, structural and thermal properties, and phonon transport mechanisms. The team develops new characterization tools, including advanced phonon spectral mapping spectroscopy based on the time-domain thermoreflectance technique, and advanced atomic-level material structural control methods, to establish detailed structure-property relationships with microscale quantification. Experimental measurement results including phonon mean free path spectra are analyzed using atomistic density functional theory and multiscale Boltzmann transport equations solved by Monte Carlo simulations. Completion of this project may lead to transformative technological innovations for advancing the performance and energy-efficiency of future electronics and photonics. In addition, the multidisciplinary research components are closely integrated with various education and outreach activities with graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, involving students from underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the simple answer to this question is yes, how this happens turns out to be quite complex. On the one hand, there is evidence that mental health problems and patterns often emerge in similar ways across the world. Therefore, the psychiatric sciences argue for the use of diagnostic categories that are broadly applicable. On the other hand, anthropological research has found that mental illness manifests differently in different places, reflecting the social and cultural environment in which it is embedded. As researchers, policy-makers, and service users debate how social systems should best provide care for those who experience mental health crises, it is important to understand how such experiences are connected to social and cultural surroundings in order to assure that care is appropriate and effective.  This is particularly important to contain costs. The market-based health care policies, medication-centered treatment plans, and dependence on hospital emergency rooms that are characteristic of mental health care in much of the Western world are costly and not always effective. As these approaches spread to other parts of the globe, it is urgent to know what works, what does not, and why. <br/><br/>These questions will be addressed in the research supported by this award.  Washington University  St. Louis anthropology doctoral candidate, Lauren Cubellis, with the guidance of Dr. Rebecca Lester,  will investigate the idea that the experience of mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, is a complex interplay of multiple factors: heritable risk, traumatic history, social and economic context, and individual social relationships and resources. The researcher began her invesigation in New York City and with this award will extend it Berlin, Germany, which will allow her to understand the effects of cultural context on mental health and treatment outcomes. Berlin is a particularly apt site because German reunification has created a cultural context that markedly increases stress for some residents but not for others, offering a scientifically useful lens for comparison. The research will be conducted in a clinic that offers an option for care designed to reduce the numbers of people admitted to the psychiatric emergency room each year, and to improve the quality of life for people living with the symptoms of severe mental illness. Data will be collected with a mixed-methods approach, including participant observation, personal and professional history narratives, interviews, and archival research. These data will allow her to determine why this treatment model has been adopted in Berlin, how it relates to the history of Berlin as a fundamental center of psychiatric thought and knowledge production, and its potential spread as a plausible treatment option throughout Germany, Northern Europe, and the United States. Findings from the research will illuminate the role of history and socio-cultural context in the development and treatment of an apparently universal mental health syndrome. At the same time, it will provide information on a particular treatment model that may reduce costs and improve quality of life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One class of these is shape-shifting materials that have the capacity to alter their shape in a desired manner.  Such shape-shifting materials have the potential for implementation in the fields of artificial muscles, soft robotics, self-deploying devices, smart windows, self-healing materials, adhesives, and many other areas.  The materials developed here combine the benefits of (a) liquid crystalline elastomers (which are highly deformable polymeric materials that reversibly change shape upon heating) and (b)light-activated chemical changes in the material that enable it to be reshaped, healed, and realigned at will.  The overall scope of the project seeks to understand the underlying relationships between the molecular structure of the materials and their remarkable properties and performance, and subsequently use that knowledge to design improved approaches and molecular structures for such smart materials.   In addition to advances in technology, this project will also contribute to the development of a ""bootcamp"" in the recently formed PhD degree program in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Colorado with the express goal of bringing in students from diverse backgrounds that would not otherwise consider or be ready to enter a PhD program in materials science.  This program aims to recruit and train diverse personnel, comprising a large number of undergraduate and graduate students, in a powerful combination of chemical synthesis, materials science, and polymer chemistry.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Programming fully reversible, shape-shifting polymers presents a special challenge despite a large amount of promising work in this area. Liquid crystalline networks (LCNs) represent one of the most capable polymeric materials because they offer thermoreversible strain, programmable simply by directing molecular-scale alignment. Although the polymer network enables the translation of molecular order to shape, it is also inherently limiting when trying to program new or complex alignment. Here, light will be used as a stimulus for radical-mediated addition-fragmentation chain transfer (AFT) that causes a cascading dynamic covalent-bond exchange reaction to occur within the network.  Using this chemistry, readily reprogrammable shape-shifting materials will be explored with independent control over the LC phase shape, disordered shape, and the switching temperature.  <br/> 	The overall objective of this work is to further the understanding, accessibility, and implementation of AFT-based LCNs through chemical design in coordination with programming conditions to develop versatile, readily reprogrammable shape-shifting materials.  This work will focus on fundamental understanding of these smart materials and their design at both the macro- and nano-scale, including: i) determining fundamental formation-structure-property-programming relationships that will be used to develop a library of photopolymerizable, programmable LCNs,  ii) combining disparate material compositions, alignments and structures in macroscale materials to understand the impact of interfaces and gradients in composition and structure on the material actuation and response, and   iii) forming nano-scale structures through imprinting and holography to determine and understand the effects of feature size as compared to LC domain size on the bond-exchange process, its effectiveness, and the LC alignment. Each scientific direction is coupled to education and training of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The activities of genes direct the formation of tissues and organs but the proper shape, structure, and mechanical properties of the tissues are also guided by internal and external loading during development. It is known that abnormal tissue properties occur along with birth defects and cancer, but the extent that the abnormalities are genetic or occur from aberrant mechanical loads isn't known.  It remains poorly understood how the mechanical and genetic factors work together to build normal tissues. The research will build an improved understanding of the underlying causes of birth defects and cancer by separating genetic from mechanical effects in tissue development.  The work is an essential step toward the development of therapies to prevent or treat these diseases. The novel tools to control genetic expression and internal cell loading may also enable new strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, contributing to the progress of science and to the advancement of national health.

In healthy cells, many chemical reactions take place all the time.  Scientists think of these reactions as forming a network, like a wiring diagram, with connecting wires describing the movement of nutrients and metabolites through a cell's chemical reactions.  Knowing the entire wiring diagram is not necessary for understanding the fate of individual nutrients, but the many interconnected circuits make it difficult to isolate only the part of the diagram important for certain activities, such as maintaining iron levels. This research will use mathematical techniques (specifically, algebraic geometry and dynamical systems) to find the simplest components in a reaction network that allow a cell to exhibit observed behaviors.

Complementing the research projects will be educational activities centered around a Directed Reading Program in which undergraduate students will gain experience reading and presenting mathematics with the help of graduate-student mentors.<br/><br/>The dynamics observed in living systems is much more than the sum of its parts.  Systems biology, therefore, seeks to understand how biological components come together to generate emergent, systems-level behavior.

Accordingly, this project will develop a theory of reaction systems tailored to biological networks.  The investigator will build on her recent work that has helped clarify how bistability and other phenomena emerge in real-life systems.  The aims here are to discover new criteria for multistationarity in reaction systems, and to answer the question of when Hopf bifurcations are preserved when new components are added to a network.  These results will be used to answer important biological questions pertaining to how cells process information and how iron levels are maintained within cells.  Specifically, the aims are to investigate the capacity for bistability and oscillations in phosphorylation networks, and to determine which components of iron-trafficking networks keep cellular-iron levels tightly regulated.

This research will generate these insights through the design, development, and systematic evaluation of a tool for designing smart textiles. Smart textiles combine age-old processes of knitting and weaving with advances in fiber-based smart materials to create soft and flexible circuits for a wide range of applications. To date, smart textiles have been designed to do things like harvest energy from body movement or integrate the display and sensing capacities of a smartphone on the sleeve of one's shirt. While initial advances in smart textiles reveal their potential to significantly benefit society, the difficulty of prototyping smart textiles is limiting innovation in this nascent but transformational design space.<br/><br/>This research will support innovation in smart textiles and advance the state of the art in computer-aided design and fabrication by synthesizing the workflows of textile and circuit design. Developing the prototyping tool will require the following: (1) developing computational representations of smart textiles; (2) developing and evaluating novel techniques for bridging textile and circuit design, and (3) studying the unique forms of expressivity and engagement that emerge from the tool. In the process, this research will produce a set of generalizable data structures and user interface techniques to support broad audiences in designing and fabricating smart textiles. Additionally, the insights this research will produce on new forms of expression and engagement that emerge from combining computation and craft are necessary to further ubiquitous computing research, which seeks to integrate technology into the rich material landscapes that characterize everyday life. While many will benefit from exploring the applicability of smart textiles in their lives and work, prior research suggests that the practices this research will make possible are likely to resonate with under-represented groups in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A polymer known to dramatically change properties, like the ability to dissolve in water, in response to a small change in an external stimulus, such as temperature and pH, has been selected for detailed investigation. By changing the structure of this polymer to create comb-like of bottlebrush-like molecular architectures from this core polymer and to add chemically distinct segments, it is expected that new polymeric materials will be generated with unique properties both in solution and in thin films. The properties of these polymeric materials can be tailored for potential applications with benefit to society such as polymers for water purification and better targeted and customized drug delivery. These materials will be prepared using a more environmentally benign synthetic approach. New knowledge generated from this work will be shared with a broad scientific audience through publications, presentations, and incorporation into the undergraduate curriculum, and to more general audiences through community and K-12 outreach presentations.

The stimuli-responsive functionality results in dramatic changes in properties, such as solubility, viscosity, viscoelasticity, interfacial activity, and self-assembly, with a small change in external stimuli. Branched and block copolymer structures affect polymer properties including polymer conformation, chain entanglement behavior, self-assembly, and rheological responses. Stimuli-responsive copolymers with block and branched architectures will be synthesized using the more environmentally benign activator regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET ATRP). The pH- and thermo-responsive poly((2-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) has been selected as the primary stimuli-responsive polymer under investigation because it changes solubility and conformation in response to changes in both temperature and pH. The stimuli-responsive functionality of PDMAEMA will be combined with block and branched copolymer architectures in order to generate new materials with expected unique solution and thin film properties. These materials have potential applications in photonics, drug delivery, and viscosity modifiers, including applications that have benefit to society such as polymer membranes for water purification and more tailored drug delivery systems. Undergraduate student research collaborators will fully participate in this immersive high impact experience of undergraduate research.

To meet this increased demand for highly skilled manufacturing technicians, community college manufacturing programs must evolve to meet these changing industry environments and attract a wide diversity of students. Women have traditionally been greatly underrepresented in manufacturing careers, but they represent the largest pool of untapped talent needed to address the manufacturing skills gap threatening America. Working collaboratively with industry partners and building on research findings that identified reasons why many women are not interested in manufacturing careers, this project at Rowan-Cabarrus Community College (RCCC) in North Carolina will create the Women in Engineering and Industrial Technologies (WE IT) program. The program will utilize the strong partnership between the college, three K-12 school districts, and the more than 35 partner employers of the North Carolina Manufacturing Institute to develop a replicable model to increase interest among women in engineering and industrial technology programs. It has been informed by and builds on effective practices designed to increase of involvement of women that include, but are not limited to, the Institute for Women in Trades, Technology and Science (IWITTS), National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity (NAPE), the Dream It, Do It campaign launched by the Manufacturing Institute, and the Asheville Buncombe Community College ATE Women in Technology program. Program evaluation will monitor progress and determine the most effective practices. Project results will be disseminated through TeachingTechnicians.org, NC-NET (an online source for the 58 community colleges in NC), and presentations at regional and national conferences.<br/><br/>To accomplish the goal of increasing enrollment of women in college engineering and industrial technology programs, the project will focus on changing perceptions of both potential students and career influencers (i.e. parents, counselors, advisors, teachers, faculty and administrators). Career influencers will take part in industry tours and Taste of Industry events held on the College campus, and a combination of faculty and staff will present to the district-wide Parent-Teachers Association (PTA). Potential students will be targeted through a variety of programs including an Industry Speaks series for high school students and an internal awareness campaign focused on current Rowan-Cabarrus students. Each semester at least 15 sections of college English will include exploration of technical careers. The second goal of the project is to increase completion rates among women in these programs. Women enrolled in these programs will have the opportunity to be WE IT Ambassadors, participate in the WE IT Navigators group, and have open lab events. The WE IT program will also provide increased partnerships and communication networks between faculty/staff, students, parents, administrators and industry allowing this program to be institutionalized by leveraging resources available to each partner. The three K-12 school districts play a vital role in the program, and the Career and Technical Education (CTE) Director from each district is committed to sustained, active participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Against the well-documented decline of the traditional American farm, the emergent alternative agriculture sector offers a potentially promising solution. But alternative farmers, the short-commodity-chain producers that have proliferated in the past two decades in the United States, frequently find that a lack of knowledge and farm management skill is an enormous obstacle to running a sustainable operation. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, will study how differing skilling institutions for alternative agriculture are used by farmers to develop, exchange, and apply knowledge necessary for alternative agriculture. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means for improving American agricultural development.<br/><br/>Bradley Jones, under the supervision of Dr. Glenn Stone of Washington University, will explore how farmers invested in smaller-scale alternative agriculture navigate skilling institutions (the institutions through which agricultural management information is disseminated) to create and sustain viable farming operations. The investigator will comparatively study the emerging landscape of knowledge production and exchange in Central Appalachia and the Hudson Valley of New York. Both regions have seen recent dramatic increases in the number of alternative farmers but have important demographic, historical, economic, and environmental differences that offer unique challenges and opportunities. The study asks: How do alternative farmers construct and engage with institutions to acquire agricultural skill?  How do institutions mediate flows of information and knowledge transmission?  What actors are involved and how do they operate in relation to one another and broader structures of power? Answering these questions has important implications for both our substantive understanding of alternative farmers and their skilling strategies, as well as our broader theoretical understandings of the way institutions are formed and used by individuals to fulfill socially determined needs and to reorient the social relations of production and expertise. Data will be collected from farmers, agricultural experts, and program staff at a variety of sites including alternative farms, beginning farmer training programs, and non-profit food and agriculture advocacy organizations, as well as at an array of training events, farm conferences, and seminars. This study of knowledge development and dissemination responds to a practical need to better understand how alternative farmers are navigating a major challenge in their long-term economic and ecological sustainability. In both study regions, summaries of the results will be provided to various stakeholders, including farmers, advocacy organizations, agricultural extension, and policy makers so strategies can be developed for mitigating obstacles to farmer success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neil Duncan and John Walker, of the University of Central Florida, will undertake research in the tropical savanna known as the Llanos de Mojos (or Mojos) in the southwestern Amazon of Bolivia to better understand the relationship of plant and landscape domestication by precolumbian farmers. Mojos has been identified as a primary center of domestication for manioc, also known as cassava, one of the world's most important crops, which today feeds hundreds of millions of people. In addition, other important crops such as peanuts, squash, chili peppers, and lesser known tropical cultivars, such as peach palm, achiote, and cocoyam, may also have been domesticated in this region. Precolumbian societies developed sophisticated agricultural systems resulting in permanent changes to the landscape, in essence these societies domesticated the landscape along with a diverse suite of crops. These domesticated landscapes include forest islands and raised fields built over several thousand years. Archaeological data from Mojos can contribute to modern agricultural development through an understanding of how densely populated precolumbian societies were able to produce food on seasonally flooded tropical savanna in a way that was sustained for hundreds of years. The interdisciplinary research team will include students from the University of Central Florida and will work with archaeologists and students in Bolivia. In addition to generating data that may benefit agricultural development within and beyond Mojos, this project will work to enhance education and training for students and develop international cooperation between scientists and students in the US, UK, and Bolivia. <br/><br/>The investigators, in collaboration with a paleoecologist from Northumbria University (United Kingdom), will use strategic landscape sampling, subsurface cores of lakes and wetlands, and stratigraphic excavation of both forest island habitations and raised fields in the Llanos de Mojos of southwestern Bolivia to obtain complementary datasets that will be used to reconstruct and analyze the long-term agricultural history of Mojos. This research uses palaeoethnobotany and landscape archaeology to define the history of combined plant and landscape domestication in Mojos. They propose that cultivation and adoption of specific crops, such as manioc and maize, drove the domestication of these landscapes through altered fire regimes, the development of raised field agriculture and clearance of gallery forests. Forest islands were inhabited by both farmers and cultivated plants. Later, raised fields were built to improve conditions for a wide range of plants. It is suggested that raised fields added flexibility to these agricultural systems allowing more plants to be grown in more places throughout the year.<br/><br/>This award is made possible by the SBE-RCUK Lead Agency Agreement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polyelectrolytes with opposite charges associate with each other, yielding versatile, soft solids suited for use as adhesives, medical dressings, membranes for purification, carriers for controlled drug release, and scaffolds for cell culture. These so-called ""polyelectrolyte complexes"" have also been discovered as membrane-less organelles within cells. Despite the promise and prevalence of polyelectrolyte complexes, it is not known why some combinations of polyelectrolytes make strong, rubbery materials while other combinations produce viscous fluids. This project will investigate broadly the fundamental relationships between the composition of individual polyelectrolytes and the properties of the hydrated complexes they form. This understanding will guide the design and application of known and new materials for new technologies. An emphasis on chemistry student education and training, including broadening participation in STEM, will expose participants to the latest ideas, techniques and problem-solving tools to better serve the flourishing polymers industry. Student participation in high-value video tutorials on aspects of polyelectrolytes will reach a broad audience of scientists and will help build professional presentation skills of young trainees involved. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>A number of interesting and useful amorphous phases spontaneously assemble when polyelectrolytes of opposite charge, Pol+ and Pol-, are mixed. However, little is known concerning why different combinations of Pol+ and Pol- have substantially different association strengths. This work will quantitatively and systematically probe the dependence of Pol+/Pol- association on ""hydrophobicity,"" or water content. Using robust synthetic methods, a series of increasingly hydrophobic cationic and anionic polymers will be prepared and complexed. The free energy of association will be determined by measuring, using sensitive radioisotope or spectroscopic methods, how easily Pol+Pol- ion pairs are broken by the addition of salt. At the same time, the amount of water in the complex will be determined with infrared spectroscopy. The results will correlate the strength of association to water content and number of methylene units added to enhance hydrophobicity. Complex formation between charged polypeptides will reveal the association strength of an ion pair or ""salt bridge"" formed between two amino acids. The fundamental insights resulting from the project will also impact the biological/health field since charged segment pairing of proteins is essential in protein folding (or misfolding). In a final thrust on polyelectrolyte interactions, the pairing strength between a polyelectrolyte and a nanoparticle of defined surface composition will be measured. The exceptional educational resources available at Florida State University's GEOSET studios will be employed to enhance the professional development of undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduates, in particular women chemists, will be recruited through the University's undergrad research program and will be mentored in science and presentation skills. Building on previous successes within the research group, graduate students will collaborate to produce several informative, competitive, well-edited educational videos on polyelectrolytes and polyelectrolyte complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Why does ECS remain stubbornly segregated when it comes to gender parity? The goal of this CAREER project is to use ethnography to compare subfields of ECS in which women have different levels of participation. It investigates the relationship between cultural values, norms and practices that 1) presume practitioners from dominant groups are more competent than practitioners from underrepresented groups; and 2) privilege the technical dimensions of computing over the social ones. The uneven participation of women across ECS subfields suggests that subfield cultural values and norms vary. To examine this variation, this project focuses primarily on the experiences of female faculty members because they are a critical population that shape the next generation of ECS practitioners, have a long-standing relationships with their disciplinary subfields, and may have experiences that could lend critical insights into the social/technical divide. The project's findings articulate and forge pathways toward broadening participation in ECS because they inform learning modules and course curricula to educate students, faculty, and leaders in academia about the benefits of diversity and transformations required to foster welcoming environments for women to participate in ECS with equal opportunities, resources and regard. Due to the prominence and impact of ECS, identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identities. Harnessing the power of diversity in this way will positively contribute to all domains on which computing impinges.<br/><br/>This CAREER project is a comparative analysis of the impact of subfield culture on women's representation in ECS. It deconstructs theoretical assumptions undergirding ECS practices to understand how complex, intersectional biases disenfranchise women from the field. To yield new knowledge useful in efforts to broaden participation, this CAREER project systematically conceptualizes how labor segregation may relate to an ideological hierarchy between the social and technical dimensions of computing and influence cultural exclusions along intersecting vectors of gender and race. Using a theory-driven, interdisciplinary research approach that integrates gender and racial equity research, anthropology and science and technology studies, this CAREER project works to: 1) Develop and refine a theoretical model of change in ECS to combat the covert and overt mechanisms that marginalize women; 2) Describe and analyze epistemic bias emerging from ideologies that consider empirical data superior to qualitative data and trivialize socially applied research in ECS; 3) Identify and assess elements of culture in ECS that reproduce or challenge inequitable power relations; 4) Describe women's differential experiences in ECS subfields along vectors of race, ethnicity, and gender identity; 5) Develop and analyze educational interventions into ECS culture that spring from an original method integrating ethnography and case study methods to both interrupt the reproduction of dominant class rule and to study the beliefs and power relations of computing communities. Not only does this project contribute a novel qualitative theory of cultural change in ECS, it also tests innovative methods to better elucidate who and what counts in the field and why. Further, it creates highly adaptable and sustainable techniques that provide opportunities for engineers to practice recognizing and responding to bias in social dynamics and articulating means of institutional change in communion with their peers. Finally, this project provides much needed anthropological theory to the problem of women's underrepresentation in ECS to advance inclusive educational practices that support and capitalize on the aptitudes of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By analyzing the role and consequences of these pretrial diversion programs, this project will contribute to knowledge about the impacts of the contemporary criminal justice system. It also will provide information to policymakers, legal practitioners, and the public as they determine the role that pretrial diversion should play in criminal justice reform efforts and in the provision of mental healthcare.<br/> <br/>Despite the growing popularity of pretrial diversion programs across the U.S., little sociological research has yet examined their impacts. This research draws on national and local datasets, document analysis, an original survey experiment, participant observation, and interviews with attorneys, defendants, and therapists to illuminate the consequences of diversion nationally and to explore variation between programs.  Three questions are addressed: 1) how effective diversion is as a tool to promote decarceration; 2) what the implications of diversion are for social inequality; and 3) what effects diversion has on the lives of defendants.  Findings will contribute to scholarship on contemporary U.S. criminal justice system reform and on the consequences of using the court system to provide mental health treatment. In addition, this research will provide empirical information to jurisdictions seeking to expand diversionary options or to design new programs, to policymakers in search of effective criminal justice alternatives, and to groups involved in advocating for penal reform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Crystallization as a materials processing technique is widely used in today's industry to manufacture fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. However, in polymer engineering, the utilization of crystallization for processing purposes is limited because it is challenging to control polymer crystallization and even more difficult to grow polymer single crystals. Recent work demonstrated that polymer single crystals-based two dimensional polymers and hybrids have great potential in applications such as nanoparticle synthesis and patterning, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, artificial nanomotors and catalyst support. Uniform, functional, and controllable two-dimensional polymer single crystals must be produced at large scale for principal commercial applications, which is a major challenge to the community. This project develops two processing platforms called continuous evaporative solution crystallization and evaporative interface crystallization to produce these polymer crystals meet this challenge. The educational component of the project includes developing class modules, mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, and involving high school students in the research activities.    <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is developing a versatile processing approach to synthesize polymer single crystal-based, two dimensional polymers and hybrids.

These hybrid metal-ceramic materials form layers on the atomistic scale, much like pieces of paper stacked together, which allows the layers to locally kink instead of crack under load.  This kinking behavior has only recently been discovered, yet if understood, has the potential to provide tougher, lighter and more damage-tolerant materials for our nation's aging energy, communication and transportation systems.  As a result, MAX phases will be investigated with varying stacking sequences and layer orientations across a variety of real-world loading conditions, including impact, and dynamic fatigue and fracture.  In addition, experimental techniques utilizing cutting edge high-speed imaging coupled with surface acceleration mapping under these complex-loading scenarios will be performed, that are able to extract more material behavior information than classical techniques.  These findings will provide meaningful input for predictive computational models in structural design leveraging MAX phases, as well as other similar advanced materials. This work brings together multidisciplinary efforts in materials science, and applied and theoretical mechanics. Novel means to reach untapped local communities at all ages will be enabled through a dance-mechanics education and outreach program. The research and outreach components highlight the innate creativity and correlations involved in both, and aims to inspire the next generation of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) enthusiasts.  <br/><br/>This research focuses on an emerging class of materials, MAX phases, a family of layered hexagonal early transition-metal carbides and nitrides.  These materials exhibit a newly classified defect deformation mechanism termed ripplocations, a nanoscale buckling phenomena, which accommodates strain in a different manner than dislocation motion in plasticity or bond rupture in fracture, and leads to the formation of nonlinear kind bands (NKB) under load.  While a notable portion of the materials science community is examining these 3D layered solids, relatively little research exists pursuing their behavior on the meso- to continuum level.  This effort aims to fill that gap through three highly integrated experimental research foci.  The first characterizes deformation behavior varying strain rate and stress states, as well as layer orientation and stacking sequences, utilizing nonlinear buckling theory to determine the driving parameters in NKB formation. The second quantifies crack tip energetics in dynamic fracture leveraging a hybrid experimental-numerical scheme, as well as explores impact fatigue, extending the classic Paris Law for temporal effects.  The third pursues damage behavior, conducting inertial impact experiments exploiting the Grid Method and the Virtual Fields Method, an emerging inverse technique. The extensive investigations on MAX phases will shed light on competing ductile, pseudo-ductile and brittle deformation mechanisms across length and time scales, thus making a significant contribution towards systemically capturing, understanding and optimizing these unique layered solids. More broadly, the findings will help understand how anisotropic materials accommodate strain under complex loading conditions, and paves the way for specifically textured (defect engineered), functionally graded, and/or hierarchical material design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant questions remain about how turbulence alters flame behavior during instability. In particular, in high-performance engines, does the turbulence/flame interaction change the instability feedback mechanisms and do the present numerical models include the correct physics? The proposed work addresses these questions using a systematic experimental approach to examine various key aspects of combustion instability. Advanced laser diagnostics will be used to image the flowfield and the flame, unlocking the coupling between turbulence and the instability feedback loop. The PI will also work with many other early-career faculty to effectively disseminate the results of this research and enhance the educational experience of students. In particular, the PI will facilitate an online network of early-career researchers to share research and teaching materials. This will ease the transition into faculty careers and promote high-quality thermofluids education at universities across the United States.<br/><br/>The technical goal of the proposed work is to understand the impact of turbulence on three critical components of the thermoacoustic feedback loop: the hydrodynamic instability of the flowfield that determines the susceptibility of the flow to external disturbances; the coupling mechanisms that drive heat release rate oscillations; and the mechanism by which these disturbances create heat release rate oscillations in non-flamelet regimes. This systematic approach uses theory-based experimental design to probe the ways in which turbulence impacts flow stability, coupling-mechanism physics, and flame behavior within the framework of combustion instability. The overarching intellectual merit contribution will be made in the formulation of the combustion instability regime diagram that describes the behavior of flames during thermoacoustic instability over a range of operating conditions. In following this framework, this work will have significant impacts on fundamental understanding of turbulent flames and combustion instability, the ability to predict combustion instability in industry-relevant devices, and the PIs career development. The results of this work will also feed into the development, implementation, and dissemination of case studies for undergraduate and graduate audiences.

The goal of this research is to exploit various interactions between paramagnetic metal ions to develop new classes of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) that will feature improved performance, higher operating temperatures, and switchable magnetization dynamics.  These molecular materials have tremendous potential for next generation data storage and future spintronic devices.  This interdisciplinary project combines state-of-the-art techniques from inorganic, synthetic, computational, and physical chemistry to identify important fundamental design guidelines for novel SMM systems. The project is very well suited to holistically educate future scientists at all levels.  This project also involves the creation and development of new class modules at the highest level of education. Several outreach activities to high schools featuring underrepresented students in sciences are also part of the project. <br/><br/>Interactions of lanthanide (Ln) atoms with transition metal (TM) atoms result in hard bulk magnetic materials. Highly magnetic anisotropic Ln3+ ions are also commonly exploited for the study of slow magnetic relaxation in SMMs, which have attracted increased attention due to their potential application in information storage and spintronic devices. SMMs are characterized by a thermal energy barrier to magnetization reversal. However, only very limited information about the magnetic properties of molecular materials featuring direct Ln-TM bonds have been reported. Furthermore, Ln-TM bonded complexes are rare and fundamental questions concerning the nature of the bonding remain open. This project addresses these questions with the specific goal to develop next-generation SMMs. Synthetic strategies to access and study molecules that feature (1) direct Ln-TM bonds or (2) LnTM interactions will be developed. Focus is given to the study of magnetic properties at various timescales of these heterometallic Ln/TM complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There has been steady progress towards large paraphrase resources, and a significant increase in its applications: from information retrieval, information extraction, and natural language generation to IBM's Watson, Google's Knowledge Graph, and many more. This research aims to create better paraphrase acquisition techniques and larger scale semantic resources, which could be of great use in various natural language processing tasks and social media data analytics in social science, national security, and other related fields. One example of potential applications is text simplification, which automatically rephrases complex texts into simpler language for children or people with reading disabilities.<br/><br/>The technical innovation of this study focuses on joint modeling of word- and phrase-level alignments between sentence pairs to address the challenges of extracting semantic knowledge from informal data sources (such as social media), which exist in very large quantities rather than just formal sources, such as newswire as per previous work. The model design extends multiple instance learning via two methods, a graphical model and neural network, and can flexibly permit the exploration of different assumptions and models the importance of words or phrases. The modeling advancements can be generalized to other natural language understanding tasks, which require analyzing sentences based on word-level composition or word meaning in a given context, and natural language generation tasks that benefit from learning what words and phrases to remove or rephrase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The specific configuration under study consists of a single undulating fin running along the length of the vehicle, which controls both forward motion and directional maneuvers. The project will first use analytical, computational, and experimental studies to describe how the fin shape and motion relates to the movement of a single vessel. Those results will then be extended to cooperative groups of multiple vessels traveling in formation. Of particular interest are the ways in which formations can make full use of the control inputs available from each vessel's undulating fin to improve collective maneuverability and efficiency, and to alter far-field wake patterns. The results of the project will be applicable to other related undulating propulsion and control configurations. The development of these multi-agent underwater systems will benefit the nation scientifically and economically, by allowing efficient and versatile operation to explore for resources and perform oceanographic observations, with minimal disturbance to the underwater environment. These systems will also be important to the nation's defense, due to their ability to travel long distances, perform multiple simultaneous independent tasks, and control their acoustic signature. Groups underrepresented in engineering -- in particular Hispanic students -- will be recruited for this project, thus increasing the diversity of the engineering student body and the future US workforce.   <br/><br/>This research project will investigate a class of undulating fin underwater vehicles, both singly and collectively, leading to understanding of how hydrodynamic interactions affect the speed, wake signature, energy efficiency, and maneuverability of the vessels and the formation.

The objectives of the research program include (i) measuring the dynamics and wake of single and multiple vessels; (ii) developing a dynamic model of the system; (iii) establishing a control model relating parameters in the fin kinematics to the motion of the vessel; (iv) studying the performance and hydrodynamic interaction of an array of bio-inspired underwater vessels.

To guarantee good performance for customers, cloud platforms usually provision resources dynamically in order to meet the demand of the fluctuating workload. Cloud providers also price their services dynamically to meet variable demand. Mobile workloads exhibit three distinct characteristics: geographic or spatial fluctuation, rapid changes characterized by a shorter time scale of fluctuation, and more frequent fluctuations, which make current resource provisioning approaches less effective. <br/><br/>The MOBILESCALE project proposes new research on resource management for mobile workload to address dual objectives of handling fluctuations and optimizing cost and performance by leveraging application-specific optimization approaches, acknowledging the cost anomalies of cloud transient servers, and unifying resources from multiple cloud providers.

This grant advances the processing of MXene nanostructures with different compositions and morphologies and their assembly into functional nanofilms. The grant will address the major research challenges associated with the production of MXenes and develop the processing techniques to form these into usable films as well as determine the resultant process-property relationships. A variety of MXenes are theoretically possible, but have yet to be experimentally obtained. MXenes exist as 2D sheets and extending their lateral dimension from nano-to-macro size remains challenging. This project will develop processing methodologies for producing MXenes with compositions and functional groups that have previously been impossible. The planned incorporation of these interesting materials into polymer composites would allow their integration into many coating technologies. The control over the material properties through manipulation of composition, shape, structure, and multi-layer architectures will allow an expansion of the range of their physical properties. The researchers and students will engage in multiple outreach efforts to foster education, research, diversity, and representation in materials science at the graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 levels, with the special focus on developing students entrepreneurship skills.  <br/><br/>The major current limitations in both MXene synthesis and processing and the underlying process-structure-property relationships at both the nano or individual nanosheet level and the macroscopic films and composites level will be investigated. These materials are derived from layered ceramics (i.e., MAX phases) and have a wide range of possible compositions and functional groups. The ""MX"" name refers to the M (transition metal) and X (typically carbon) in these layered structures; a common example includes Ti3C2Tx, where T stands for various terminal groups. The specific research tasks include the following: (1) The compositional space of existing MXenes will be extended by altering the composition of the parent MAX phase to achieve easy etching of A layers and by applying an electrochemical bias; (2) Capillary forces during spray drying will manipulate MXene morphology and create shelf-stable 3-D MXene particles; and (3) Properties and performance of macroscopic MXene-polymer structures created using layer-by-layer assembly as a function of MXene interlayer spacing and morphology will be determined. At each stage, MXene composition, functional groups, and architecture will be connected to the bulk mechanical and electrical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The HSZ displays marked changes in seismicity and plate-slip along its length: to the south the plates appear to be locked and have the capacity to generate great earthquakes whereas to the north the plates are creeping and regularly host episodic slow slip events and the occasional tsunami earthquake. The physical conditions controlling this contrast in plate coupling is not well understood. Recent investigations suggest fluids may play a critical role. To delineate whether fluids act as a primary control on the style of slip expressed along the HSZ, this study will use electromagnetic (EM) methods to image the electrical resistivity structure of the HSZ. Our measurements will provide important constraints on the hydrologic architecture by quantifying the along and across-strike variations in porosity and the fluid budget of the HSZ. This project will support a Ph.D. student and several graduate students, postdocs and early career scientists will be involved in the field work. The PI is an early career scientist who will gain valuable experience leading the field project and mentoring a graduate student. Additionally, a marine EM short-course will be given for students and unfunded collaborators to learn about marine EM theory, applications, data processing, and inverse modeling.<br/><br/>This project will use newly proven marine EM imaging technology to constrain the porosity and fluid budget of the crust and mantle along both segments of the HSZ. The survey cruise will deploy a grid of ocean-bottom EM receivers in a 400 km by 150 km area that spans the incoming plate and fore-arc margin. Magnetotelluric (MT) response functions will be estimated from the recorded electric and magnetic field time-series. In addition, controlled-source EM (CSEM) data will be recorded by deep towing a horizontal electric dipole transmitter near the seafloor along three trench-crossing transects located in the southern, central, and northern segments of the HSZ. The MT and CSEM data will be inverted for electrical resistivity and used to quantify the porosity structure across the margin. The HSZ resistivity results will be interpreted in conjunction with existing and planned geophysical and drilling data to test the hypothesis that along-strike variations in seismicity and interplate locking are related to the fluid budget of the incoming oceanic plate, fluid content along the plate interface, and upper plate permeability/porosity structure. The MT data will also image the electrical resistivity of the lithosphere and asthenosphere, providing independent constraints on the origin of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet this need, the ESIL Scholarship Program will enable scholarship recipients to complete internships at tribal and non-tribal government partners, and to participate in extracurricular activities designed to provide cross-cultural awareness in STEM, academic supports, and professional development. The ESIL Scholarship Program has the potential to produce valuable knowledge about: (1) how a university can promote equity for all students, and (2) how non-technical training in culture, professionalism, and communication can reduce barriers to retention in STEM programs (e.g., the perceived need to abandon one's cultural identity in favor of a new scientific dominant-culture identity). The ESIL Scholarship Program will conduct research on how to provide programming grounded in the viewpoint that cultural identity and scientific identity are symbiotic rather than exclusive. The research will be carried out via both quantitative and qualitative research methods.

It was submitted to the Discovery Research K-12 program, which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. The goal of this study will be to improve elementary science teaching and learning by developing, testing, and refining a framework and set of tools for strategically incorporating forms of uncertainty central to scientists' sense-making into students' empirical learning. The framework will rest on the notion that productive uncertainty should be carefully built into students' empirical learning experiences in order to support their engagement in scientific practices and understanding of disciplinary ideas. To re-conceptualize the role of empirical investigations, the study will focus on the transitions between the experiences and processes students seek to understand, classroom investigations, evidence, and explanatory models as opportunities for sense-making, and how uncertainty can be built into these transitions. The project's underlying assumption is that carefully implementing these forms of uncertainty will help curriculum developers and teachers avoid the oversimplified investigations that are prevalent in K-8 classrooms that stand in stark contrast to authentic science learning and the recommendations of the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council, 2012). Accordingly, the project will seek to develop curriculum design guidelines, teacher tools, professional development supports, and four elaborated investigations, including sets of lessons, videos, and assessments that embed productive uncertainty for second and fifth graders and designed for use with linguistically, culturally, and socio-economically diverse students. <br/><br/>The hypothesis of this work is that if specific forms of scientific uncertainty are carefully selected, and if teachers can implement these forms of uncertainty, elementary students will have more robust opportunities to develop disciplinary practices and ideas in ways consistent with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (Lead States, 2013). Employing Design-Based Research, the three research questions will be: (1) What opportunities for sense-making do elementary school empirical investigations afford where we might strategically build uncertainty?; (2) How can we design learning environments where uncertainty in empirical investigations supports opportunities for learning?; and (3) In classrooms with sustained opportunities to engage with uncertainty in empirical investigations, what progress do students make in content understandings and the practices of argumentation, explanation, and investigation? The work will consist of three design cycles: Design Cycle 1 will involve two small groups of six teachers in adapting their curricula to incorporate uncertainty, then describe how students engage around uncertainty in empirical investigations. Design Cycle 2 will involve the same small groups in implementing and refining task structures, tools, and teacher instructional strategies. In Design Cycle 3, teachers and researchers will further refine lesson materials, assessments, and supports. The project will partner with one school district and engage in design research with groups of teachers to develop: (1) a research-based description, with exemplars of opportunities for student sense-making within empirical investigations at both early and upper elementary grades; (2) a set of design principles and tools that allow teachers to elicit and capitalize on sense-making about uncertainty in investigations; and (3) four elementary investigations elaborated to incorporate and exemplify the first two products above. These materials will be disseminated through a website, and established networks for supporting implementation of the NGSS. An advisory board will oversee project progress and conduct both formative and summative evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has long been proposed that hotspots are the surface expression of mantle plumes, conduits of hot rock rising from the deep mantle.  Such conduits - albeit broader than expected - have recently been imaged by seismic tomography, and traced down to the core-mantle boundary under major hotspots under Hawaii and Iceland, for example. However, these plume images are still blurry, making it difficult to fully understand their role in the dynamics of the mantle, while the depth at which others originate, such as under Yellowstone, are still debated. A new methodology called ""full waveform tomography"", which aims at utilizing all the information contained in seismic records, is increasingly gaining interest in the global seismology and exploration geophysics community, as it holds the promise of obtaining sharper images of structures in particular in the deep mantle. However, such an approach is computationally very expensive, especially at the global scale, as the seismic wave propagation needs to be computed over very large distances and has to be performed many times during successive incremental updates of the image. A promising solution is ""box tomography"" whereby a target region of study is defined within the Earth's deep mantle and the complete wavefield from earthquake sources near the Earth's surface to distant recording stations is computed only once at the beginning, while successive updates of the model within the target region require wavefield computations only within the limits of the target region. We will implement this methodology and apply it to two targets of geophysical significance: (1) the Yellowstone plume and (2) the root of the Iceland plume near the core-mantle boundary, which has been shown to contain a patch of extreme material properties, which may indicate the presence of partially molten rock.  Broader impacts of this project include training of two graduate students in addition to providing a better understanding of mantle flow in Earth's deep mantle.<br/><br/>The existence of mantle plumes has long been debated. Broad conduits of pronounced low shear velocity have recently been imaged tomographically, extending from the core-mantle boundary through most of the lower mantle, in the vicinity of major hotspots such as Iceland, Hawaii, or the south-Pacific superswell volcanoes. Better characterizing the details of these plumes will help improve our understanding of the organization of upwelling flow in the deep earth, and the contrasted rheology between the lower 2000 km of the mantle and the extended upper mantle transition zone. Also, there may be different types of plumes, as may be the case for Yellowstone, where a broad lower mantle plume is not imaged. To address this, full waveform tomography based on numerical computations of the seismic wavefield is a promising tool, as it has the potential of improving tomographic resolution by exploiting the information contained in entire seismograms. However, to attain the higher frequencies necessary for pushing the limits of image resolution, a formidable challenge is the increasingly heavy computations involved. Also, not all regions of the earth are adequately illuminated by the present distribution of earthquakes and receivers to warrant much higher resolution than is achieved today. A promising solution is ""box tomography"", in which a target volume of limited extent is embedded in a global 3D Earth model, and the imaging is restricted to that smaller volume, leaving the model fixed outside of it. In many situations, both sources and receivers are located outside of this volume, presenting challenges for connecting wavefields to reconstruct complete seismograms. We have developed a ""box tomography"" methodology that allows arbitrary relative locations of sources, receivers and target volume, and can be applied with any wave equation integrator. A first application to continental scale upper mantle tomography with stations inside the target volume has been developed in north America. Here we plan to finish implementing the computation of the Green's functions necessary to extrapolate the wavefield from the target region to the external stations and to apply it to two targets of geophysical significance: (1) confirming the presence of a mantle plume in the mid-lower mantle beneath the Yellowstone hotspot, and improving its resolution; (2) improving the resolution of the structure at the base of the earth's mantle, within the root of the Iceland Plume, where a large axisymmetric ultra-low-velocity zone was recently documented, and comparing it to the structure at the base of what might be the lower mantle expression of the Yellowstone plume.  This project will train 2 students on state-of-the art seismological techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project is to train models to identify portions of speech utterances that are important to their being correctly identified by human listeners, and to use predictions from these models to make automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems more noise robust by focusing on those regions.  The ability to identify important regions of an utterance could significantly advance our understanding of healthy and impaired hearing.  Improvements in automatic speech recognition would have broader impacts on the 260 million Americans who use smart phones and the $100 billion ASR industry.  The educational portion of this project utilizes examples from speech, language, audio, and music processing to attract and retain students in Brooklyn College's introductory programming course serving a diverse student body along with similar efforts at affiliated high school programs.<br/><br/>The team's preliminary results have shown that that some regions of an utterance are more important or useful than others in identifying it by measuring the intelligibility of a given utterance in many different noisy mixtures.  This project expands upon these preliminary results in three ways.  First it measures ASR auditory importance using the team's existing slow but accurate technique involving random ""bubble noise"", comparing different ASR variants to each other and to human listeners.  Second, it trains a model to predict ASR auditory importance from clean speech using a novel architecture called the bubble cooperative network (BCN) that allows the recognizer to be trained jointly with the BCN to improve performance.  Third, it adapts the learned importance predictor to human listeners and uses this human-adapted importance predictor to further refine the ASR models.  These tasks should permit the use of utterance-level human responses to directly improve the noise robustness of automatic speech recognition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Normally, charged polymers are very flexible and do not have strong mechanical properties.  This project involves a solid material formed from a mixture of a very rigid and strong charged polymer (similar to Kevlar(R)) and an ionic liquid (also known as a molten salt).  This new material, which is called a molecular ionic composite (MIC), combines the best properties of solids and liquids.  MIC materials are stiff and non-flammable solids and yet they can conduct ions like lithium and sodium with very low resistance, as if the ions were in a liquid.  The properties of MICs can also be widely tailored for potential use in different applications such as water purifiers, electromechanical sensors, or artificial muscles.  This project will combine cutting edge research tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray analyses, materials science theories, and computational molecular simulations in order to build fundamental understanding of how MIC materials work.  By combining such interdisciplinary knowledge and insights, these researchers will work to create new designs for MIC materials for devices such as safer, cheaper, and more lightweight lithium batteries.   This project shows promise for feeding into advanced battery materials technology, thus enabling a potential new avenue for US business impact on the $20B global battery market.  Students and collaborators involved in this project will gain new knowledge about these novel polymeric conductors, and this new knowledge will be integrated into polymer science classes on the Virginia Tech campus and propagated to K-12 children and their parents in an educational outreach program based in Southwest Virginia. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project aims at a non-flammable solid with the modulus of poly(methyl methacrylate), but where a high density of ions inside move as if they were in a liquid.  It builds on the discovery of a new class of polymeric ion conductors that are termed molecular ionic composites (MICs).  The prototypical MICs, formed from a rigid-rod anion-containing polymer and an ionic liquid (IL), exhibit the following special combination of tunable properties: ionic conductivity up to 8 mS/cm, widely tunable elastic modulus (0.01&#8722;3 GPa), and thermal stability up to 300 degrees C.  MICs show promise for allowing use of metal electrodes in lithium and sodium batteries, potentially enabling higher energy density as well as battery operation over a wide temperature range and with inherent fire resistance.  While these materials display impressive properties, researchers are only beginning to understand the origins of why such fast ion transport is commensurate with such a stiff and robust material matrix.  This project combines fundamental polymer analyses involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray scattering, and microscopy with molecular dynamics simulations and theories of conduction and oriented matter.  Better understanding of the fundamental nature of MICs could feed into design of new compositions to meet desired requirements for battery electrolytes or other molecular separations applications.  Students and collaborators involved in this project will gain new knowledge about these novel polymeric conductors, and this new knowledge will be integrated into polymer science classes on the Virginia Tech campus and propagated to K-12 children and their parents in an educational outreach program based in Southwest Virginia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These toxic pollutants often end up in the sediment of lakes, rivers, estuaries and the ocean, along with combustion-derived air pollutants like soot and char called pyrogenic carbonaceous matter (PCM). PCM can mix and react with a chemical known as sulfide that naturally exists in many sediments. This project aims to understand how the interaction between PCM and sulfide can degrade halogenated pollutants naturally. The ultimate goal is to use the new understanding of these reactions generated from this research to produce inexpensive engineering solutions that will detoxify pollutants in the sediment and improve human and ecological health. In conjunction with this research initiative will be an educational outreach program targeted at underserved high-school students that will use 3D virtual reality modules and hands-on lab experiences to help students understand how pollutants enter the environment and how natural processes can promote their clean up. A technology-rich and inquiry-based instruction manual will also be developed and distributed to teachers through training workshops and online venues to more efficiently reach the public.<br/><br/>There is a pressing need to develop ecologically sound and economically feasible solutions to degrade toxic halogenated pollutants in the environment. These pollutants are found in existing contaminated sites and new halogenated pollutants continue to enter the environment. A recently published study by the PI demonstrates that PCM and sulfide together promote the abiotic degradation of DDT, a halogenated pollutant, which released lower toxicity products. This dehalogenation reaction represents a vast untapped resource for detoxifying pollutants as both PCM and sulfide are naturally occurring in sediment. Yet, due to the complexity that arises from the heterogeneity of the PCM system in the environment, the required conditions for dehalogenation are not understood. This project aims to define these conditions. The specific goals of this project are to: 1) isolate surface functionality, conductivity, and porosity from the complex properties of PCM by synthesizing PCM-like polymers as a model system; 2) characterize the mechanism for the PCM-dependent formation of surface-bound sulfur species using X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES); 3) understand how surfaces are involved in dehalogenating contaminants; and 4) investigate the long-term effectiveness of PCM-facilitated dehalogenation in environmental matrices. The results from this project will transform our current understanding of how halogenated pollutants are degraded in the environment by recognizing the abiotic dehalogenation capacities of naturally abundant environmental reagents. An in depth investigation of the speciation and distribution of sulfur species formed on PCM surfaces using XANES will allow for the discovery of a novel reaction pathway that can be harnessed to detoxify pollutants. Moreover, by identifying important PCM properties that are responsible for its reactivity, a new generation of carbon-based materials can be tailored to achieve simultaneous sorption and destruction of pollutants. This will revolutionize current remediation practices by utilizing these carbon-based materials. Lastly, this project will identify the chemical structures that are susceptible to natural breakdown by PCM and inform industry on sustainable chemical designs that minimize environmental impacts. The educational component of this project aims to engage students with diverse learning styles by incorporating innovative instructional strategies, such as developing 3D virtual reality learning modules and employing inquiry-based teaching. The PI will offer a four-week long program each year, entitled ?Water and Pollutants,? to engage high school students from inner city Philadelphia on current environmental issues and engineering solutions. In addition, teacher-training workshops will be organized in the 5th year to promote broader participation and help implement the developed activities into high school classrooms. This project will directly impact approximately 300 undergraduate students, 800 high school students, and 38 high school teachers through the teacher-training workshop.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Segments are typically tens to hundreds of kilometers long and form crust along their length but with decreased thickness toward the segment ends. Often the segments are offset from each other along shear zones called transform faults. The scars produced by transform faults, referred to as fracture zones, trace out the motion of the plates and are among the longest and most prominent features of ocean basins. The segmented nature of volcanic crustal production on seafloor spreading centers creates the large-scale structure of the seafloor and controls the way in which material from the shallow mantle flows, melts and is emplaced to form the layered oceanic crust that forms two-thirds of the surface of the Earth. Yet segmentation is a dynamic aspect of seafloor spreading and can evolve abruptly or progressively. Segments can form, grow, shorten or be eliminated by merging together with other segments. What controls this evolution has long been a subject of debate and controversy. Some models propose that large-scale variations in flow and temperature of the underlying mantle are important. Other models propose a predominant control by the motion of the tectonic plates themselves. This project will conduct a marine geophysical survey to examine what controls the formation, evolution and elimination of segmentation on the Reykjanes Ridge, a 1000-km-long seafloor spreading center in the North Atlantic Ocean south of Iceland. In order to study what may be controlling this evolution this project will map how the segments first formed following the abrupt change in plate motion and how they progressively re-merged to eliminate segmentation along the gradient in mantle melting away from Iceland. The project will support the training and education of a graduate student in the research and bring undergraduates and interns out on the research vessel for at sea experience and training. A movie will be made of the ridge segmentation evolution to help explain the processes involved in plate tectonics.<br/><br/>The Reykjanes Ridge is probably the best example of the systematic formation and elimination of segmentation and transform faults on Earth today. The project will survey two conjugate flank areas of the Reykjanes Ridge where segmentation and transform faults formed and were subsequently eliminated.  The survey will span the area from near the Iceland shelf in the north to the Bight Fracture Zone in the south, encompassing the prominent gradient in mantle melting away from Iceland.  The survey will use multibeam swaths and sub-bottom sonar profiles to map the tectonic and volcanic structure of the seafloor, towed magnetometer measurements to accurately map the magnetic lineations that date the crustal formation process, and ship gravimeter measurements to estimate crustal thickness changes. These data will be used to examine how variations in mantle melting and plate motion changes affect the formation, evolution and elimination of segmentation on mid-ocean ridges that frame the large-scale tectonic and crustal structure of entire ocean basins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The grant looks to develop new surface modification techniques, relying on atomic layer deposition (ALD) which can deposit sub-monolayer thick layers which serve as seeds to subsequently grow new structures three-dimensional structures at the nanoscale. These designed nanostructures are remarkably versatile. They can serve to improve the strength of polymer composites allowing for light-weight materials as well as impede corrosion on metal surfaces. This addresses critical needs, for example, in the transportation sector to improve fuel efficiency and vehicle performance, while maintaining safety. Beyond the direct impact on lightweighting, the scientific knowledge generated will provide an alternative design paradigm to the bottom-up design and manufacturing at the nanoscale. The educational goal is to promote public awareness of the importance of nanomaterials for the future of domestic manufacturing.  The educational plan integrates concepts of design and manufacturing, nanotechnology, and surface science across multiple levels, including a new 6th grade materials curriculum, integrating materials education into undergraduate student team mentorship, and promoting a more diverse STEM workforce through research demonstrations to encourage underrepresented students to apply to graduate school and participate in research.<br/><br/>Current manufacturing processes for controlling surface and interfacial structure in bulk structural materials suffer from poor control of geometric parameters such as feature size, shape, geometric orientation, which is particularly challenging within hierarchical assemblies of nanomaterials on non-planar surfaces. This lack of deterministic control of structure limits our ability to fundamentally understand how the nanostructuring produces specific material properties and a route to rationally design optimized structures to achieve application-specific properties. This project's effort addresses this limitation by quantitatively identifying the process-structure relationships needed to achieve deterministic control of interfacial geometry and composition at the nanoscale. The approach uses the concept of spatial ALD to generate sub-monolayer seeding areas for the growth of nanostructures through solution-based processes. The process can be repeated to develop three dimensional nanostructures on surfaces to precisely tune the interfacial geometry, composition, and microstructure of lightweight structural materials, and quantify the impact on their mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. An improved understanding of these process-structure relationships will provide the fundamental knowledge needed to ?encode? the manufacturing instructions for the controlled hierarchical assembly of nanoscale building blocks into surface architectures. This approach will be used to address two critical challenges in lightweight structural materials: 1) rational design of nanostructured interphases in polymer matrix composites to tune their mechanical properties, and 2) improving corrosion-resistance of magnesium alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Smith from the University of Akron to investigate lipid regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases. The surface of living cells is composed of a lipid membrane embedded with thousands of protein receptors. Dynamic associations between membrane proteins and lipids are integral to function, but resolving these interactions has proven to be extremely challenging. This project applies advanced fluorescence methods, and single-molecule imaging to measure lipid-protein interactions in biological membranes. The long-term goal is to develop a quantitative chemical model for the interface between plasma membrane lipids and a class of membrane proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RTKs are integral membrane proteins that regulate cell growth and differentiation. The focus of this project is on two RTKs, EphA2 and EGFR. Integral with these research objectives is an education and broader impacts program that enhances STEM education at the University of Akron and provides materials and curriculum for enhanced laboratory instruction across the country. This includes the development of a 3D-printable, smartphone spectrometer (the SpecPhone) for implementation in university laboratory courses. The low cost and simplicity of the SpecPhone also make it accessible to K-12 students and citizens so that they can engage in real-world science problems.  The broader impacts work creates new curriculum and teacher training workshops for K-12 STEM education, to participate in local Maker Fairs, and to develop protocols for a transformative citizen science project in the Lake Erie watershed.<br/><br/>Lipids solvate membrane proteins and, in many cases, regulate their activity through direct, specific contacts. Many lipid-protein interactions are inferred from static structures or computer simulations; however, there is little experimental data to verify these interactions in situ and determine their kinetic and thermodynamic stability. This project uses advanced fluorescence methods, including pulsed-interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS) and single-molecule imaging to measure molecular associations in biological membranes. The long-term goal is to develop a quantitative chemical model for the interface between plasma membrane lipids and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Both the extracellular domain (ECD) and the intracellular domain (ICD) of RTKs associate directly with the plasma membrane, but the chemical details of the associations are not well-understood. This project focuses on two RTKs, EphA2 and EGFR. The central hypothesis is that anionic lipids bind these proteins and regulate their structure and activity. To test this hypothesis, we determine the affinity and specificity of anionic lipid binding to EGFR in model supported lipid bilayers. We also investigate the regulation of EphA2 structure and dynamics by anionic lipids in model membranes. Finally, we resolve the functional role of anionic lipid binding to EGFR. Achieving these objectives contributes to a systematic understanding of how the lipid-protein interface is affected by parameters like lipid charge, headgroup structure, solvent pH, and salt effects. The results significantly advance our understanding of the chemical interactions that guide cell communication.

If the blocks possess distinctly different chemical properties, then they may be capable of self-assembling into well-ordered physical structures that impart material properties that are very different, and often better, than the properties of the individual blocks alone.  Unfortunately, the chemical synthesis of block copolymers is generally much more complicated, energy intensive, and expensive compared to that employed in synthesizing a typical commodity polymer of just one block.  While polymer chemists have made remarkable progress in developing new ways to synthesize block copolymers, commercial success has been limited and often relegated to applications in high-cost fields such as advanced medical devices or semiconductor manufacture.  In this project, a new physical approach will be used to create blocky copolymers in a straightforward, economically-attractive fashion by selectively modifying specific sequences of units along the chains of commercially available polymers.  The breakthrough approach here involves performing chemistry in the gel state, whereby specific portions of the chains are essentially hidden from the modifying chemistry.  This research will provide significant advancements in accelerating the creation of tailored block copolymer assemblies and enhance fundamental insight toward next-generation membrane technologies.  With respect to the grand challenges facing our society, this project will provide cost-effective, readily available alternative materials needed to meet critical demands for water purification membranes, fuel cell membranes for clean energy conversion, and environmentally-friendly materials for the medical and healthcare industries.  The interdisciplinary nature of research activities in this project, ranging from pure chemistry to materials structure and properties, will provide a plethora of educational opportunities to a diverse community of students and researchers eager to contribute to our nation's leadership in a scientifically and technologically advanced society.<br/><br/><br/><br/>PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will focus on a new way to create blocky copolymers using straightforward, post polymerization chemistries on semi-crystalline homopolymers in the gel state. With reactions upon only the accessible amorphous chain segments within the semi-crystalline network, this new physical process yields a non-random, blocky incorporation of functionality, and is a simple alternative to the complex polymerization mechanisms that are conventionally employed in the synthesis of block copolymers. Building upon recent discoveries that semi-crystalline polymers, such as syndiotactic polystyrene and poly(ether ether ketone), can be brominated in the heterogeneous gel-state as a simple way to create blocky copolymers with tailored sequence distributions, this project aims to engage a wealth of substitution chemistries available with brominated aromatic templates to create a wide variety of new blocky copolymers as a means to systematically manipulate phase behavior and thus the formation of ordered morphologies with tailored properties.  In addition to the substitution chemistries, the morphological parameters of the semi-crystalline gel will be altered by controlled temperature, concentration, and solvent to precisely affect the sequences of functionalized and non-functionalized chain segments.  The grand challenge to be addressed in this project will be: Can we now direct the formation of ordered phase-separated domains, similar to that observed with conventional block copolymers, by tailoring the chemical composition of these new, gel-state functionalized, blocky copolymer systems? Membranes of the blocky copolymers will be architecturally tailored for energy conversion and water purification applications.  The interdisciplinary nature of research activities in this project, ranging from pure chemistry to materials structure and properties, will help to educate a diverse community of researchers, including underrepresented groups.  Educational outreach activities will engage citizens of all ages through the focus on cutting-edge research aimed at ensuring a healthier, more energy-efficient global society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include progressive collapse in civil infrastructure systems, social contagion and diffusion of innovations in sociology, epidemics in biology, viral marketing in economics, default cascades in financial systems, and blackouts in power networks. The ability to model, analyze, and control the cascade behavior in networks enables detection of sensitivities to shocks, helps develop vulnerability mitigation strategies for increased resilience, and serves the public interest in the areas of human health, infrastructure, and national defense. Due to their surprisingly intricate behavior and wide applicability, this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project focuses on networks in which components take binary states, such as zero or one, inactive or active, healthy or failed. Here, a cascade is a process in which the irreversible activation or failure of a relatively small number of components spreads through the network and ultimately results in the activation or failure of a substantial portion of the network's components. To date, progress in the prevention and promotion of binary cascades has been hampered by the complexity of such behavior. The techniques and algorithms developed in this project are expected to provide theoretical and computational tools for the modeling, analysis, and design of cascades in large-scale networks. This project will not only promote fundamental science of network systems but also improve our preparedness to avoid failures in critical networks such as, health, traffic, power, communication, and financial systems. The project also has strong education and outreach plan that includes K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and local community. <br/><br/>To advance scalable techniques for the modeling, analysis, and design of cascading behavior in emerging networks, this CARRER project considers the optimal cascade seeding problem: For a given network find the set of components whose failure at time zero maximizes the failure amplification ratio -- the ratio between the number of final and initial failures. Two concrete classes of networks are employed as motivational applications of optimal cascade seeding: transportation networks and threshold networks. Threshold networks are ones in which a component fails if at least a certain fraction of its neighbors have failed. The transformative idea of the fundamental research is to utilize piecewise-linear functions to approximate the complex temporal dynamics of cascading networks. A special relaxed version of these nonlinear dynamics is embedded in a high-dimensional linear program with a cascade-promoting objective. Combinatorial aspects of finding the most critical initial failures are overcome through the use of regularization techniques from sparse optimization and compressed sensing. The developed approach scales gracefully to large-scale networks and has the potential to enhance the systems-theoretic toolset for analysis and design in general classes of Boolean and nonlinear systems. The broader impacts of this project include prevention of epidemic outbreaks and spread of disease, triggering positive social change and collective action in sociopolitical networks, and vulnerability detection and mitigation in the emerging smart grid. The education effort is focused on filling the educational pipeline from K-12 to graduate students using engaged learning strategies and is centered around networks and optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most studies of patterns and processes responsible for vegetation change have focused on deciduous shrubs, which have shown increases in abundance throughout much of the Arctic.  Fewer studies have examined changes in tree abundance at the interface between arctic tundra and the boreal forest. This project will take advantage of historical aerial images collected throughout the Brooks Range during the 1950s and 1970s to provide a comprehensive census of changes in tree abundance in recent decades in northern Alaska. Investigators will also test hypotheses about whether differences in nutrition, colder soils, and more widespread permafrost explain why trees in the western Brooks Range have increased their growth in response to recent warming, while those in the eastern Brooks Range have not. In addition, the investigators plan extensive education and outreach activities in rural and urban Alaska. Rural efforts will include visiting classrooms in Kotzebue High School to share research results, providing opportunities for Kotzebue High School students to join the research team in the field, arrainging to be interviewed by local public radio stations, and delivering public lectures at National Park Service headquarters in several local villages. In Anchorage, the investigators plan to equip a public high school in Anchorage with supples needed to conduct tree-ring research, train students in standard methods, and help them design a study to link white spruce tree ring data in their backyards to long term climate records. <br/><br/>The relative abundance of forest and tundra has important implications for surface energy exchange, carbon cycling, wildlife habitat and the availability of subsistence resources at high latitudes. The northern limit of the boreal forest in Alaska is formed within the Brooks Range. The eastern Brooks Range is an area well known to dendrochronologists as an epicenter of divergent tree growth responses to climate warming. Divergence refers to the deterioration of historically strong positive correlations between temperature and tree growth. The recognition that divergence has been widespread in the circumboreal has undermined confidence in paleoclimate reconstructions and created uncertainty in projections of vegetation-climate feedbacks. While divergence is a well-known phenomenon, its implications for changes in tree abundance and shifts in treeline position remain unknown. Recent findings in four watersheds along a west to east gradient in the Brooks Range suggest colder, more permafrost-affected soils limit tree access to soil nutrients and may be the cause of divergence in the eastern Brooks Range.  In this study, investigators will expand the spatial extent of this previous work to examine the causes and consequences of divergence in the Brooks Range. They will combine repeat aerial photography with tree-ring analysis and detailed measurements of tree microclimates, mycorrhizal associations, nutrient relations, and reproductive effort in 25 Brooks Range watersheds to yield broad-scale mechanistic insights into controls on tree growth and changes in tree abundance in a changing climate. They will test the hypothesis that positive growth responses to warming and increased tree abundance will prevail in the western Brooks Range and in habitats with warmer soils, while neutral growth responses to warming and stagnant treelines will be common in the eastern Brooks Range and in areas with cold soils.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As cancer progresses and invades into the bowel wall beneath, a signals between cells trigger the formation of new, abnormal blood vessels. These vessels are twisted and have variations in their structure and components.  There are also significant differences when compared to normal blood vessels and capillaries. Existing techniques to directly investigate the colon tissue's structure and function in a living subject are limited due to technological constraints. This project will develop a probe that can be used on an endoscope, a standard piece of surgical equipment, that can image the tissue and reconstruct a three-dimensional representation of the tissue properties.  This technology will be useful for anatomical ""tubes"" of many types and sizes - including the digestive tract, pancreatic duct, and other structures. This novel device will be used to test the hypothesis that an abnormal structure and organization of blood vessels beneath the surface of the colon tissue is related to colorectal tumor growth and development.  Similarly, it is expected that effective treatment of colorectal tumors will be accompanied by a return of normal blood vessel structure and organization.  Within this project, research and educational components are integrated through undergraduate and graduate student mentoring and training activities, course development, and a Biophotonics-specific summer camp.  In the summer camp, students will learn the fundamentals of light and how light can be used to answer research questions in the life sciences.<br/><br/><br/>The project focuses on developing a novel Tomographic Imaging MicroEndoscopy (TIME) platform, capable of multimodal characterization of tissue structure and perfusion.  The Research Plan builds on an optical fiber bundle image guide-based microendoscopy platform, previously developed by the PI, capable of imaging superficial tissues at subcellular (<3.5 micron) resolution.  The proposed platform will be capable of deployment via endoscope (for gastrointestinal applications) or catheter (for intravascular applications) and be capable of multimodal real-time in vivo tomographic imaging of microvasculature, spectroscopic quantification of tissue perfusion (hemoglobin content and oxygen saturation) and high-resolution imaging of superficial tissue microarchitecture. Specific design goals include:  1) Outer diameter of <1mm; 2) No complex galvanometric or resonant scanning systems; 3) Cost-effective hardware (<$20,000 USD) to facilitate translation to clinical applications and 4)Tomographic resolution capable of three dimensional mapping of subsurface vessels of ~20 micron diameter, down to 500 micron depth. The Research Plan is organized around three objectives:  1) Tomographic-image reconstruction using a fiber bundle image guide microendoscope--requiring development of the prototype microendoscopy device and image reconstruction methods and validation in PDMS phantoms; 2) Fluorescence-based tomographic microendoscopy (F-TIME) for angiographic applications--requiring development of image reconstruction methods and validation in optical phantoms and 3) Application of TIME for characterization of tumor vasculature and perfusion in an orthotopic mouse model of colorectal cancer--requiring mapping the in vivo microenvironment during tumor development and characterizing the tumor vasculature in response to a therapeutic intervention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project works with high school science teachers to develop educational materials through workshops held on the University of Washington campus. The goal is to introduce the climate system in an accessible form, simplifying it as much as possible while retaining the essential elements and their interactions. Simple models are developed which use one or two equations to represent the evolution of global temperature in response to radiative forcing, incorporating factors such as feedback effects and time delay due to ocean heat storage. Despite their simplicity the models are closely related to cutting-edge research, as such models are commonly used to understand behaviors found in full complexity climate models and the observational record. The models and accompanying materials also introduce students to simple differential equations, scientific computation, hypothesis testing and the scientific method. A parallel effort is organized for high school science teachers in eastern Washington with the help of scientists and education specialists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland.<br/><br/>The research component of the award is an effort to understand the sensitivity of global temperature to changes in greenhouse gas concentration. This sensitivity, commonly referred to as climate sensitivity, is quantified as the warming produced by a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) over its pre-industrial level. Climate sensitivity is an important indicator of the risk posed by greenhouse gas increases, and much effort has been devoted to estimating its value.<br/><br/>But the extent to which the impact of greenhouse gas increases on global temperature can be represented by a single, fixed sensitivity value is unclear. Several lines of research suggest that global temperature becomes more sensitive to the radiative effect of CO2 increases as climate warms. In that case that the warming ultimately produced by CO2 doubling is greater than what would be expected from sensitivity estimates calculated at any time prior to the full temperature increase.<br/><br/>The temperature increase achieved when the climate system has fully adjusted to the radiative effect of CO2 doubling is termed the equilibrium climate sensitivity, or ECS. The terminology distinguishes between ECS and instantaneous climate sensitivity (ICS), meaning the incremental temperature increase from an incremental radiative increase during the ramp-up to CO2 doubling. ECS is a fixed value whereas ICS evolves over time, approaching ECS as the ultimate doubling temperature is realized. While there is evidence that ICS is always less than ECS, the excess of ECS over ICS has not yet been satisfactorily explained.<br/><br/>Research under this CAREER award seeks to understand why ICS changes over time and why it is consistently lower than ECS. A key issue in the research is the dependence of climate sensitivity on feedback mechanisms that are specific to particular regions. A simple example is the sea ice albedo feedback, in which warming causes sea ice retreat, replacing bright reflective ice cover with the darker ocean surface, causing more solar energy to be retained in the climate system and causing further warming. Since the albedo feedback only occurs within ice covered regions, the feedback strength depends on the warming of the polar cap rather than the increase in globally averaged temperature. The PI hypothesizes that much of the ECS-ICS difference is due to regional differences in the rate of warming produced by greenhouse gas increases: if different regions are home to different feedback processes and some regions warm faster than others, different regional feedback mechanisms will be prominent during different stages of the transition to a warmer climate. Changes over time in the mix of feedback processes can then account for the evolution of ICS. The research thus focuses on the spatial pattern of temperature increase, which is explored primarily through analysis of climate model output and a set of focused climate model experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent success has led to breakthroughs in applications such as speech and image recognition, nourishing public interest. However, more theoretical insight is needed to create a rigorous scientific basis for designing and training deep neural networks, increasing their scalability, and providing insight into their reasoning. This project develops a new mathematical framework that simplifies designing, training, and analyzing deep neural networks. Due to the broad applicability of deep learning, advances made in this project will benefit a wide range of technologies of high economic and societal impact, e.g., driverless cars, drug discoveries, and web searches. The mathematical theory supporting the new algorithms will increase the acceptance of deep learning for delicate tasks, e.g., cancer prediction and cyber-security. <br/><br/>This project develops a new mathematical framework for deep learning based on the interpretation of deep learning as a dynamic optimal control problem involving nonlinear time-dependent differential equations. This interpretation offers a new way to analyze the successes and failures of deep learning. Advances in deep learning will be made by adapting the wide array of tools available for related optimal control problems, including numerical optimization, partial and ordinary differential equations, inverse problems theory, and parallel processing. Using these currently untapped resources provides rigorous new ways to design and train very deep neural networks that generalize well. Advances in optimal control will be achieved through new hybrid regularization methods, adaptive time discretizations, and large-scale splitting-based optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When that happens, the rigid plate is heated and releases water and other volatiles into the overlying mantle.  This induces melting in the mantle and expresses itself in explosive surface volcanism, such as those around the Pacific Ocean basin (the so-called 'Ring of Fire'). Volcanism associated with subduction zones is closely linked to the formation of economic mineral deposits.  Unfortunately, the nature of fluid movement from the descending slab into the overlying mantle cannot be directly observed.  This project will test if large igneous bodies that intruded into the shallow continental crust and dehydrated underlying rocks can serve as proxies to processes operation at depth in subduction zone hydrothermal systems. The study will be centered on the intrusion of the 2.7 billion year old Stillwater Complex in Montana, and which has since been exposed by erosion. Specifically, it is planned to investigate mechanisms (fractures, veins, etc.) by which fluids liberated from the underlying rocks and moved into the overlying igneous rocks and the degree that these were modified during this process.  The study has broader applications to the study of the explosive volcanism that occurs at subduction zones as well as understanding the ultimate source of fluids involved in ore deposits in both the subduction zone environment and in unique magmatic intrusions that are the main sources of critical materials for our modern industry. Copper, chromium and the platinum-group elements are examples of critical resources with great importance for the national economy.  The funding also will help support advanced training for a graduate student and senior thesis projects for undergraduate students.<br/>	<br/>More specifically, the work entails mapping and characterization of hydrothermal features (high temperature veins and pegmatoidal bodies) of the lower part of the Stillwater Complex and its 2-3 km thick metamorphic aureole.  This will include comparing the stable (particularly carbon) and radiogenic (Nd, Sr, and Pb) isotopic composition of veins pegmatoidal bodies in the Stillwater Complex with the surrounding host rock to test the degree country fluids were involved in their formation.  The composition of these hydrothermal features will be compared with bulk rock major and trace element composition of the Stillwater Complex up to the Middle Banded series, for which there currently is no comprehensive coverage of the complex.  These field data can be used to constrain theoretic models of fluid channelization in both subduction zone and layered intrusion settings.  It can also lead to insights toward understanding the transition from magmatic to country fluid migration in three-phase crystal-liquid-gas mushes, and has consequences for ore deposit formation models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular importance are two common risk factors of diabetes: a fatty diet (fatty acids) and lack of sufficient oxygen.  In this project, a novel miniaturized pump will precisely control the beta cells' local environment so that the mechanisms of diabetes can be studied quantitatively and precisely.  Results of the research will transform understanding of how diabetes develops and may explain why not all obese patients develop diabetes despite similar risk factors. These novel and transformative biomedical science and engineering investigations (or experiments) will be conducted by a team of interdisciplinary, peer-learning students, under the guidance of the principle investigator. Research is also interwoven with education, where students from graduate, undergraduate, local high school, and elementary school all participate in the experimental, interpretive, and peer-teaching aspects of the project.<br/><br/><br/>The proposal focuses on probing mechanisms of beta cell dysfunction, a hallmark of diabetes, through studies performed in a highly integrated platform termed ""quantitative droplet molecular transport (qDMT)"" based on the PI's ""smart microgel"" droplets and a novel microfluidic Tesla pump.  The two mechanisms for initial study are 1) enhanced immunogenicity as a result of neoantigen binding to free fatty acid (FFA) exposed beta cells and 2) beta cell impairment as a result of a potential synergy between FFA and hypoxia in modulating adipocyte cytokines.  The qDMT is a unique tool for quantifying protein transport in situ due to three novel features:: 1) Smart microgels allow antibody binding to be assayed while modifying the antigens in situ, i.e., within the porous droplets, bead biosensors can be placed right next to cells of interest so the diffusion length is dramatically shortened, accelerating sensitive protein detection in situ; 2) The miniaturizing bladeless Tesla pump optimizes use of boundary layers, enabling a completely sealed, continuous flow difficult to achieve with conventional pumps and 3) Microchannel dimensions can be varied to create predictable diffusion models to quantify molecular kinetics. The Research Plan is organized around three objectives: 1) Engineer qDMT with cell & biosensor laden smart microgels, a micro-Tesla pump and reconfigurable microfluidics. 2) Apply qDMT to study neoantigen (insulin, GAD, IA-2, ZnT8) binding in FFA exposed beta cells and 3) Apply qDMT to study FFA+hypoxia synergy in adipocyte cytokine (IL6, TNF) modulation of beta dysfunction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the protein materials are even made from predominantly one type of such structure, showing that high material performance can be achieved by relatively simple structural motifs. This project aims to elucidate how a class of synthetic polymers, which possess both a relatively complex molecular architecture and well-defined secondary structural motifs, may allow for the development of new materials with predictable physical properties. The different ways of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions in these complex polymer molecules may turn out to be the primary factor that determines the macroscopic properties. Successful completion of this research may enable the generation of polymeric systems that will approach the level of sophistication and versatility found in some  of nature's biomaterials and the properties of these materials may be tailored for a variety of applications. This research project entails the design and preparation of such complex molecules and their supramolecular assemblies, as well as the study of their properties.  It also provides a model system of complex macromolecules, enabling comparison of the multiscale assembly and the material properties with predictions from computer simulations and modeling. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in this area and acquire skills in polymer synthesis, material characterization, and computer simulations. The program will integrate the research with the development of interdisciplinary courses on bioinspired polymeric materials, provide vibrant research experiences to undergraduates and high-school students, and promote polymer research and its impact on society through lectures and workshops for the public. Emphasis is given to involving underrepresented students at all levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Using living polymerizations and other strategies, polymers with complex architectures and controlled molecular structures can be synthesized for new materials. One central question that arises is how to control the organization of these complex polymers at different scales to achieve targeted material properties. This research puts a particular emphasis on the secondary structures of complex synthetic polymers, and the connection between the different organizations of the structural motifs and the performance of resulting materials. The model system used in this research is the comb-like macromolecules containing polyamino acids (PAAs) as the side chains. Synthetic PAAs are polypeptide model systems that can form alpha-helix or beta-sheet structures, and that can be made on a large scale. Current studies mainly focus on the linear PAAs and their various copolymers. However, incorporating PAAs into complex macromolecular architectures (e.g., comb-like or brush-like) has profound effects on the association and physical properties of the polymers. The research aims to elucidate the relationship between the structural configuration and the material properties of the PAA-grafted comb macromolecules. The investigation begins with the use of water-soluble PAAs that form intermolecular beta-sheets, to guide the association of the comb macromolecules into fibril-based thin films. The mechanical properties of the polymer films will be compared with those made from proteins or linear PAAs. The study will then continue on the hydrophobic PAAs that form alpha-helices, and determine how different structural configurations of the helices may dictate the morphology and mechanical properties of the PAA-grafted comb macromolecules. At the end of the project, the stress-induced transformation of alpha-helix to beta-sheet in the PAA-grafted comb macromolecules will be examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vesicles, called polymersomes, have diverse applications in the soft materials community as drug delivery devices or even as tiny, nanoscale, flasks for chemical reactions.  The shape of the polymersome can be tailored in response to external stimuli such as temperature or type of solvent. The PI will focus on polymersomes made of a particular kind of polymer that contains a hydrophilic molecular building block, one that can dissolve or mix with water, that is connected to a hydrophobic molecular building block which does not mix well with water.  At low concentrations in water, depending on the polymer length and exact ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups, these polymers can assemble into spherical shapes, worm-like shapes, or vesicle-like shapes.  The PI will use computation and focus investigation on the self-assembly of these polymers into polymersomes.  <br/><br/>This award will use molecular dynamics simulation methods to investigate both the self-assembly of these polymersomes as well as their elastic properties.  In molecular dynamics, the rule by which atoms and molecules interact with each other is mathematically described by a force field.

Nearly all soft materials, particularly materials based on polymeric self-assembly, are far from their equilibrium state.  Not only is this a challenge, but it is also an opportunity to harness the structure, morphology, and transformation kinetics of self-assemblies to optimize materials properties. Indeed, the ability to tune molecular assembly shape in response to external stimuli has numerous applications in tailoring the thermodynamic, mechanical, and photonic properties of materials.  This research activity aims to develop multi-scale computational approaches that will provide fundamental insight into the design principles guiding the elastic properties of charged polymeric membranes, including polymersomes.  Polymersomes, in particular, stimuli-responsive polymersomes have diverse applications as nanocarriers, nanoreactors, and even as biomimectic systems.  Within the scope of this project the PI will develop a computational toolbox that can be used to engineer polymersomes with key physical properties. Specifically, the PI will design coarse grain force fields for common diblock copolymers that self-assemble into polymersomes, and use an array of approaches in molecular dynamics to characterize and predict their elastic properties.  Next, the PI will utilize various computational methodologies to predict the stability of these polymersomes, specifically the energy required to porate the membrane, as well as characterize their stimuli-responsive change in shape.<br/>A focus of this research project is the development of computational methods and force fields to characterize intermediate morphologies and shape transformations underlying molecular self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules.   These new computational techniques would be both verified and experimentally validated, and would allow for the rational design of new diblock copolymer mixtures that can self-assemble into the polymersome morphology, that can be tested by experimental collaborators.  New computational methods that inform the design of diverse morphological self-assemblies from the molecular level up, that also incorporate their potential for dynamic shape transformation, can impact multiple soft materials fields.  Outcomes of the proposed research will allow for molecular design strategies that can be used to tailor amphiphiles to optimize their dynamic response to external stimuli such as solvent or salt concentration.  For example, the diblock copolymers discussed within this proposal can be tailored for applications such as drug delivery or as catalytically active nanomotors. <br/><br/>Complementing the above research activities, proposed educational and outreach activities include strengthening the local educational and research environment of College of Staten Island and City University of New York (CUNY), and more closely integrating the institutions with local NY teachers.

The central dogma of molecular biology has long stated that DNA codes for RNA, which codes for protein, which then carries out a cell's important functions; but there is a rapidly growing appreciation for the functions of RNA itself in fundamental biology. At the same time, there is a pressing need for new techniques to investigate these functions, including how RNA interacts with other molecules. In this work, Hargrove and coworkers develop new technology to meet this need using pattern-based recognition, which is similar to human's sense of taste, wherein a handful of receptors can identify a wide range of flavors based on how the components of those flavors differentially interact with the receptors. In this application, small organic molecules are used as receptors to evaluate different ""flavors"" of RNA structure and rapidly reveal how the shape of RNA corresponds to its function. The assay developed will be widely accessible for future investigations into the classification of RNA functional motifs, and the library of small molecule receptors and their properties will be a publicly available and searchable database. The knowledge and technology produced provide the basis for novel, fundamental discoveries into the structure and function of regulatory RNAs and thus, the central dogma of molecular biology, which impacts all areas of life, from the environment to human health. These innovative technologies push the limits of differential sensing to include structural biology, paving the way for the structure-based classification of additional biomacromolecules. This research integrates with the educational plans of the PI to: 1) implement research-based experiments and collaborative projects among diverse undergraduate and high school students throughout North Carolina; 2)increase student understanding of noncovalent interactions via accessible visualization and application activities; 3)introduce students to interdisciplinary research and real-world applications of chemistry and chemical biology; and 4) increase student engagement in the study of STEM fields. <br/><br/>The long-term research goal of the PI is to establish guiding principles for small molecule and protein recognition of RNA and to use these principles for the development of chemical probes for RNA structure and function. The CAREER research objective is to draw upon exquisitely tunable small molecules to develop timesaving and simple technologies that elucidate critical principles in RNA recognition and related function. The identification of functional yet non-protein coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences has led to a revolution in molecular biology, yet myriad questions surround the molecular function of ncRNA. These knowledge gaps include the driving principles behind ncRNA molecular interactions, particularly the influence of three-dimensional shape, and how these interactions guide ncRNA-dependent processes. Fundamental investigations of ncRNA biochemistry are hindered by challenges in molecular characterization, including the intensive time and expertise required to determine 3D RNA structure. Using techniques recently developed in the lab of the PI, the proposed work addresses a number of fundamental molecular questions, including: 1) How does shape influence small molecule:RNA recognition? 2) What RNA structural elements can small molecule receptors differentiate? 3) How do varying environmental conditions impact this differentiation? 4) How do base modifications influence RNA recognition? 5) Can arrays of small molecules differentiate functional RNA elements in a manner comparable to or better than proteins? These novel, small molecule-based methods for understanding RNA recognition provide ready access to chemical insights that reveal both the fundamental principles of small molecule:RNA recognition and the pivotal role RNA shape plays in regulating key cellular functions, ultimately leading to new knowledge in the ncRNA field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The students can apply to the REU program by ranking their favorite projects and recruitment will consider the applicant's skills and likelihood of having a successful experience as well as attracting students from traditionally underrepresented population groups, including women, African American and Hispanic/Latino students. The participating students will spend a total of 10 summer weeks at Harvey Mudd College (a member of the 5 Claremont Colleges that also include Claremont McKenna, Pomona, Pitzer and Scripps) and will work on their research projects with an experienced faculty member. They will be supported by state-of-the-art infrastructure such as computing facilities, libraries and laboratories. Students will also engage with their peers in a series of data science and professional skill workshops. Social events and educational field trips round out the program. Domain-specific research using data science methods and tools provide the students with important skills that prepare them for graduate studies and are useful for analyzing and solving problems in many disciplines and environments. The professional skill modules, including research ethics, time management and scholarly publishing, will complement and enrich the technical training and further equip students with competencies needed to become well-rounded, successful researchers. As computational capacity continues to expand at a rapid pace, there is an increased need for data science literacy among all scientists and engineers. Exposing the students to relevant concepts and tools in data science through this REU program is aimed at encouraging them to pursue careers in STEM-related fields and helping fill the persistent skill and labor gap in the U.S. by producing graduates who can have an impact on science and technology in the public and private sectors. <br/><br/>The research projects that are part of the Harvey Mudd College REU program in Data Science in Life Sciences, Environmental Science and Engineering address new and open problems in different STEM disciplines using computational, mathematical and statistical methods and tools. The participating faculty mentors maintain active research activities in these tracks that offer data and hypothesis-rich environments for exploration and in-depth analysis. Example projects include the analysis of flow cytometry data, modeling of epidemiological and public health data such as surgical cataract coverage in developing countries, spatial data modeling and analysis for health risk assessments related to unconventional oil and gas development, testing hybrid mathematical models in atmospheric chemistry, and developing predictive models for sports coaching such as real-time coaching recommendations based on play-by-play basketball data. These projects involve high-dimensional data analytics and use different techniques to extract insights such as simulated data to validate mathematical models of effective health intervention coverage, multivariate spatial regression and Kriging, time series analysis of cloud-chamber data on air pollution models, and algebraic analysis of partially ranked data coupled with predictive techniques used in machine learning to predict player performance. In addition, students will also receive hands-on training in R, Python, MATLAB, become well versed in Linux command line processing, batch scripting, data movement, use of XSEDE supercomputers, and version control. They will be exposed to big data environments such as Hadoop and Spark, learn to use relational databases and write SQL and PostgreSQL queries, and work with ESRI's ArcGIS to model high-resolution spatial data. While the technical training and participation in real research processes is the main component of the REU program, necessary soft skills for successfully developing and running research programs are taught as well. This includes the group's participation in Harvey Mudd College's successful weekly Stauffer lecture and open lab series as well as a series of custom-tailored workshops involving additional personnel from the College's academic departments and the Writing Center.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will answer some of the many questions remaining about tone by focusing on a language displaying a rich tonal inventory, and a typologically unexpected system of consonant patterns and vowel harmony. These features interact in complex and poorly understood ways in phrases and sentences. This project will describe and analyze these phenomena in detail with a specific emphasis on word building (morphology) and sound patterns (phonology).  The project will provide new insights into many questions remaining about tone and its scalar properties in this language, and on the behavior of complex tonal and vowel harmony systems in morphology and syntax. The results will be disseminated via journal articles on the descriptive and theoretical findings, a reference grammar and archived, annotated language data. In addition to its documentary goals, this project will support underrepresented students in international fieldwork and language documentation training. It will enhance the global competitiveness of the STEM workforce by fostering collaborative international relationships as sites of student learning.<br/><br/> <br/>This project will investigate Gubie, an understudied endangered Kru (Niger-Congo) language spoken in southwestern Cte d'Ivoire, as part of a collaborative effort by by linguists at Georgetown University, linguists at Flix Houphout-Boigny University in Abidjan, Cte d'Ivoire, and the Gubie community. Kru languages in general are underdocumented, though extant work shows that languages within the Kru family show typologically rare linguistic properties. These include: 1) complex tonal systems with four tone heights, where tone distinguishes both lexical and grammatical contrasts; 2) unexpected patterning of implosive consonants with liquid consonants like rather than stops; 3) large vowel inventories with multiple types of vowel harmony, often conditioned by morphosyntactic environment; and 4) phonologically determined noun class agreement within noun phrases. Investigating these four properties and others will increase the scientific knowledge that depends critically on these linguistic features that are not found in languages like English, Spanish or their Indo-European relatives. These patterns include such typologically rare phenomena as scalar tone alternations as the sole markers of case and aspect distinctions. Due to the atypical nature of the phonological inventory and morphological properties of Gubie, a complete understanding of the morphophonological system of the language has much to contribute to our collective understanding of the possible linguistic features of a natural language, and the theoretical tools most appropriate for modeling morphophonological phenomena. Prosodic and phonological features, like those exhibited by Gubie, are highly vulnerable as languages become more endangered, which is happening in the Gubie community. This project also fosters strong connections between Ivoirians and Americans at globally focused academic institutions, which serves the national interest by helping to strengthen democracy and governance in Africa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emerging AM technologies, such as 3-D metal printing, are promising for performance-based optimization of seismic steel systems, as they can accommodate highly irregular component designs through highly controlled weld-free geometry formation. In order for AM steel parts to transition to functioning components in seismic structural systems, the ability to predict damage limit states, such as ductile fracture and low-cycle fatigue, is needed. Existing ductile fracture models lack the ability to accurately capture fracture processes in AM steel alloys due to the complex micro features formed during fabrication. This research will develop an innovative framework for upscaling micro-scale material measurements in AM steel alloys to predict macro-scale behavior in seismic structural fuse components. These micro-scale measurements and up-scaling framework can lead to the creation of a hybrid analysis-AM framework, allowing iteration and optimization of seismic structural fuse performance through probabilistic fracture predictions prior to fabrication. The capability to optimize the seismic performance of steel buildings through AM structural fuse design will promote national welfare and prosperity through safer and more resilient and sustainable building construction to better protect life and property during earthquakes and to maintain essential services and business continuities during response and recovery.  Integral with this research are an innovative middle school outreach program and a graduate-level international research collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.  The middle school outreach, in the form of engineering songwriting workshops, will couple music education with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) curricula. Termed STEMusic, the outreach plan aims to promote creativity, understanding, and retention of engineering principles through the engagement of alternative cognitive processes.  The international research collaboration will include the exchange of graduate students.  <br/><br/>The objective of this CAREER award is to test the hypothesis that measured micromechanical material behavior can be scaled to accurately predict macroscale ductile fracture in steel alloys created through common AM processes such as selective laser melting. In the research, modern technologies such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and modified nano-indentation will be used to measure the fundamental localization processes driving ductile fracture in AM steels and create a new simulation framework to allow the future creation of more generalizable fracture models. Steel specimens approximately 0.002 millimeters in diameter will be fabricated using focused ion beam milling and mechanically tested using a modified in-SEM nano-indentation device.  The measured micromechanical behavior, coupled with TEM spatial characterizations of the fracture surface microstructure, will be used to inform statistical volume element simulations for upscaling to larger material volumes.  This micro-mechanics based framework will be used to investigate the ductile fracture performance of free-form structural fuse geometries (geometries created using AM processes). Potential impacts of this award outside the described application to seismic design include advances in materials engineering and AM fabrication. The micromechanical experiments have the potential to provide fundamental insights into the effects of underlying material morphology and chemistry on macro-mechanical AM steel alloy response, allowing material response (e.g., fracture, yielding, and deformation) to be designed into the AM geometry creation process. Coupling this within the field of nonlinear topology optimization, the framework to be developed will be essential for deriving optimum design solutions that satisfy complex performance criteria involving high plastic strains that lead to fracture or fatigue under various complex loadings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work addresses this fundamental shortcoming by developing new<br/>models and algorithms that simultaneously account for the most prevalent processes in eukaryotic gene<br/>family evolution: gene duplication, loss, and coalescence. The new computational framework and<br/>methods will enable researchers to systematically interpret data sets, make substantially more reliable<br/>and robust inferences, and improve our understanding of genome evolution.

For<br/>eukaryotic organisms, the most popular reconciliation methods allow for gene duplications and gene<br/>losses, which is appropriate only for species sampled at large evolutionary distances, or allow for<br/>coalescences, which is appropriate only for species sampled at close evolutionary distances.

By<br/>bridging these two models, this research will impact how gene family evolution is represented and how<br/>reconciliations are inferred and analyzed. Specifically, this work addresses three key problems in the<br/>field: algorithmic challenges of scaling to large datasets, statistical challenges of distinguishing biological<br/>signal from noise, and modeling challenges of generalizing across genomes.

The research effort addresses challenges at the interface of Geomorphology, Ecology, and Fluid Dynamics. It is coupled with an education and outreach plan that will foster a STEM-oriented, school-to-college pipeline for at-risk young boys; and will develop advanced but accessible educational material for Universities, agencies, and policy makers dealing with floodplains, wetlands, and coastal areas worldwide.<br/><br/>The project seeks integration of the various impacts of aquatic ecosystems in sediment and oxygen dynamics in natural waters. An extensive experimental study, using quantitative flow imaging, acoustic, and optical sensors, will fully characterize coupled water-air-vegetation-sediment interactions, by monitoring turbulent flows, sediment-oxygen demand, and their impact on gas transfer.

Debris flows emanate from steep catchments where they entrain sediment and debris before entering adjacent lowlands, and thus, they pose an increasingly significant threat to human life and infrastructure. In September 2017, the Eagle Creek fire complex burned nearly 50,000 acres of steep, forested terrain along the southern margin of the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon. Data and field observations necessary to determine the relevance of post-fire geomorphic responses in the Eagle Creek fire region are lacking. This project responds to the severe urgency to collect data and field observations following the fire, and could impact management activities. <br/><br/>This project will inform process-based geomorphic models of debris flow potential and provide important constraints on the contribution of extreme events to regional erosion and sediment yield. The work plan includes raster and point-cloud based change-detection with lidar datasets. Lidar analysis documenting changes in the forest and sub-canopy structure between 2014 and 2018 will enable the team to quantify how the disturbance of different components of the vegetation mosaic contribute to sediment transport. Analysis of post-fire land surface change will enable the team to test how grain size and slope angle regulate transport distances owing to disturbance. Fieldwork in summer 2018 will occur before mitigation activities overprint post-fire geomorphic change. The team will identify hillslope sites with thick sediment accumulation that are likely to produce debris flows and identify damage to infrastructure.  Various state and federal agencies are involved and a graduate student will receive training from experts in lidar techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Also, when members of mixed-sex decision-making groups are non-consciously ""primed"" with images that challenge cultural gender stereotypes, people are less likely to act as if such stereotypes are accurate, and the magnitude of gender inequality can be reduced. Conversely, when group members are primed with images that support cultural gender stereotypes, the magnitude of gender inequality increases. What we do not know is why this occurs. This study will test three possible explanations: i) men and women may require targeted primes that convey self-relevant status information; ii)  whereas men tend to process only gender-related information relevant to masculine gender expectations, women may respond to information relevant to both masculine and feminine gender expectations; and iii) the behaviors of individuals in higher-status positions may reflect a self-serving bias whereby they ignore situational cues that threaten their privileged position.  Understanding the mechanisms driving differences between men and women in terms of processing and responding to gender stereotypes is an essential step in developing interventions to reduce inequality.  Furthermore, insights from this study are of potential importance for developing interventions aimed at mitigating the negative effects of other forms of status beliefs (e.g., racial inequality).  <br/> <br/>The proposed study involves an eight-condition laboratory experiment examining how priming effects enhance or impede the cognitive categorization of interaction partners and affect judgments about relative status and competence. Prior to interacting, participants will complete a cognitive priming task, which involves viewing a series of photographs that convey visual signals that either support or challenge dominant cultural stereotypes regarding male competence and agency. Following the priming task, participants will complete a seemingly unrelated collective decision-making task either with a same-sex partner or an opposite sex partner. This task will allow assessment of how the cognitive primes affect group outcomes: specifically openness to influence. Hypotheses suggest that priming group members with stereotype-consistent images will increase inequality of influence between men and women, and that priming with stereotype-inconsistent images will reduce inequality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dissolved or suspended materials can meet at interfaces between phases, react, accumulate, and undergo phase transfer.  Bijels are a relatively new class of materials in which the two distinct phases are both continuously connected through interpenetrating networks (rather than having islands of one phase within another phase).  In bijels, the two phases are stabilized by forming a densely packed layer of particles at the interface between phases.   The principle investigator has recently discovered a new process for making bijels.  This process expands dramatically the range of liquid pairs that can be used and allows the bijel structure to be tailored.  The present work is a detailed study of how to control and tune bijel structure and properties.  In addition, fluid flow and mass transfer within these materials will be measured to assess their potential use in applications.  A third study will involve a demonstration of bijel use in a two-phase chemical reaction with continuous flow.  This project will uncover the principles that determine the structure of bijels and will lead to new and well-designed multiphase materials for industrial applications. Potential applications range from enhanced product purification in chemical plants to industrial synthesis of high-value added chemicals in bijels. A broad range of educational and outreach activities aimed at middle school, high school, undergraduate and graduate students are also integrated into the research plans.<br/><br/>The objective of this work is to determine whether bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) formed by Solvent Transfer Induced Phase Separation (STRIPS) can be employed for continuously operated and efficient phase transfer processes.  Initial work will focus on control over bijel structure and properties.  Bijels will be formed with a selection of functional inorganic colloidal particles with surface modifications that will be developed and characterized.  The hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature and the repulsive/attractive character of surface functional groups are expected to govern bijel architecture and stability; this will be tested through surface modification of nanoparticles, characterization of surfaces, bijel formation, and characterization of bijel structure and mechanical properties.  A second thrust of the work will determine how the mechanical properties of bijels can be tailored to withstand the pressures needed to drive flow.  A scheme for reinforcing the interfacially jammed layer of nanoparticles has been developed and a tool has been constructed to characterize pressure-driven flow in bijels and assess their structural integrity under flow conditions.  The third aspect of the study involves phase transfer processes under continuous flow in bijels.  Continuous extraction in bijels will be demonstrated, followed by study of phase transfer catalysis of a model reaction in a bijel.  Educational and outreach activities include the development of a ""droplet engineering"" course for high school students, a course on colloidal and interfacial engineering for undergraduates, a course on soft matter nanotechnology for graduate students, and expansion of instructional videos on the principle investigator's YouTube channel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Visual analytic technologies help people in a variety of these domains including business, health, education, national security, and many more. These visual analytic techniques are effective since they combine powerful machine learning with interactive data visualization. Currently, the way that people use such systems is through user interfaces with control panels to adjust parameters of the analytic models and visualization properties directly. For example, controls may ask users to select which analytic model to use, which parameter to adjust, and by how much. However, when people do not have the necessary expertise or training in data science or information visualization, they may not be able to properly use these tools and miss out on important insights. Instead, this project will explore, design, develop, and evaluate techniques that allow people to demonstrate their analytic goals, tasks, and operations. Developing this ""visual analytics by demonstration"" method of user interaction has the potential to impact numerous data-driven domains, and society more broadly. This project will also provide educational experience and research training for graduate and undergraduate students to guide them towards careers in computing.<br/><br/>The proposed research will create Visual Analytics by Demonstration prototypes, generalizable toolkits, and demonstration primitives to foster exploration and discovery in visual analytics. Instead of control panels that require users to directly parameterize analytic models and visualizations, people provide demonstrations, from which the system selects the appropriate visual representation, analytic model, and parameters. To realize the benefits of such technology, many research challenges exist and must be addressed. For instance, what are the basic demonstration primitives that people use to communicate their intent to a system? How can systems interpret these demonstrations and perform the correct analytic and visualization operations? Finally, how can these systems guard against potential user bias in exploring data using by-demonstration? Project objectives include the design, implementation, and evaluation of by-demonstration visual analytic prototypes. The research will perform formative studies to develop demonstration primitives categorized by user tasks. The project will design and develop applications for specific data domains as well as general, open-sourced toolkits for other researchers to use and extend. User studies will identify if and how specific tasks and operations can be performed by demonstrations, and how these compare in performance to current control panel interfaces. The proposed work will also create instructional material to integrate visual analytics by demonstration into courses that teach visual analytics, or data science more generally. The project website (http://va.gatech.edu/projects/visual-analytics-by-demonstration/) will include project information, links to resulting publications, videos, and open-source software produced.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objectives of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award are to: 1) investigate relationships that exist between congestion dynamics at the local (e.g., individual intersections or roadways) and regional (e.g., city-wide) spatial scales; and, 2) use this knowledge to identify strategies that can effectively combat urban traffic congestion at individual intersections, along corridors and across entire regions simultaneously. The relationships between local and regional congestion dynamics will be integrated into a novel multi-scale congestion modeling framework for optimizing and refining contemporary traffic control policies as well as supporting the development of advanced congestion management strategies that will become available as connected and automated vehicles are integrated into urban environments. The proposed research will be integrated with a set of educational activities to advance our knowledge in traffic management and promote national prosperity and welfare. Specific education activities include collaboration with local transportation agencies who will provide data to verify the identified relationships and support real-world project-based learning activities and demonstrate a holistic, multi-scale view of traffic congestion. These activities will be shared through the creation of an electronic repository of undergraduate course materials on traffic operations. The PI will also develop interactive, online simulations to demonstrate the relationships between local and regional congestion dynamics and integrate these into ""Expanding Youth Horizons"" STEM outreach workshops targeted to local female middle school students. <br/><br/>This research will integrate novel models of regional congestion dynamics that relate network productivity and accumulation--the network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD)--with existing link-based modeling paradigms. These two disparate approaches will be combined by identifying and quantifying interdependencies between local and regional network properties and congestion dynamics along each of these spatial scales. Theories and methodologies will be developed to unveil network characteristics and local congestion patterns that are conducive to the existence of reproducible and predictable regional congestion models for realistic urban traffic networks. This includes the identification of the building blocks necessary to characterize regional traffic network performance for networks made up of hierarchical streets and that serve heterogeneous traffic streams. Insights obtained for these heterogeneous network structures will also serve as the basis to study and design more sophisticated systems, particularly multimodal traffic networks with multiple unique and interacting vehicle classes. Integration of this regional MFD approach with existing link-based modeling paradigms will provide a framework that facilitates automated traffic control policies to coordinate regional and local traffic performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These oceanic organisms act as oceanic vacuum cleaners, having incredibly high feeding rates on phytoplankton and, unusual for consumers of their size, smaller bacteria-sized prey.  This rapid feeding and the salps' tendency to form dense blooms, allows them move substantial amounts of prey carbon from the surface into the deep ocean, leading to carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere.  However, salps are often considered a trophic dead-end, rather than a link, in the food web due to the assumption that they themselves are not consumed, since their gelatinous bodies are less nutritious than co-occurring crustacean prey.  Along with this, salp populations are hypothesized to be increasing due to climate change.  This proposal addresses these questions: 1) Do salps compete primarily with crustaceans (as in the prevailing paradigm) or are they competitors of single-celled protists, which are the dominant grazers of small phytoplankton?  2) Do salp blooms increase the efficiency of food-web pathways from tiny phytoplankton to fisheries production in nutrient-poor ocean regions?   <br/><br/>This project will support the interdisciplinary education of a graduate student who will learn modeling and laboratory techniques in the fields of biological and chemical oceanography and stimulate international collaborations between scientists in the United States and New Zealand.  Additionally, several Education and Outreach initiatives are planned, including development of a week-long immersive high school class in biological oceanography, and education modules that will serve the ""scientists-in-the schools"" program in Tallahassee, FL.<br/><br/>It is commonly assumed that salps are a trophic sink.  However, this idea was developed before the discovery that protists (rather than crustaceans) are the dominant grazers in the open ocean and was biased by the difficulty of recognizing gelatinous salps in fish guts.  More recent studies show that salps are found in guts of a diverse group of fish and seabirds and are a readily available prey source when crustacean abundance is low.  This proposal seeks to quantify food web flows through contrasting salp-dominated and salp-absent water parcels near the Chatham Rise off western New Zealand where salp blooms are a predictable phenomenon.  The proposal will leverage previously obtained data on salp abundance, bulk grazing impact, and biogeochemical significance during Lagrangian experiments conducted by New Zealand-based collaborators.  The proposal will determine 1) taxon- and size-specific phytoplankton growth rate measurements, 2) taxon- and size-specific protozoan and salp grazing rate measurements, 3) compound specific isotopic analysis of the amino acids of mesozooplankton to quantify the trophic position of salps, hyperiid amphipods, and other crustaceans, 4) sediment traps to quantify zooplankton carcass sinking rates, and 5) linear inverse ecosystem modeling syntheses.  Secondary production and trophic flows from this well-constrained ecosystem model will be compared to crustacean-dominated and microbial loop-dominated ecosystems in similarly characterized regions (California Current, Costa Rica Dome, and Gulf of Mexico).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research in Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices focuses on the novel design of architectures that interact with biological systems and promote a desired response. These advanced architectures have numerous applications including tissue engineering, sensing systems, and drug delivery. Students will be recruited from various undergraduate disciplines including engineering, biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics. There are numerous regional colleges and universities surrounding the University of Kentucky that have no graduate programs in these areas. Recruitment at these institutions will encourage students that may not otherwise pursue an advanced degree. In addition, recruitment for the program will focus on national institutions that do not have graduate programs. Special efforts will be made to attract women and minorities to this program by recruiting at minority institutions and publicizing the program at national meetings of minority and women organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers. Students accepted into the program will work closely with faculty and graduate students who are currently engaged in collaborative, cross-disciplinary research. The proposed REU program builds on these successful collaborations and integrates them with other educational components, such as seminars, workshops, and other technical and social activities. The students will be exposed to the excitement of interdisciplinary research and by the end of the program will have an excellent knowledge of what is involved in graduate research. <br/><br/>The need for this REU Site's cross-disciplinary interaction between investigators working in biological systems and those creating novel engineered synthetic architectures has long been recognized. Successful development of these systems will depend on expertise not only in developing novel synthetic architectures through nanotechnology, self-assembly and hybrid systems but also on the interactions of these interfaces with biological systems such as cells and proteins. As part of the 10-week summer REU program, the undergraduate students will have the opportunity to learn about three cross-disciplinary research themes that form the foundation of the research in this area. These include: 1) Novel Bioactive Architectures, 2) Cell/Protein Interactions at Interfaces, and 3) Integration into Devices. The students will work closely with faculty and graduate students who are currently engaged in collaborative, cross-disciplinary research across these three themes further supporting a highly multidisciplinary team research approach. This REU Program will not only provide the students with true interdisciplinary mentoring and research training but will also stimulate the students' interests in Ph.D. careers in science and engineering through seminars, field trips and interactions with both graduate students and faculty, and will develop the students' independence and confidence through participation in research and presentations both in house and at scientific meetings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In plants, the mechanisms of pigment production have been well-studied, but surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of complex patterns of pigmentation. Filling this knowledge gap is the goal of this research. This project will study two species of monkeyflower; each has flowers with strikingly different color patterns. What's more, when the two species are mated together, new intricate and complex color patterns emerge. Since these new pigmentation patterns are seen only when different species are mated together, it suggests that interactions between their genomes give rise to the new patterns. Exploring how such interactions between different genomes can produce unexpected new traits is a primary focus of this research. One master's student, six undergraduates, and six high school students will be recruited to carry out this work. These students will be exposed to high-impact learning opportunities as they are immersed in hands-on scientific research.  At least two of the high school students will be selected from a high school that specifically serves disadvantaged youth.<br/><br/>The pigmentation patterns in the hybrids of Mimulus cupreus x M. luteus var. variegatus are too intricate to quantify using standard approaches. Instead, a new digital image analysis pipeline is being developed. This approach will be useful for analyzing spatial patterning in monkeyflowers and in other taxa. The researchers will use this new method to identify and quantify elements of floral color pattern in a phenotypically diverse F2 hybrid population. Next-generation sequencing will be used to map the genomic regions responsible for the observed variation in flower patterns. Because M. cupreus and M. l. variegatus also differ in yellow carotenoid pigmentation, the same phenotypic and genetic datasets will be used to identify the genetic basis of divergent carotenoid production, which is an important but under-studied component of plant physiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymer composite usage is growing rapidly; driven by increasing demand for high-strength, lightweight materials in the automotive, aerospace, and civil infrastructure industries. In these primarily outdoor applications, loss of load-bearing ability over time is driven by material property changes in response to the complex and combined effects of mechanical and environmental stresses. A fundamental understanding of these changes is crucial to safe operation throughout the life cycle of the structure. To derive this understanding, the experimental approach in this research project takes advantage of changes in dielectric behavior of absorbed atmospheric water molecules in response to damage initiation and progression. By tracking the ability of water molecules to rotate in response to an oscillating electromagnetic field, early and non-visible changes in the chemical and physical characteristics of the material can be measured. The new and valuable insight into the mechanisms responsible for the progression of damage derived from these measurements will improve our ability to design more robust materials and better predict impending failure, thus advancing national health, prosperity, welfare, and national defense. The research will be complemented by an effort to provide access to K-12 summer engineering camp activities at North Carolina State University for students from rural and isolated urban communities. A sustainable process for packaging and disseminating these high-value educational resources will be developed and implemented, expanding their impact beyond the students attending the on-site camps and increasing visibility and knowledge of engineering among students who may not otherwise consider or pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the research is to derive the mechanistic underpinnings of polymer composite damage progression across spatial scales in response to coupled thermal, hygroscopic, and mechanical loading. The specific objectives in support of this goal are to: (i) describe the link between water-polymer interaction and topology, nanovoid content, polarity, and hygrothermal aging of fiber-reinforced epoxies; (ii) connect the response of absorbed molecular water to multiscale damage induced by dynamic, fatigue, and impact loading; (iii) use a neural-network technique to extract the salient variables that govern damage progression for use in deriving a mechanistic understanding of the molecular precursors to damage; and (iv) reconcile the experimental and neural-network derived insights with the physical basis of state-of-the-art multiscale, multiphysics simulation techniques. This project will allow the PI to expand the knowledge base in mechanics and materials science, enabling safer and more efficient use of polymer composites across multiple industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed work will use specific biosourced and biodegradable plastics and process them to obtain conducting composites, thereby extending their use to electronic applications.  By confining the synthesis to two dimensions, the principal investigator (PI) will also explore synthesis of conducting plastic materials with fewer defects that may possess higher intrinsic conductivity. Using these materials, the PI plans to fabricate fibers having diameters roughly one-thousandth that of a human hair using an electrospinning technique.  Devices and sensors fabricated from these fibers may then have superior operating properties compared to those prepared from thicker films of the same material. For example, sensors may be able to detect toxic gases at low concentrations and higher speeds. The planned research is interdisciplinary involving materials science, physics, chemistry, nanoscience, and electronics. Students will be trained in multiple disciplines thereby preparing them to enter the workforce with a diverse set of skills. This project will also focus on educating and mentoring undergraduates, recruiting students, and conducting outreach in science and engineering.  It will thus increase the number of research-experienced undergraduates from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.<br/><br/> <br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The principal investigator (PI) will work with sustainable polymers that are biosourced and biodegradable and render them usable for electroactive applications via fabrication of composites with conducting polymers. In addition, he plans to synthesize conducting polymers in a confined environment, where in-situ confinement during polymerization may lead to fewer chain defects and ultimately higher intrinsic conductivity. Besides thin films, nanofibers of the electro-active polymers will also be fabricated and characterized via temperature-dependent charge transport and dielectric relaxation studies. Nanofibers naturally possess a confined environment for charge flow, and studies on such fibers may lead to reduced defects. The results from the fundamental research on charge transport and charge relaxation will be used to prepare devices and sensors with superior operating characteristics. The planned research includes an interdisciplinary combination of materials science, physics, chemistry, nanoscience and electronics. It will provide undergraduates with a sound research experience thereby preparing them to enter the workforce with a diverse set of skills.

This project compares the trajectories of two mega-cities that in began in the 1980s and early 1990s from roughly equivalent situations, including a relatively high level of local governance and commitment to delivery of urban public goods such as housing, sanitation, and public transportation.  Yet despite similar goals and strategies, while state interventions have reduced urban inequalities in one of these cities, they have reproduced these inequalities in the other one.  This project promises to generate new insights into the relationship between states, democracy, and urban inequalities.  Findings will be useful for urban policymaking in the midst of social change.  They will inform understanding of how cities can coordinate politics and institutional change to deliver public goods.<br/><br/>This project will use multiple methods to compare public goods provision in So Paulo, Brazil and Johannesburg, South Africa.  The methods are: a) field-based participant observation and interviews with key public and private actors; b) archival research of legislation, newspapers, trade publications, and internal government and NGO documents; and c) spatial analysis of 25 years of quantitative data on housing, sanitation and transportation.  The research design and comparative-historical methods of analysis make it possible to disaggregate changes in interactions between social coalitions and state institutions over time, and to specify the mechanisms of these changes.

However, not all people and communities respond the same. In the research supported by this award, the researcher investigates the processes that produce these variable outcomes. Research in the United States and elsewhere has shown that multiple factors, at the community as well as the individual level, work together to produce health outcomes. Therefore, it is not surprising that policies that focus only on individual economic challenges may miss the positive and negative effects of community-level buffers already in place. This research project, which also trains a graduate student in the collection of empirical scientific data, seeks to answer the questions: How do communities respond to economic stress? How do communities buffer against it, and do these mechanisms unintentionally facilitate unhealthy behavior? The answers to these questions are of critical importance to U.S policy makers committed to improving local health outcomes.<br/><br/>The research will be undertaken by Case Western Reserve University anthropology doctoral student, Megan M. Schmidt-Sane, under the supervision of Dr. Janet W. McGrath. The research will be conducted in two communities in Kampala, Uganda. Uganda was chosen for the research because recent changes in local government labor policies have put many people out of work. Therefore, because the researchers have access to baseline health data, the situation is a natural experiment in how people respond to sudden economic stress, how traditional buffering mechanisms are put into play, and whether these mechanisms prevent or increase poor health outcomes. The researcher will collect data over one year using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative anthropological methods, including: community censuses, surveys, in-depth interviews, and participant observation. These data will allow her to assess specific pathways between the larger socio-economic context, individuals, and risk, resilience, and vulnerability. Findings will facilitate integrating these concepts  as well as scientific understanding of the mechanisms by which economic stress affects health. This can then become the basis for improved policy in the United States. Results will be disseminated widely in academic and public health settings, providing insight into the factors that are simultaneously resilient and vulnerable, and the potential pathways to resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, a VQA system could enable blind people to address daily visual challenges such as learning whether a pair of socks match or learning what type of food is in a can.  VQA services could also facilitate the creation of smarter environments, say to monitor how many defective products are on a factory assembly line at any given time.  A limitation of existing VQA systems is that they do not account for the fact that a visual question may elicit different answers from different people.  VQA systems could save time and reduce user frustration if they empowered users to anticipate and resolve any answer disagreements that may arise.  Blind and sighted people could more rapidly and accurately learn about the diversity of human perspectives on the visual world.  VQA services also could teach people how to ask visual questions that elicit the desired answer diversity.<br/><br/>This project will create artificial intelligence (AI) models that can account for the possible diversity of answers inherent in crowd intelligence.  Specifically, AI models will be designed to predict when, why, and how human answer disagreement occurs, which in turn will enable new designs for human-computer partnerships.  This is challenging because it necessitates designing frameworks that simultaneously model and synthesize different and potentially conflicting perceptions of images and language for the many possible causes of disagreement.  To ensure that the AI models generalize across a broad range of applications, an existing corpus of over one million visual questions asked by blind and sighted people will be used to create annotated datasets that indicate when, why, and how much answer disagreement arises.  Methods will then be developed for automatically predicting directly from a visual question how much answer diversity will arise from a crowd, and why disagreement arises when it does.  Finally, a system will be designed for guiding visually-impaired users to more quickly formulate visual questions so they can receive a single, unambiguous crowd response (e.g., guide the person to better frame the visual content of interest with a mobile phone camera).  User studies with blind users will be conducted to empirically test the efficacy of the new system, with a focus on uncovering human-based issues in real-world, real-time situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vascular plants include lycopods, ferns and their allies, as well as conifers and flowering plants. They form the foundation of nearly all terrestrial ecosystems and our food supply, yet scientists disagree about when and how they evolved. Current methods for estimating evolutionary timelines for these species have led to conflicting answers, as they rely on the ability of researchers to assign extinct fossil species correctly to particular branch points in the tree of life. This assignment is challenging to do because extinct species may have morphology that can be interpreted differently. Researchers will refine a new data analysis method to address this limitation. They will compare the DNA sequences of living vascular plants and incorporate morphological data from both living and extinct species to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. During this process, researchers will apply new computer algorithms to estimate the evolutionary timeline for the species. Researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of an early-career researcher. They will educate the public about plant evolution by creating an interpretive exhibit at the University of California Berkeley and by producing a series of online video lessons for high school students and educators.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new total-evidence dating method to reconstruct the next-generation of time-calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses that incorporate both extinct and extant species. Researchers will leverage DNA sequence data collected by an existing NSF award to reconstruct a backbone phylogeny of ca. 300 extant vascular plants using nuclear genomic data. They will also collect morphological data for ca. 300 traits from these species as well as ca. 200 extinct fossil species. These data will be simultaneously integrated by the software program RevBayes to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny. This program combines sophisticated tree-shape priors, powerful models of morphological evolution, and recently developed methods for relaxing the molecular clock. Project outcomes will include a robust estimate of vascular plant divergence times and patterns of morphological evolution with an explicit measure of the full associated uncertainty of that estimate. The project will support research by sharing new and legacy morphological datasets in the online, open-access PROTEUS database and by hosting a training workshop focused on refining the theory and practice of divergence-time dating.

Educational development activities for undergraduate classmen participating in the Spacecraft Group at BYU will culminate in the participation of BURST projects (undergraduate research) to assist students in the pursuit of a graduate education and provide a mechanism to explore the research project. Activities performed with students in the Spacecraft Group include outreach to underrepresented minority high school students by assisting with college preparation, K-12 STEM activities with low-income schools, and the creation of a website for access to data and instructional tools.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to provide dynamic control of radiative surface properties using origami-inspired surfaces.

Intrinsic radiative surface properties are static and therefore unable to adapt to changing thermal environments. Dynamically controlling the net radiative heat flux by controlling radiative properties would enable thermal management of surfaces where radiation is a dominant mode of heat exchange with the environment. Origami-inspired surfaces, comprised of tessellations (a tiled plane comprised of one or more geometric shapes), are able to provide an adaptable surface topography to modify the apparent radiative surface behavior. As the tessellations that comprise the unfolded surface collapse on each other during folding, deep grooves are formed which trap radiative energy due to the high-aspect ratio of the cavity. Controlling the cavity angle through mechanical actuation results in control of the degree of black-like behavior. To achieve the goal of providing thermal management through controllable radiative properties, the following objectives in the study of origami-inspired surfaces (e.g. Modified V-groove, Miura-ori, and Baretto Mars) will be pursued: 1) quantify and model emission of thermal radiation; 2) quantify and model absorption of thermal radiation; 3) predict and validate the net heat transfer rate at these surfaces; and 4) establish undergraduate research preparation through training activities that culminate in a research experience. Tools and analysis methods developed by this work will enable design for radiative thermal management through simple actuation methods and provide predictive relations for radiative behavior of angular topographies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how and why some groups have come to be more species-rich than other groups is a central and unsolved problem in the life sciences. One class of explanations for these differences in species numbers involves the rate at which new species arise. Using tools from genome biology and computational data science, this project will identify the mechanisms that lead to different rates of species formation and quantify their importance in a major group of vertebrate animals.  The project will provide training in genomics, geographic information systems, computational biology, and biodiversity science for students and researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Genomic resources and new scientific software developed for the project will be made publicly available, and a museum exhibit will highlight the ways in which genomics and computer programming are changing the way scientists study and understand the diversity of life forms on Earth.<br/><br/>This project will produce a novel synthesis between population biology and large-scale patterns of species diversity by integrating next-generation population genomics with a phylogenetic comparative perspective on lineage diversification rates. The project will quantify the genomic signal of several population processes to address how rates of population splitting and persistence influence speciation rates as measured on time-calibrated phylogenetic trees. These objectives will be supported by estimating phylogeographic and population genomic parameters across many species of squamate reptiles that vary in rates of speciation, and by developing new methods to link these parameters to diversification rates on phylogenetic trees. The project will also assess how organismal traits (life history, dispersal biology, population size) contribute to demographic processes that can influence the formation and persistence of incipient species. The project will provide a bridge between biological processes that occur at two very different timescales and will provide an understanding of how changes in populations at ecological timescales affect changes in biological diversity at deep (million-year) timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These oceanic organisms act as oceanic vacuum cleaners, having incredibly high feeding rates on phytoplankton and, unusual for consumers of their size, smaller bacteria-sized prey.  This rapid feeding and the salps' tendency to form dense blooms, allows them move substantial amounts of prey carbon from the surface into the deep ocean, leading to carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere.  However, salps are often considered a trophic dead-end, rather than a link, in the food web due to the assumption that they themselves are not consumed, since their gelatinous bodies are less nutritious than co-occurring crustacean prey.  Along with this, salp populations are hypothesized to be increasing due to climate change.  This proposal addresses these questions: 1) Do salps compete primarily with crustaceans (as in the prevailing paradigm) or are they competitors of single-celled protists, which are the dominant grazers of small phytoplankton?  2) Do salp blooms increase the efficiency of food-web pathways from tiny phytoplankton to fisheries production in nutrient-poor ocean regions?   <br/><br/>This project will support the interdisciplinary education of a graduate student who will learn modeling and laboratory techniques in the fields of biological and chemical oceanography and stimulate international collaborations between scientists in the United States and New Zealand.  Additionally, several Education and Outreach initiatives are planned, including development of a week-long immersive high school class in biological oceanography, and education modules that will serve the ""scientists-in-the schools"" program in Tallahassee, FL.<br/><br/>It is commonly assumed that salps are a trophic sink.  However, this idea was developed before the discovery that protists (rather than crustaceans) are the dominant grazers in the open ocean and was biased by the difficulty of recognizing gelatinous salps in fish guts.  More recent studies show that salps are found in guts of a diverse group of fish and seabirds and are a readily available prey source when crustacean abundance is low.  This proposal seeks to quantify food web flows through contrasting salp-dominated and salp-absent water parcels near the Chatham Rise off western New Zealand where salp blooms are a predictable phenomenon.  The proposal will leverage previously obtained data on salp abundance, bulk grazing impact, and biogeochemical significance during Lagrangian experiments conducted by New Zealand-based collaborators.  The proposal will determine 1) taxon- and size-specific phytoplankton growth rate measurements, 2) taxon- and size-specific protozoan and salp grazing rate measurements, 3) compound specific isotopic analysis of the amino acids of mesozooplankton to quantify the trophic position of salps, hyperiid amphipods, and other crustaceans, 4) sediment traps to quantify zooplankton carcass sinking rates, and 5) linear inverse ecosystem modeling syntheses.  Secondary production and trophic flows from this well-constrained ecosystem model will be compared to crustacean-dominated and microbial loop-dominated ecosystems in similarly characterized regions (California Current, Costa Rica Dome, and Gulf of Mexico).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Voices to Hear (V2H) will use the oral tradition of storytelling to empower Native American students (middle school, high school and college) to engage in environmental decision-making and scientific communication, while building a stronger sense of their ethnic identity. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe (CdAT), University of Idaho, and University of New Hampshire research alliance will recruit and work with middle school, high school, and undergraduate students from the CdAT Reservation in Idaho and other Tribal youth who attend University of Idaho, to develop high-quality audio documentaries focused on environmental decision-making processes. The production of a three- or five-minute high- quality audio documentary/podcast is a multilayered, labor-intensive process that emphasizes scientific inquiry, patience, and perseverance, ultimately requiring observation, data collection, analysis, and building a summary or conclusion.  While podcasts resonate strongly with the oral storytelling traditions of native American youth, they also provide a mechanism for conducting scientific inquiry. The project focuses on students learning about how to merge different knowledge systems (Western- mainstream/dominant science perspective, and Indigenous traditional knowledge) in order to become effective environmental decision-makers in the future. By investigating how community members resolve local environmental problems, students will be mentored by traditional and professional experts, and learn to utilize both STEM and cultural perspectives to solve environmental issues.  The project will develop and implement a unique, vertically integrated mentoring model where Native undergraduate students will be trained to mentor high school and middle school students, thereby helping middle school and high school students learn about pathways to college and other careers. <br/><br/>The V2H project will examine how people from Native American communities negotiate their Indigenous knowledge sources with Western science to make decisions in their everyday lives. The project grounds itself in research on how student's ethnic identity impacts their science learning and also decision-making capacity in their everyday life. Project research will employ a mixed-methods design. The project will address several research questions: (1) What complex systems thinking attributes do students demonstrate? (2) How do students merge or negotiate different knowledge systems (Indigenous and Western)? (3) How do the students ethnic identity change through both audio documentary making and mentoring? (4) What aspects of complex thinking and integrating knowledge systems improve students attitudes toward traditional and non-traditional STEM topics? Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and parallel data analysis will be implemented through the life of the project.  In order to understand what complex thinking attributes students demonstrate, the project will employ a pre- and post- modeling activity, using Mental Modeler, software that allows individuals to define components of a system and show the interconnectedness between the components of that system.

Public memorialization often emerges in the aftermath of fraught, sometimes violent, encounters. The spaces dedicated to preserving those social memories can therefore function as much to resolve conflicts as to erase or remember particular identities or histories. This has been well-documented within formal, public spaces, but we know less about the informal mechanisms through which commemorative spaces are established, maintained, and contested. This project, which trains a student in methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, conducts a case study of informal forms of memorialization in an American city in order to understand what impact the establishment and maintenance of a commemorative sites has on identity formation, civil society, and violence reduction. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations engaged in policy dialogues related to understanding the origins and motivations for urban violence, and to what extent memorialization attenuates its prevalence.<br/> <br/>Harvard University anthropology doctoral student Samantha Hawkins, under the supervision of Dr. Laurence Ralph, will explore the inner-city as a complex, affective landscape, wherein urban memorials function as tools of cultural recollection in a context marked by violence. These memorials are also sites of regulation and contestation, made evident by their ongoing obliteration and reinscription. She will conduct ethnographic fieldwork in Baltimore, which is an ideal site to conduct the study as it has the second highest per capita murder rate in the U.S. The makeup of and changes to memorials in Baltimore, the different levels of engagement and investment, the varying reasons that they are erected and/or destroyed, the patterns of aesthetic composition, demonstrate something significant about material claims to space and identity. The project asks how social relations and political ideologies are woven into a topography of memory. Can a material object both reflect political authority and social hierarchies, while also serving efforts of urban black populations to preserve a cultural identity? The investigator will employ a range of qualitative ethnographically-grounded techniques, pursuing three key areas of inquiry: how the memorial functions as an object of argument through which survivors of those lost to violence seek to legitimize their lived experience and assert value; the role of urban space in re-presenting material traces of memory and defining personhood; and the impact of violence in the formation of identities. This research will produce a critical account of memory politics in Baltimore's inner-city, contributing both to the anthropology of race and class, as well as broader scientific debates about memorialization.<br/><br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Instead of relying on new construction, the PI will demonstrate how existing stormwater systems can be used more efficiently and made ""smarter"" through the use of wireless sensors, valves, and pumps to address this national issue. This approach will enable automatic control of stormwater systems to reduce flooding and improve water quality. To this end, the PI will investigate computational methods to embed stormwater systems with ""intelligence,"" helping to reduce the cost of improving US infrastructure while protecting public health and the environment. The PI will also develop training programs for a new generation of technicians, who will deploy and maintain smart stormwater systems.  <br/><br/>The PI will improve the fundamental understanding of the water flow and water quality benefits that can be achieved through the real-time control of urban watersheds. Results of this research will lead to a theoretical and conceptual framework to begin studying the impacts of autonomous technologies on the scale of entire watersheds. The research hypothesis of this proposal is that ""smart"" stormwater systems will vastly shrink the size of infrastructure required to manage runoff pollution. The hypothesis will be tested across three objectives: (1) investigate new algorithms, based on dynamical systems theory and reinforcement learning to control flows across city-scale stormwater systems, (2) study the distributed real-time control of water quality across the scale of entire watersheds with a focus on removing of sediment-bound and dissolved pollutants, and (3) explore how competing water flow and water quality goals can be unified to resiliently manage urban watersheds in real-time. Results of this research will allow entire watersheds to be controlled, akin to large distributed treatment plants, while vastly improving the fundamental understanding of the benefits, tradeoffs, and performance limits of ""smart"" water systems.

To maintain America's previously-held strategic position of command in Science and Engineering, American students need greater encouragement to pursue advanced studies in Science/Technology/Engineering/Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site aims to encourage more American undergraduates in Computer Science to pursue graduate studies, and to assist them in realizing their full potential as researchers. The investigators believe that the best way to achieve these aims is to immerse capable undergraduates within a successful, active research group for a sufficient duration. This exposes them to the intellectual excitement that is involved in research activity, encourages them to think creatively and independently, and helps them to develop the skills necessary to work on research projects. This project represents renewal of the REU site in Computer Vision, which has operated successfully for the past thirty years. It is important to continue educating the next generation of computing researchers, including a special emphasis on engaging underrepresented members in computing fields and those students attending institutions that do not have substantial research opportunities. Dissemination of the best practices to other institutions remains our site's deep commitment and is achieved by publication in educational venues, and involvement in the REU community.<br/><br/>This project has ten undergraduate researchers per year, for three years. Each year, undergraduate researchers participate in a ten week, full-time Summer program, with optional follow-on part-time participation during the subsequent Fall and Spring. The key elements of our approach are (1) a full Summer experience for the undergraduate researchers, providing sufficient time to follow a substantial project through to completion, (2) to present each undergraduate researcher with several possible project topics, so that they can feel they have chosen a project which is most interesting to them, (3) to immerse the undergraduate researchers in the general research environment essentially as if they were graduate students, by having them meet with their faculty advisor regularly to discuss their project, participate in the weekly research group meetings, attend research presentations, PhD defenses and PhD proposal presentation and meet with visiting distinguished researchers, (4) to offer undergraduate researchers an optional follow-through over the year by working with the undergraduate  researchers to write a (publishable) technical report on their project, (5) to expose them to the benefits of graduate school through a half-day workshop on Why grad school, How to apply to grad school and fellowships, How to prepare for the standardized entrance exams, (6) to take them for field trips to local technology companies involved in real world applications of computer vision, and (7) to offer them mentoring at social events: group lunches, banquet, picnic, parties, etc. This site has been successful in contributing to educating generations of researchers.

The field of meta-science, which performs the scientific study of science itself, is thriving and has examined the existence and prevalence of threats to reproducible and robust research.  Most existing replication efforts in social sciences, however, have focused on studies using data from statistically rigorous designed surveys or experiments. Largely missing are replication efforts devoted to examining those studies with organic data, including data organically generated by ubiquitous sensors or mobile applications, twitter feeds, click streams, etc.  This project examines the inconsistent handling practices of organic data among scholarly publications in social sciences, in order to establish the confidence (or the lack thereof) in the conclusions drawn from such data analysis.  Since findings of social and behavioral sciences inform policy makers on a wide variety of issues, from homeland security to national economy, establishing the confidence of these findings is critical for the proper usage of them, and therefore has broader impacts on all these application areas of national priority.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project starts with determining the extent of, causes of, and remedies for empirical research using organic data that are neither reproducible nor generalizable.  The findings from this step raise awareness about the standards and tools for collecting, cleaning, and processing organic data sets across many fields of social sciences. In addition, this project develops new analytical frameworks and methodologies useful for evaluating replicability and robustness of empirical studies with organic data. The vision is for such frameworks to be broadly used in many application domains, thereby fostering cultural change across different fields in social sciences, and bringing the value of reproducibility and robustness to the forefront of data intensive research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These material systems can potentially bear mechanical loads but also perform other duties.  The research aims at transforming the ancient art of origami into a theoretical framework for designing multi-functional materials.  It is envisioned that these multi-functional origami materials can significantly advance the performance and sustainability of many strategic applications like morphing airframes, adaptive wind turbines, energy harvesters, and medical devices.   Origami folding - due to its seemingly infinite capabilities of developing 3D geometries from 2D sheets - is becoming an increasingly popular subject among mathematicians, educators, architects, and engineers.  However, we are still scratching the surface of its potential.  The research will formulate a systematic method: analysis, design, and experiment, to fully uncover the physics underpinning the 3D multi-stability from folding.   Such physical insights will be exploited to create linkages to translate these stability properties into unprecedented material functions, such as on-demand property programming, static diode effects, and motion rectification.  Research results will also be leveraged to enhance origami as an engaging teaching tool through the creation of a book of origami folding exercises for teaching engineering. The research will also lead to a Creative Inquiry project for undergraduates, in collaboration with the Clemson Engineers for Developing Countries program, on the design of origami emergency shelters in Haiti. This project will produce educational tools that are specifically designed to be adopted by other educators to train high-quality researchers and engineers as well as to motivate K-12 students to pursue undergraduate and graduate STEM study. The research outcomes of this project will enable new low-cost material systems to adaptively protect infrastructure systems from natural and man-made disasters and to increase the collection of energy from renewable sources.<br/><br/>Multi-stability has been used to create many multi-functional materials and structures for shape reconfiguration, property adaptation, vibration control, and energy harvesting.  However, current systems are built upon low dimensional mechanisms such as the buckled beams, the simplicity of which severely limits their overall potential.   This CAREER award aims to leverage the mechanics of origami folding to advance the study of multi-stable systems into the fundamentally three-dimensional domain. The sophisticated shape transformations via folding can impart novel stability properties that are unavailable in the lower dimensional mechanisms, including the anisotropic arrangement of stable and unstable states, asymmetric energy barrier between stable states, and the use of pressurization to eliminate or create stable equilibria.  This project will formulate nonlinear mechanics analysis, experiment validation, and crease design methodologies to harness these stability properties and synthesize architected multi-functional material systems.  This project, if successful, will create a new field of three-dimensional multi-stability, including a high-fidelity mechanics modeling process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Driven by this need, various physical or chemical mechanisms have been developed to enhance the fracture resistance of soft materials, and they share a common theme: to introduce energy dissipation or consumption by the material during deformation. However, theoretical modeling and experimental characterization of fracture in such soft dissipative materials are challenging due to the lack of understandings on the quantitative relation between energy dissipation and fracture resistance. This research program will establish experimental and modeling capabilities to uncover the complex nonlinear mechanics associated with soft material fracture, which will lead to quantitative principles for engineering new soft functional materials that are mechanically robust, as well as new tools to measure and predict fracture in soft materials. Thus, the research will promote the science of soft material fracture to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. As part of research, education and outreach programs will be developed to promote research of soft material fracture in academic, educational and industrial sectors by creating an interdisciplinary summer workshop, integrating research findings into curriculum and K-12 outreach activities, and building collaborations with industrial partners.<br/><br/>A major challenge in soft material fracture is the large deformation near the tip of a crack, which causes nonlinear strain and stress fields as well as complex failure and dissipation behaviors. To address this challenge, a particle tracking method will be used to measure the crack tip deformation field in model soft materials under various fracture modes. For elastic materials, the experiments will provide data to assess the region of validity for existing crack tip asymptotic solutions, to discover new structures of crack tip fields, and to enable local evaluation of energy release rate through the J-integral, thus eliminating the requirement of specialized experimental geometries. For dissipative materials, the experimental data of crack tip deformation field, augmented by accurate constitutive models, will be used to identify the crack tip dissipation zone and to separately measure the intrinsic and dissipative toughness. A finite element model will also be developed to couple the crack tip failure process, represented by a cohesive zone, with the bulk material dissipation, which will enable the prediction of crack growth in soft dissipative materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A liquid tightly confined between two solid surfaces at a gap spacing comparable to its molecular dimension can behave very different from its bulk state. Increased friction is commonly observed with confined liquids, often due to the solidification of the liquid when confined. Prior research of confined liquids has mostly focused on hard and well-structured confining walls. Yet many biological and engineering processes involve highly soft and deformable surfaces, such as lubrication between synovial and cartilaginous joints, motions of red blood cells in capillaries, and even the aquaplaning of rubbery tires. The impact of surface stiffness on fluid lubrication remains poorly understood. This grant supports fundamental research to understand the effect of surface stiffness on the structure and friction of strongly confined liquids, whose confining wall stiffness can be varied to be relevant of many real world systems. The knowledge gained from this investigation can be transformed to control fluid transport by optimizing surface mechanical elasticity and design low-friction interfaces for energy saving in various industrial applications. Broader impacts of this project will also include the recruitment and training of underrepresented students, including women students, as the next generation of American engineers. <br/><br/>This project addresses the long-debated questions of surface-induced glass transition and friction augment of spatially confined liquids. A quantitative understanding of the effect of surface stiffness on the dynamics of confined liquids between deformable surfaces will be developed by in-situ microscopic characterization at a single-particle level. The surface-to-liquid stiffness ratios will be tuned in a single microgel system by using microgel particles of varied crosslinking degrees as both surface coatings and confined liquids. A micron-gap tribometer integrated with confocal laser scanning microscopy enables the measurement of the heterogeneous dynamics and friction of confined microgel liquids between two deformable surfaces against varied gap spacings and shear conditions. The relationship among surface stiffness, confinement length scales, dynamic heterogeneity, and shear-induced fluidity of confined liquids will be quantified. The results obtained from this research will give molecular insight to confinement-induced glassy dynamics and biolubrication involving highly deformable surfaces. The success of this project can lead to a new avenue by judicious design and control of the mechanical compliance of surfaces and coatings to modify friction, facilitate interfacial mass transport, and manipulate surface sensing and actuation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applications are most direct in human health, as fibrous materials form the structure for numerous tissues in the human body. Mechanical properties of those tissues relate to injury, for example in tearing of ligaments, and to disease, for example in progression of cancer. Fibrous materials also have potential engineering applications, as they are light in weight yet have high tolerance for damage. In both applications--human health and engineering--it is crucial to understand the relationship between structural properties, like fiber size and number, and mechanical properties, like stiffness and strength. This research will establish these crucial relationships, which will advance treatments to disease and enable engineering applications for fibrous materials. As many future applications of this research are in human health, there will be a need for future engineers to be trained in both engineering and biology. Therefore, an additional objective of this project is to enable students to apply principles from multiple different scientific fields to solve engineering problems. For this, undergraduate students in engineering will practice applying concepts of engineering to problems in biology and human health. Additionally, high school students in biology will learn how principles of physics can be used to understand biology. It is expected that this interdisciplinary training will strengthen the engineering and scientific workforce.<br/><br/>The specific objective of this research is to determine how properties of the individual fibers within a network affect the mechanics under different loading conditions. To accomplish this, experiments will subject fibrous networks to both global and local loads and measure the displacements at the scale of the fibers. Results will be compared for networks having different fiber concentration, length, and crosslinking. In parallel, a theoretical model simulating the mechanics of how each fiber bends and stretches will be used to test the state-of-the-art theory against experimental data. The results will establish the fiber properties, strain magnitudes, and length scales for which nonlinearity, heterogeneity, nonaffinity, and plasticity each affect the mechanics. Together, these findings will establish which deformation mechanisms must be accounted for in a model that predicts the response of fibrous materials to general loading conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanotechnology integrates the physical sciences and engineering with applications in medicine, energy, and the environment that are particularly appealing to recruit and retain college students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Historically, economically disadvantaged and first generation students have an underrepresented presence in STEM.  Community colleges serve a high percentage of underrepresented groups and present a rich pool of future scientists and engineers. Undergraduate research can help build confidence and research skills and in turn, play a pivotal role in a student's decision to pursue graduate school or research careers. This REU Site aspires to integrate local community college students with an enriching and meaningful laboratory experience in a community of scholars with mentorship and support that will facilitate their transition and retention into a four-year university. <br/><br/>The objectives of this REU site are: 1) facilitate the development of engineering students from underrepresented groups and economically disadvantaged populations; 2) educate community college students about STEM research careers; 3) provide experiences in research laboratories while demonstrating the excitement of STEM careers; 4) build and maintain mentoring relationships with our participants; and 5) promote effective inter-institutional partnerships between Rice University and community colleges in the Texas Gulf Coast Region. The 10-week research experience will introduce students to research, applications, and education and career opportunities in nanotechnology in an inclusive culture. Students will interact with Rice faculty, post-doctoral and graduate student mentors and teaching staff who will be guiding them through program activities that include research methodology, oral and written presentations, networking, career webinars, and college transferring; along with local STEM industrial opportunities that will promote the dissemination of the program's impact into their communities. REU participants will present their research findings at the Smalley-Curl Nanotechnology Institute's Summer Research Colloquium.

Understanding how and why some groups have come to be more species-rich than other groups is a central and unsolved problem in the life sciences. One class of explanations for these differences in species numbers involves the rate at which new species arise. Using tools from genome biology and computational data science, this project will identify the mechanisms that lead to different rates of species formation and quantify their importance in a major group of vertebrate animals.  The project will provide training in genomics, geographic information systems, computational biology, and biodiversity science for students and researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Genomic resources and new scientific software developed for the project will be made publicly available, and a museum exhibit will highlight the ways in which genomics and computer programming are changing the way scientists study and understand the diversity of life forms on Earth.<br/><br/>This project will produce a novel synthesis between population biology and large-scale patterns of species diversity by integrating next-generation population genomics with a phylogenetic comparative perspective on lineage diversification rates. The project will quantify the genomic signal of several population processes to address how rates of population splitting and persistence influence speciation rates as measured on time-calibrated phylogenetic trees. These objectives will be supported by estimating phylogeographic and population genomic parameters across many species of squamate reptiles that vary in rates of speciation, and by developing new methods to link these parameters to diversification rates on phylogenetic trees. The project will also assess how organismal traits (life history, dispersal biology, population size) contribute to demographic processes that can influence the formation and persistence of incipient species. The project will provide a bridge between biological processes that occur at two very different timescales and will provide an understanding of how changes in populations at ecological timescales affect changes in biological diversity at deep (million-year) timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogels are a class of soft materials, composed of crosslinked polymeric networks that remarkably swell in water, which closely simulate many natural biological tissues, like mucous gel layers. Biological lubrication taking place in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, in the oral cavity and in the eyes, relies on the low friction coefficients provided by these mucous gel layers. Despite significant research effort, there is still disagreement about the origin of such low friction, which hinders the design of biomaterials capable of achieving efficient biolubrication to date. This project will thus deliver the needed knowledge of the relation between hydrogel's properties and frictional response. Thereby, it will enable to establish design principles of hydrogels for targeted biomedical applications capable of achieving low friction coefficients, and augmented wear resistance, and therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. society. This research involves several disciplines including materials chemistry and science, and tribology. The multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>In order to fill the outlined knowledge gap, two major lines of research will be followed: one comparing physically and chemically crosslinked hydrogels with a wide range of crosslinking degrees, and a second one that will study the influence of polymer chain semi-flexibility. To evaluate lubrication mechanisms, friction force measurements will be carried out on well-characterized hydrogels (with a wide range of compositions) by colloidal probe Atomic Force Microscopy and with a Surface Forces Apparatus as a function of load and sliding velocity (spanning over five orders of magnitude) to probe microscopic phenomena with different relaxation times. The experimental effort will provide insight into the effects of mesh size, type of crosslinking, polymer stiffness, as well as aging of the interface, on the frictional characteristics. The research team will also conduct dynamic shear-force measurements to scrutinize the relation between friction force and interfacial rheology of hydrogels. The knowledge generated by this research will afford to modulate the frictional response of hydrogels through the precise control of their microstructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers studying the transmission or spread of cultural practices in the ancient past rely largely on material and physical remains. Archaeology is especially well-suited to address these questions because it combines a critical engagement with material culture with a concern with change and interaction over time and space. In this context, writing presents an ideal case for exploring cultural transmission because of the material traces that it leaves and because its physical aspects are often ignored at the expense of its more abstract message. Mallory Matsumoto (Brown University) will undertake dissertation research to understand the production and transmission of writing. In addition to fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeology, epigraphy, and anthropology, this work will demonstrate how interaction in one cultural context may affect another, an issue relevant to understanding both the past and the present. In addition to contributing to current understanding of pre-Columbian Maya civilization, the results will be especially relevant to contemporary Maya communities given their current efforts revive the hieroglyphic script as a symbol of identity and cultural heritage.<br/><br/>This dissertation research will examine if and how the networks through which writing is transmitted overlap with other contexts of cultural exchange. Its case study will be the ancient Maya hieroglyphic writing system, which was used for over 1500 years in areas of what are now Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. Critically, the writing system was shared among pre-Columbian Maya communities who were not only separated by space and time, but also were never politically unified. Although the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs has advanced significantly in recent decades, scholars still do not understand how the writing system developed and spread. The investigator will analyze the form of Maya inscriptions and the hieroglyphs they contain to reconstruct which settlements were sharing which writing techniques, how these patterns changed over time, and how they related to interactions in other contexts like politics, warfare, or trade.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Song Lin is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University.  Prof. Lin's lab aims to develop new methods for building organic molecules that contain carbon-nitrogen bonds.  Carbon-nitrogen bonds are critically important. Over 85% of the top-selling pharmaceuticals have at least one carbon-nitrogen bond. With this in mind, the goal of the research being pursued is to establish efficient, selective, and sustainable reaction technologies that will promote the formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds from abundant starting materials.  Electrochemistry, a process that directly uses electricity to drive chemical reactions, is an intrinsically efficient, selective, and sustainable technology. It would appear to be an ideal method for making carbon-nitrogen bonds in a sustainable manner. However, electrochemical reactions frequently do not afford the chemical selectivity and efficiency necessary to accomplish a particular transformation. The introduction of catalysis that can control the chemical reaction portion of the process can solve this problem. In so doing, the catalyst augments the energy efficiency of electrochemical reactions by offering an opportunity to better control the yield and identity of the end product. The project lies at the interface of organic synthesis, catalysis, and electrochemistry. Therefore, it is also well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Prof. Lin's group is actively engaged in outreach activities by integrating the key elements of their research into the education and training of the next generation of scientists at both collegiate and K-12 levels.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Lin of Cornell University is developing electrocatalytic methods for new carbon-nitrogen coupling reactions. The proposed research enlists the combination of electrochemistry and redox-active metal catalysis as a general approach to enable highly efficient and chemoselective amination of organic substrates. Three specific aims are being pursued simultaneously. The scope of the electrocatalytic diazidation of alkenes for the synthesis of vicinal diamines is being investigated, the electrochemical azidooxygenation of alkenes for the synthesis of aminoalcohol products is being advanced, and an electrocatalytic paradigm to decarboxylative and deborylative azidations is being expanded. Additional efforts are studying the mechanisms of the electrochemical reactions using kinetic and voltammetric experiments. Finally, the new reaction methods are being employed to improve the synthesis of bioactive complex targets.  The proposed educational plan is working to expand the nation's infrastructure for STEM education on collegiate and K-12 levels with a particular emphasis on sustainability.

Paula Turkon, Sturt Manning, and Carol Griggs, along with colleagues from Mexico, will conduct research to provide a high-resolution absolute tree-ring chronology for Northern Mesoamerican archaeological sites using a combination of tree-ring and AMS radiocarbon data.  This project extends their preliminary research both geographically and chronologically, with the goal of linking the existing Epiclassic chronology from Northwestern Mesoamerica that ends in the 8th century A.D., to the regionally extensive, calendar-dated chronologies from living and relic trees in the same region. The dendrochronological results will offer dating precision to archaeologists working in these regions for time periods that do not have written sources of chronological data. It will also establish the foundation for climate reconstruction studies that, in the future, will help clarify the long-term relationships between the magnitude of climatic change and human response. In fostering close collaboration between archaeologists, dendrochronologists, graduate, and undergraduate students from multiple institutions throughout Mexico and the United States, this project's mission is to encourage the application of dendroarchaeology [=archaeological dendrochronology], currently not part of archaeological fieldwork or analysis in Mexico. <br/><br/>Mesoamerican archaeologists have long acknowledged the need for precise dating methods in order to understand cultural change, particularly in the region north of the core of Mesoamerican culture. Yet despite tremendous success in the development of tree-ring dating of archaeological sites just north in the American Southwest, and the more recent development of long tree-ring chronologies in Mexico that cover the past 1300 years, dendroarchaeology has been virtually absent in Mesoamerica. The first stage of this NSF funded project demonstrated the availability, measurability, and similarities in growth patterns (""crossdatability"") of archaeological tree-ring samples in Northwestern Mesoamerica from the 5th to 8th centuries A.D.  In this second stage, the researchers will incorporate archaeological samples from Postclassic and historic sites located in a broader geographic region in northern Mesoamerica. Because the new archaeological collections of wood will likewise be from a time period for which there are no well-established master chronologies, the tree-ring sequences produced from the prehispanic sites will be initially anchored in time by ""radiocarbon wiggle-matching.""   This method fits a known relative sequence of radiocarbon dates from specific tree-rings against the radiocarbon calibration curve to achieve a precise fit and thus calendar placement with minimal error.  Ultimately, we intend to create a continuous tree-ring record from the present back to the Classic period, using both the archaeological and historic collections, as well as existing calendar-dated chronologies.  The resulting data will not only fill a significant gap in our knowledge of the chronology of Northern Mesoamerica, but help address broader questions such as the rate, timing, and directionality of cultural influences with the Mesoamerican cultural core.

Using a variety of methods, the doctoral student will reconstruct and compare fire-climate-vegetation dynamics of the past century to those that have occurred over the past millennium.  The results of this project will reveal whether once-forested but now peat-accumulating sites are novel ecosystems, or whether such transitions have occurred in the past in these regions, possible due to drought conditions and fire frequencies that are similar to those observed today.  These results are of interest to land managers, who require tools to determine how best to manage altered ecosystems. By identifying whether (and which) ecological thresholds have been crossed, this project will provide crucial input for decision-making regarding best practices for land management.  The doctoral student will work closely with regional land managers and other stakeholders, including land owners and educators, to ensure that project results are available to inform collaborative land use decisions.  The PIs will also engage K-12 and college students in hands-on fieldwork, thus preparing future scientists to employ multiple lines of evidence in investigating the causes and consequences of environmental change.  In addition, as a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising graduate student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of this doctoral dissertation improvement project is to contribute to the scientific literature on alternative stable states that result from changes in the fire regimes of forested ecosystems.  Using methods from paleoecology, dendroecology, and community ecology, this research will examine fire-mediated effects on ecosystem structure at varying spatiotemporal scales at the peatland-forest ecotone, a transition zone that, like tree line, is particularly sensitive to changes in fire and climate.  The project addresses the following questions: (1) How has fire activity during post-European settlement periods with distinct climate conditions differed quantitatively from that of pre-settlement conditions?  (2) How has fire impacted the vegetation community of the forest-peatland ecotone during the most recent extreme warm/dry and cool/wet periods?  (3) What are the mechanisms that favor a transition from forested to peat-accumulating lands in a site?  Specifically, the doctoral student will use tree-ring fire scar dates, forest stand structure reconstructions, and sedimentary records to answer these questions.  In addition, surveys of present-day vegetation composition/structure at control and burned sites will be paired with those of abiotic and biotic factors to uncover the mechanisms underlying the persistence of the peat-accumulating state.  Although this project will focus on the forest-peatland ecotone of southwestern Patagonia, the research will provide new insights and approaches for dealing with the interactive effects of environmental change in many other regions, including some in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project tests the hypothesis that the reason for this is because redundant (i.e., matching) multisensory information elicits greater attention than does either mis-matching multisensory information or unisensory information. The results from this project will provide key insights into infant perception, attention, learning, and memory and, as a result, they will suggest better ways for helping infants acquire critical cognitive and social skills. In addition, the results will provide new insights into the root causes of some developmental disabilities (e.g., autism) which are known to involve impaired perception and attention to multisensory information. Finally, the results from this project will provide a scientific foundation for the design of  tools that will permit clinicians to more effectively detect and ameliorate impaired attention to multisensory information in young children with developmental disabilities, thereby improving their cognitive and social development.<br/><br/>By around 6 months of age, a previously rudimentary, reflex-like selective attention response system becomes transformed into an endogenously driven selective attention system. This new functionality permits infants to deploy their attention to sources of multisensory redundancy that are of specific interest to them. The project seeks to answer three main questions. First, what mechanisms underlie developmental changes in infant selective attention to sources of multisensory redundancy? Second, how does early experience contribute to developmental changes in selective attention to multisensory redundancy in infancy? Third, how does improving selective attention to multisensory redundancy contribute to information processing across different psychological domains? Infants residing in monolingual and bilingual households will be tested with eye tracking methods to assess attention to multisensory redundancy inherent in talking faces. In some cases, eye tracking will be used  with an intersensory matching procedure to examine infant matching of auditory and visual attributes of speech. In other cases, eye tracking will be used with a habituation/test procedure to investigate learning of multisensory events. The investigators will analyze the temporal distribution of attention as well as the latency of responses. The findings from this project will provide novel insights into the emergence of attention and learning in infancy, clues to maximizing attention and learning in typically developing infants, and clues to improving attention and learning in infants at risk for developmental disabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How and why do complex organs, like eyes, evolve?  These phenomena happen on time scales much longer than our lives, making it difficult for us to understand how they happened.  Species are defined by being distinct from and not breeding with each other.  Not interbreeding could be a simple matter of when, where or who you choose to mate with.  It could also be caused by a failure to produce offspring that can survive and reproduce.  Species today are often kept separate from one another by multiple mechanisms, so we do not know how they evolved in the first place.  Likewise, complex organs are like machines with many parts that must all be present and well integrated if the machine is to work, but how did this complexity arise?  In each case, nature most often presents us with end products without any clues about how they came about; however, sometimes nature provides groups of species that retain enough clues to these processes for one to be able to study how they occur, as in the case of this research program.   One impact of this work pertains to the complex organ that is studied.  These investigators are studying the evolution of placentas and are doing so in a context in which they can compare species with placentas with close relatives who lack placentas or have less complex placentas.  This diversity enables them to address the consequences of having a placenta, including how it affects fertility. The research will enhance the training of students at multiple levels (high school, college, and post-graduate) as well as provide outreach to the public.<br/><br/>The proposed research combines work done at two levels of resolution. First, the investigators will work on all species in the fish family Poeciliidae, enabling them to define the timing and order of evolutionary changes.   Second, they will perform experiments on individual species within the family to characterize the mechanisms that cause evolution. They will sequence whole genomes then use the DNA sequences to reconstruct the family tree.  They will characterize the biology of every species on the tree, including how females provision their young and how males and females choose who to mate with.  These fish all bear live young, but some fully provision eggs before they are fertilized while others continue to provision eggs after fertilization.  The latter group has the functional equivalent of a mammalian placenta, but species vary in how well the placenta is developed and how much they provision young during development.  Species also differ in how they choose mates, with some having males with elaborate ornamentation and courtship displays and others with no sex differences in coloration and no courtship.  The integration of biology with the family tree is what will enable the investigators to infer when and in what order female provisioning and aspects of mate choice evolved.  It is also possible to test whether the evolution of certain traits is associated with an acceleration or deceleration of how fast new species are formed.  It will then be possible to test predictions derived from evolutionary theory for how the evolution of these traits are inter-related with one another.  The family tree also enables the investigators to identify closely related species that differ in the presence or absence of placentas.  These species pairs become the subjects of experiments in which they will perform more detailed studies of the biology of reproductive isolation, including assessments of multiple mating and the rate of evolution of reproductive isolation.  The integration of work done at both levels will enable the investigators to detail how mating systems and mode of reproduction affect the evolution of reproductive isolation, how these different facets of speciation have interacted to shape the evolution of species in the family and how they affect the rate of speciation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, these reactions need catalysts based on precious metals. Significant improvements need to be made to reduce costs and waste. Catalytic reactions and processes with inexpensive and widely-available metals metals, simple substrates and reagents, and generation of benign by-products will serve this need. In this project, Dr. Dave Martin is developing new light-driven reactions with a novel cobalt-based catalyst that converts simple chemicals into a host of useful products. This approach is leveraging cheap, abundant feedstocks such as biomass. New insights into the mechanism of these reactions are also being learned. Sharing these new developments with undergraduate students at UC Riverside promotes green chemistry values as a part of a larger effort to increase research participation and scientific engagement. Through chemistry demonstrations and interactions between K-12 students from local schools and members of his research group, Dr. Martin fosters excitement and curiosity for the sciences and encourages young students from all backgrounds to pursue higher education and careers in science. <br/><br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Dave Martin of the University of California, Riverside is developing a cobalt-based catalyst system that harnesses light energy to perform the direct functionalization of alcohols via acyl and alkyl radical intermediates. Current methods typically require a pre-functionalization step and produce undesirable, often toxic by-products that must be separated. The use of abundant cobalt-based catalysts inspired by the biochemistry of vitamin B12 provides an alternative mechanism for in situ activation and generates versatile radical intermediates that can participate in a wide variety of chemical transformations including catalytic deoxygenation, radical cyclizations and intermolecular cross-coupling. Direct alcohol coupling processes leverage readily available feedstock chemicals from conventional sources and also provide a powerful means for the valorization of renewable sources such as sugars and lignin biomass. The mechanisms of stoichiometric and catalytic pathways are being studied to provide a deeper understanding of the interaction of Co(II) complexes with radical intermediates under photochemical conditions.

The outcome will be an unprecedented database of crocodylomorph cranial and post-cranial diversity that includes contrast-enhanced neural and skeletal tissues, raw and partitioned CT stacks, and 3D digital models as well as comparative, intra-clade conceptual models for how predatory vertebrates shift to lives on the shoreline, within the sea, and toward herbivory. The microCT and cutting-edge, diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging, in addition to a robust morphological phylogeny for analysis of evolutionary trends using the latest phylogenetic methods, represent potentially transformative methodologies developed by this research group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cloud storage services must keep the data of thousands of customers separated while also allowing customers to operate on it efficiently. Safely intermixing customer-provided operations over data is problematic. Historically, processor hardware isolates programs, but increasing data access rates make that costly. This project develops a new approach to storage that allows safe operation on data without hardware protection using recent advances in programming languages.<br/><br/>The approach combats data movement between disaggregated storage and compute nodes by having untrusted tenant extensions pushed to Sandstorm, a new cloud storage system. Sandstorm's insight is that storage extensions can use language-level isolation to eliminate hardware isolation overheads that cannot be avoided today: not with virtual machines, containers, nor serverless Lambdas. Sandstorm also eliminates copying data for safety, so extensions benefit from low-level hardware functionality like zero-copy network transmission. The project will develop multitenant benchmarks, low-cost performance-isolated concurrency mechanisms for multicores, techniques to minimize data movement within servers, storage extensions that demonstrate the benefits, and distributed extensions over clusters.<br/><br/>As power limits data center scale, minimizing data movement out of storage becomes crucial. Sandstorm enables any cloud developer to accelerate data-intensive applications like real-time social network and natural graph analysis and fine-grained coordination of hundreds of thousands of autonomous vehicles. All artifacts will be developed openly under a permissive MIT license for academic and industrial use. The project includes development of a new education platform for teaching students about distributed systems and cloud computing at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels with a set of serverless computing labs targeted toward University of Utah students and summer camp attendees. <br/><br/>All data, code, experiments, and benchmarks will be open and made publicly available through http://github.com/utah-scs/ and at http://utah.systems/ and retained for a minimum of three years beyond the project award period.

Ionomers in an energy conversion device (such as hydrogen fuel cell) allow conduction of ions and generation of electricity. Utilizing hydrogen fuel cells can greatly benefit the environment since it does not emit any harmful gas (such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide) while generating electricity. However, such an eco-friendly technology is not economically viable due to the expensive ionomers and catalysts used. Also there is much data available on ionomer behavior in thick (several tens of micron thick) materials, but it is still not very well understood how ionomers behave in very thin (less than a micron thick) materials. Thin ionomer layers suffer from poor ion conductivity which negatively impacts the performance of energy conversion and storage devices. Without a sound understanding of nanoscale properties of ionomers at catalyst interfaces, more efficient, next-generation ion conducting materials cannot be designed. To address these needs, this project will systematically study how proton conducting ionomers interact with low-cost catalysts (with lower content of precious metals) and how those interactions impact the ion conduction environment in nanothin films. This understanding will lead a chemical synthesis effort to design new ionomers that can improve ion conductivity in thinner materials.  This project will address technical challenges in understanding polymers at nanoscale and advance the existing knowledge. It will contribute to potentially making eco-friendly hydrogen fuel cells more efficient and cheaper; aid improvement of other energy conversion and storage devices (e.g. batteries, supercapacitors); and improve the quality of life.   This work will also contribute to educating and training students (including women and underrepresented minorities) at all levels in STEM areas and inspire them toward technologically and societally important careers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>As the future demand for thinner energy conversion and storage device continually increases, ionomer confinement and interfacial phenomena studies continue to become more important. Ionomers behave very differently under thin film confinement (e.g. at ionomer-catalyst thin interfaces) as compared to bulk membranes. Nanoscale ion conduction behavior determines the energy efficiency of fuel cell based devices. The project aims to systematically probe the impact of gradual changes in ionomer confinement and distinguish the ion conduction behavior of nanoconfined and bulk materials as a function of ionomeric material thickness, ionomer structure, nature of catalyst, and hydration. Ionomer-catalyst-water interactions and characteristics of local hydration environment will be qualitatively explored in sub-micron thick films of an array of proton exchanging ionomers over low-Platinum group metal (low-PGM) catalyst layers. By combining the qualitative picture of nanoscale ion conduction environment with quantitative values of proton conductivity, a true insight into interfacial proton conduction will be obtained.  Depth profile imaging of ionomeric materials (upon incorporation of ratiometric fluorescent probes) will offer information about distribution of properties (such as proton concentration profile) across the thickness of materials. Since the issues associated with thin ionomer films (confinement, interfacial interactions, ill-connected ionic domains, poor proton conductivity) are different from bulk membranes, a new range of ionomers will be chemically synthesized aiming to improve proton conduction in confined systems. The presence of macrocyclic moieties within ionomer structure will allow the formation of pores and ion conducting channels with controlled diameter, which will offer additional proton conduction pathways and facilitate proton conduction in nanothin ionomer films. The project's educational objectives are to: 1) prepare a diverse, future energy workforce by educating and inspiring middle school, high school, undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, and 2) contribute to public awareness and societal behavior regarding sustainable energy through outreach for families and adults.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the site's inception in 2006, students' commitment to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields has been demonstrated, as well as producing research publications. Students are provided with classroom training and gain hands-on experience using cutting-edge instruments, equipment, computers and cyberinfrastructure. Classes in computer programming and graphics, interface design, human-computer interaction, research skills, team skills, and ethics occupy approximately one third of the students' time. In an unusual structure that is focused on building a community of practice, students conduct interdisciplinary research projects in groups of two or three, with all students co-located in Iowa State's Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC). Each group interacts with VRAC graduate students under the supervision of VRAC faculty. The research projects are presented at an end-of-the summer campus-wide research symposium in the form of posters, demos, and a five-page research paper. Frequently the students present their research at research conferences later during the school year. <br/><br/>Two major trends are driving research in Emerging Interface Technologies (EIT): a dramatic increase of interface technologies themselves, and the ubiquitous permeation of technology into our everyday lives. Correspondingly, this research focuses on new interfaces that enhance people's perception, understanding of complexity, and work performance. The SPIRE exposes students to three broad areas of EIT: information visualization, virtual/augmented reality, human-agent interaction. In particular, previous projects have focused on improving cockpit sensor displays for pilots, the optimal use of emotional cues by intelligent agents during crisis situations in the International Space Station, use of virtual reality for improved drone navigation, use of augmented reality for reducing errors in factory assembly lines, reducing cyber sickness, improved user interfaces for faster traffic incident management, design tradeoffs of wearable biosensors and use of wireless electroencephalography (EEG) caps with people who have Parkinson's disease.

These range from internal patterns, like the repetition of vertebrae in the spinal cord, to external patterns like the stripes of black pigment on a zebra. Pigmentation has become a powerful model for exploring the origins and genetic mechanisms behind these types of patterns. For example, new information about insect development has been learned by studying the colorful eyespots in butterflies. In plants, the mechanisms of pigment production have been well-studied, but surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of complex patterns of pigmentation. Filling this knowledge gap is the goal of this research. This project will study two species of monkeyflower; each has flowers with strikingly different color patterns. What's more, when the two species are mated together, new intricate and complex color patterns emerge. Since these new pigmentation patterns are seen only when different species are mated together, it suggests that interactions between their genomes give rise to the new patterns. Exploring how such interactions between different genomes can produce unexpected new traits is a primary focus of this research. One master's student, six undergraduates, and six high school students will be recruited to carry out this work. These students will be exposed to high-impact learning opportunities as they are immersed in hands-on scientific research.  At least two of the high school students will be selected from a high school that specifically serves disadvantaged youth.<br/><br/>The pigmentation patterns in the hybrids of Mimulus cupreus x M. luteus var. variegatus are too intricate to quantify using standard approaches. Instead, a new digital image analysis pipeline is being developed. This approach will be useful for analyzing spatial patterning in monkeyflowers and in other taxa. The researchers will use this new method to identify and quantify elements of floral color pattern in a phenotypically diverse F2 hybrid population. Next-generation sequencing will be used to map the genomic regions responsible for the observed variation in flower patterns. Because M. cupreus and M. l. variegatus also differ in yellow carotenoid pigmentation, the same phenotypic and genetic datasets will be used to identify the genetic basis of divergent carotenoid production, which is an important but under-studied component of plant physiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project is to bring innovations to mobile video delivery for new content types and over emerging networks. Specifically, the project investigates three aspects: (1) 360-degree immersive video delivery, (2) video streaming over multiple network paths (multipath), and (3) video streaming over millimeter-wave (mmWave) links. These are expected to be the key building blocks of next-generation video streaming services.  First, 360-degree videos provide users with unique panoramic viewing experience; however, 360-degree video content delivery is much more challenging compared to regular videos. Second, multiple network interfaces have become a norm on off-the-shelf mobile devices but their potential is far from being fully exploited. Third, mmWave is a key technology that will be integrated into 5G wireless networks; but adapting video streaming to mmWave largely remains an uncharted territory. The proposed solutions will benefit the society by enhancing the user experience and reducing the resource consumption for next-generation immersive video services. The research will also be integrated with an education plan that seeks to prepare computer science students with the knowledge of new technological trends in networking and systems, and stimulate the general public interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.<br/><br/>This project includes three inter-connected research thrusts. (1) For 360 video streaming, based on the concept of field-of-view (FoV) guided streaming, the project uses big data analytics to facilitate accurate head movement prediction, a key prerequisite for FoV-guided streaming. It also uses a rate adaptation scheme with a ""delta encoding"" design allowing the quality of a fetched chunk to be incrementally upgraded. This substantially improves adaptability when facing randomness in head movements. (2) For multipath streaming, the project uses multiple network interfaces to be used simultaneously for streaming videos. The network framework supports video rate adaptation and allows users to flexibly configure each path's cost. The framework also supports delay-sensitive live streaming over multipath through strategic packet scheduling. (3) mmWave links bear unique characteristics of massive capacity and intermittent availability. The project first designs a transport layer for mmWave links. It then proposes several video streaming strategies tailored to mmWave, such as strategically combining mmWave and legacy omni-directional radios.  For the above research thrusts, the project will develop algorithms, models, and systems, backed up by real implementation and evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water utilities perform extensive monitoring in the water distribution system to ensure that the drinking water microbiome remains safe as it travels from the water treatment plant to the household tap. Although these monitoring practices are designed for early detection of microbial contamination, any attempt to fix a problem identified by monitoring will be inherently reactionary. This project seeks to revolutionize the current United States drinking water monitoring system of ""detect and mitigate"" towards a proactive one of ""predict and correct"".  This project aims to develop a computer model that will allow water utilities to predict future microbial contamination events across the water distribution system, thus providing an opportunity to prevent contamination events before they occur. Integrated with the research activities will be an education program that includes training of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students in state-of-the-art microbiome characterization and interpretation to attract them to STEM careers. The goal of this education program will be to prepare future water scientists and engineers with expertise in microbiome research and practice.<br/><br/>The career development plan will advance the safety and health of drinking water by integrating experimental and computational microbial ecology into drinking water microbiome research and by leveraging this research through education and outreach to engage a diverse student body in microbiome research and practice. The research goals of this project are (1) to establish a long-term observatory to monitor high-resolution drinking water microbiome dynamics in Boston?s water distribution system, (2) to develop a novel framework to apply econometric and ecological models to these dynamics, and (3) to systematically integrate the two modeling approaches for comprehensive spatial-temporal forecasting of the abundance and composition of the drinking water microbiome. The research plan combines state-of-the-art integrated analyses and novel modeling approaches to develop a quantitative predictive framework for the drinking water microbiome. This predictive framework will (1) help water utilities preemptively estimate and eliminate future drinking water microbial risks, and (2) serve as foundational knowledge for model-informed quantitative management of the drinking water microbiome. This research is integrated with an education and outreach plan designed to (1) attract and train undergraduate and graduate students in microbiome research and practice, using pedagogical approaches designed to enhance participation of students from underrepresented minority groups in STEM research, and (2) raise public awareness of the drinking-water microbiome through K-12 initiatives. The objectives will be accomplished by developing innovative microbiome-focused curricula in environmental engineering using a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) approach in collaboration with Wentworth Institute of Technology and Wellesley College and a K-12 learning activity for Boston area students through the Center for STEM Education at Northeastern University.

The second part of the project investigates the computational power of the absence of entanglement in the context of quantum Merlin-Arthur protocols with two provers (QMA(2)). It is a well-motivated problem due to its connection to the separability problem within quantum information as well as the Unique Games Conjecture in the field of approximation algorithm. Specific objectives include the study of (1) the k-extendible states and de Finetti theorems for the separability problem and (2) non-trivial error reduction schemes of QMA(2).

A big attributed network (BAN) is characterized by a combination of (a) high-dimensional and heterogeneous network topologies and (b) high-dimensional and heterogeneous attribute data. Effective analysis of BAN data relies on simultaneous subgraph mining and feature selection for discovering complex patterns that are interesting or significant. However, as yet little has been done to bridge these two important research areas. The focus of this project is therefore to unify a wide range of complex pattern discovery tasks including, for example, the detection and forecasting of societal events (disasters, civil unrest), anomalous patterns (disease outbreaks, cyberattacks), discriminative subnetworks (cancer diagnosis), knowledge patterns (new knowledge building) and storylines (intelligence analysis), and to resolve the fundamental modeling, algorithmic, and interactive challenges associated with ubiquitous BAN data in today's big data era. This project incorporates the resulting research outcomes into the curricula of interdisciplinary courses on topics such as complex pattern detection in BAN data presented at seminars, tutorials, and workshops, and will include outreach activities such as a big data analytics summer camp for local K-12 education in New York's Capital Region.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are: (1) the development of a unified, theoretical framework for discovering complex patterns in BAN data in various kinds of tasks; (2) making the inference computationally tractable in extremely large combined spaces composed of vertices, edges, and attributes; and (3) rendering the detected heterogeneous patterns transparent and interpretable and incorporating heterogeneous user feedback into the detection process.

The tools participants learn will enable future research that capitalizes on the growing availability of genetic data.  The workshop targets early and mid-career professionals with expertise in four major scientific disciplines to examine host-pathogen interactions in wildlife: genome sciences; wildlife biology; veterinary sciences; and wildlife management and conservation. Workshop organizers are focusing particular attention on assembling a diverse set of participants, with approximately equal gender balance, and attention to ethnic as well as regional diversity. <br/><br/>Participants in this Genomics of Diseases in Wildlife will be taken from start to finish in the process of using next generation genomic sequence data to address questions in the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases of wildlife. The workshop will address which sequence data are appropriate to address what questions in the area of ecology and evolution of infectious disease. Participants will learn to assess sequence read quality and coverage, map reads to a reference genome, perform de novo assembly of host and pathogen genomes, and annotate assembled genomes. From there, they will assess read quality, create alignments for comparative analyses within and among hosts and pathogens. Several forms of analysis will be included with a focus on comparative genomics across space and time, including the patterns of evolution associated with disease outbreaks.  All of these activities will focus on recently available sequence related to a current problem in wildlife disease ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural polymers, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, starch, proteins, and chitin, have been utilized in composites, plastics, biofuels and other applications. The development of synthetic polymers from molecular biomass, such as plant oils, rosin acids, terpenes, terpenoids, and furan, is a fast-growing area. However, there are many mounting challenges in increasing the component of biobased polymers in the commercial market, in contrast with dominant petrochemical-derived counterparts. To promote sustainability and national prosperity, this project will develop next-generation renewable polymers by designing general strategies based on wrapping of macromolecules on polymers from natural resources to improve their physical properties, especially addressing critical hurdles on inferior mechanical properties involving a variety of biomass.  A central goal is to understand how macromolecular chain wrapping via supramolecular interactions dictates thermal and mechanical properties of these materials and to establish structure-property relationships.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Sustainable biobased polymers from natural resources are facing a lot of compelling challenges.  Among them, many polymers suffer inferior mechanical properties, largely due to their inherent low chain entanglements (thus, they have very high chain-entanglement molecular weight). Macromolecular architectures and compositions play vital roles in dictating these properties. The planned research is aimed to provide an economical, robust, and general approach to enhance mechanical properties of biobased polymers. The central idea is to wrap bulky biobased polymers with a flexible and highly entangled macromolecule via supramolecular interactions. The overall goal of the proposed research is to simultaneously maximize the use of biomass and enable biobased bulky polymers with high tensile strength and desirable elongation under stress by incorporating minimal levels of macromolecular wrapping. This project includes the development of macromolecular engineering protocols through parallel efforts on: (1) polymers containing bulky biomass such as fatty acid, resin acid, isosorbide, guaiacol, pinene, tulipalin, and glucose;  and (2) biocomposites based on lignin and cellulose nanowhiskers.  An essential goal is to understand how macromolecular chain wrapping via supramolecular interactions dictates thermal and mechanical properties of these materials and to establish clear structure-property relationships. The planned research program seeks to explore potentially transformative concepts to address sustainability issues by maximizing the use of biobased polymers with enhanced thermomechanical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of the known matter in the universe is in an ionized state, a plasma, comprised of electrons and ions that strongly interact with electromagnetic fields.  Magnetic reconnection is an explosive phenomenon that occurs in plasmas where magnetic field lines suddenly rearrange themselves to release large amounts of energy.  This has important implications here on Earth for fusion energy schemes and prediction of space weather events that can disable satellites used for communication and navigation. Magnetic reconnection is also theorized to occur around violent astrophysical events such as in the vicinity of gamma-ray bursts or active galactic nuclei where the magnetic fields are very large and the particles move at close to the speed of light.  This project will investigate magnetic reconnection under similar conditions in the laboratory and test the accuracy of existing theories. In addition, this award will support efforts to improve the climate for women and other underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines in general, and in plasma physics, in particular.<br/><br/>Relativistic magnetic reconnection occurs when the energy density of the reconnecting fields exceeds the rest mass energy density. The experiments to be performed will use laser pulses focused to ultra-high intensities to heat a small volume of electrons on a solid foil target to relativistic energies. The electrons are mostly confined to the target surface and expand radially outwards at the speed of light. This generates a very large azimuthal magnetic field. Focusing two laser pulses in close proximity forms oppositely directed magnetic fields in the midplane to form a driven reconnection geometry.  Numerical modeling has indicated the conditions created by the laser pulses will satisfy the requirement for accessing the relativistic magnetic reconnection regime. Measurements of the timescale of the reconnection and the characterization of accelerated particle jets will be used to benchmark and test existing theories and numerical models.  Further, the education and outreach goal of the project is to help address under-representation of women and minority groups within many fields of STEM, and specifically in plasma physics.  This will be done by developing curriculum to educate undergraduate students about unconscious bias and when this may lead to unintentionally discriminatory behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many older groups of fishes were going extinct and being replaced by modern groups. But where did the modern groups come from, and how and why did they replace the older groups? These questions, among others, are unanswered because the fossil record of fishes from this time period is extremely poor. This project analyzes newly discovered, complete fossilized skeletons of freshwater fish from a critical time period (72-66 million years ago). These fossils are extraordinarily well-preserved, providing a rare glimpse of complete skeletons. This project will fill a critical gap in understanding the origin and evolution of modern freshwater fish. In addition to the scientific merit of this project, there are several broader impacts. First, the fossils to be described are deposited in publicly accessible natural history collections, thereby ensuring that they are available in perpetuity to the scientific community. Second, student training programs developed around the preparation and analysis of the fossils provides valuable research and training for budding scientists. Third, results from this study will be published in scientific articles and presented at professional meetings and seminars for public audiences. And finally, by using the resources available at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the project will increase public understanding of science. All specimens will be prepared in a lab where active preparation and study of the specimens can be observed by the more than 1.2 million annual visitors to the Field Museum, including many K-12 student groups and teachers, and a temporary exhibit of this exquisitely preserved fossil fish fauna will add an important component to current exhibits at the Field Museum. <br/><br/>Although the modern freshwater fish fauna of North America has been intensively studied, its origin, biogeography, and evolutionary history are still poorly understood, due in part to a lack of whole-body fossils from Cretaceous freshwater deposits, particularly those containing articulated skeletons. This study uses exceptionally well-preserved fossil fish from a recently discovered lagerstatten in the Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota, to illuminate the transition between the early Mesozoic (consisting of extinct orders and families) and the modern freshwater fauna. Recently discovered blocks containing the articulated, complete skeletons of many freshwater fish have been acquired by the Field Museum for preparation and analysis. All fossils will be described and illustrated using a combination of detailed photographic documentation of all aspects of the anatomy of the species with matched line drawings clearly showing the interpretation of the morphology. These data will form the basis of original morphological descriptions, character conceptualization, and phylogenetic and comparative analyses of key fish lineages present in the blocks, including the Acipenseridae, Polyodontidae, Amiidae, Lepisosteidae, and possibly Teleostei.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program consists of two integral components --- a two-week preparatory module for students from the Maricopa County Community College District, followed by an eight-week research experience for all participants. The preparatory module will expose students to mathematical topics that are not covered in a typical community college curriculum, including a mix of interesting ""real world"" problems and an introduction to numerical computations, which the students will then use during the research period. Following the two-week course module, students will work in small groups of 3-4 on problems suggested by mentors, in areas of interesting overlap across research groups. Participating students will learn applied mathematical concepts and numerical tools that model space- and time-dependent dynamical processes. They will also be exposed to enrichment activities including relevant research seminars and workshops on STEM opportunities and career services. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the REU program is to expand research opportunities for place-bound community college and liberal arts college students; engage community college students to matriculate into Baccalaureate programs; guide students in scholarship and graduate school applications; and establish a supporting network to assist students throughout their undergraduate programs. To realize these goals, the curriculum is designed to provide opportunities to undergraduate mathematics and science majors to work as part of a team on an interdisciplinary problem; read journal articles to gain some background on a new subject quickly; analyze open-ended problems using computer simulation as a discovery tool; and present a talk on their work at the end of the program and (optionally) at an appropriate research conference. Students are also encouraged to continue collaboration with mentors remotely, leading to publications in archival journals. The summer research will address problems related to weather prediction, atmospheric dynamics, aviation hazard analyses and forecasting; image processing and Fourier analysis; network dynamics and topology; and mathematical models of cancer (especially brain and prostate cancer). Students will be supervised by experienced faculty in their respective fields. By reaching out to community colleges, the program will tap into diverse talents from underrepresented minority groups and increase their research participation in mathematics and STEM fields. Special efforts will be made to recruit students who are first-generation college students as well as students who are female and/or members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical science.<br/><br/>This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vascular plants include lycopods, ferns and their allies, as well as conifers and flowering plants. They form the foundation of nearly all terrestrial ecosystems and our food supply, yet scientists disagree about when and how they evolved. Current methods for estimating evolutionary timelines for these species have led to conflicting answers, as they rely on the ability of researchers to assign extinct fossil species correctly to particular branch points in the tree of life. This assignment is challenging to do because extinct species may have morphology that can be interpreted differently. Researchers will refine a new data analysis method to address this limitation. They will compare the DNA sequences of living vascular plants and incorporate morphological data from both living and extinct species to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. During this process, researchers will apply new computer algorithms to estimate the evolutionary timeline for the species. Researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of an early-career researcher. They will educate the public about plant evolution by creating an interpretive exhibit at the University of California Berkeley and by producing a series of online video lessons for high school students and educators.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new total-evidence dating method to reconstruct the next generation of time-calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses that incorporate both extinct and extant species. Researchers will leverage DNA sequence data collected by an existing NSF award to reconstruct a backbone phylogeny of ca. 300 extant vascular plants using nuclear genomic data. They will also collect morphological data for ca. 300 traits from these species as well as ca. 200 extinct fossil species. These data will be simultaneously integrated by the software program RevBayes to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny. This program combines sophisticated tree-shape priors, powerful models of morphological evolution, and recently developed methods for relaxing the molecular clock. Project outcomes will include a robust estimate of vascular plant divergence times and patterns of morphological evolution with an explicit measure of the full associated uncertainty of that estimate. The project will support research by sharing new and legacy morphological datasets in the online, open-access PROTEUS database and by hosting a training workshop focused on refining the theory and practice of divergence-time dating.

Catalyst selection involves a complicated juggling act to identify materials that selectively promote desired chemical reactions while avoiding undesired side reactions.  Typically, catalysts are selected through tedious trial-and-error screening of many combinations of materials. In contrast, this project seeks to accelerate the catalyst discovery process through mathematical and computer models that relate the properties of prospective catalytic materials to their ability to carry out the desired reactions under a wide range of conditions.  The improved catalyst designs resulting from the project will promote broader utilization of biomass as a carbon-neutral source of energy, directly addressing the nation's energy security while minimizing environmental impact. Training of graduate and undergraduate students in computational research will provide a future workforce for the emerging areas of computational and data-enabled science and engineering.<br/><br/>The project will focus on an integrated research and education program that provides molecular insights into the selective catalytic deoxygenation activity of transition metal catalysts (TMCs), particularly those based on bimetallic phosphide and carbide materials as the active components. From a technical standpoint, the primary objectives will be to understand the effects of solvent, temperature, and pressure on the binding modes of aromatic oxygenates while revealing mechanistic insights into C-O bond cleavage and competitive pathways for undesired products in the presence of solvents and high surface coverages of adsorbed species. The objectives will be accomplished by developing advanced first-principles Monte Carlo (FPMC) and molecular dynamics (FPMD) algorithms. These novel sampling algorithms will be used to investigate catalytic activity for the cleavage of carbon oxygen bonds including the beta-O-4 linkage by considering model compounds containing a phenolic hydroxyl group. In all these calculations, solvent molecules will be explicitly represented to determine their effect on reactants, transition states, products, and catalytic sites. Composition of model phosphide and carbide catalysts will be systematically varied to understand the structure-composition-property relationship for catalytic activity. More broadly, the FPMC and FPMD simulations will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in computational modeling, and provide advanced simulation tools to model catalytic processes under relevant thermodynamic constraints. The fundamental knowledge thus generated will provide a rational framework for designing efficient and effective catalysts for converting lignocellulosic biomass into fuels and chemicals. The algorithmic developments will be implemented in a widely distributed software suite, CP2K, enabling modeling of a wide range of heterogeneous catalytic processes, including zeolite-based catalysis and electrocatalysis.

Despite the potential for academic and career success in STEM, students with learning disabilities participate in advanced science courses and pursue STEM careers at much lower rates than their peers. The project will focus on the motivational beliefs of middle and high school students with learning disabilities as largely neglected but likely powerful influences on science trajectories, contributing to the goal of fostering an inclusive STEM educational system and workforce.<br/><br/>The research will take place in three phases, addressing multiple perspectives and levels of analysis. In the first phase, a national longitudinal dataset (High School Longitudinal Study 2009) will be analyzed to investigate the relationship between motivational beliefs of high-school students with learning disabilities and subsequent pursuit of advanced science coursework and careers. In the second phase, a mixed-methods study with 80 middle-school students with learning disabilities will investigate how science instructional experiences shape motivational beliefs. The third phase will focus on the teacher perspective, working with a cadre of master science teachers to understand teachers' perceptions of learning disabilities and to co-develop practical resources for use in science classrooms. The education plan similarly uses multiple approaches to have impact. These include: 1) integrating project theory and research across the University of Rochester's masters-level courses for future educators in STEM and special education, 2) improving doctoral-level research methods courses by developing courses aligned with the project's varied research methods, 3) partnering with master teaching fellows who are current science teachers with the ability to improve STEM outcomes in area schools, and 4) developing professional development experiences to inform science instructional practices.<br/><br/>The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.

Voices to Hear (V2H) will use the oral tradition of storytelling to empower Native American students (middle school, high school and college) to engage in environmental decision-making and scientific communication, while building a stronger sense of their ethnic identity. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe (CdAT), University of Idaho, and University of New Hampshire research alliance will recruit and work with middle school, high school, and undergraduate students from the CdAT Reservation in Idaho and other Tribal youth who attend University of Idaho, to develop high-quality audio documentaries focused on environmental decision-making processes. The production of a three- or five-minute high- quality audio documentary/podcast is a multilayered, labor-intensive process that emphasizes scientific inquiry, patience, and perseverance, ultimately requiring observation, data collection, analysis, and building a summary or conclusion.  While podcasts resonate strongly with the oral storytelling traditions of native American youth, they also provide a mechanism for conducting scientific inquiry. The project focuses on students learning about how to merge different knowledge systems (Western- mainstream/dominant science perspective, and Indigenous traditional knowledge) in order to become effective environmental decision-makers in the future. By investigating how community members resolve local environmental problems, students will be mentored by traditional and professional experts, and learn to utilize both STEM and cultural perspectives to solve environmental issues.  The project will develop and implement a unique, vertically integrated mentoring model where Native undergraduate students will be trained to mentor high school and middle school students, thereby helping middle school and high school students learn about pathways to college and other careers. <br/><br/>The V2H project will examine how people from Native American communities negotiate their Indigenous knowledge sources with Western science to make decisions in their everyday lives. The project grounds itself in research on how student's ethnic identity impacts their science learning and also decision-making capacity in their everyday life. Project research will employ a mixed-methods design. The project will address several research questions: (1) What complex systems thinking attributes do students demonstrate? (2) How do students merge or negotiate different knowledge systems (Indigenous and Western)? (3) How do the students ethnic identity change through both audio documentary making and mentoring? (4) What aspects of complex thinking and integrating knowledge systems improve students attitudes toward traditional and non-traditional STEM topics? Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and parallel data analysis will be implemented through the life of the project.  In order to understand what complex thinking attributes students demonstrate, the project will employ a pre- and post- modeling activity, using Mental Modeler, software that allows individuals to define components of a system and show the interconnectedness between the components of that system.

This happens when cancer spreads, but also when an embryo grows.  Whether cells can change from ones that move into ones that remain in the same place is partly dependent on the tissue stiffness. If we better understand this change in cells, it will improve our understanding of how cancer progresses and how our organs grow. The change from mobile to a static cells is call mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). MET is important to kidney and heart development, wound healing and cancer metastasis. When MET happens, migrating cells change so that they are immobile and tightly bound to neighboring cells. MET depends on tissue stiffness, but the details of the dependence aren't known. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will measure the response of cells to dynamic changes in matrix stiffness and determine how EMT is affected by tissue stiffness. This will help in understanding how embryos grow, how to better manufacture artificial tissues and in building 'organs on a chip' that can be used for drug discovery research. The PI and graduate student supported through this project will develop and implement a workshop for grade 6-12 teachers focused on biomechanics and mechanobiology concepts so that they can better teach their students, including how engineering research impacts society.     <br/><br/>Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) is a phenotypic change in which migratory cells with weak cell-cell contacts transition to tightly bound cells exhibiting apical-basal polarity. MET is central to embryonic remodeling, establishment of organ architecture, wound healing, reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells, and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. While it is recognized that mechanical properties of the cellular niche change dynamically during MET-associated processes in vivo, important questions still remain regarding how microenvironmental physical properties regulate MET. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop a dynamic hydrogel system that recapitulates changes in tissue mechanical properties during MET-associated events, and then to use this system to determine the expression of genes associated with epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell migration. Further studies will elucidate the role of key mechanoresponsive signaling molecules and epigenetic remodeling in regulating MET response to mechanical signals. The establishment of molecular mechanisms linking tissue mechanics and MET will result in a better understanding of mechanotransduction processes and will provide insight into how mechanical signals regulate cell plasticity. The research program provides the foundation for educational and outreach efforts aimed toward incorporating positive themes about the impact of engineering and mechanobiology on society into engineering curricula and into recruitment efforts directed toward grade 6-12 through graduate-level students. A workshop for grade 6-12 teachers focused on biomechanics and mechanobiology concepts will be developed and implemented and will demonstrate how research impacts society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Sharma is developing new synthetic methods for the construction of the types of bioactive molecules that are frequently used in efforts to identify drug leads for the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders. The research described seeks to develop cascade reactions that take advantage of a sequence of carefully timed steps to convert inexpensive, readily accessible compounds into higher-value, complex molecules. To accomplish this, the Sharma group is developing new reaction protocols that involve the use of more than one metal at a time. This research is expected to have broad application in the fields of chemical synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and therapeutics development.  Professor Sharma is also pioneering an outreach program, the Synergistic Catalytic Cycle for Education Excellence  (SC2E2), that provides crucial hands-on science education for underrepresented students in the State of Oklahoma. The SC2E2 program encourages an increase in school enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of highly qualified STEM students from low-income areas in the State of Oklahoma.<br/><br/>Despite dramatic advances in natural product-inspired drug discovery, many bioactive scaffolds (spirocycles, medium-sized rings, and terpene furanolactones) remain underexploited in drug discovery screening owing to the challenges associated with their synthesis. To address these challenges, this research program will utilize metal carbene cascade reactions for the efficient scalable synthesis of such scaffolds. More specifically, this research focuses on the use of diazo-derived metal-carbenes that are ambiphilic in nature in combination with a second metal catalyst to trigger sequential reactions with a nucleophile and an electrophile. The ensuing cascade reactions lead to the rapid generation of molecular complexity. A comprehensive educational plan is also integrated with the research goals to provide an inclusive scientific education experience for students from underrepresented groups in the State of Oklahoma. The proposed SC2E2 program is inspired from developed research involving synergistic catalysis, in which two or more catalysts act simultaneously to improve the efficiency of existing transformations. Likewise, SC2E2 builds upon inclusive educational practices in a cyclic process by providing students training, guidance and leadership opportunities, which ultimately help cultivate a new generation of diverse STEM professionals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We consume plants either directly, or by eating animals that have been fed with plants. Therefore, life on earth would simply not be possible without plants. The calories, amino acids, vitamins and mineral ions our bodies require are taken up by plants from the environment or they are made within plant cells after uptake of some of the building blocks. Plants use these nutrients for growth and the production of edible organs such as tubers and seeds. However, abiotic stresses, including soil mineral limitation, drought and high temperature, and biotic stresses such as pathogen and insect pest attacks provide a threat to plant food production. But how can plants achieve mineral ion uptake, even under stress, and how are they able to use the nutrients and produce the tissues and organs needed for the human food supply? Plants have evolved specific membrane proteins that can sense and transfer environmental signals, as well as recognize and transport mineral ions from the outside environment into the cell. Novel scientific approaches have revolutionized our understanding of the structure and function of plant membranes, and this workshop will address important breakthroughs in membrane biology with respect to signaling, nutrient transport and plant growth. We expect that the scientific interactions will promote discussions on how to meet the challenge of feeding the global community of tomorrow and will facilitate advances essential for food security.<br/><br/>The 6th Pan American Membrane Biology Workshop will be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada from June 24-28th, 2018. It will focus on topics covering important breakthroughs in plant membrane biology and their importance for plant growth and adaption to environmental stresses. Given the importance of membrane biology and its potential to continue to make groundbreaking discoveries, there is pressing scientific demand for opportunities to communicate and interact. This meeting will be both stimulating and timely, and specific objectives are (1) to organize and support knowledge exchange and discussions on the latest scientific advances in membrane biology research, including in areas related to plant membrane structure, transport, protein trafficking, and signal transduction, (2) to promote interactions between scientists and trainees to share new discoveries in the field of membrane biology as it relates to plant growth, development and nutrition, and to enhance training and new collaborations that will move the field forward and (3) to directly involve newly independent scientists and trainees, with emphasis on diversity and gender. The workshop agenda will include discussions for trainee mentorship, publication strategies and emerging areas of plant membrane biology in a supportive setting to promote trainee and established researcher interactions. The broader impacts of this meeting are manifold. It will promote participation of groups underrepresented in science and support diversity in the plant biology community by connecting the trainees with senior scientist role models.

These applications require low latency and fast response time, which are often difficult to attain due to the physical distance and bandwidth limitations between users and the cloud. To cope with these limitations, edge computing has been introduced as a new paradigm that optimizes cloud computing to provide distributed computing solutions at the edge of the network, where IoT users utilize the computing resources in their vicinity (sometimes called ""cloudlets""). Driven by the surging demand for edge computing, the energy consumption of clouds, cloudlets, and devices becomes increasingly important both from an environmental and cost viewpoint. Most of the existing energy consumption improvements in clouds come from improved engineering rather than improved algorithms. Such a practice fails to incorporate significant optimization opportunities available for clouds/cloudlets/devices to reduce their energy consumption. This two-year project focuses on developing resource management systems to significantly improve energy efficiency in edge computing. <br/><br/>The project consists of the following research thrusts: 1) understanding energy consumption in edge computing by exploring recurrent energy consumption patterns and identifying potential improvements; 2) introducing energy-aware data and job decomposition algorithms by developing mathematical and scalable computational models that seamlessly integrate multiple system objectives; 3) developing energy-aware placement of jobs to the edge components based on matching theory, graph theory, and distributed online algorithm design; and 4) evaluating the system on the National Science Foundation-funded CloudLab platform.<br/><br/>This project will enable more efficient use of cloud computing at the edge, while reducing energy consumption, which leads to cost reduction in edge services. It also benefits IoT users by extending battery lifetime of their smart devices and by improving their application performance. This project may lead to societal benefits such as promoting livable communities and smart cities. This research will be integrated into the into classroom teaching via a cloud computing course.

Paula Turkon, Sturt Manning, and Carol Griggs, along with colleagues from Mexico, will conduct research to provide a high-resolution absolute tree-ring chronology for Northern Mesoamerican archaeological sites using a combination of tree-ring and AMS radiocarbon data.  This project extends their preliminary research both geographically and chronologically, with the goal of linking the existing Epiclassic chronology from Northwestern Mesoamerica that ends in the 8th century A.D., to the regionally extensive, calendar-dated chronologies from living and relic trees in the same region. The dendrochronological results will offer dating precision to archaeologists working in these regions for time periods that do not have written sources of chronological data. It will also establish the foundation for climate reconstruction studies that, in the future, will help clarify the long-term relationships between the magnitude of climatic change and human response. In fostering close collaboration between archaeologists, dendrochronologists, graduate, and undergraduate students from multiple institutions throughout Mexico and the United States, this project's mission is to encourage the application of dendroarchaeology [=archaeological dendrochronology], currently not part of archaeological fieldwork or analysis in Mexico. <br/><br/>Mesoamerican archaeologists have long acknowledged the need for precise dating methods in order to understand cultural change, particularly in the region north of the core of Mesoamerican culture. Yet despite tremendous success in the development of tree-ring dating of archaeological sites just north in the American Southwest, and the more recent development of long tree-ring chronologies in Mexico that cover the past 1300 years, dendroarchaeology has been virtually absent in Mesoamerica. The first stage of this NSF funded project demonstrated the availability, measurability, and similarities in growth patterns (""crossdatability"") of archaeological tree-ring samples in Northwestern Mesoamerica from the 5th to 8th centuries A.D.  In this second stage, the researchers will incorporate archaeological samples from Postclassic and historic sites located in a broader geographic region in northern Mesoamerica. Because the new archaeological collections of wood will likewise be from a time period for which there are no well-established master chronologies, the tree-ring sequences produced from the prehispanic sites will be initially anchored in time by ""radiocarbon wiggle-matching.""   This method fits a known relative sequence of radiocarbon dates from specific tree-rings against the radiocarbon calibration curve to achieve a precise fit and thus calendar placement with minimal error.  Ultimately, we intend to create a continuous tree-ring record from the present back to the Classic period, using both the archaeological and historic collections, as well as existing calendar-dated chronologies.  The resulting data will not only fill a significant gap in our knowledge of the chronology of Northern Mesoamerica, but help address broader questions such as the rate, timing, and directionality of cultural influences with the Mesoamerican cultural core. Since dendroarchaeological methods are cumulative and iterative, the chronologies will gain in length, sample depth, and robustness, and will become increasingly useful to archaeologists working in broader geographic regions and time periods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research goal of this project is to build and optimize an innovative electrode array device that will improve the resolution of brain interface devices by more than 1000-fold.  This goal is now considered possible due to the PI?s breakthrough success in developing electronics that can support more than 650 electrodes with a single wire.  The array, which can both record brain activity and stimulate the brain, will enable research into the subtle brain signals that generate seizures in people with epilepsy and unlock new treatment options.  The technology will also dramatically improve the performance of motor prosthetic devices for the paralyzed, visual prosthetic devices for the blind, and facilitate new treatments for other neurological disorders.  The educational goal is to engage students and teachers in understanding brain-machine interfaces and increase interest among students in pursuing STEM undergraduate degrees and careers. In collaboration with several local high schools, a high-school written science module on neuroengineering, meeting state and national science standards, will be created. The PI will develop materials for high school biology and physics teachers to introduce the field of neuroengineering with a hands-on laboratory exercise. The PI will host an annual workshop for 20 science teachers from around the state to introduce the field of neuroengineering and to give the teachers a chance to try out the lab materials.<br/><br/>The project's research objective, driven by the PI's recent breakthrough development of active, flexible electronics that will enable implanted neural interfaces in which greater than 65,000 electrodes can be sampled using fewer than 100 wires, is to advance and optimize these brain interfaces by measuring fundamental neural interface design parameters. These design parameters critically influence the signal to noise ratio, total information content, and long-term reliability of electrode implants. Leveraging both computational models and experimental results related to audio responses in rats and comparisons to nonhuman primate data made available by a collaborator, three aspects critical to the performance of neural interface devices will be investigated: 1) electrode material and contact size, 2) electrode spacing, and 3) array geometry. The implant design uses the same electronics that permit a digital camera to have millions of pixels without millions of wires and will improve the resolution of brain interface devices by more than 1000-fold. The Research Plan is organized under 3 objectives: 1) Measure the effect of cortical surface contact size, material, and impedance on the properties of the recorded neural signals, including the recording of action potentials (APs); 2) Determine the surface electrode spacing required to satisfy Nyquist-Shannon spatial sampling by measuring the information content of neural signals from varying length scales and 3) Understand the biological and non-biological factors that influence the long-term reliability of surface electrode arrays by chronically implanting surface electrode arrays in freely behaving rats and evaluating long-term function and biocompatibility. The project's educational objective, to create a high-school science module, involves development and dissemination of curricular resources and a lab exercise using Arduino microcontrollers that will allow students to record and display their own electromyographic(EMG) signals and use them to control a video game.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These questions, among others, are unanswered because the fossil record of fishes from this time period is extremely poor. This project analyzes newly discovered, complete fossilized skeletons of freshwater fish from a critical time period (72-66 million years ago). These fossils are extraordinarily well-preserved, providing a rare glimpse of complete skeletons. This project will fill a critical gap in understanding the origin and evolution of modern freshwater fish. In addition to the scientific merit of this project, there are several broader impacts. First, the fossils to be described are deposited in publicly accessible natural history collections, thereby ensuring that they are available in perpetuity to the scientific community. Second, student training programs developed around the preparation and analysis of the fossils provides valuable research and training for budding scientists. Third, results from this study will be published in scientific articles and presented at professional meetings and seminars for public audiences. And finally, by using the resources available at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the project will increase public understanding of science. All specimens will be prepared in a lab where active preparation and study of the specimens can be observed by the more than 1.2 million annual visitors to the Field Museum, including many K-12 student groups and teachers, and a temporary exhibit of this exquisitely preserved fossil fish fauna will add an important component to current exhibits at the Field Museum. <br/><br/>Although the modern freshwater fish fauna of North America has been intensively studied, its origin, biogeography, and evolutionary history are still poorly understood, due in part to a lack of whole-body fossils from Cretaceous freshwater deposits, particularly those containing articulated skeletons. This study uses exceptionally well-preserved fossil fish from a recently discovered lagerstatten in the Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota, to illuminate the transition between the early Mesozoic (consisting of extinct orders and families) and the modern freshwater fauna. Recently discovered blocks containing the articulated, complete skeletons of many freshwater fish have been acquired by the Field Museum for preparation and analysis. All fossils will be described and illustrated using a combination of detailed photographic documentation of all aspects of the anatomy of the species with matched line drawings clearly showing the interpretation of the morphology. These data will form the basis of original morphological descriptions, character conceptualization, and phylogenetic and comparative analyses of key fish lineages present in the blocks, including the Acipenseridae, Polyodontidae, Amiidae, Lepisosteidae, and possibly Teleostei.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Originally developed as a theory to optimize the efficiency of heat engines, two extensions of thermodynamics in the last century advanced the theory to the point at which quantum mechanics should be incorporated. First, the identification of the role of information in thermodynamics makes strong connections between heat, entropy and information. Second, extensions of thermodynamics to the realm of microscopic systems in which fluctuations are significant allow the application of thermodynamics at the level of single trajectories of classical particles. Quantum mechanics requires both of these features as information and fluctuations are central to the behavior of quantum systems. The experimental control over single quantum systems that has been achieved in this century places us in a unique position to extend thermodynamics into the quantum regime. Understanding quantum thermodynamics will be increasingly important as quantum machines become more complicated and as classical machines are further miniaturized.  The experimental work will utilize microscopic superconducting circuits as artificial atoms and the interaction of these atoms with microwave light to control the atom's environment.  The team will conduct a series of experiments elucidating the relationship between quantum information, heat and work. An additional goal of this project is to increase the diversity and talent pool of future physicists. The team will create a three and a half day pre-orientation program for entering freshman focused on building community among women and minority physics majors.<br/><br/><br/>The project builds on previous work using superconducting artificial atoms and the physics of cavity quantum electrodynamics to create quantum systems with exquisite control over the environment of the system.  The team will undertake a series of experiments to study the relationship between quantum information and the thermodynamic quantities of heat and work. The first experiment will examine the interplay between quantum feedback, quantum coherence, and work in a continuously monitored superconducting qubit that realizes a quantum version of Maxwell's demon.  The team will look for uniquely quantum features stemming from the quantum coherence of the qubit and the backaction of the continuous measurement.  In the second project the team will create a single atom heat engine that utilizes the electronic degrees of freedom of a superconducting artificial atom. This will explore how quantum superposition, entanglement, and quantum control can affect the Carnot efficiency of the engine.  In a final experiment, the team will study the microscopic physics of thermalization with a thermal bath from the perspective of quantum measurement by simultaneously monitoring heat transfer to and from the bath.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, Professors Kevin Caran, Christine Hughey, and colleagues in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry host an REU site that integrates deaf, hard of hearing (D/HH), and sign language-interpreting students in chemical research. JMU faculty members provide research opportunities in all major sub-disciplines of chemistry, with expertise centered in synthesis, biophysical chemistry and materials. In addition, students participate in a series of professional development activities aimed at enhancing effective science communication with other chemists, scientists in other disciplines, the public, and those with communication disorders (e.g. deaf and hard-of-hearing). Participants include students and faculty from JMU and outside institutions that serve deaf students or institutions that do not have extensive research infrastructure. By involving students in all aspects of the research process, from experimental design to dissemination of results, this program aims to lower the barriers, particularly for D/HH students, that hinder the pursuit of graduate studies in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The JMU Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry provides research opportunities for D/HH students and faculty. The students participate in a variety of research projects. Some examples include: the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to formaldehyde, the development of hybrid materials for photovoltaic applications, and the use of molecular dynamics to elucidate the mechanisms of the binding of ubiquitin to its substrate protein. D/HH participants are supported with professional American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters and student interpreters in both professional and social settings. This immersive experience provides interpreting students the opportunity to learn and work in a science environment with the goal of developing professional interpreters with experience in the laboratory. In addition to the full-time student interpreters, additional ASL-interpreting students are invited to campus to observe the REU program for one week. The incorporation of these students expands the impact of the program by exposing a larger number of interpreting students to the challenges and opportunities involved in deaf communication in chemistry laboratories. All REU hearing participants, including faculty and students from outside colleges and universities, benefit from interactions with D/HH students and faculty, as hearing participants gain an appreciation for the challenges and opportunities associated with the inclusion of persons with disabilities. As a result of these interactions, this REU program aims to lower barriers for collaboration between these groups in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results could contribute to innovations in motor skill training, including rehabilitation of sensorimotor disorders after stroke and development of prostheses, as well as to ergonomics, brain-machine interfaces, robotics, and tele-operations.  The project will advance the NSF's educational goals by encouraging underrepresented students to consider STEM career paths.

The project will also support the expansion of a neuroscience summer camp developed by the study team for Indiana high school girls.  <br/><br/>To execute a voluntary movement, such as reaching out to pick up a pencil, the brain must plan motor parameters such as movement direction and extent. Importantly, the hand's movement will not be correct unless the brain accurately perceives hand position, obtained through an integration of visual information, body position sense (proprioception), touch, etc. This ""multisensory integration"" is flexible and can change with learning, just like motor control, but it is not known whether or how these processes interact. The project will address this question at both the behavioral and neural levels and asks whether multisensory integration and motor control share a common sensorimotor map (a model relating motor commands to sensory consequences). A combination of psychophysics and reaching tasks will indicate whether multisensory integration and motor learning affect each other at the behavioral level. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the researchers will examine whether connections between sensory and motor areas of the brain change in strength when subjects learn a new spatial relationship between vision and proprioception; this would suggest a shared sensorimotor map at the neural level.

Vascular plants include lycopods, ferns and their allies, as well as conifers and flowering plants. They form the foundation of nearly all terrestrial ecosystems and our food supply, yet scientists disagree about when and how they evolved. Current methods for estimating evolutionary timelines for these species have led to conflicting answers, as they rely on the ability of researchers to assign extinct fossil species correctly to particular branch points in the tree of life. This assignment is challenging to do because extinct species may have morphology that can be interpreted differently. Researchers will refine a new data analysis method to address this limitation. They will compare the DNA sequences of living vascular plants and incorporate morphological data from both living and extinct species to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. During this process, researchers will apply new computer algorithms to estimate the evolutionary timeline for the species. Researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of an early-career researcher. They will educate the public about plant evolution by creating an interpretive exhibit at the University of California Berkeley and by producing a series of online video lessons for high school students and educators.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new total-evidence dating method to reconstruct the next-generation of time-calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses that incorporate both extinct and extant species. Researchers will leverage DNA sequence data collected by an existing NSF award to reconstruct a backbone phylogeny of ca. 300 extant vascular plants using nuclear genomic data. They will also collect morphological data for ca. 300 traits from these species as well as ca. 200 extinct fossil species. These data will be simultaneously integrated by the software program RevBayes to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny. This program combines sophisticated tree-shape priors, powerful models of morphological evolution, and recently developed methods for relaxing the molecular clock. Project outcomes will include a robust estimate of vascular plant divergence times and patterns of morphological evolution with an explicit measure of the full associated uncertainty of that estimate. The project will support research by sharing new and legacy morphological datasets in the online, open-access PROTEUS database and by hosting a training workshop focused on refining the theory and practice of divergence-time dating.

Hydrogel materials are already used for soft contact lenses and biomedical coatings (for example for prosthetics) because they are water-permeable, biocompatible, and compliant. However, their surface slip behavior does not yet have clear design rules because of their hydrated nature and broad ability to tune the composition. This award will allow for highly-qualified students to examine the mechanisms of slip, and to combine their findings into more concrete design rules for these hydrogel surfaces. This requires them to draw from several disciplines including materials science, mechanical engineering, surface science, and even biomechanics. This work will allow for the recruitment and encouragement of underrepresented groups in engineering. The PI will participate in two ongoing summer camps for underrepresented K-12 students and will enlarge the curricula of these camps by bringing in women engineers from industry to lead educational events based on the science of lubrication. Specific interactions will be focused on highlighting the personal experiences of the industry leaders to encourage the camp participants to pursue STEM careers.

The mechanics of energy dissipation in hydrated soft surfaces, especially under contact and slip, have not been sorted out, and thus there is no way to currently engineer the lubrication behavior required for prosthetic devices which support load and control slip. This work examines reigning theories as to their ability to account for energy dissipation under slip, including fluid load support, viscoelastic relaxation, and fluid shear. Experiments on mechanical deformation and contact will prove or disprove the hallmarks of different mechanisms, such as the pressure-dependence on friction coefficient. The material composition will also be varied, and the results will be assembled into guiding design principles for soft hydrated surfaces.

Complex systems are made up of a large number of smaller components that interact in ways that can lead to interesting collective behaviors where the components act in concert.  Examples of such systems include materials, biological pathways, and neural networks as well as many engineered systems and social networks.  Complex systems are difficult to model.  Usually, mathematical models are most useful when they are sufficiently simple to capture the relevant parts of the phenomenon of interest while ignoring irrelevant details.  For complex systems, it is difficult to know from the start which components are relevant and which are irrelevant.  Consequently, models of real-world systems tend to be overly complicated, difficult to work with, and have limited predictive power compared to more parsimonious representations.<br/>This project leverages recent advances that combine the mathematical areas of information theory with differential geometry and topology.  The basic idea utilizes a systematic method for pruning irrelevant complications from a model of a complex system until a sufficiently simple model is obtained.  By enumerating all of the resulting approximations, the scientist has a roadmap from the complicated, detailed representation of the physical system, through various types of approximations and the system behaviors they describe.  Put another way, the process acts as a mathematical bridge across scales: connecting microscopic mechanisms to systems-level phenomena.  In this project, the PI will apply these new mathematical and associated computational tools to three target application areas: crystal structures of alloys, biochemical kinetics of developmental pathways, and networks of neurons.  By better understanding how mathematical models reflect relevant physical details, models will be better at predicting the behavior of complex systems and enable more sophisticated design and control of complicated materials and processes. <br/>This work also includes an educational component that will develop a pedagogy of interdisciplinary science.  This pedagogy will focus on university faculty in the form of a seminar series; university students in the form of a multi-department, special topics course; and high school teachers in the form of teaching workshops and web resources for high school science teachers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research aimed at developing simple models of complex systems. Simple mathematical models have always played an important role in scientific inquiry.  For systems with separated scales or symmetries, there are standard techniques for constructing parsimonious representations from complicated, mechanistic descriptions.  Recent advances combining information theory and differential geometry and topology suggest new methods for reasoning about the relationship between mechanisms and phenomena in models of complex physical systems.  <br/>For this research, the PI takes the approach that the predictions of a multi-parameter model form a manifold embedded in an abstract data space.  It has been observed that typical model manifolds are bounded and that simple, approximate models reside on the boundary of the model manifold.  The Manifold Boundary Approximation Method constructs a sequence of limiting approximations, that is, ""small parameters"" that corresponds to a sequence of simple, approximate models.  This research will extend these results to three target application areas: alloy crystal structure, biochemical kinetics of developmental pathways, and networks of neurons.  Within these target application areas, the PI will develop a new approach to modeling based on the concept of a ""supremum model"", that is, the minimal model that simultaneously explains several behaviors.  When combined with the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method, the supremum model concept enables one to bootstrap from several models of overlapping system components to models of much larger systems, the direct exploration of which would be computationally challenging or infeasible.<br/>This work also includes an educational component that will develop a pedagogy of interdisciplinary science.  This pedagogy will target university faculty in the form of a seminar series; university students in the form of a multi-department, special topics course; and high school teachers in the form of teaching workshops and web resources for high school science teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the development of quantitative predictive theory and models, ecologists have already made considerable progress understanding the structure and properties of undisturbed ecosystems.  But numerous observations indicate that this understanding fails when ecosystems are changing rapidly.  The project will build upon ideas that have proven successful in statistical physics and the relatively new field of information theory.  The expected output is a quantitative, predictive and thus testable, theory of ecosystem structure that will be applicable to both undisturbed ecosystems and to those that are changing rapidly in response to disturbance.   Because our livelihoods are entangled with the health of our ecosystems in numerous ways, both insofar as our activities can alter nature and nature can enrich our lives, this research will contribute to the betterment of humankind as well as the advancement of basic science. This project will support a postdoctoral research fellow and provide research training experiences for graduate students.  <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to advance and test a dynamic theory that can predict patterns in the abundance, distribution, and energetics of individuals and species in ecosystems.  The theory should apply to ecosystems that are either static or changing rapidly in response to disturbance.  To achieve that goal, insights from statistical physics and information theory will be combined with explicit mechanisms governing organismal and population growth, as well as migration, diversification, and extinction.  Stochastic mechanistic theory will predict the time-dependent probability distributions of a small set of governing state variables that play a role similar to that of pressure, volume, and temperature in thermodynamics.  These state variables will then provide the constraints used in maximizing information entropy to yield predicted probability distributions for the detailed patterns displayed by individuals and species. The expected outcome is a general theory of both static and dynamic ecology.  Ecological census data from the tropics to the tundra, from plants to animals, across a wide range of spatial scales, and under a variety of disturbances, will be used to test the predictions of the new theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pristine lakes within those landscapes, especially lakes whose iconic beauty has led to their designation as World Heritage sites, have strong tourist appeal. Yet that beauty is threatened by changes to the clarity of the lake waters. Conservation efforts for these potentially fragile ecosystems would benefit from a predictive understanding of lake responses to global climate change. This research explores the consequences of these landscape-level changes for lake ecosystems.  Rather than study a single system over a long time, these researchers will substitute a comparison of lake ecosystems that currently differ in the extent of glacial and vegetation coverage in the catchment.  The primary aim of the research is to compare lake responses to rain and snowmelt-driven inputs of materials such as glacial flour, the finely ground rock from glaciers, and dissolved products of organic matter decomposition.  Both of these materials have strong effects on the clarity of the water or water transparency, which in turn influences many aspects of lake ecosystem function.  Lake responses will be examined using two complementary measurements of ecological resilience: resistance, the magnitude of change in the system following rain or snowmelt events; and recovery, the rate of return to previous conditions.  Project findings will deepen the basic scientific understanding of the effects of changing landscapes on lake ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains.  Undergraduate students will be engaged in all stages of the research, including planning, data collection, analysis, and publication.  Targeted efforts will be made to attract students from diverse backgrounds and experiences.  Because water transparency of mountain lakes is a powerful case study through which to communicate ecosystem-level effects of environmental change to a broader audience, a short film describing the research will be produced and  distributed.<br/><br/>The proposed research will test the overarching hypothesis that changes in the resilience of water transparency occur systematically as lake catchments shift from glaciated to rocky to vegetated states.  Specifically, resistance of water transparency is predicted to increase with glacial loss and decrease with vegetation advance.  Additionally, recovery rates of water transparency are predicted to increase as the regulator of transparency shifts from suspended rock flour in glacial catchment lakes to dissolved organic matter (DOM) in vegetated catchment lakes.  To test these hypotheses, high frequency monitoring buoys equipped with sensors that measure turbidity and the fluorescent component of DOM will be deployed in five lakes that vary across a gradient of glacial and vegetation coverage.  Concurrent hydrological data will be used to better understand dynamics of material inputs and their relationships to meteorological data recorded at nearby weather stations.  More generally, the research probes the relationship between the two components of resilience by testing whether resistance and recovery change independently as glaciers retreat and vegetation advances.  The potential for uncoupled changes in the two components of resilience is a unique and transformative aspect of the research program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researchers will categorize different types of unemployment compensation (unemployment insurance, lump sum payments, and no insurance) and use sophisticated methods to analyze how the type of unemployment compensation unemployed workers receive affects affect their consumption over time.  The researchers will then develop a theory that combines the insights of both economics and psychology to explain the observed differences in consumption patterns of unemployed workers receiving different types of unemployment compensation. The researchers will then use the results to discuss policy recommendations.  The results of this research will provide valuable inputs into unemployment compensation policies in both developed and developing worlds.  The results will also be used as an input to develop policies to improve the functioning of labor markets, hence enhance economic growth both in the US and around the world.  Finally, the results of this research project can be used by individuals to plan their consumption during periods of unemployment.  <br/><br/><br/>The debate about the optimal choice between (combinations of) unemployment insurance (UI) and lump sum payment at the time of layoff focuses on the tradeoff between the disincentive from the former to the inability to smoothen consumption because of the uncertainty of unemployment duration in the case of the latter.   There is very little empirical and theoretical investigation of this tradeoff, especially in developing countries that are struggling to develop their unemployment compensation systems.  The proposed research project will use theory and large data sets to investigate how the type of unemployment compensation scheme affects the consumption trajectories of laid off workers.  The project follows a strand in the economics literature that documents consumption profiles around economic shocks. The PIs will build a new high-frequency longitudinal microdata of formal employment and expenditure for more than 400,000 individuals and exploit this dataset and a rich empirical setting with multiple sources of variation in unemployment insurance schemes across workers to document new empirical findings. The project will then estimate structural models of behaviors that explain these consumption patterns and evaluate their ability to explain the empirical observations. The project will then use the estimated models to discuss policy implications for unemployment compensation schemes, particularly for developing countries. The results of this research project will provide critical inputs into the formulation of unemployment compensations schemes and other labor market policies, improve the functioning of labor markets and in the process, increase economic growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Economic models of conforming to social norms assume that people conform either because of material incentives or to avoid punishment.  This research project will use economic theory and laboratory experiments to study why people conform to social norms when there are no material incentives to do so or punishment for deviating from those norms. The theory is based on the idea that individuals want to judge themselves in a positive way but lack a direct way of evaluating themselves.  As a result, individuals look at the actions of their peers to form the positive image of themselves, allowing them to form a better image of themselves.  Comparing one?s behavior to their peer?s lead to a better understanding of social conformity that does not require material incentives or punishment.  The researchers will then conduct laboratory experiments to test this theory.  The results of this research project will provide an input into the formulation of policies to enhance social cohesion.  The project will support a doctoral dissertation research and therefore contributes to growth of US's economic research capital and global leadership in economics research.  <br/><br/>Economic theories of social conformity based on sanctions, social signaling, or adherence to social norms cannot explain why there is conformity among those whose actions are not likely to be seen by others, nor do they address the environment in which peer effects may be strong.  This research project seeks to deepen understanding of why social conformity arises in the absence of material incentives with a unified theory and two experiments. The theory posits that individuals have an intrinsic desire to judge and evaluate themselves positively.  Lacking objective means of self-evaluation, individuals rely on social comparisons to better understand what their choices reveal about themselves.  By deriving behavioral conformity from self-image, the model establishes a scope for peer effects without observable incentives or the pressures of social stigma.  Two experiments are then conducted to test the predictions of this model.  The first experiment tests whether individuals follow a pattern of peer effects that is uniquely consistent with self-image evaluation.  The second experiment tests whether a noisier signal mitigates peer effects by garbling the information peer-behavior provides.  The effects of social interaction on individual decisions is quite broad and a better understanding of how self-evaluation through social comparisons drives social conformity will provide explanation of empirical observations of this phenomenon as well as provide policy makers with information as to when peer effects are likely to be strong.  The results of this research project have many broader impacts, not only from application to fields of economics, but also in areas of public policy, business, and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increases in algal blooms typically include cyanobacteria, which are capable of producing toxins called cyanotoxins. These cyanotoxins are harmful to human health and to other animals that live in or drink water from the lakes. There is little, historical data on algal blooms and cyanotoxins, which makes it difficult to understand how long they have been occurring and what makes them happen. This project will advance our understanding of algal blooms and cyanotoxin occurrence by focusing on the historical record of cyanotoxins that are preserved in the sediments of lakes. There are significant challenges in relating the cyanotoxin in lake sediments to their historic production in the water column of lakes. This EAGER project will develop innovative methods to extract and measure cyanotoxins in lake sediment, and conduct experiments to quantify how the toxins degrade under various environmental conditions. Researchers will then make critical determinations of historic production of these toxins for Lake Harris in Florida. Results from this project will be broadly useful in developing standard methods for the study of cyanotoxins in all lakes and reservoirs, and will provide lake and municipal water managers a new tool to acquire cyanotoxin data on a longer time scale. This project will also provide research training for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including members of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>While these paleolimnological investigations are providing much needed records of historic cyanotoxin production, it is unknown if changes in paleo-cyanotoxin stratigraphies result from alterations in toxin production, degradation or deposition. As a result, sediment studies incorporating cyanotoxins as a proxy are at risk to incorrectly infer historic toxin production. This research will establish cyanotoxin water-sediment connections, develop innovative analytical protocols, and cutting-edge degradation indices for determining cyanotoxin sediment studies on cylindrospermopsin and microcystin. In addition, results from these experiments will used to verify cyanotoxin deposition with known periods of historic eutrophication and limnological change throughout the Holocene. The objectives of the study are: 1) develop sediment-water column connections for cyanotoxins by matching surface sediment cyanotoxin concentrations with known water column cyanotoxin values and improving extraction methods, 2) determine degradation coefficients for CYN and MC in a variety of sediment types under a range of environmental variables (temperature, oxygen, organic matter content) experienced in lake sediment environments, and 3) identify stratigraphic changes of cyanotoxins and cyanobacteria pigments from sediment cores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Urban populations now account for over half of the world's population, with the proportion projected to grow to two-thirds by the mid-21st century.  Of this increase, 90% is expected to take place in developing countries, including those with authoritarian governments.  This research project investigates how urban labor migration, a key driver of this projected urbanization, can be catalyzed by development projects that may seem to have little to do with migration, such as those that subsidize rural house construction.  It analyzes how these development projects shape ideas about modernity and how these in turn encourage migration.  It also investigates how urban migration shapes senses of self and identity, and how these work with or against states' attempts to govern their populations. The project's findings will be widely disseminated via academic and non-academic outlets.  Results are relevant to policy-makers, NGOs, and development organizations concerned with the social impacts of rapid urbanization throughout the developing world.  <br/><br/>Using qualitative (participant observation, semi-structured interviews, surveys, and textual and discourse analysis) field-gathered data, this project examines the relationship between development as a rationale of rule and its actual accomplishment, and how state power (re)shapes desires vis-a-vis housing as a form of development.  The project contributes to the field of development geography through its investigation of governmentality and modernity in an authoritarian, non-Western context.  It also contributes to the geography of migration by analyzing how cultural politics and political-economic factors come together in producing labor migration, and how the experience of labor migration shapes migrant and urban subjectivities. This study investigates these broad questions by asking how and why villagers make the decisions they do with respect to accepting and spending on housing projects; how and why they make decisions about labor migration; and how urban living experiences change their aspirations and identities.  Although this project uses a case study of Tibetans in Qinghai province, China, its approach and findings has applicability in many other places experiencing rapid urbanization.

Plant interactions with these mutualists may be intertwined in important ways, but have most often been studied separately. This research will examine how mycorrhizal fungi affect plant traits important to pollination, and how the environmental context affects these interactions. These questions will be examined in an agricultural species of great economic importance in the United States - the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum).  Additionally, through existing farm-to-plate programs, relationships with K-12 teachers, and new collaborations with an agricultural outreach program, school children will be engaged in activities to learn about the importance of healthy below- and above-ground organisms, and high school and college students will be engaged in scientific research.<br/><br/>The project will examine if mycorrhizae affect floral traits important to pollinators in host genotype-specific ways.  Additionally, the identity and relative abundance of mycorrhizae will be examined for effects on floral trait expression in the host.  Mycorrhizal-driven differences in floral traits will be explored for their effects on pollinator visitation and resulting pollen limitation.  The links among mycorrhizae, floral traits, and pollination are hypothesized to depend on pollinator abundance, diversity, and identity. The work will capitalize on state-of-the-art molecular tools to understand if plant response to mycorrhizal fungi is dependent on the identity of fungal communities, and entail extensive field experiments to understand the importance of the native pollinator communities as well. To examine these hypotheses, highbush blueberry of two different cultivars (genotypes) will be inoculated with a commercially available inoculum or with soils containing native fungal spores and grown in pots in a common garden.  Once they flower, plants will be placed at six farms in Vermont alongside existing blueberry bushes.  Floral traits will be measured on each plant.  In addition, a pollen limitation experiment will be conducted to examine if mycorrhizal inoculation affects pollen limitation. Experimental plants, as well as others growing at each site, will be observed and the number and identity of bee pollinators will be recorded to assess site-specific differences in pollinator communities.

The research will use modern sophisticated methods to study the benefits and costs of labor movements across countries, within countries, and within cities. Many of the issues associated with labor migration are likely to increase in the future and understanding the possible spillover effects from migration is an important concern in the United States and the world.  For example, many large cities in the world are facing congestion and environmental stress and whether and how to invest in transportation infrastructure is a key question to be discussed now.  Understanding how to develop policies to maximize the role of migration as a poverty-reduction strategy has great promise for development around the world.  The results of this research will provide guidance on policy relating to labor markets, urbanization, and international relations, thus helping the US develop well-informed policies that enhance economic growth as well understanding the possible spillover effects from migration. This is an important concern in the United States and the world.  <br/><br/>The proposal contains three interlinked projects to study internal and cross-border migration. The first project seeks to quantify the heterogeneity in returns to migration through a two-stage RCT. Prospective internal migrant will be offered either ""low"" or ""high"" subsidies. Some of those who receive ""low"" subsidies will be surprised with a ""high"" subsidy after they have made a migration decision. The second project will use an observational panel data and a suite of experiments to study the economic effects and distributional consequences of a large public transportation investment. The third project develops and estimates a binational regional spatial equilibrium model of migration focusing on the US-Mexico border migration using a dataset of Mexico-US migration flows.  Providing quantitative and rigorous evidence of the benefits and costs of migration is indispensable now when there is increasing urbanization, movement of people across borders, and migration is a controversial topic world-wide. The proposed research will generate new datasets and disseminate the research findings.  A theme running through the projects is the incorporation of microeconomic estimates and RCTs into spatial general equilibrium models.

While many of these programs have been shown to be effective, there is little research on how these programs interact with one another. This proposed research will study how different mass media programs to improve health interact with each other to affect other outcomes that were not targeted.  It will develop a theory and test it with an experiment in which individuals are randomly reminded or incentivized to engage in one healthy behavior, two healthy behaviors, or nothing at all. By comparing outcomes across these groups, the study will discover whether these mechanisms cause interference between programs, and if so, which mechanisms are most important. This is the first study that uses theory and experiments to study the general mechanisms that may produce interactions among interventions. The results of this study promise to directly help the beneficiaries of programs that promote healthy (or otherwise beneficial) behaviors in underserved communities by enabling policy makers to coordinate programs more effectively.  The results of this research will improve the performance of many government and business programs, thus improving the lives of many US citizens.<br/><br/>This research will study whether there are mechanisms that cause behavior change campaigns to have spillovers or interactions, identify those mechanisms, and understand their implications in dynamic settings in different domains.  Evidence of spillovers or interactions implies that campaigns can be made more effective through coordination.   The research will take inventory of theories in economics and psychology that predict spillovers or interactions, organize them into a simple framework, and test the predictions of the framework with a field experiment.  SMS reminder programs about one ``target'' behavior or two such programs will be sent to participants and compare responses to the effects on non-target behaviors to establish if interactions exist, and distinguish between several possible mechanisms. Two additional studies will: (i) explore how these mechanisms operate in a dynamic setting, and (ii) investigate when to expect spillovers or interactions.

One of the main challenges is predicting impacts of multiple environmental stressors changing at the same time within highly dynamic ecosystems. Climate simulations in coastal marine habitats will, therefore, yield critical information about likely future changes in biodiversity and ecosystem health. This project is a partnership between institutions with a strong focus on serving underrepresented communities of students, and the investigators are committed to participating in K-12 and undergraduate mentorship programs through their respective institutions. Furthermore, the research will be based in Sitka, Alaska, where investigators will collaborate with the Sitka Sound Science Center to incorporate research into the Scientist in the Schools program and a summer day camp for elementary age children.<br/><br/>This work aims to uncover the trajectory of climate change impacts and interactive responses to multiple climatic stressors on coastal marine species, communities, and ecosystem functioning. To uncover these links, the investigators will (1) quantify seasonal and diel dynamics under ambient conditions in a benthic marine community, (2) conduct factorial manipulations of two climatic stressors - increased carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures - and measure impacts on physiology, diversity, and productivity, and (3) conduct a second field experiment to evaluate whether productivity responses are due to changes in physiology or biodiversity. Climatic changes have the potential to influence ecosystem functioning by altering physiology, abundance, and community structure (i.e., biodiversity), and this research specifically aims to partition these different pathways, leading to more effective predictions of impacts on benthic marine ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This site is supported by the NSF Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, in partnership with the Department of Defense. This program in WWU's Department of Chemistry provides research projects and professional development for students from community colleges and small four-year universities with limited research opportunities. Among the recruited participants, an emphasis is placed on underrepresented minorities from community colleges. Under the guidance of a faculty mentor, the students perform research in the areas of biochemistry, synthetic chemistry, or materials chemistry. In addition to providing an authentic research experience for these students, this program facilitates student transitions from community colleges to four-year universities, thus increasing the likelihood of these students obtaining an advanced degree in the sciences. The research training and workshops for REU participants provides them with training towards a career in chemistry, or a related science, and contributes to increasing the diversity of the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>The student participants choose a research project from one of three main areas of chemistry: biochemistry (structure, function and engineering of proteins and nucleic acids), synthetic chemistry (organic and organometallic method development, natural product synthesis, small molecule activation, biomaterials), or materials chemistry (nanomaterials, solar concentrators, heterogeneous catalysis, computational methods). This program also provides workshops that improve students' perspectives on how to conduct research, communicate scientifically, and initiate their career in chemistry. In addition to numerous formal and informal activities for the entire group of REU participants, divisional groups (biochemistry, synthetic chemistry, and materials chemistry) are used to provide additional training that is specific to the research area, including workshops and combined group meetings. Many projects are also collaborative between multiple investigators at WWU, allowing the REU students to interact with more faculty members and get exposure to a broader scope of research topics. The culmination of the summer program is a symposium in which REU participants give poster presentations on their research projects in addition to keynote speakers from each of the three research areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The event will take place on April 21-22 in conjunction with the ACM 2018 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2018) sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI), which will be held April 21-26 in Montreal, Canada.  The annual CHI conferences are the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and they are attended by approximately 3,000 HCI professionals from around the world.  Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI.  More information about this year's conference, whose theme is ""Engage with CHI"", is available online at https://chi2018.acm.org/.  The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees.  To increase the broad impact of the event, the organizers are committed to diversity.  Due to timing issues, the student participants for 2018 have already been selected; there are a total of 20 students (9 females and 11 males) from 10 different countries around the world, who represent a wide range of topic areas and backgrounds; in addition, no more than one student was accepted from any given institution.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  The 2018 Consortium will be a 2-day long event on April 21-22.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  This year's DC will adopt the successful schedule implemented in 2017, where the group breaks into clusters of 3-4 students paired with one faculty panelist.  Each student participant will have a time slot of approximately 20 minutes in which to make a formal presentation about his or her doctoral research and to receive feedback both from the faculty panelist and the other student participants.  The feedback will be constructive and geared to help the students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other HCI research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Follow up activities, including two poster sessions, are planned during the technical program of the conference on April 23-26.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2018 Extended Abstracts.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral research consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spatial data is used in mapping applications for navigation. Government agencies in public health, urban planning, transportation, scientific communities and private sector depend on spatial data mining and analysis to gain insights and produce actionable plans. However, with the increase in the size and complexity of spatial data, traditional desktop-based analysis is inadequate for the task, and there is a need to accelerate compute-intensive spatial applications on modern computers and supercomputers to get results in real-time. This requires new software design and implementation, as well as efficient algorithms for spatial query, join and overlay that can scale with the data and the available hardware resources. The first objective of this project is to develop practical parallel algorithms based on plane sweep for computational geometry problems. The second objective is to inject spatial data awareness into the existing Message Passing Interface (MPI)-based Geographic Information System (GIS), and incorporate new features to leverage high performace computing resources by using specialized software packages. A new load balancing technique will be developed that works during the file partitioning phase by non-contiguous file reading supported by the MPI library.<br/><br/>The MPI-Vector-IO library will enable efficient parallel input/output on large polygonal datasets stored on parallel filesystems, thus improving the state-of-the-art. The MPI-ACC-GIS software will enable existing sequential tools to be used in a high performance computing environment with thousands of cores. Parallelization of plane sweep algorithm based on concurrent data structures on shared memory machines will impact many computational geometry algorithms that rely on plane sweep for efficient implementation. Development of MPI-ACC-GIS software will be useful to geo-spatial data scientists. In addition, the project has a broader impact in training undergraduate and graduate students to perform research in high performance computing.<br/><br/>MPI-ACC-GIS software implementing new algorithms and methodologies along with test data, results and benchmarks will be made publicly available on a website hosted at the university.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will focus on the impacts of increased housing costs on middle-income renters and how their perceptions of housing cost change and their experiences of neighborhood change impact their decisions to move or not move.  This project will contribute to a growing body of scholarly literature regarding neighborhood change and residential mobility.  It will increase basic understanding of population dynamics in urban areas by examining and the reasons that middle-income residents move in a changing city.  Because this project will identify the specific factors that influence residential mobility or immobility in middle-income renters, project findings will enable policymakers and housing developers to better understand and serve the needs of middle-income residents in competitive housing markets and will facilitate development of more effective policy interventions aimed at middle-income residents.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Many urban areas in the United States have high and increasing housing costs.  In the ten years following the 2008 global financial crisis, the number of renters in the United States has increased in every income group, indicating that households who previously would have owned their homes now are renting.  The doctoral student conducting this research project will address two specific sets of research questions:  (1) How are new housing development, commodification of housing, and increased housing prices related to the spatial distribution of middle-income residents and middle-income affordable rentals?  (2) How do housing costs affect middle-income renters' perceptions of housing affordability, provide information about their decisions to move or stay, and impact their experience of neighborhood change?  The student will employ a mix of research methods to answer these questions.  She will address the first question by analyzing census data to identify spatial relationships between housing investments and middle-income residential locations, she will develop a hedonic model of where middle-income affordable rentals are likely to be.  Geographically weighted regression will be used to analyze the geography of the relationship between investment and middle-income locations.  The student will address the second question using geo-narratives of residential histories to analyze the spatially and temporally specific reasons for household residential histories.  Semi-structured interviews with middle-income residents will provide insights into where they have lived, why they moved or did not move, and how they make sense of the broader processes of housing commodification, investment, and gentrification in their own residential experiences.  This study will investigate these questions through a case study in New York City, a high-cost U.S. city, but the findings will be applicable to other high-cost of living metropolitan areas in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigation will explore how many failures occur and their frequency, whether small landslides in an area make the slope resistant to large landslides, and  what types of landslides generate tsunamis. Recent work off the northwest coast of the U.S. has shown that small landslides on continental margins occur more frequently than previously thought. The small landslides are caused by shaking generated by both local and remote earthquakes. Changes in the overlying water column were also found to be important in generating the small landslides. In this new study off New Zealand, seafloor sensor data will be combined with other available geophysical, water column, and meteorological data, to evaluate whether the results of the Cascadia work on the stability of submarine slopes can be generalized to other subduction zone margins. The results of this study will improve the capability to identify past large earthquakes in the sedimentary record. In addition, this study will provide constraints for models of submarine landslides and aid in predicting areas of potential slope failure. The study supports the training of a postdoctoral investigator.<br/><br/><br/>Accretionary margins that overlie active subduction zones undergo continuous re-surfacing by repeated sediment slope failures and gravity flows. Studies done off Cascadia show that slope failures can occur either spontaneously or be triggered by identifiable events that include oceanographic processes or by seismic waves generated by local or remote earthquakes. The mechanisms and key attributes of these triggering seismic waves (e.g., frequency content, duration, etc.) remain speculative. Preliminary results also indicate that the geologic structure and topography of the accretionary wedge have profound impacts on the seismic loading. Sediment slope failures and flows also can be triggered by storms, tides, upper water column eddies and circulation changes. This study tests these ideas by analyzing new data from seafloor sensors that were deployed on the Hikurangi margin off New Zealand in 2015. These data will also be used to examine the signature of slow slip events on the shallow plate interface. A Regional Ocean Modeling System hindcast will provide insight into the nature of signals at the seafloor that originate from ocean surface forcing in this area. By combining seafloor pressure, temperature and seismic ground motion measurements, with other available geophysical, water column and meteorological data, and the oceanographic context provided by the regional model, it will be possible to improve the fidelity of seafloor temperature and pressure signals associated with sediment slope failures and flows, with the side-benefit of characterizing near-surface eddies and ocean circulation changes<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will explore two innovative aspects. First, control will be distributed. That is, a large number of sensors and actuators will be spread throughout the manipulator, and information gathered by each sensor will be used to control only a small number of nearby actuators. This distributed control strategy avoids the transmission of large amounts of data across the structure, and eliminates the need for a powerful central computer to process this flood of data. Second, the control law will be iterative. That is, the soft manipulator will learn to achieve its objectives over multiple attempts. Although the approach taken is not explicitly based on biological behavior, both these features are present in animals that manipulate objects using compliant appendages. Computer simulations will be used to study performance of the new control laws on extremely complex robots, with hundreds of individually controllable segments. Physical experiments will be conducted on systems with between five and ten such segments. The modeling and control approaches will advance the national health and economic prosperity, by enabling reliable autonomous operation of soft multi-segment robots, to increase their usability in numerous applications, including manufacturing, surgery, search and rescue, navigation, and personal home assistance.<br/><br/>This project will explore novel distributed planning and control approaches for multi-segment soft robotic systems.

To date, most visualization tools have been designed to support open-ended exploration of patterns in data; though useful for some tasks, this exploratory model does not fit well when analysts have existing models or hypotheses.  This project aims to support a ""concept-driven"" analysis style in which analysts can share their existing conceptual models with the system, which uses those models to generate visualizations that allow the analyst to explore places where the models and data disagree and develop revised models that reconcile those discrepancies.  To do this, the research team will design a number of prototype techniques for communicating conceptual models, algorithms for selecting visualizations and data features that best match those models, and interfaces that highlight discrepancies and provide tools for analysts to dig into the data around them.  If successful, these concept-driven analyses will provide better ways for scientists and other analysts with existing models to leverage data while reducing the risk of confirmation biases in which people choose analyses that don't show where their existing models are wrong. The project will also enable the research team to learn more about the ways people come to form and express expectations about data.  Lastly, project will provide opportunities for graduate research training as well as tools to support K-12 outreach workshops that introduce younger students to data science.<br/><br/>The project has two main activities.  The first involves prototyping three elicitation techniques that prompt users to externalize their mental models and expectations about a dataset: free text expressions combined with natural language processing techniques that extract both variables of interest and implied relationships between them; concept mapping tools that allow users to graphically express relationships between entities, ideas, and concepts as node-link diagrams in which the nodes represent key aspects of the data and links represent suspected relationships between them; and tools for sketching expected relationships between variables using existing visualizations such as line charts and heatmaps.  The team will also develop interfaces that encourage analysts to develop several alternative models to reduce the chance of confirmation bias.  The second main activity is using the captured models to generate relevant visualizations that support discrepancy exploration.  To do this, the team will first use a taxonomy of best practices for choosing visualizations that best fit the concepts and relationships represented in the models.  They will then design interfaces that highlight discrepancies in both the visualizations (for instance, by highlighting data that badly fits a model) and the models (for instance, by highlighting links in a concept map that are not supported by the data) to call attention to inconsistencies.  Both the elicitation and feedback interfaces will be refined through a series of semi-structured visual analysis studies in which participants use them to analyze data in domains of general interest such as socioeconomic indices, crime statistics, and health risks.  The refined versions will then be used to compare the effectiveness of the concept-driven approach with more traditional exploratory approaches, as well as against both structured and unstructured workflows that interleave exploratory and concept-driven elements, in a series of lab studies using participants drawn from a number of scientific disciplines and a case study with scientific partners at Argonne National Laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two million Americans have such severe COPD that, even on maximal medical therapy, they are unable to walk up a single flight of stairs due to severe shortness of breath. As the disease progresses, patients become bound to their house, their chair, and finally their bed. This technology provides a non-intrusive pulmonary support to patients in a form of a lightweight, mobile, and noninvasive ventilator, which can help support these patients during physical activity and help them live a full life again, free of suffocation. Long term impacts of this technology include: (1) increased quality of life and treatment effectiveness for severe COPD patients; (2) development of novel pulmonary rehabilitation therapies; (3) expansion of noninvasive ventilation technology in the field of pulmonary care to supplement and enhance current ventilation techniques.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is a mobile, non-invasive ventilation technology targeted at COPD patients. The device works by supplementing patient's breathing with pressure changes on their chest and abdomen. With each breath in, the device generates a vacuum that helps lift the chest and abdomen, helping the patient breathe in.  With each breath out, the device increases pressure over the chest and helps the patient breath out faster.  By assisting the work of breathing, patients no longer feel short of breath and can once again engage in normal daily activities. The device promotes a healthy breathing cycle, which prevents hyperinflation of the airways and degeneration of alveoli in the lungs. Noninvasive ventilation and pulmonary rehabilitation have both been shown to have significant, positive effects on the quality of life and medical outcomes of COPD patients. The technology aims to improve patient's well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These transformations occur quickly and automatically in literate adults, despite the fact that written language is a relatively recent cultural invention and that reading is something learned in school rather than acquired without formal teaching. Rapid advances have been made in the understanding of how people read words - both in terms of better models of the computational processes involved in these transformations and better understanding of how the brain responds to written stimuli. This project aims to bridge these computational and cognitive neuroscience approaches, using brain activity data from neuroimaging studies to answer some fundamental questions about how people read. What code does the brain use to recognize written words? How do individuals differ in how they process written words? Do people read words differently depending on the context in which they are read? In answering these questions, the ultimate goal of this research is to develop a neurocognitive theory of reading that can provide critical insights into how people read words. This in turn can benefit society by informing literacy education, the treatment of learning disabilities or the remediation of language loss after brain injury.<br/><br/>This project's goal will be achieved by collecting functional neuroimaging data while people read, and analyzing it with an approach that maps between different cognitive reading processes and different patterns of brain activity. By using this approach, the PI can identify the pattern of brain activity elicited by individual stimuli, and calculate the similarity in the pattern between all pairs of stimuli. They can then compare these brain-based similarity measures to formal predictions of similarity derived from computational models of reading. Consider how DOUGH relates to the words TOUGH, SEW and BREAD; DOUGH is spelled similarly to TOUGH, sounds similar to SEW, and has a meaning related to BREAD. Using the logic of this analysis, brain regions in which DOUGH elicits a similar response to TOUGH, but not to BREAD or SEW can be interpreted as regions involved in the neural representation of word spellings. In this way, the current approach provides a tool for linking neural activity to cognitive operations. Using this technique, the proposed research will test competing computational models of the front end of the reading system, evaluate how differences in a task alter reading-related processes and assess individual differences in the cognitive processes used by skilled readers. This project will advance research methods in bridging computational theories of cognition and neuroscience data that could be useful for many questions in cognitive science. Along the same lines, the project includes the educational goal of developing new approaches to teaching students from high school, through college, and into graduate school how to think about the relationship between brain data and cognitive theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the investigator focuses on the divergence in incomes per capita within Europe before the Industrial Revolution. Economic historians have recently suggested several competing explanations for this divergence, but many of these explanations are rooted in the events that took place around the time or in the aftermath of the Black Death (1347-1350). Therefore, this research constructs new measures of economic activity starting from 1300 in order to explore the factors that contributed to sustained economic growth in Northwestern Europe but hindered it elsewhere. The investigator utilizes a unique data source -- revenues of the Catholic Church -- to study how various regions responded to the Black Death. Given the limitations of the existing data, it remains unclear whether, and via which channels, the massive population losses during the Black Death can be linked to the divergent growth paths of European economies after 1500. The resulting database will illuminate some of the long-standing questions in economic growth and also improve our understanding of pre-modern society.<br/><br/>In the recent years, economic historians have suggested several competing explanations for the divergence in the incomes per capita between Europe and Asia, as well as within Europe, before the Industrial Revolution. Many of these explanations are rooted in the events that took place around the time or in the aftermath of the Black Death. With the exception of a handful of countries, however, the existing data on incomes in the late Middle Ages is fragmented and ill-suited for testing these hypotheses. This research uses data on revenues of the Catholic Church, which were collected as the taxes on clergy, to measure the dynamics of regional inequality in Europe in a more direct fashion. The Catholic Church was a uniquely cohesive and capable institution that used advanced bookkeeping methods, routinely updated registries of its personnel, and transferred vast amounts of wealth all over Europe. Besides its geographic scope, the assembled panel-like database has the following advantages: (i) Church revenues are available at annual intervals right before, during the course of, and immediately after the Black Death; (ii) the primary spatial unit is diocese, which allows the researcher to study subnational variation in income levels; (iii) at a given point in time, most transactions were made in the same currency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thwaites and neighboring glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment are rapidly losing mass in response to recent climate warming and related changes in ocean circulation. Mass loss from the Amundsen Sea Embayment could lead to the eventual collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, raising the global sea level by up to 2.5 meters (8 feet) in as short as 500 years. The processes driving the loss appear to be warmer ocean circulation and changes in the width and flow speed of the glacier, but a better understanding of these changes is needed to refine predictions of how the glacier will evolve. One highly sensitive process is the transitional flow of glacier ice from land onto the ocean to become a floating ice shelf. This flow of ice from grounded to floating is affected by changes in air temperature and snowfall at the surface; the speed and thickness of ice feeding it from upstream; and the ocean temperature, salinity, bathymetry, and currents that the ice flows into. The project team will gather new measurements of each of these local environmental conditions so that it can better predict how future changes in air, ocean, or the ice will affect the loss of ice to the ocean in this region.  <br/>  <br/>Current and anticipated near-future mass loss from Thwaites Glacier and nearby Amundsen Sea Embayment region is mainly attributed to reduction in ice-shelf buttressing due to sub-ice-shelf melting by intrusion of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water into sub-ice-shelf cavities. Such predictions for mass loss, however, still lack understanding of the dominant processes at and near grounding zones, especially their spatial and temporal variability, as well as atmospheric and oceanic drivers of these processes. This project aims to constrain and compare these processes for the Thwaites and the Dotson Ice Shelves, which are connected through upstream ice dynamics, but influenced by different submarine troughs. The team's specific objectives are to: 1) install atmosphere-ice-ocean multi-sensor remote autonomous stations on the ice shelves for two years to provide sub-daily continuous observations of concurrent oceanic, glaciologic, and atmospheric conditions; 2) measure ocean properties on the continental shelf adjacent to ice-shelf fronts (using seal tagging, glider-based and ship-based surveys, and existing moored and conductivity-temperature-depth-cast data), 3) measure ocean properties into sub-ice-shelf cavities (using autonomous underwater vehicles) to detail ocean transports and heat fluxes; and 4) constrain current ice-shelf and sub-ice-shelf cavity geometry, ice flow, and firn properties for the ice-shelves (using radar, active-source seismic, and gravimetric methods) to better understand the impact of ocean and atmosphere on the ice-sheet change.  The team will also engage the public and bring awareness to this rapidly changing component of the cryosphere through a ""Live from the Ice"" social media campaign in which the public can follow the action and data collection from the perspective of tagged seals and autonomous stations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed algorithm can detect eye diseases or monitor eye healthiness in a proper and timely manner, and it can share the monitoring information with ophthalmologists. Hence, eye diseases can be detected in the earlier stage with our technology.  Moreover, ophthalmologist can focus more on severe treatments or surgeries. A 5- to 10-fold lower cost is an added potential benefit. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a new eye disease detection technology using a smartphone and make it broadly available for scientific discovery and medical applications. The project further develops a smartphone-based eye disease detection technology that is more accurate and convenient using image processing and machine learning techniques. The proposed smartphone-based eye disease detection technology makes use of panoramic images or short video recordings of the eye at different angles. The recorded eye images are divided into iris, lens, sclera, and cornea components using automatic image cropping techniques. Each divided component is then analyzed using shape detection and color matching techniques to recognize the shape and to detect the abnormality of each component, respectively. Preliminary finding shows that the proposed technology detects keratoconus with more than 90% accuracy from 30 subjects. To detect diverse types of eye diseases and to increase the accuracy of eye disease detection, we will collect additional eye data from patients and normal subjects to form a larger database, and apply machine learning techniques to the accumulated database. Bringing these innovative capabilities to the commercial market will significantly improve discovery output in academia and industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These estimators combine novel machine learning of certain economic weights with machine learning estimators of demand functions to do double machine learning estimation of welfare. These estimators are also generalized and applied to many other problems. In addition, this research uses the fact that scanner data follows individuals over time. Hence, individual demand functions are estimated and averaged to construct improved welfare measures.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to develop and apply economic demand analysis for large data sets that include many prices, such as scanner data. A common feature of scanner data is that cross price effects tend to be small, often an order of magnitude smaller than own price effects.

The grant allows the design and investigation of artificial muscle fibers fabricated from electrospinning technique. Artificial muscle materials can generate an active deformation and force when subjected to external stimuli, behaving like real muscle.  Previously developed artificial muscle materials have often suffered from poor scalability and slow response, which greatly limit their applications. Consequently, performance of artificial muscle has been increasingly recognized as one of the bottlenecks in designing novel soft robots and active structures. The artificial muscle material in this grant will have superior mechanical properties, a faster response rate, diverse actuating modes and excellent scalability. These new materials will contribute to the rapidly developing fields of soft robotics, novel actuators and energy conversion systems. The project will also provide interdisciplinary education and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students and seeks to attract underrepresented groups into science and engineering. Short disseminated demonstrations of artificial muscles to be developed will serve as an attractive education and research platform for disadvantaged, first generation high school and college students.<br/><br/>The artificial muscle assembled from electrospun polymer fibers can be easily fabricated into different shapes with various actuating modes, scaled up and down to various sizes, made to respond to different stimuli. A comprehensive understanding of processing-structure-property relationship for the electrospun polymer fibers is essential for the rational design of the artificial muscle fibers. The research team will electrospin three different types of polymer fibers: semicrystalline polyamide, polyelectrolyte and liquid crystal polymer, conduct systematic chemo-thermo-mechanical characterizations of these individual fibers using novel electrospinning tools, and design artificial muscle with diverse actuating modes by assembling these polymer fibers into different patterns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We rarely pay attention to the scene's low-level properties such as luminance values at various spots unless we are asked to report them, and even then, we are not very accurate about them. The fact that higher-level properties of a scene are more relevant to our behavior than low-level properties has informed global precedence theories of perception. However, experimental studies of the brain have established that lower-level features in a scene are detected before higher-level features; this result somehow led to the commonly used, but rarely tested, assumption that visual perception follows the same low-to-high-level hierarchy of feature detection. This project attempts to resolve this apparent contradiction by separating feature detection and perception, and by integrating visual perception and working memory, the brain's short-term storage of relevant visual information. The project will provide a new computational framework for understanding perception and memory which challenges traditional theories.<br/><br/>Technically, vision can be viewed as involving both encoding and decoding. Encoding refers to how visual stimuli evoke sensory responses in the brain whereas decoding concerns how these responses eventually lead to the subjective perception of the stimuli. A common assumption of many existing models is that decoding follows the same low-to-high-level hierarchy as encoding, but this was never rigorously tested. Additionally, under natural viewing conditions, the small fovea and frequent saccades introduce delays between sensory encoding of different parts of a scene and perceptual integration of the whole scene, suggesting that working memory must be involved in perceptual decoding; yet previous decoding models do not consider working memory. This project aims to address these issues using psychophysical and computational methods, with the specific goal of elucidating the nature of decoding hierarchy in light of working-memory properties. Specifically, compared with lower-level stimulus features, higher-level features are more invariant and categorical, thus requiring less information to specify and permitting more stable maintenance in noisy working memory. The brain should therefore prioritize decoding of reliable higher-level features and then use them to constrain and improve the decoding of unstable lower-level features in memory (when necessary). The project will test some surprising predictions of this retrospective Bayesian decoding theory and develop a neural network implementation of the theory.<br/><br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Walczak and his students develop new methods to make carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, the most abundant biopolymers, are involved in energy storage in the body.  They also control molecular recognition events in the body. This research develops versatile methods for the synthesis of bioactive glycosides and glycopeptides.  This research enables comprehensive studies on the function of carbohydrates in biology, and facilitates the preparation of high-value biological compounds and pharmaceutical agents. The synthetic approaches specifically enable the preparation of anti-diabetic drugs and anti-tumor antibiotics.  Professor Walczak's group is well positioned to educate and train students from groups that are underrepresented in science. Outreach activities focus on improving science awareness in the local communities, specifically through education at the high school level and public presentations. The education program integrates efforts at the department and university levels to create a collaborative community of researchers working at the interface of chemistry and biology.<br/><br/>This research develops versatile new methodologies for the synthesis of bioactive saccharides, primarily glycosides and glycopeptides.  A majority of known methods to synthesize saccharides focus on substrates in which the anomeric position is substituted with an electronegative element. This approach bears several limitations such as substrate dependence, the need for protective group manipulations, and incompatibility with free alcohol groups. The central hypothesis of this NSF CAREER award is that configurationally stable anomeric nucleophiles are engaged in stereospecific (stereoretentive) reactions under transition metal-catalyzed conditions,  forming carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds with high selectivities.  These moieties are independent from the nature of the substrates and catalysts. Capitalizing on these new conceptual foundations, three specific aims are pursued: (a) the development of cross-coupling reactions of anomeric boronic acids, (b) the implementation of new chemical methods for the synthesis of carbon-glycosides, and (c) the development of new methods in the synthesis of nitrogen-linked glycoproteins. Successful realization of these aims yields novel umpolung methods that eliminate the critical problems inherent to the previous approaches. The synthetic approaches also enable the preparation of anti-diabetic drugs, anti-tumor antibiotics, glycoproteins, and glycopeptides under standardized and user-friendly conditions. The research program is also intimately connected with ongoing educational and outreach activities. An undergraduate course featuring blended learning supplemented by randomized trial to improve undergraduate pedagogy is being developed and implemented. The outreach activities focus on mentoring high-school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Also, audio technology and single line displays cannot deliver spatial information, e.g. mathematical equations, diagrams, and graphs, which are critical to literacy in science, technology, and math-related subjects.  Commercial electronic tactile displays exist, but due to the complexity and cost of the underlying technology, the devices are prohibitively expensive and are limited to a single line of braille.

New technology can improve literacy rates, education outcomes and overall lifestyle of blind people. <br/><br/>The I-Corps project will assess the commercial viability of using a patented microfluidic technology for developing a full-page tactile display. Based on the technology, a microfluidic chip can reduce the complexity and cost of controlling a large number of densely-packed pneumatic actuators. A large array of thousands of individually controllable features is possible. The pneumatic actuators are integrated directly into the microfluidic chip using large-scale integration, making the device low-cost and highly scalable. Pressure-based actuation ensures that even tightly placed features will maintain relatively high force outputs.

Flower color, shape, and size are widely understood to reflect adaptation to pollinators. Yet, emerging evidence indicates that microscopic changes in floral features may also have large effects in driving new species to evolve.

What is the genetic basis of plant tolerance to climate variation? Addressing these questions is critical for foresters and crop scientists seeking to select appropriate varieties for high yield in different climates and assuring the nation's food supply.  The answers are also important for predicting whether threatened plant populations can persist in the face of environmental change, or whether introduced species will become invasive in their new range.  Understanding mechanisms of adaptation to variable environments is, moreover, a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology.  The genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (common name: thale cress) provides a unique opportunity to address this problem by synthesizing field measurements, genomic data, and geographic information, as outlined in this project. The results will be valuable to a wide range of scientists, from plant developmental biologists and population geneticists to plant ecologists and foresters.

These unique phenotypic data will be integrated with newly available genomic data to investigate the genetic basis and adaptive evolution of complex life history traits such as flowering and phenotypic plasticity (the range of trait values expressed by the same genotype across different environments). The project will have three objectives: 1) Elucidate the genomic basis of complex life history traits and their plasticity in different natural seasonal environments.  2) Estimate natural selection on life history traits to understand how phenotypic plasticity contributes to plant performance in different climates. 3) Combine quantitative genetic and population genomic data to test for a signature of past adaptive divergence and climate adaptation in plastic life history traits.

Precise assessment and prediction of patient status in the ICU can enable early interventions, and can result in improved patient outcomes. However, today's ICUs still face many barriers for assessing and predicting patient status. First, essential information such as pain and functional status are not captured automatically, but rather are repetitively measured by overburdened ICU nurses, with new assessments added each year. Second, existing methods for predicting patient status have limited accuracy and are used infrequently (e.g. every 24 hours as opposed to in real-time). This leads to missing opportunities for early interventions. Finally, existing models cannot automatically incorporate family caregiver feedback for improved patient status prediction. Together, these challenges point to the critical need for developing several fundamental intelligent building blocks of future ICUs. These building blocks should address: (a) how to learn new patient status prediction models without compromising performance on previous prediction models, (b) how to handle the complex clinical data for precise prediction of patient outcome, and (c) how to incorporate family caregiver feedback into the prediction models.<br/><br/>This project will pursue three specific research objectives that will address these issues: (1) Lifelong Multi-Task Learning: Novel multi-task deep learning models will be developed for recognizing clinical expressions and functional activities related to pain and functional status assessments. These models will be customized in an innovative manner to maximize information sharing among related tasks. (2) Multi-Scale and Dynamic Learning: Novel multi-scale recurrent neural networks will be developed to predict precise patient outcomes while handling multiple temporal scales and implicit input changes over time. (3) Continual Opportunistic Learning: Novel active deep learning models will be developed to query the labels of the most informative data points for improving the models over time, with minimum burden on users. The proposed project will bring together novel elements of machine learning algorithms and critical care medicine. This will represent the first attempt to autonomously assess pain and functional status in the ICU, to predict precise patient trajectory from high-resolution data, and to improve predictive clinical models through user feedback. In addition, the research will be impactful because what is learned here, will contribute to a broader understanding of future design considerations for the next generation of lifelong learning systems and intelligent hospitals. The PI will also provide a highly-integrated research and educational program for Florida high school teachers and students, and University of Florida (UF) undergraduate students in the context of the intelligent ICU. The PI proposes to: (1) sponsor summer internships for math teachers, (2) organize an Intelligent Machines workshop on coding and machine intelligence for the high school students, and (3) develop focused research and training activities for undergraduate students.

In this study, thermodynamic principles, directed assembly, additive manufacturing and protein engineering provide the basic tools to explore and harness structural proteins folding, assembly and fusion. In particular, epitaxial growth of structural proteins, e.g., silk, is studied at the nanoscale using design principles that liaise the sequence-structure-assembly properties of polypeptides and that allow for their use as seed materials to template and direct assembly processes. This basic understanding enables the nanomanufacturing of biopolymer-based hierarchical mesostructured materials, unattainable with current nanomanufacturing techniques, that exhibit enhanced toughness and resilience, selective mass transport and modular heat dissipation, impacting several technological fields that span biomedical, agriculture, aerospace, automotive, microelectronics and energy applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first goal is to measure more accurately how residential segregation by income has evolved in the last decade. The second goal is to analyze how changes in the income composition of neighborhoods ? such as neighborhoods that are gentrifying or becoming more impoverished ? are tied to outcomes for individual families. What kinds of people are entering, leaving, and staying in changing neighborhoods?  Where do they come from and where do they go? What are the implications for their welfare? Neighborhood changes, changing forms of separation between more affluent and less affluent families, and minority access to better neighborhoods have a strong bearing on urban development related to housing inequality, affordable housing, and school disparities.<br/><br/>This study analyzes trends in income segregation since 2000, addressing two aspects of these trends. The first question is how measures of segregation are affected by the reduction in sample sizes in the American Community Survey (ACS), which scholars now rely on for data at the census tract level. There is good reason to believe that direct measures are biased upwards as sample sizes decline, so that results may show increasing segregation even if there has been no real change. The project will apply new methods of correcting for sample bias to the original sample data in a federal Research Data Center. Working with confidential data ameliorates other methodological limitations in published data including: 1) the suppression of data by race/ethnicity in tracts with small numbers of minority residents and 2) top-coding of the income distribution. The second question is how changes in the income composition of neighborhoods are produced through patterns of residential mobility. The project will make use of the original records from Census 2000 and 2010 and the 2008-2012 ACS that can be linked over time. The study will select neighborhoods that have experienced gentrification, poor neighborhoods that have become poorer, and affluent neighborhoods that have become more exclusive. In each type of neighborhood, it is possible to identify the number and characteristics of residents who remain from 2000 to 2010, who leave, and who enter.  This research will offer new insight into how individual-level (mobility) behaviors aggregate to macro-level (neighborhood) outcomes, which is an enduring issue in social science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The zone of slip between the two plates is a geologic fault where the motion of the lower plate is imperfectly transferred to the overlying plate through frictional processes allowing for unreleased strain to build up in the upper plate.  The abrupt release of built-up strain in the upper plate causes earthquakes, which can be large on subduction zones because of the size of the slip region. These great earthquakes cause damage both from the shaking itself but also because of the flooding of seawater from a tsunami. Recent events in Sumatra in 2004, Chile in 2010, and Japan in 2011 all demonstrate the devastating hazard associated with these events.  Subduction zones also lie offshore the US coasts along Northern California, Oregon and Washington State and another along Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.   Both of these subduction zones have experienced great earthquakes in the past and will do so again in the future. A goal of this project is to better understand the geophysical processes at work at subduction zones and to improve the quantitative assessment of potential hazard. This project will deploy a combination of seafloor geodetic sensors to track the slow buildup and possible release of seafloor motion offshore of a New Zealand subduction zone.  The New Zealand Hikurangi site was picked because the subduction zone is shallow and can be imaged more effectively with seafloor geodetic instruments.  This site also has a history of rapidly repeating slow slip earthquakes that provide insight into the slip process.  Broader impacts of this project include training and support for a graduate student in the research. The project leverages international efforts by New Zealand and Japanese research teams who will occupy adjacent seafloor geodetic sites. The project will also transfer operational know-how for how to conduct seafloor geodesy experiments to NZ research counterparts, enabling them to collect measurements at these critical sites during this proposed project and continue in the future past the end of the project.<br/><br/>This project will measure deformation near the trench of the New Zealand Hikuangi subduction margin over a four year period using the GPS-Acoustic (GPS-A) method. The GPS-A site will be established in the Hawkes Bay area to provide critical measurements centered between GPS-A sites in the northern and southern parts of the margin established using Japanese and New Zealand funding. This central site is near the transition from an apparently strongly coupled margin to the South, and a nearly uncoupled margin in the North.  The project will implement the more efficient and cost-saving Wave Glider platform for the GPS-Acoustic measurements. Permanent seafloor benchmarks will be installed for horizontal positioning to ensure the time series of positions can be continued into the future, past the end of this project. An array of absolute pressure gauges will also be deployed for two years to measure the offshore extent of slow slip events observed from land arrays beneath the Hawkes Bay area, a region thought to have experienced many >8 magnitude earthquakes in the past based on paleoseismology. The array is expected to detect vertical uplift and hence the spatial extent of at least one large slow slip event in this region during the deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Grapes (Vitis vinifera) are among the most important horticultural crops in the world, with over 1 million acres planted in the United States. Products of grape cultivation (table grapes, raisins, juice, wine and oil) have a value of $5.76 billion at the farm gate and an estimated $162 billion annually to the American economy. The viticulture industry has grown steadily over the past decade, but grape cultivation faces new and continuing challenges from diseases and abiotic stresses.  Grape cultivation relies heavily on wild North American species for rootstocks, and that reliance is expanding.  This project will allow researchers to determine the genetic composition of four wild grape species from the Southwest that are used, or have demonstrated promise, for grape breeding. The project will gather information about the ability of these species to resist Pierces Disease, it will generate new information about plant biology, genomics, and evolution, and it will make Vitis one of the best-studied botanical genera. Data obtained from this project will help worldwide grape breeding programs and will be available through a community resource, allowing the project investigators to share their research with members of the public and the wine and grape industries. They will also train and mentor undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. The PIs work at public universities known for their efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and serving first generation college students.  <br/><br/>The cultivation, sustainability and security of grapes (Vitis vinifera) rely heavily on North American Vitis species as sources of resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. This project aims to make Vitis a leading perennial model for comparative genomics, landscape genomics and association genomics.

Researchers will assay hundreds of natural accessions to identify plants with resistance and study the geographic distribution of resistance in nature. They will complement phenotypic assays with whole genome resequencing (WGS) data to identify signatures of local adaptation, study the phylogenomics of the genus, and associate genetic variation with climatic variables. They will also employ analyses that aim to uncover important basic information about candidate genes and the genetic architecture underlying abiotic and biotic stress responses. An additional goal is to generate reference genomes for four North American Vitis species that have been used in rootstock breeding; currently, no reference genomes exist for any North American Vitis species. These genomes will be a valuable community resource, facilitate interspecific analyses, form the basis for inferring the pace and pattern of structural rearrangements during species diversification, and aid the identification of homologous and syntenous regions between V. vinifera and its congeners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One level of this organization consists of DNA wrapped around histone proteins, and is called the chromatin. High-throughput chromatin conformation capture methods (one example is called the Hi-C assay) have been developed, and yield an immense amount of information about 3D genome organization. However, most current analysis tools cannot distinguish the Hi-C, or equivalent, information that comes from the paired (homologous) maternal and paternal chromosomes in diploid organisms (like humans and other mammals). This means it is not possible to tell if there are different effects arising from the maternal and paternal copies of genes (the alleles). This project will address this problem and allow the development of fine-scale, allele-specific chromatin structures and therefore shed light on the role(s) of chromatin interactions in allelic gene regulation as well as larger principles of genome organization. This research will result in novel computational and statistical methods that combine the analysis of allele-specific chromatin structure with gene expression regulation; the products will include open-source software tools for 3D genome modeling, comparison, visualization, and exploration. These software tools will be made publicly accessible to scientists worldwide. The integrated research and educational activities include curriculum development for both undergraduate and graduate courses in subjects including data science, and statistical and computational genomics. Activities will allow undergraduate students to participate in the research project, as well as training graduate student researchers to acquire interdisciplinary expertise. The project will reach out particularly to middle school students with the goal of engaging young women and underrepresented minority groups in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to (i) establish a new computational and statistical framework for modeling the 3D chromatin structures in an allele-specific manner; (ii) identify structural differences between homologous chromosome pairs; (iii) investigate the impact of chromatin organization on allelic gene regulation; and (iv) understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene function. The project will integrate fine-scale allele-specific chromatin structures with the currently overwhelming amount of one-dimensional functional genomics data to discover new allele-specific regulatory elements and features. The project will elucidate gene regulation principles at an unprecedented resolution, and enhance our understanding of the interplay between genome architecture and gene expression. These findings will have fundamental significance in molecular cell biology, personal genomics, and medicine.

This project capitalizes on the recent availability of these unusually detailed and highly-classified internal investigation reports, compiled by the government of a region that experienced some of the most severe disorders and highest death tolls.  The database that will contain close to 6,000 political events and associated casualties, for all 86 cities and counties in the region, along with a range of economic, social, and political data about each locality. The quality, level of detail, and comprehensive coverage of these materials will permit the analysis of state collapse and political violence with an unusual degree of precision and depth. The completed dataset and full documentation will be widely shared and made publicly available at the end of the project. This will contribute to efforts to understand the dynamics of political violence and state repression, and the sources of instability and conflict in highly centralized authoritarian regimes. Data and analysis generated by this project will be valuable for the crafting of policy toward such regions.<br/><br/><br/>The dataset compiled in this project will permit the analysis of the endogenous formation of factional identities during political upheavals, while at the same time gauging the impact of exogenous structural features of localities and populations on levels of political mobilization and collective violence. Three structural features of particular interest are ethnic and sub-ethnic populations in an ethnically diverse region, prior divisions within local political networks, and the degree of party-state penetration across 86 rural counties and cities. The dataset will permit the analysis of the factors that influenced the origins and evolution of a highly complex upheaval over the course of several years (1966-1969) that included the collapse of local civilian governments, a popular insurgency that divided into two violently opposed armed factions, widespread and systematic intervention by military units, and overwhelming levels of state repression in order to rebuild local governments. The anticipated analyses will employ event count models, event history analysis, and network analysis to analyze the initial formation of factions and the subsequent evolution of collective violence.

There is growing consensus that Thwaites Glacier is unstable and vulnerable to collapse. However, there is significant disagreement in projections of rates of mass loss, with some studies suggesting century to millennial scale retreat and others forecasting more catastrophic disintegration. These disagreements are significant because rapid disintegration of Thwaites and adjacent glaciers could potentially trigger or accelerate collapse of significant portions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet with implications for global mean sea-level rise in the coming decades. Predicting rates of ice loss from Thwaites Glacier is currently hampered by a lack of reliable models of ice fracture and breakaway--called iceberg calving--and the interactions between calving and climate change. This study addresses this major knowledge gap, and is motivated by the need to improve sea-level projections critical for policy and planning. Moreover, there is also a gap between what scientists assert about the usefulness of sea-level rise predictions and stakeholder's perceptions of the usability of that work. This project is also geared to address this gap, by identifying the information that is accessible and usable to a broad community of stakeholders whilst proactively engaging with under-represented communities at nearby community colleges and school districts, engaging community college students in research.  <br/><br/>Projected rates of sea-level rise from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (and Thwaites Glacier in particular) have large uncertainties due to difficulties in understanding and projecting the calving and dynamic processes that control the ice-sheet stability.  This uncertainty is magnified by the poorly understood connection between calving processes, ice-sheet stability and climate. To address these uncertainties, this project seeks to explicitly resolve the processes that could cause retreat and collapse of Thwaites Glacier using a novel ice-dynamics model suite.  This model suite includes a discrete element model capable of simulating coupled fracture and ice-flow processes, a 3D full Stokes continuum model, and the continental scale ice-dynamics model (BISICLES). Ice-dynamics models will be coupled to an ocean forcing model suite including simple plume models, intermediate complexity 2-layer ocean models and fully 3D regional ocean models. This hierarchical approach will use high-fidelity process models to inform and constrain the sequence of lower-order models needed to extrapolate improved understanding to larger scales and has the potential to radically reduce uncertainty of rates of marine ice-sheet collapse and associated sea-level rise. The large-scale modeling approach will be tested and implemented within the open source BISICLES ice dynamics model and made publicly available to other researchers via a ""calving package"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For each unit (e.g., city, state, or region) affected by the intervention of interest, a synthetic control is a combination on unaffected units chosen to resemble the characteristics of the treated units before the intervention. Synthetic controls are used to estimate the outcomes that affected units would have attained in the absence of the intervention of interest, providing a benchmark against which researchers can evaluate policy impacts. The synthetic control method was originally developed for cases with one or a small number of aggregate units affected by the policy of interest. However, the applied literature has surpassed the methodological contributions in this area. In particular, many current applications focus on settings with a large number of affected units. As a result, additional methodological research is needed to guide the empirical implementation of the method. This research will provide empirical researchers with a robust and general framework for estimation and inference with synthetic controls as well as freely available software with which to implement it.<br/><br/>When disaggregated data are available, constructing separate synthetic controls for each treated unit helps avoid interpolation biases. However, the problem of finding a synthetic control that best reproduces the characteristics of a treated unit may not have a unique solution, and multiplicity of solutions is a particularly daunting challenge in settings with many treated units. This research will provide a generalized synthetic control framework for estimation and inference. The framework builds on synthetic controls and introduces a penalization parameter that trades off pairwise matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of each unit in the synthetic control against matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of the synthetic control unit as a whole. It can be shown that, as long as the penalization parameter is positive, the generalized synthetic control estimator is unique and sparse. The investigators propose data driven choices for the penalization parameter, as well as inferential methods for synthetic controls in settings with many treated units.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus areas are in cardiovascular disease, breast milk banks, and assisted living facilities. There is a need for early diagnosis of heart failure, especially myocardial infarction, by monitoring cardiac biomarkers. This is not only for the patient's survival, but also reducing treatment costs. This biosensor technology will potentially be the first product on the market for a portable, rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This project may accelerate POC diagnostics research and personalized medicine, including early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control. Thus, it will permit a more effective deployment of therapies. The developed product is expected to find broader commercial applications including, but not limited to, preclinical and clinical researchers, life science studies, hospital and healthcare facilities, diagnostics and patient monitoring, home and remote use, as well as drug discovery in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the market potential for the innovative biosensor. The end product will be a lab-on-a-chip based POC technology for use in complex biological media, like whole blood, which commonly requires sample pretreatment and/or separation of the large blood cells. The POC device will provide exclusive delivery of protein biomarkers (e.g. troponin) to the detection area for highly sensitive and reliable detection from a drop of whole blood. The uniqueness of the innovation lies in the nanoscale structures that are fabricated into thin metal films and integrated with microfluidics for direct optical measurement. The combination of on-chip/in-line sample preparation and fluid handling integrated with a simple, label-free, optical detection system enables a complete lab-on-chip system. This system may offer several advantages over conventional biomarker detection methods for use in complex samples.

Flowering plants dominate the majority of terrestrial ecosystems and most depend on animal pollinators to complete their lifecycle. Biologists hypothesize that the interaction with pollinators ultimately increases the number of flowering plants over time. However, important details are lacking about how this might be happening. Flower color, shape, and size are widely understood to reflect adaptation to pollinators. Yet, emerging evidence indicates that microscopic changes in floral features may also have large effects in driving new species to evolve. This project will investigate how biochemical, microscopic and macroscopic traits of flowers vary with different animal pollinators in the water-willow genus, Justicia. Researchers will determine the evolutionary relationships among Justicia species native to North, Central and South America to analyze trait data, including field-based observations of pollinator behavior. The project will train high school, undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups and community college students, as well as a post-doctoral research associate. Researchers will provide outreach to the public about the ecological and economic importance of pollination biology through educational exhibits at the University of Colorado Boulder Museum of Natural History and Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that variation in morphological traits intimately involved with the reproductive success of flowering plants are inter-correlated and are associated with functional groups of animal visitors. Researchers will investigate the evolutionary history of New World Justicia (Acanthaceae; the Acanthus family), whose ca. 400 species show remarkable diversity in micro-morphological floral traits essential to reproduction, including anthers, pollen and stigmas, and support a range of vertebrate and invertebrate pollinators. Outcomes of the research will include a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for New World Justicia species based on nuclear genomic data, a quantitative analysis of macro- and micro-morphological variation in relationship to pollinator type, and improved taxonomic circumscriptions for this widespread yet poorly characterized lineage. Research will facilitate the discovery and description of species new to science, build herbarium research collections, and expand ethological information about pollinating animals. Targeted fieldwork in five Neotropical countries will strengthen international collaborations among US and Latin American scientists and facilitate investigation of this species-rich lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research project will use laboratory experiments to study a new model of advertising with positive spillovers that is designed to understand whether such spillovers are beneficial. This model improves on existing work by bridging the gap between three separate and different bodies of literature in the economics of advertising, the effects of limited attention, and of network analysis. The aim of the experiments is to better understand: (1) conditions that make advertising socially wasteful or useful and (2) whether a well-informed policy maker can reduce socially wasteful advertising or take advantage of socially beneficial advertising. The research results will provide a guide to US businesses on how best to invest their advertising resources. The results will also provide important inputs into the promotion of different government policies that may be related to each other.  This award will fund a graduate dissertation research, hence contribute to the development of US research capital and global leadership in economics research.  <br/><br/><br/>This project consists of experiments designed to test the validity and empirical implications of a novel model of advertising. The proposed experiments will be conducted in two stages: An Online Survey which will be used to elicit a perceived product network on a set of charitable organizations and a laboratory experiment in which the effects of advertising will be measured through incentivized choice in response to experimentally varied advertising stimuli. These projects will be completed sequentially, with the results of the online survey informing the parameterization of the laboratory experimental treatments.   The study will answer two questions: (i) to what extent can the model of advertising with product networks explain responses to advertising campaigns by charitable organizations? (ii)  how can charitable organizations, facing similar product networks, optimally plan advertising campaigns in the presence of spillovers?  The results of the research project can help charitable organizations, businesses, and governments plan and execute efficient advertising campaigns in the presence of network effects.  These successful advertising campaigns will lead to better business performance, hence increase economic growth in the US.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, if a person were to explain how he knew that the crowd gathered in the street was rioting, he might point to the shouting of political slogans or tires lit on fire. In this instance, the riot would be the event. The slogan-shouting and tire-burning would be the subevents. Knowledge of subevents provides important information for characterizing events, and has great potential to benefit various event oriented applications, such as event detection, event visualization, event summarization and extreme event management. This project aims to acquire subevents from text corpora by recognizing various contextual patterns that contain subevents. This research on subevent identification will bring us one step closer to automatic event ontology construction, which organizes events based on their relations (subevent, precursor, consequence, cause, condition and purpose, etc.) with a central type of event. This project will integrate research with education, train and prepare the future NLP researchers as well as expose early undergraduate students and high school students to NLP research, with a focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>An initial subevent extractor has been developed that leverages a specific type of sentential and local context to recognize subevents. This project will extend the approach to explore diverse types of contexts that suggest subevents, by incorporating event coreference resolution into the learning loop. The task of event coreference resolution aims to identify event mentions that refer to the same real world event, and coreferential event mentions can appear in distinct contexts from the same document or from multiple documents. In the proposed research, new contexts identified through event coreference resolution that contain subevents will be used to acquire more subevents from a text corpus. In addition, this project will conduct extensive analysis of learned subevents. The project will apply clustering algorithms as well as analyze document samples to understand the usefulness of subevents in categorizing and identifying properties of the parent event as well as in identifying causal relations involving the parent event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To facilitate improved estimates of past glacier activity as well as future glacier change, the doctoral student will utilize historical air-photos, Landsat and Worldview satellite data, as well as several open-sourced digital analytical tools to reconstruct historical glacier extent and area, and model glacier Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA).  In combination with the related research which reconstructs long-term Holocene glacier histories using lake sediments in the same region, this complementary geospatial analysis will place 20th and 21th century glacier variability into a longer-term perspective. Although this research project will focus on alpine glaciers in South Greenland, it is highly relevant to understanding the impacts of global environmental change more broadly.

All genes in an organism use a simple, four-letter alphabet (A, C, G, T) to make three-letter words (codons) to specify each amino acid of a protein.  There is redundancy in this genetic code with multiple, similar codons often coding for the same amino acid.  In the DNA, the overall G+C content of genes within any given species is often very similar.  However, in grass species there are high-GC and low-GC genes, and there is evidence that high-GC and low-GC genes may be transcribed from DNA into RNA and translated from RNA into protein differently.  This project will test whether proteins from high-GC and low-GC genes are transcribed and translated with equal efficiency and, specifically, whether that differential regulation is used when responding to heat, cold and drought stress.  This work will also discover rules about codon usage and protein synthesis that can be used to design transgenes for efficient protein production.  Finally, current gene prediction software does not account for the high-GC and low-GC genes found in grasses.  This project will create a new gene prediction program that will more accurately predict genes in grasses.  Better gene prediction will benefit the larger community of plant researchers, including those who work with economically important grasses such as maize, rice, wheat, oats and barley.<br/><br/>Grass genes have a bimodal GC distribution and a significant 5' to 3' GC gradient.  Little is known about the consequence of such variation on gene and protein expression.  High gene GC content and strong negative 5' to 3' gradients in grasses strongly affect codon usage bias.  It is possible that both GC biased gene conversion and codon usage bias are important in shaping the unusual GC features that are found in grass genes.  GC biased gene conversion may help to move gene mutation towards a particular codon usage program, and then selection on that codon bias may maintain a gene's GC content and gradient. GC biased gene conversion in rice will be examined.  Transcriptional and translational characteristics of native and transgenes that differ only in their GC content will also be studied in rice. Translational efficiency may also be affected by regulation of tRNAs in a tissue or condition-specific manner.  Therefore, regulation of tRNAs will be examined to determine if changes in tRNA abundances affect protein translational efficiency.  Recent published data indicate that due to the variation of GC content in grass genes, a notable number of genes in grasses have been missed or mis-annotated by existing gene finders.  A new gene prediction tool that accounts for grass bimodal GC distribution will be designed to improve gene annotation in grasses.  The results from this project will provide novel insights into gene evolution in grasses as well as important guidance for crop improvement via genetic modification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the degree of autonomy of vehicles increases and the nature of human-autonomy interactions becomes more complex, key questions that need to be asked are how to ensure safety and trust in human-autonomous vehicle interactions. On the one hand, high-profile incidents make clear the risks from ""overtrust"" or over-reliance on autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, ""undertrust"" may cause the neglect or under-utilization of automation. This work will be integrated into the graduate and undergraduate education on cyber-physical systems, as well as various Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) outreach programs for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The approach is to develop languages and algorithms for formally expressing and reasoning about trust in human-autonomous vehicle interactions. This includes new models that can represent a human's trust in autonomous vehicles, together with new formal methods that can use these models in a tractable manner to verify trust requirements. The key innovations include new methods to measure trust based on multi-modal sensing of human cognitive and physiological states, new methods to express and verify trust-based specifications, and new methods to explain trust-based decisions in human-autonomy interactions. If successful, this research will allow the formalization of trust in human-autonomous vehicle interactions and the design of autonomous vehicles that establish appropriate levels of trust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to understand such noise generation when the gas in question (e.g., carbon dioxide, or high-temperature air) absorbs sound waves at certain frequencies. In particular, it is thought that by introducing such a gas into a near-surface flow of air, the noise generation can be reduced in configurations such as high-speed wind tunnels, where this noise can severely contaminate measurements. In conjunction, a variety of educational activities will be undertaken to introduce students at all levels to high-speed flows, including the creation of a YouTube channel where students can suggest objects to be flown in a Mach-8 wind tunnel.<br/><br/>A systematic experimental study will be conducted to investigate turbulence-generated noise in the presence of a vibrationally relaxing gas. Acoustic attenuation measurements will be performed in quiescent pure gases (e.g., CO2, N2O) and gas mixtures to identify strong acoustically absorbing combinations at pressures and temperatures relevant to high-speed flows; results will be compared with theoretical attenuation models. Experiments in supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels will examine the acoustic noise generated by a high-speed turbulent boundary layer: first, with the species identified in the earlier quiescent experiments as test gases; and subsequently with these species introduced locally into the boundary layer of an air flow. Effects of nonequilibrium on surface-pressure and turbulent velocity fluctuations will also be determined.  This work will ultimately provide a fundamental understanding of thermal nonequilibrium effects on high-speed turbulence, as well as potentially provide a control mechanism for the reduction of acoustic noise in hypersonic wind tunnels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current lightweight radiation shielding materials lack the required temperature stability.  New radiation shielding materials with better properties are needed to protect the health of biological, electrical, and structural systems in radioactive environments.  Radiation shielding improvements in the nuclear industry could result in upwards of one billion dollars in savings annually and result in lower electricity costs.  Commercialization of these advanced materials can also minimize the effects of disasters like Fukushima and reduce the costs of clean-up efforts.  Lightweight radiation shielding materials are also needed in airplanes and satellites to protect workers and electronic systems from cosmic radiation and for medical personnel working with radiation related treatments. <br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on an innovative lightweight radiation shielding material that withstands operating temperatures nearly double those of commercially available products.  It has been demonstrated that the addition of carbon-based particles can more quickly move heat away from radioactive waste; this enables safer disposal options for the nuclear waste.  Additional technical merit lies in the fabrication process that has been developed to reduce the weight and size of the material.  It also enables the technology to be cost competitive with existing products while providing better shielding properties.

Our product aims to improve early childhood STEM learning by supporting the preschool workforce. Children's development in math and science at the end of preschool predicts how well they will do in multiple subjects later in school. Our professional development tools will empower teachers to provide rich early STEM experiences so that all children, regardless of background, have the opportunity to be better students. These experiences also build habits of mind, inquiry, and interest in STEM, which can result in a stronger, larger, and more innovative STEM workforce. The business could develop a national footprint that employs educators and experts from across the country to provide professional development, online supports and resources, and innovative technology to educators, school districts, and other preschool education organizations. The reach and impact of the project could expand rapidly through emerging technologies. The business can fulfill a massive need in our society to improve early childhood education by providing quality professional development and support for those educating our youngest learners. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of our preschool professional development model and resources, SciMath-DLL. A variety of methods for program delivery, including direct to consumer, partnerships with schools, and outright licensing to schools could be utilized.

This doctoral dissertation research improvement project investigates how changes in the knowledge economy influence these training and work dynamics. The extent of collaboration between faculty scientists and industry scientists has grown in recent decades. Together, academic and industry scientists have made breakthroughs that have improved human health, technology, and production processes. This project investigates how graduate student training in science and engineering is changing in response to these closer connections between academia and industry. Through understanding changes in the knowledge economy and how graduate student training supports knowledge production, this project addresses the need to integrate graduate students more effectively into the US science and engineering workforce. The project also has implications for broadening participation in science and engineering, as the results will bring out the ways female and male graduate students are recruited and retained in science and engineering fields.<br/><br/>This dissertation project employs two qualitative research methods: ethnography and interviews. The detailed ethnographic observations chart physical scientists' daily practices surrounding research, collaboration, and the training of students. Observations are conducted at a research center and with a training grant program. In addition, observations at professional scientific meetings will expand the scope for understanding the complex role students play in knowledge production. These data reveal how graduate students are trained to disseminate their scientific knowledge, and collaborate with colleagues in academic and industry settings outside of their own campus. Interviews with students, faculty, and research support personnel provide data on the experiences and perceptions that scientists have of wider changes in the knowledge economy, and of their own collaborations. Observations and interviews will be supplemented with content analysis of documents and written materials from each site and from professional scientific associations. This project aims to understand not only the dynamics of work and professionalization for students training to become scientists, but also to uncover student perceptions of broader changes in the knowledge economy. The research will generate new knowledge on how relationships between academic and industry science shape student work, training, and professional development.

It will have a direct impact on over 1000 Puerto Rican middle and high school students this school year. This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the characteristics of educational interventions after a humanitarian crisis that can foster positive adaptation. Students will gain a scientific understanding of the natural disaster that occurred and of the resilience of the local El Yunque rainforest. In addition, these investigations will provide a positive outlet for students to express their feelings in creative ways and propose design solutions for their local community.<br/><br/>For school age children on the island of Puerto Rico, the back-to-back hurricane strikes of Irma and Maria were their first experience with the tragedy of hurricanes in Puerto Rico. There is much concern in the media and associated reader comments about the ability of the forests in Puerto Rico to recover. These concerns reveal common misconceptions about the dynamics of forest ecosystems. Long-term research conducted by Luquillo ecologists paints a different picture. The El Yunque rainforest has adapted to being struck by hurricanes on a regular basis. Engaging in investigations of El Yunque resilience at different timescales and different perspectives allows students to connect their learning about the rainforest to the current tragedy of their everyday life. Students will propose designs for their local community for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria and preparation for future hurricanes by mimicking how nature recovers from hurricanes. Researchers hypothesize that the quality of implementation will be predictive of the quality of students' projects, increased understanding of the dynamics of resilience in El Yunque, as well as increased appreciation for science.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

While the region has an overwhelmingly large K-12 minority student population, very few teachers are from underrepresented populations. As such, it is critical to increase the number of teachers who share their students' cultural heritage. The overarching goal of this project is to prepare a diverse group of mathematics and science teachers who can serve as role models and leaders in high-need schools in the region. SMART will establish professional learning communities and provide participants with pedagogical training, mentoring, and ongoing teaching experiences in highly diverse educational settings. The project will engage participants in carefully structured training and field experiences to help them develop subject matter knowledge, understanding of linguistics, language acquisition, academic language acquisition, and subject-specific methods to make content accessible to all students. Other project activities will include monthly cohort meetings, a summer research experience, and tutoring opportunities. In collaboration with school district teacher induction programs, SMART will develop a New Teacher Retention Program. This program will be aimed at providing incoming teachers with guidance and holistic support needed to teach mathematics and science to diverse student populations. <br/><br/>Over a five-year period, SMART aims to increase the number of STEM credential candidates at CSU Stanislaus from 119 to 200. Half of these credential candidates will be students of minority backgrounds. SMART will recruit, prepare, and retain 31 Noyce scholars. Noyce scholars will include STEM majors from CSU Stanislaus and UC Merced, transfer students from nearby community colleges, and local career changers interested in entering the teaching profession. An energetic, capable, diverse community of STEM teachers has the potential to lower the educational barriers that minority and English Language Learner students often encounter when completing mathematics and science coursework. A significant percentage of CSU Stanislaus students are not only ethnically and linguistically diverse, but also are the first in their family to attend college. SMART will provide the educational community with a better understanding of the training and support systems needed to recruit and prepare students of minority background for a career as a teacher in a high-need school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Permanent loss of H has a significant impact on long-term atmospheric evolution.<br/><br/>Numerical models of exospheric H assume a population of collisional atoms. However, this assumption has long been known to be oversimplified. Recent measurements made by the PIs of non-thermal, high-energy H atoms in the upper thermosphere bear this out. The goals of this proposal are to refine the PI's radiative transfer models to reflect non-collisional H physics, and to identify the mechanisms that control the distribution and dynamical transport of H atoms in the terrestrial thermosphere and exosphere. The efforts will lead to further understanding of the structure, chemical coupling and energetics of the space-atmosphere interaction region. The work also sheds light on the evolution of the exosphere due to H escape. The new modeling capabilities and inversion techniques can be easily generalized for the study of other planetary atmospheres, particularly that of Mars. The PI is early career scientists, and will train a graduate student in inverse theory, data analysis, and radiative transfer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet this demand, Binghamton University (BU-SUNY) will host a 10-week summer REU program to train 10 undergraduate students per year in translational biomedical science and engineering. The program will offer undergraduates intensive multidisciplinary hands-on research and professional development training in integrated biomedical translational science and technology development. The program is anticipated to develop a leadership pipeline helping students advance in either their graduate studies or career and professional training in these fields. The teaming of biomedical scientists with engineers has led to the development of this novel and unique REU program. The fourteen participating faculty members combined have trained nearly 684 REU students, leading to 80 peer-reviewed research articles co-authored by undergraduates. BU's strong commitment to undergraduate education and research will ensure the success of the proposed REU program. The broad and cohesive research interests of faculty mentors involved in this program allow for designing and implementing a vigorous summer REU program to offer T-shaped professional training opportunities to undergraduates. Efforts will be made to recruit students from underrepresented groups, such as women, minority students and students from undergraduate institutions and community colleges where undergraduate research training is limited. The outcome of the REU program will be disseminated at national conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.<br/><br/>The REU program will provide students with opportunities to learn how engineering principles can be integrated with medical and life sciences to translate biomedical discoveries into bedside technologies for treating many diseases, such as diabetes and cancers. The program will expose students to medical science, biology, biochemistry, pharmaceutical sciences, neuroscience and cognitive science, as well as to tissue engineering, materials sciences, nanofabrications, genome editing, RNA transcriptome analysis, 3D bioprinting, cell manufacturing, and tissue biofabrication. Interactive workshops covering topics related to biomedical engineering and graduate studies and career development training will inform students of the latest developments in the fields of biomedical science and engineering and professional development opportunities in these fields. Social events related to the REU program will allow students to interact with other REU students on campus facilitating peer learning and collegiality. Field trips to industry sites will introduce students to applications of biotechnology development. The combination of research training, workshops, social events, and field trips will provide students with a foundation in biomedical engineering research, which they can apply to enriching their professional development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The zone of slip between the two plates is a geologic fault where the motion of the lower plate is imperfectly transferred to the overlying plate through frictional processes allowing for unreleased strain to build up in the upper plate.  The abrupt release of built-up strain in the upper plate causes earthquakes, which can be large on subduction zones because of the size of the slip region. These great earthquakes cause damage both from the shaking itself but also because of the flooding of seawater from a tsunami. Recent events in Sumatra in 2004, Chile in 2010, and Japan in 2011 all demonstrate the devastating hazard associated with these events.  Subduction zones also lie offshore the US coasts along Northern California, Oregon and Washington State and another along Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.   Both of these subduction zones have experienced great earthquakes in the past and will do so again in the future. A goal of this project is to better understand the geophysical processes at work at subduction zones and to improve the quantitative assessment of potential hazard. This project will deploy a combination of seafloor geodetic sensors to track the slow buildup and possible release of seafloor motion offshore of a New Zealand subduction zone.  The New Zealand Hikurangi site was picked because the subduction zone is shallow and can be imaged more effectively with seafloor geodetic instruments.  This site also has a history of rapidly repeating slow slip earthquakes that provide insight into the slip process.  Broader impacts of this project include training and support for a graduate student in the research. The project leverages international efforts by New Zealand and Japanese research teams who will occupy adjacent seafloor geodetic sites. The project will also transfer operational know-how for how to conduct seafloor geodesy experiments to NZ research counterparts, enabling them to collect measurements at these critical sites during this proposed project and continue in the future past the end of the project.<br/><br/>This project will measure deformation near the trench of the New Zealand Hikuangi subduction margin over a four year period using the GPS-Acoustic (GPS-A) method. The GPS-A site will be established in the Hawkes Bay area to provide critical measurements centered between GPS-A sites in the northern and southern parts of the margin established using Japanese and New Zealand funding. This central site is near the transition from an apparently strongly coupled margin to the South, and a nearly uncoupled margin in the North.  The project will implement the more efficient and cost-saving Wave Glider platform for the GPS-Acoustic measurements. Permanent seafloor benchmarks will be installed for horizontal positioning to ensure the time series of positions can be continued into the future, past the end of this project. An array of absolute pressure gauges will also be deployed for two years to measure the offshore extent of slow slip events observed from land arrays beneath the Hawkes Bay area, a region thought to have experienced many >8 magnitude earthquakes in the past based on paleoseismology. The array is expected to detect vertical uplift and hence the spatial extent of at least one large slow slip event in this region during the deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern agriculture is based on the adoption of selection as a method to improve crops. Furthermore, dealing with emerging diseases and antibiotic resistance is helped by understanding how natural selection operates. This project examines the fact that the strength and direction of natural selection routinely differs between males and females of a species. The consequence of this selection depends on whether the same genes are expressed in males and females. The research team will explore selection on males and females using field studies, genomic analyses, and statistical modeling using Silene latifolia, an herbaceous flowering plant. This plant is an ideal model for this research given extensive prior work demonstrating important phenotypic and genetic differences between males and females. Workshops to the scientific community will be presented on how to write scientific articles and the genomic techniques used in this study. Outreach to the general public will include a project involving high-school students in Kansas in genetic research, and a demonstration on flowers at a community-level science festival in Indiana.<br/><br/>The research team will collect phenotypic and fitness measurements on all individuals within a S. latifolia population from Virginia, and then interrogate these individuals, and their progeny, at Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. The combination of phenotypic, genotypic, and fitness data will allow the researchers to determine if selection is evident at the scale of individual loci and if it differs between males and females. This species has heteromorphic sex chromosomes (males are XY), and a genome-wide characterization of selection will enable a test of the prediction that selection should differ between autosomes and sex chromosomes. While there is a great body of work measuring natural selection in plant populations, this experiment will provide unprecedented detail on a typically hidden component of selection, the differential success of male plants in siring. Finally, the project will allow both undergraduate and graduate students to engage in and learn field techniques, laboratory methodology, and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the evidence reported in expert-novice teacher literature suggesting that teachers become experts by gaining PCK through on-the-job learning, little is known about what and how teachers learn during their early career. This project addresses the fundamental issue of how and under what conditions beginning Grades 3 to 7 teachers of mathematics improve their PCK, what learning opportunities play a role in beginning teachers' PCK growth, and what the learning trajectories look like for beginning mathematics teachers. Although this project primarily focuses on teachers' PCK development in the areas of fractions and proportional reasoning, it has the potential to inform research on teachers' PCK development in other topic areas or disciplines. The work will contribute significantly to advancing our understanding of the learning opportunities that are key to beginning teachers' learning and knowledge development, and the results of this research will have the potential to guide the work of and interventions by researchers and teacher educators.

Additionally, the generalizability of key professional learning opportunities identified in the qualitative phase will be assessed using the larger sample. Outcomes from this research will be translated into educational activities and pedagogical resources that can be used by other researchers and teacher educators as a means of enhancing the PCK of elementary and middle school teachers of mathematics. The project results will include developing a theory of beginning Grades 3-7 teachers' PCK growth and creating resources for researchers and teacher educators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cold periods and frost episodes are still one of the worst enemies of grape and stone fruit production worldwide.  Grape and orchard production are highly linked to climatic conditions, making sub-seasonal weather variability and its connections to climate change a challenging issue for this economic sector. Growers may presently deploy fossil fuel heaters, sprinkler systems, the downward draft from helicopters and wind machines to fight spring frost damage. These methods are usually costly, some create environmental concerns, and in many cases they may be limited by water availability and area coverage.  Altering timing of bud break stages that are susceptible to frost injury appears to be a viable alternative to cope with current and emerging challenges of climate change. The proposed I-Corp program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities of an end-to-end solution. The innovation combines a bioactive, non-toxic biodegradable encapsulation technology (spray) that alters internal grapevine physiology and promotes bud break delay. A predictive analytic system provides recommendations to make informed decisions about frost risk management.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on a series of studies that have combined pruning management, biophysical and biochemical factors influencing the endogenous regulation of bud break, and resistance to cold injury.  In addition, the project combines this knowledge with an analytic data platform (software) that will analyze plant development as a function of environmental temperature (phenology), topographic and soil data, at the farm level.  Combination with global and regional patterns of climate patterns will aid understanding climate variability at high spatial and temporal scale. This platform will allow better prediction for decision making at the vineyard and orchard level to reduce some of the most significant challenges associated with prediction reliability about bud break and risk of frost.  Moreover, this predictive analytic system will be the foundation for continued innovation in tools and services to support decision-making to adapt growing practices, and to preserve sustainability due to already observed and worsening climate change impacts.  The I-Corp process will also be used to refine our understanding of customer value, willingness to pay and the cost of the best current alternatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although tornadoes are known to produce some of the strongest winds on earth, sufficient understanding of the magnitude, frequency, and structure of these violent winds remains elusive. To effectively design structures that provide protection for life and property against tornadoes, it is necessary to better understand the wind speeds in tornadoes, the interaction of tornado winds with structures, and the likelihood of tornado occurrences.  At the small scale, this research will employ cutting-edge technologies, such as laser scanning and digital imaging, to create highly detailed, 3D digital models of tornado-damaged structures.  The research will also examine large-scale tornado phenomena by using earth-observing satellite images to help detect ""missing"" (unobserved) tornadoes. Improved characterization of regional tornado climates, wind structures, and wind speeds will improve tornado forecast models and risk-based design methodologies. Heightened understanding of tornado hazard will advance society's ability to plan for, and rapidly respond and recover from, disasters, thus promoting national welfare and prosperity. This project also will provide a platform to enhance STEM education in a large rural portion of West Texas by encouraging the pursuit of graduate education through engaging undergraduate students in research collaborations with U.S. and international research institutions and an expansive Natural Hazards Workshop/Symposium series that will bring researchers from academia, government, and industry to campus to inspire students to pursue research and innovation for challenging natural hazard mitigation problems.  Data from this project will be archived and shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) DesignSafe Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>The objectives of this CAREER award are the achievement of rapid and comprehensive multi-scale wind damage assessments through remote sensing, advancement of understanding of tornado-structure interaction, and inspiration and training of students for vital roles in securing national welfare and prosperity through minimizing life and property losses from wind hazards. Through strategic research collaborations, the Principal Investigator and undergraduate student researchers will explore tornado actions via remote sensing technologies at multiple scales.  At small scales, reality-capture-enhanced modeling of tornado-induced failures of engineered steel structures will utilize 3D reality-capture platforms (photogrammetry and lidar) and optimization of these platforms to balance the breadth and depth of detailed forensic analyses of damaged structures (in collaboration with the Texas Tech University National Wind Institute). This modeling will then be used to investigate tornado impacts on structures through the measurement of deflections and study of failure patterns. At the large scale, the project will investigate a methodology to detect ""missing"" tornadoes via multi-spectral image analysis to enhance tornado climatology in sparsely populated and forested areas (in collaboration with Western University in Canada). The research will advance the knowledge of complex tornado-structure interactions, estimation of tornado intensity, and detection of tornado occurrences via safe, reliable, efficient, and cutting-edge remote sensing technologies at spatial scales ranging from minute structural deformations to the overall tornado-path level. The research will provide validation methods for physical and numerical tornado load simulations, facilitate necessary adjustments to wind speed estimates in the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and explore optimization of high-resolution imaging platforms to most effectively advance the understanding of tornado effects on the built environment.

The project supports a postdoctoral researcher.  The educational goal of the project is to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of postdoctoral researcher and graduate/undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The conventional view of Tropical Cyclone (TC) intensification regards the absolute angular momentum as a materially conserved quantity above the friction layer.  This study seeks to demonstrate that the eddy process associated with eyewall and rainband convection serves as a sole forcing for the azimuthal-mean angular momentum conservation.  It is this forcing that provides an ultimate mechanism for triggering and driving Rapid Intensification (RI) of TCs that cannot be explained by the classic TC intensification theories.  At the current resolution of operational models, the PIs demonstrate that the sub-grid scale (SGS) forcing above the PBL associated with convection poses an important bearing on TC intensification, especially RI.  How to generate a realistic SGS forcing aloft in the TC inner-core region is a new challenge in turbulent mixing parameterization that has not been previously explored.  The most important features of this EAGER project are: (1) advance our understanding of the role of eddy forcing associated with eyewall and rainband convection in modulating intensity change of TCs and (2) develop physically robust parameterization to represent sub-grid scale forcing associated with convection above the PBL in numerical models used for TC prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent.

This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes.A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes. This work will have broad implications for our understanding of extinctions, survival, environmental variables, and humans on mammalian ecology, which is directly relevant to modern conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award funds research that incorporates more realistic assumptions about individual and household behavior into macroeconomic modeling. Dr. Angeletos and his team will conduct several projects to understand the empirical, quantitative and policy relevance of this alternative approach to understanding macroeconomic outcomes. The research has transformative potential.  The new model of economy-wide market efficiency assumes that individuals are boundedly rational (that is, they are sometimes inattentive or have limited cognitive abilities).  The result promises to be new theories about the causes of business cycle fluctuations.  These new results would be extremely useful for policy makers in many contexts, including the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy. The result would be a direct contribution to performance and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. <br/><br/>The researcher will examine how frictions in information, attention, and cognition affect belief formation, coordination, and the overall outcomes that can be achieved in large economies. Specific contributions include: (1) A parsimonious structural interpretation of salient features of macroeconomic data. (2) A new formalization of the Keynesian multiplier widely used in macroeconomics that does not depend on unrealistic assumptions about nominal rigidity and policy constraints. This formalization may help to explain why aggregate demand shocks can trigger a recession. (3) A theory of why general equilibrium mechanisms may be less potent, or more slow-moving, than is usually presumed in macroeconomics. This theory can also explain the economy may respond to shocks and policy shifts as if the agents were discounting the future heavily. The new theory will be evaluated against empirical evidence. (4) New insights into the effects of monetary and fiscal policy during liquidity tramps, including a resolution to the forward-guidance puzzle and a rationale for front-loading fiscal stimuli. (5) Re-examining fiscal multipliers and Ricardian equivalence, along with a new approach to the equilibrium determinacy of the Neo-Keynesian model and the role of Taylor rules. (6) An investigation of the conditions under which the two fundamental welfare theorems do or do not extend to economies in which the agents are rationally inattentive or cognitively constrained.

The project will lay the foundation for data-driven transportation science that is to have an impact at all scales from individuals' quality of life to the nation's economy. This project will involve collaboration with several public agencies and private firms to develop, deploy and test real-world systems in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area based on large-scale data analytics. All models, algorithms, and examples will be implemented and open sourced in the public domain to promote access to applications and spark discussions from users all over the world. The results will be used to develop a new undergraduate course on data analytics for infrastructure management. Additionally, a virtual laboratory will be developed in conjunction with Carnegie Museum of Natural History for educating students in grades 7-12, college students, and the general public. Students from both Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh will be engaged through learning sessions, data analytics competitions, and hands-on activities. <br/>   <br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to develop theories and algorithms that utilize large-scale data to infer characteristics of probabilistic network flow and optimally manage transportation networks under uncertainty. High-dimensional joint probability distributions are used to explicitly model probabilistic network flow and system states in the context of flow dynamics and user behavior. Those joint probability distributions are learned, estimated, and predicted from fusing and mining fine-grained data collected over many years. They reveal the second-order statistics of flow and system states, namely variance-covariance, resulting in a better understanding of the inter-relations among flow/system characteristics, at high temporal and spatial granularity. This project will also develop rigorous statistical theories to identify recurrent and non-recurrent flow patterns in subnetworks through dynamic network partition. The science of network optimization will be advanced by integrating probabilistic network flow into decision making theories for both planning and operation.

Differential privacy is a formulation of statistical privacy that protects individual data values while still allowing the release of results from privacy-preserving analyses. Prior work on language-based techniques for differential privacy has focused on preventing leaks, rejecting programs either statically, before they run, or dynamically, as they run, before they leak too much information. This project uses an approach that allows the compiler and runtime to enforce privacy requirements by construction. The objective is two-fold: to make it easier for programmers to implement privacy-preserving data analytics, and to provide provable privacy guarantees. The approach facilitates the programming of differentially algorithms, while allowing non-experts to build up intuitions about what makes programs differentially private. The project integrates research with education by developing a framework to educate non-experts about statistical privacy, by disseminating results to both the academic community and collaborators, and incorporating the techniques into the security curriculum.<br/><br/>Central to the technical approach is the concept of policy-agnostic programming, where a programmer can write policy-enforcing code that looks similar to (simpler) policy-free code and relies on the runtime environment to customize program behavior to enforce policies. The project develops the theory and infrastructure for a new programming framework called Jostle that supports privacy-agnostic programming through exposing fine-grained algorithmic choices to the programmer. The compiler and runtime, rather than the programmer, is responsible for navigating the space of privacy and accuracy trade-offs. Making this work involves (1) a dynamic semantics for policy-agnostic differential privacy, (2) a decidable probabilistic relational type system, and (3) a compilation framework for policy-agnostic differential privacy that uses the results of (1) and (2) for statically and dynamically exploring privacy/accuracy tradeoffs. The resulting system supports implementations of complex machine learning algorithms that are agnostic to the differential privacy concerns, and allow the programmer to rely on the compiler and runtime to modify programs to satisfy privacy requirements. The approach is intended to be sufficiently general to support different formulations of statistical privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Municipal wastewater treatment alone accounts for about 3% of electrical energy consumed in the U.S and other developed countries. The successful implementation of the proposed technology, which integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into existing waste treatment infrastructure, has the potential to greatly improve the management of microbial communities associated with treatment processes thereby improving overall effectiveness and sustainability. This solution represents a new way for customers to cut energy and operational costs and improve effectiveness of their treatment processes without large investments in infrastructure.

The research explores the relationships between the science of vision, images, and the optical-psychological practices with images at a critical juncture of western civilization. Specifically, it focuses on relationships between understandings of optics and violent European religious iconoclasms that occurred during the early modern period. The researcher will show that common beliefs about the ways vision and visual psychology worked, and the different uses of that knowledge by artists on the one hand and theologians on the other, set religious art on a collision course with the Reformation understandings of the image. The connections between science, religion, and society that are to be revealed in this study will serve to create scholarly exchanges among those in the natural sciences, social sciences, visual arts, and several fields within the humanities. The results of this study will be integrated into curricular development at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and they will be disseminated in professional journals and conferences. Finally, there will be a conference to extend the trajectories of the main lines of inquiry of this research.<br/><br/>The overarching research question of this study addresses what the science of vision can teach us about iconoclastic violence. The researcher will engage in this study first setting out the understandings of optics in this period among different levels of society, then comparing textual evidence in Latin and vernacular religious texts alongside visual and text evidence from the artists. Scientific understandings today recognize vision, perception, and memory storage as physical processes that create both temporary and long-term changes to the brain. Early scientists also recognized the power of vision, especially when focused on images, to alter the mind physically. Those who urgently called for immediate destruction of religious images repeatedly point to the fact that the devout had confused the material image with the holy figure portrayed, and were treating the material object as though it were alive. As the Reformers point out, the optical habits of daily meditation on images, especially on images that appeared alive, caused the images to become physically part of the person's memory, and shaped the person's identity. The iconoclasts understood their image destruction to be destroying a deeply ingrained psychological part of the individual that was considered religiously pernicious.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The University of Kentucky is partnering with the Fayette County Public School to accomplish the project objectives, which include: (1) attract more diverse candidates to STEM teaching pathways, (2) strengthen collaborations between the College of Education and the Colleges of Arts & Sciences and Engineering to support a dual degree program in STEM education and a STEM discipline, (3) institutionalize wide-ranging support services to ensure student retention and success across the dual degrees, (4) increase the number of STEM education graduates, and (5) prepare STEM teachers in culturally responsive teaching and with strong content knowledge, including how to integrate energy and manufacturing challenges in the curriculum. The project aims to achieve these objectives through a three-pronged approach: (1) Recruiting--using a multi-faceted approach that will include promotion of a viral(readily accessible, engaging online) video, development of postcard brochures, social media ads, and collaborations with teacher pathway programs across the state; (2) Collaboration--staff and faculty across the three collaborating colleges will work together to provide candidates with support aimed at supporting the highest possible retention rates; and (3) Professional learning--academic year and summer professional learning opportunities will be provided to candidates while they are in the program and after they have gone into their own classrooms. The specific focus on underrepresented populations--both minority candidates and first-generation Appalachian candidates--will allow this project to align candidate placement with the demographics of either urban or rural school settings, enabling the new teachers to serve as models for success in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>This Noyce Track 1 Scholars project is designed to recruit 34 candidates (majors in any of the STEM disciplines) into STEM teaching careers. The goal is for 25% of those candidates to be in one or more of the following under-represented populations: (a) student of color; (b) first generation student as identified by the University of Kentucky?s definition; (c) student with a disability; and/or (d) student from Appalachia. Those candidates will be prepared to teach mathematics, science (biology, chemistry, physics, earth science) and computer science in high-needs secondary schools. Candidates will be afforded unique professional learning experiences within the program, such as work in informal STEM learning settings (e.g., the University of Kentucky SeeBlue STEM camp), industry externships (in partnership with Kentucky Advanced Manufacturing, KAM), and summer retreats with sessions focused on Common Cores State Standards in Mathematics or the Next Generation Science Standards.

This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.<br/><br/>	The major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time. This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes.A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes. This work will have broad implications for our understanding of extinctions, survival, environmental variables, and humans on mammalian ecology, which is directly relevant to modern conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By furthering the potential to reduce labor-intensive fieldwork and instead use new, high-resolution remote sensing imagery to assess tree species and stress symptom levels, this project can help advance research on the interplay of different factors on the health of urban forests.  The project will help advance the practice of urban forest management, which has significant societal value because healthy urban forests improve urban air quality, enhance ground water maintenance, and moderate urban air temperatures.  Although this project will focus on a case study in Washington, D.C., the development of an accurate, robust, and repeatable methodology for using widely available, state-of-the-art remote sensing data to update forest inventories of tree species and tree stress will have utility in a much broader set of urban and rural settings.

UV light is a harmful to DNA and proteins. In flowering plants, pollen is particularly susceptible to UV damage, but dark pigments in flower petals may protect the pollen by absorbing UV light. The intensity of UV light reaching Earth has increased greatly during the 20th century and may continue to increase, especially in some regions. This project explores whether protective pigmentation in flowers has increased in response to increasing amounts of UV light.  Because flower color is important for attracting pollinators, understanding how it may have changed is necessary to understand how effectiveness of pollination may also have changed.  Pollination effectiveness, in turn, is important for the economic success of many agricultural crops and for the ecological well-being of all flowering plants. This project will also provide research experiences and mentoring for students from underrepresented groups, and will engage the general public through outreach activities at multiple events.<br/><br/>Researchers will test the prediction that temporal increases in UV-B radiation have driven increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation in the petals of flowers. Because UV-B has increased most in polar and temperate regions during the last century, they predict that species with polar and temperate distributions will display larger increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation than sub-tropical species. Additionally, the researchers will test the prediction that species with pollen-bearing structures exposed to sunlight will respond to changes in UV-B, while those with pollen structures recessed within the flower (protected) will not. Researchers will use herbarium specimens and bioclimatic databases to gather data on flower pigmentation and abiotic conditions for 75 diverse taxa with different geographic distributions.

Typically, liquid-repellent surfaces are made with long chain fluorocarbon materials. However, long chain fluorocarbon materials are rapidly being phased out because of the growing concerns regarding their negative environmental and biological impacts. This research promotes national health by developing alternative surface treatments to the currently used toxic bio-accumulating materials. New hydro- and omniphobic materials are increasingly in demand for defense and commercial applications in textiles, surface coatings in harsh or ""dirty"" environments, among others. The work advances the science of surface repellents by providing the basic knowledge needed to design novel liquid-repellent surfaces with the more benign short chain fluorocarbon materials and with performance (i.e., degree of liquid repellency) equivalent to the long chain fluorocarbon materials. Such innovative liquid-repellent surfaces have the potential to drastically alter the non-stick coatings technology landscape in civilian, industrial and defense sectors. Therefore, the results and insights from this research will be significantly beneficial to the U.S. economy and society. The education activities are integrated with this research through the generation of STEM education kits and do-it-yourself (DIY) videos on ""Fun with Surface"" to be used in K-12 science classes in conjunction with teacher training workshops.<br/><br/>Liquid-repellent surfaces consisting of long chain fluorocarbons (i.e., linear molecules with 8 or more fully fluorinated carbons) decompose into perfluorooctanoic acid, which is bio-accumulative and is considered an emerging contaminant. So, it is essential to develop alternative sustainable materials (e.g., short chain fluorocarbons) that can be as liquid-repellent as long chain fluorocarbons. The research is based on the hypothesis that short chain fluorocarbons with high surface crystallinity and re-entrant morphology will offer liquid-repellency equivalent to long chain fluorocarbons. To test this hypothesis, the research team will systematically investigate the influence of molecular architecture of fluorocarbon surface ligands and surface modification reaction coordinates on surface crystallinity and morphology. The resulting liquid-repellency will be investigated experimentally and compared with theoretical predictions. Overall, this research will provide a thorough understanding of molecular architecture-processing-structure-property relationships involved in design of liquid-repellent surfaces and pave the way to a paradigm of sustainable liquid-repellent surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transcription, the synthesis of RNA on the DNA template, is the first step in gene expression that largely defines which genes will be active. The key unanswered question is how transcription is regulated across the genome to generate stable, cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression. By combining classic biochemical approaches with global sequencing, this project will determine how specific transcription patterns may be stabilized by universal mechanisms targeting the enzymes responsible for RNA synthesis. By studying the process of transcription, the project will tackle a general problem of how multiple layers of information could be packed into, and extracted from, the same DNA sequence.<br/><br/>This project deals with the phenomenon of promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing, which occurs within the first 100 nucleotides of many metazoan genes and is controlled by factors involved in most if not all Pol II-transcribed promoters. Pausing is established by the Negative ELongation Factor (NELF) and, apart from the well-known productive elongation, can be alternatively released without mRNA synthesis via premature termination. This project will investigate the roles of factors responsible for pause establishment and release in human mesenchymal stem cells undergoing adipocyte differentiation. Objective 1 will focus on establishing pausing to determine how NELF defines genes to be paused. The question will be addressed by perturbing the levels of NELF at various time scales and monitoring Pol II pausing distribution and dynamics using our published as well as new methods including 5'-capped RNA- sequencing and multiplex permanganate footprinting. Objective 2 will focus on pause release to determine how the decision between mRNA production versus termination regulates expression of genes in response to a model heat shock stimulus. The question will be addressed by combining Pol II ChIP-sequencing and global run-on assays with novel analysis of termination-specific small RNAs derived from paused complexes. By exploring Pol II pausing as a prominent yet still poorly understood phenomenon, a new principle organizing genes into networks may be uncovered.

The workshop is aimed at graduate students and early career researchers, as well as researchers from related applied fields in which processes like the mean curvature flow naturally arise. The workshop will consist of a one-day introductory course on mean curvature flow, followed by a series of longer form survey lectures from a selection of preeminent researchers which will introduce participants to some of the most important recent breakthroughs in the field. These lecture series will be supported by auxiliary talks from further leading researchers and a series of short talks by graduate students and early career researchers.<br/><br/>Geometric flows, such as the mean curvature flow, have proved to be a powerful tool in the analysis of a large number of important problems in differential geometry, image processing and mathematical physics, leading to a profound impact on each of these fields. They also arise naturally in such diverse physical contexts as thermomechanics, annealing metals, crystal growth, flame propagation, wearing processes and conformal field theory, where they model physical processes involving interfaces and surface energies. The mean curvature flow is the prototypical geometric flow equation and, as such, tools developed to understand its behavior often lead to insights into the behavior of other flow-based models. The main themes to be explored at the workshop will be the uniqueness, rigidity and genericity of cylindrical singularities, the classification of ancient and soliton solutions, and recently developed entropy and noncollapsing methods.<br/><br/>Conference website: http://www.math.utk.edu/barrett/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project supports a postdoctoral researcher.  The educational goal of the project is to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of postdoctoral researcher and graduate/undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The conventional view of Tropical Cyclone (TC) intensification regards the absolute angular momentum as a materially conserved quantity above the friction layer.  This study seeks to demonstrate that the eddy process associated with eyewall and rainband convection serves as a sole forcing for the azimuthal-mean angular momentum conservation.  It is this forcing that provides an ultimate mechanism for triggering and driving Rapid Intensification (RI) of TCs that cannot be explained by the classic TC intensification theories.  At the current resolution of operational models, the PIs demonstrate that the sub-grid scale (SGS) forcing above the PBL associated with convection poses an important bearing on TC intensification, especially RI.  How to generate a realistic SGS forcing aloft in the TC inner-core region is a new challenge in turbulent mixing parameterization that has not been previously explored.  The most important features of this EAGER project are: (1) advance our understanding of the role of eddy forcing associated with eyewall and rainband convection in modulating intensity change of TCs and (2) develop physically robust parameterization to represent sub-grid scale forcing associated with convection above the PBL in numerical models used for TC prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As many of these chips may be manufactured in environments of limited trust, problems of the piracy of intellectual property (IP) and the overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs) have emerged in recent years. This project focuses on designing a secure logic locking technique to enable protection against untrusted IC manufacturing. The developed solution is resistant to all known attacks.<br/> <br/>Logic locking is a promising solution for enabling trust in outsourced IC manufacturing, where a design is obfuscated by modifying the functionality. A locked chip will produce incorrect results unless activated by an obfuscation key. However, Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based algorithms have been shown to effectively determine the obfuscation key and break the locking mechanisms. In this work, a novel secure cell (SC) is designed, which prevents the obfuscation key from being captured in internal flip-flops of a chip and disables scan dump after functional mode. The SC provides a complete protection against SAT-based and other existing attacks that utilize scan data. In addition, SC provides support for commercial tools to generate test patterns without having the obfuscation key. This will help perform the manufacturing test before the activation of chips, and thus preventing IC overproduction.<br/> <br/>The proposed research will serve a critical need for the industry and government by working to support trust in the semiconductor manufacturing and test process.

Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) could raise the global sea level by about 5 meters (16 feet) and the scientific community considers it the most significant risk for coastal environments and cities. The risk arises from the deep, marine setting of WAIS. Although scientists have been aware of the precarious setting of this ice sheet since the early 1970s, it is only now that the flow of ice in several large drainage basins is undergoing dynamic change consistent with a potentially irreversible disintegration. Understanding WAIS stability and enabling more accurate prediction of sea-level rise through computer simulation are two of the key objectives facing the polar science community today. This project will directly address both objectives by: (1) using state-of-the-art technologies to observe rapidly deforming parts of Thwaites Glacier that may have significant control over the future evolution of WAIS, and (2) using these new observations to improve ice-sheet models used to predict future sea-level rise. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of UK and US scientists. This international collaboration will result in new understanding of natural processes that may lead to the collapse of the WAIS and will boost infrastructure for research and education by creating a multidisciplinary network of scientists. This team will mentor three postdoctoral researchers, train four Ph.D. students and integrate undergraduate students in this research project.<br/><br/>The project will test the overarching hypothesis that shear-margin dynamics may exert powerful control on the future evolution of ice flow in Thwaites Drainage Basin. To test the hypothesis, the team will set up an ice observatory at two sites on the eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier. The team argues that weak topographic control makes this shear margin susceptible to outward migration and, possibly, sudden jumps in response to the drawdown of inland ice when the grounding line of Thwaites retreats. The ice observatory is designed to produce new and comprehensive constraints on englacial properties, including ice deformation rates, ice crystal fabric, ice viscosity, ice temperature, ice water content and basal melt rates. The ice observatory will also establish basal conditions, including thickness and porosity of the till layer and the deeper marine sediments, if any. Furthermore, the team will develop new knowledge with an emphasis on physical processes, including direct assessment of the spatial and temporal scales on which these processes operate. Seismic surveys will be carried out in 2D and 3D using wireless geophones. A network of broadband seismometers will identify icequakes produced by crevassing and basal sliding. Autonomous radar systems with phased arrays will produce sequential images of rapidly deforming internal layers in 3D while potentially also revealing the geometry of a basal water system. Datasets will be incorporated into numerical models developed on different spatial scales. One will focus specifically on shear-margin dynamics, the other on how shear-margin dynamics can influence ice flow in the whole drainage basin. Upon completion, the project aims to have confirmed whether the eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier can migrate rapidly, as hypothesized, and if so what the impacts will be in terms of sea-level rise in this century and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Poor understanding of how roots respond to stress is an obstacle to understanding plant responses to environmental change. In addition, how quickly roots decompose affects how nutrients are recycled from dead root tissues, which can further influence plant growth. However, current models of root decomposition are based on what is known about the breakdown of aboveground parts of plants, like leaves and stems. Furthermore, little is known about how root chemistry varies with local soil conditions which limits understanding of how plants respond to nutrient poor soils, or how this in turn influences soil nutrient recycling. This research will study how soil conditions and microbes influence root chemistry of important forest tree species in eastern North America. Results of this research will also improve models of root decomposition by incorporating root chemical composition. This project will also provide several benefits to society. It will create workshops for high school students and a summer course and curriculum development materials for K-12 teachers. It will also provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>Fine roots (less than 2mm diameter) have a disproportionately large influence on plant adaptation and key ecosystem processes, yet they remain one of the least understood components of Terrestrial Biosphere Models. Commonly used parameters, such as element ratios, that predict decomposition of aboveground tissues fail to adequately predict the decomposition of fine roots. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that this disconnect is due to the unique chemical construction of roots, which is shaped by their immediate biotic and abiotic soil environments. The PIs propose to investigate the chemical plasticity in fine roots of different tree species developed under different soil resource availabilities and associations with different species of mycorrhizal fungi. The PIs will link observed chemical plasticity to decomposition dynamics of fine roots using decomposition experiments and by utilizing advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques. The PIs propose to develop parameters that incorporate root chemistry to improve predictions of fine-root decomposition. The proposed project would be one of the first attempts to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular-level chemical profile of fine-roots that facilitate plant stress adaptation, and to develop robust parameters to predict fine-root decomposition and soil organic matter formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Random environments are ubiquitous to many physical systems: gases, condensed matter, chemical reaction, etc. The inherent complexity of these phenomena motivates the use of noise in their mathematical description. A fundamental challenge is to interpret how this noise affects the dynamical aspects of the system. In condensed matter physics, the lack of synchrony between random scatterers can eliminate all propagation of waves-- a phenomena known as Anderson localization. On the other hand, disordered gases exhibit high diffusivity properties, with applications in imaging. A mathematical understanding has impact on technological applications in atmospheric science, wireless communications in urban environments, physiological imaging and electronic transport in nano-structures. <br/><br/>This workshop will present recent developments on wave propagation, scattering and diffusion in random medias at the interface of probability theory, mathematical physics and partial differential equations.

User interfaces that adapt themselves to available user information (such as special needs or individual preferences) are becoming increasingly important, so much so that adaptability has become a selling point for software products.  A system with the ability to construct and consult a user model (an explicit representation of properties of a particular user or group of users) can adapt diverse aspects of its performance and enhance its effectiveness, usability and/or acceptance in a variety of situations (e.g., to reduce information overload, to improve the quality of information retrieval, filtering and annotation, and to generate useful information visualizations).  Applications for user modeling range from electronic commerce and intelligent learning environments to health care and assistive technologies.  Relevant platforms for user modeling include mobile and wearable systems and smart environments, as well as individual desktop systems, groupware, adaptive hypermedia, and other web-based systems.  The annual UMAP conference is the premier forum at which academic and industrial researchers from all these fields gather to present their latest research and to exchange their complementary insights on user modeling issues. Attending and presenting their work at UMAP will have a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of user modeling, adaptation, and personalization researchers.  More information about the conference is available online at http://www.um.org/umap2018/.  <br/><br/>Student authors at UMAP and attendees in the Doctoral Consortium will both have the opportunity to present their work to a knowledgeable audience and through lively discussions get useful comments at an early stage of their research when it will be most useful.  Just as importantly, they will have a chance to meet established researchers and other graduate students doing similar work, to exchange ideas and to make contacts that will be invaluable to them as they progress in their scientific careers.  Interacting with young researchers is also beneficial to experienced investigators, by providing fresh ideas and new perspectives.  Thus, the Doctoral Consortium is a great confidence builder for the students involved, and highly stimulating to the senior researchers as well.   Students whose work has been selected for presentation at the Doctoral Consortium will be invited to write a paper that will be published in the UMAP 2018 conference proceedings, which will be included in the ACM Digital Library.  They will have a 30-minute window in which to present their work (with a short demonstration where appropriate), including time for questions and discussion.  During the question/discussion period and in subsequent informal interactions, organizing committee members and other participants will provide constructive comments on each student's work and attempt to address aspects on which the student has requested advice.  The organizers have reaffirmed the long-standing and demonstrated UMAP commitment to diversity; to this end, they will make special efforts to recruit women and members of under-represented groups when selecting the candidates to receive financial support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is an evident mismatch between the scientific understanding of signals defined over regular domains (time or space) and graph-valued signals. Knowledge about time series was developed over the course of decades and boosted by real needs in areas such as communications, speech, or control. On the contrary, the prevalence of network-related signal processing problems and the access to quality network data are recent events. In this context, research in this project aims to push the frontiers of knowledge in network-analytic information processing, and thus make progress towards understanding the inherent complexities of strongly coupled systems such as the brain. Students will also be trained to tackle the problems at the intersection of Big Data and Network Science, thereby contributing to workforce development as well.<br/><br/>Under the assumption that the signals are related to the topology of the graph where they are supported, the goal of graph signal processing is to develop algorithms that fruitfully leverage this relational structure, and can make inferences about these relationships when they are only partially observed. Most graph signal processing efforts to date assume that the underlying network is known, and then analyze how the graph's algebraic and spectral characteristics impact the properties of the graph signals of interest. However, such assumption is often untenable in practice and arguably most graph construction schemes are largely informal, distinctly lacking an element of validation.  The intellectual merit of this research project is to investigate how to use information available from graph signals to learn the underlying graph topology, through innovative approaches that operate in the graph spectral domain. The idea is to consider the graph Fourier transform of the snapshot signals associated with an arbitrary graph and, among all the feasible networks, search for one that endows the resulting transforms with target spectral properties and the sought graph with appealing physical characteristics. Aligned with current trends in data-driven scientific inquiry into complex networked systems, the aim is to shift from: (i) descriptive accounts to inferential graph signal processing techniques that can explain as well as predict network behavior; and from (ii) ad hoc graph constructions to rigorous formulations rooted in well-defined models and principles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Any improvements in welding productivity and performance can potentially save billions of dollars for the country. Laser welding is a promising process that can improve the welding speed by tens and even hundreds of times compared with conventional welding processes such as arc welding and electric resistance welding.  However, laser welding can suffer from several problems, including high porosity, coarse grains, and brittle intermetallic compounds in the joints, all of which can reduce performance. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project is focused on a novel process called Vibration-assisted Laser Keyhole Welding (V-LKW) and aims to study how the laser vibration will help to solve the aforementioned problems in laser welding. Experimentation and numerical modeling will be used simultaneously to investigate the fundamental physics in V-LKW. The research, if successful, will significantly advance scientific understanding of the complex phenomena in V-LKW, and promote the applications of this novel process in the manufacturing industry (especially the automotive and aerospace sectors) for the improvement of welding productivity and performance. The educational objective of this project is to engage and prepare students for the intellectual challenges in modern manufacturing technologies. Outreach activities to high school students will be conducted to cultivate their interests in manufacturing technology and encourage them to explore engineering as their future careers.<br/><br/>This CAREER project will focus on a novel Vibration-assisted Laser Keyhole Welding (V-LKW) process. The research objective is to test the hypothesis that the properties of V-LKW joints can be significantly improved through the mechanisms of porosity reduction, grain refinement, and intermetallic reduction, all of which are functions of the vibration direction, amplitude, and frequency of the laser. In-process time-resolved observation techniques, post-process microstructural/mechanical characterization methods, and a multi-physics numerical model will be used to identify the process-structure-property relationship of V-LKW and understand the fundamental physics in V-LKW. If successful, this project will advance our understanding of laser-matter interaction, keyhole dynamic behavior, vibration generation/transmission, multi-phase thermo-fluid flow, and solidification phenomena in V-LKW. The research will enable the improvement of welding productivity and joint properties in the manufacturing of many products, including but not limited to automobiles, thermal management devices, electronic devices, and medical devices. The outreach and education activities will improve the education of manufacturing science and engineering at the University of Utah, attract more high school, college, and minority students to choose careers in engineering and manufacturing, and strength the university's connection to local communities.

Resulting efficiencies can reduce product defects and manufacturing costs by over 25 percent. When coupled with Additive Manufacturing, Smart Manufacturing promises to transform U.S. industry. For example, 20 pounds of raw material are currently required to make a one-pound part for the aerospace industry using subtractive machining. Additive Manufacturing can reduce this so-called buy-to-fly ratio of 20:1 to 2:1, while simultaneously reducing lead time from six months to one week. Realization of these potential manufacturing gains will advance the national prosperity and welfare by increasing U.S. advanced manufacturing competitiveness. Despite these advantages, industries are hesitant to adopt Additive Manufacturing due to process inconsistency - parts may have undetected defects, such as porosity, that make them unsafe for use in mission-critical applications. A potential solution to this problem is a concept called Smart Additive Manufacturing, which melds the ideas of Smart Manufacturing with Additive Manufacturing. Through this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award, in-process sensor data will be utilized to understand the mechanisms of defect formation occurring during the Laser Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing process. Advanced data analysis approaches that incorporate the new fundamental understanding of defect evolution will be leveraged to realize a robust correct-as-you-build methodology. This foundational work will find application across many manufacturing sectors including aerospace and defense. The award will also facilitate a discovery-based learning approach to engage learners in hands-on exploration of Additive Manufacturing at multiple levels. A research collaboration with Navajo Technical University will be initiated to further broaden project impact and train the advanced manufacturing workforce of the future. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to establish a Smart Additive Manufacturing framework for alleviating the poor part quality in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion-based Additive Manufacturing of metals. Success will result in a hybrid Additive Manufacturing strategy that combines material deposition (additive) and material removal (subtractive) actions within the same machine potentially giving rise to zero-defect parts. The research challenges addressed by this award include: 1) understanding how and why certain defects are formed by isolating and quantifying the underlying process phenomena as they happen in real-time using in-process sensors, 2) advancing the mathematics of spectral graph theory to capture defects from heterogeneous sensors in real-time - a big data problem, and  3) forwarding reduced-order models to understand the physical thermomechanical dynamics, such as layer re-melting and reflow, that occur when defects are corrected with hybrid Laser Powder Bed Fusion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These types of molecules constitute a highly important class of systems due to their role in a number of important processes, such as photosynthesis and homogeneous transition-metal catalysis. Strongly correlated systems are difficult to model, in part, due to the inability to divide up the molecule into small parts (""inseparability"") to focus on only one part at a time.  This requires simulations to be performed on an entire system, which is usually far too complicated for even the world's fastest supercomputers. Prof. Mayhall's research is focused on studying the extent of this inseparability in different types of molecular systems. This knowledge will then be used to design better theories and software which start from a ""separated"" initial description, reintroducing the effects of inseparability in a slow and controlled manner, to avoid the large growth in computational complexity while maintaining accurate results. This work has the potential to contribute to technologies involving energy production and chemical catalysis. Prof. Mayhall's outreach program involves developing two sets of educational modules targeting distinct demographics.  The first is focused on inmates in regional detention facilities, and the second is directed toward female high-school students interested in STEM fields.  The latter work is done in collaboration with established activities at Virginia Tech.<br/><br/>The main goals of this project are two-fold, 1) obtain better understanding of inseparable systems, such as strongly-correlated molecules and collective excited states in molecular aggregates and materials, and 2) develop new computational methods capable of modeling these systems in a way which exploits approximate separability to obtain computational algorithms which can be effectively parallelized to run on large scale computing resources. To achieve these goals, Prof. Mayhall's research group is pursuing two distinct approaches. The first approach builds on recent work from the PI in which an approximate tensor decomposition is used to model ground and excited states in strongly correlated systems. The second approach draws on recent work in the field based on quantum embedding theories, with direct applicability to large scale parallelization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the world's largest collection of chytrids, it serves as a resource to the research community by providing cultures to biologists in both academic and industrial settings, resulting in biological insights found in over 200 published articles.  Although these microscopic fungi reproduce with a swimming spore they occur in soils as well as in fresh and saline waters; they fill important ecological roles as parasites and also by degrading substrates such as pollen and other plant material, insect exoskeletons, hair, etc.  Chytrids are notorious for their role in the global decline of amphibians; the collection contains over 180 strains of the amphibian pathogen from around the world.  This collection was developed and maintained by Joyce Longcore at the University of Maine without institutional support for more than 25 years.  To safeguard the chytrid collection, it will be moved to the University of Michigan's recently remodeled Research Museums Complex where it will be stored in a state-of-the-art cryopreservation facility and managed by the University's Herbarium unit. The collection will be a resource for the scientific community involved in research on chytrids and their function in terrestrial and aquatic systems.<br/><br/>Chytrid fungi require special growth and maintenance conditions, because they are aquatic fungi that reproduce with flagellated, wall-less zoospores. Most of the University of Maine collection is cryopreserved, making inter-institutional transfer in a frozen state possible, however, approximately 12% of the collection is routinely transferred in liquid cultures, because it has not been amendable to freezing. The first goal of the project is to move the collection in Maine to the Research Museums Complex in Ann Arbor where fungal strains will be stored in liquid nitrogen freezers.  Cryopreservation in the vapor of liquid nitrogen stabilizes samples at -193 degrees Celsius; because inadvertent exposure to temperatures above -80 affects the viability of frozen cultures, storage in liquid nitrogen is safer than storage in typical ultralow freezers with electrical compressors.  A second goal of this project is to develop methods to freeze and secure the remaining 12% of strains that have been resistant to cryopreservation.  To verify taxonomic assignments of the culture collection and to better characterize its contents, DNA barcoding will be performed by sequencing and making accessible the 18S and ITS ribosomal RNA gene regions.  Finally, this project will transform the collection into a public resource by making additional data about the strains accessible online and improving the distribution and maintenance of the cultures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This leads to a lot of redundancies in the model and unnecessary over-complication of the architecture.

The project explores novel auto-scaling and multi-deformable convolutional network architectures that utilize parametric motion fields to automatically locate the correct deformations of a visual object for each convolutional filter. In order to learn the motion fields from video, the research team uses a Siamese convolutional-deconvolutional network predicting boundaries in two consecutive frames, and utilizes an output-to-output feedback loop to deduce boundary motion.

Currently, the manufacturing industry is operating production systems vulnerable to malicious attacks, which may cause produced parts to not meet intended design requirements. Such a deviation from design intent could result in damaged products, loss of customer trust, and potentially injure employees and/or customers. The adoption of the proposed approach will secure manufacturers from cyber-physical attacks and create a strong supply chain. This will allow manufacturers to continue to produce sensitive parts both for the general public and the defense industry, increasing the difficulty of a malicious attack to affect part production.

This is done through a two-phase approach. First, a cyber-physical vulnerability assessment is completed which highlights areas within the production environment susceptible to malicious attack. Employing decision trees and process mapping, the vulnerability assessment is used to provide a high level overview of the cyber-physical resiliency of a manufacturing facility. Second, the proposed detection approach consists of an air-gapped sensor suite which can be placed on any piece of critical equipment to detect malicious events in real-time. The proposed approach analyzes side-channel measurements independent of the machine such as power consumption, vibration, and sound to identify anomalies within the process.

It supports computational research and education that includes developing computer simulation tools and applying them to advance understanding of battery electrode material performance. Material failures are serious roadblocks to the development of high performance energy storage materials, which are vital to many applications, such as electric cars and delivering renewable energy. The PI aims to use computers to simulate the chemistry and mechanics of candidate electrode materials in a lithium-ion battery. The PI will investigate proposed high-performance electrode materials, particularly one made of copper coated silicon on a scaffold made of carbon. The simulations will show how charging and discharging cycles affect the failure of the electrode material. The research activities will not only advance the scientific knowledge on the material structure changes and the dynamics of lithium ions of silicon-based electrode composites, but also will provide a Mutliscale Modeling Toolbox that describes physics and chemistry that spans from processes on the scale of atoms to macroscopic scales. The computational toolbox can be extended to systems beyond silicon and lithium technology such as newly developed magnesium and lithium air batteries. This approach has impact on enhancing the performance of energy storage materials. This project also supports educational activities that will employ the latest methods of emerging media to recruit and retain underrepresented students and women to engineering through professional programs at Rice University, and provide outreach to local high school teachers in Houston to help enrich the science content and to introduce pedagogical methods with lesson plans to nurture future generations.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award is a collaboration between the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation. It supports computational research and education to develop a reactive molecular-dynamics-based multiscale simulation framework that enables the application of fundamental material science to tackle the pressing global needs for high performance energy storage materials. These needs include high capacity, rate, and cycle life rechargeable batteries. The overarching goal is to study how the intrinsic coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry during cycling impact the failure and performance of silicon-based electrode composites of lithium-ion batteries. Copper coated silicon deposited onto a 3D carbon scaffold will be a focus of this modeling effort. A novel computational protocol will be developed to enable understanding of the synergistic behavior of material characteristics and atomistic processes across multiple length scales and how it affects the performance of silicon-based electrodes. The proposed electrode composite will provide a 3D template, which exhibits improved service life and performance as well as lightweight and multifunctional features. The key hypotheses of this project are: 1) there exists two or more phase boundaries in the composite silicon electrodes that co-evolve, influence each other, and trigger defects and mismatched strains, and 2) a memory effect in the topology of the active material controls the system to retrace a similar electrochemical pathway during cycling, leading to voltage hysteresis. By sequentially monitoring relithiation and delithiation processes, the PI aims to unravel a series of complicated dynamic atomistic mechanisms at unprecedented length scales, including aggregation and segregation pathways of residual silicon topology, and formation of voltage hysteresis. The work is aimed to provide fundamental insights and to introducing new design concepts and principles for de novo computational-driven fabrication of lightweight and high performance rechargeable batteries, which may lead to a new line of research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to place new teachers into rural high schools in Western Kansas, thus increasing the workforce for secondary STEM education. To accomplish this goal, the project will provide students with scholarships and develop curriculum materials to prepare them to be successful teachers in high needs, rural classrooms with high percentages of students eligible for free and reduced lunches (a poverty indicator). A key element of the curriculum will be a rural field experience planned in cooperation with the school districts through a regional service center, coupled with academic year seminars. The project will use a mentoring program for undergraduates and a professional development program for early teachers that will support both future and practicing teachers. Rural areas in Kansas have a critical shortage of STEM teachers. By supporting the pipeline of students from community college, through teacher certification, and placement into high-need rural areas of Western Kansas, this project will contribute to STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The project aims to recruit 33 undergraduates from five local community colleges (Dodge City, Garden City, Barton County, Colby, and Seward Community Colleges) to Fort Hays State University, where they will double major in secondary education and a STEM discipline.  The project will also collaborate with the Southwest Plains Regional Service Center, which serves 34 rural school districts in Western Kansas. The service center will provide scholarship recipients with early experiences in rural schools and assist with student teaching placements.  The project will provide scholarships and support activities to students through their undergraduate and post-baccalaureate year, intended to enable the students to become certified STEM teachers.  The project focuses on research questions including: What recruiting practices for attracting STEM teachers to FHSU are most effective? What recruiting strategies attract more STEM teachers? What factors result in retaining STEM teachers once they enter the profession in a high needs rural area? What factors negatively impact retention in rural areas?  Answers to these questions has potential value to other teacher education programs, particularly those focused on preparation of pre-service teachers for high-needs, rural schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with enabling reproducibility and justifiability of decisions in the data analysis process, specifically as it relates to visual data analysis. Visualization is an important tool for discovery, yet decisions made by humans based on visualizations of data are difficult to capture and to justify. This project will develop methods to justify, communicate, and audit decisions made based on visual analysis. This, in turn will lead to better outcomes, achieved with less effort and cost. The increasing use of visual analysis tools for decision making will make data analysis accessible to a broad variety of people, as visual analysis tools are generally easier to use than scripting languages and do not require extensive computational and statistical training. This research and its related activities increase accessibility and enhance the data analysis infrastructure for research and education.  <br/><br/>To achieve these goals, this research will develop a framework for making visual analysis sessions not only reproducible but also reusable. The approach is based on tracking semantically meaningful provenance data during an interactive visual analysis session. Once a discovery is made, analysts can use this history to curate a succinct analysis story, adding justifications and explanations to make their analysis reproducible by others. Using a semi-automatic process, analysts will be able to make their actions data-aware, so that their analysis processes become robust to changes, such as updates in the data. A second contribution of the proposed work is the integration of visual analysis into computational analysis processes. While visualization is commonly used to present computational analysis results, the results of a visual analysis session are rarely used to feed into further computational processes. The techniques developed in this project will allow analysts to feed analysis results (selections, aggregations, filters, etc.) back into a computational environment. This will make it possible to use interactive visualization at any point in the data analysis process while maintaining reproducibility and enabling reuse. The expected results include new methods to capture user intent, create data stories from analysis processes, and to integrate computational and visual data analysis, leveraging the strength of both, human abilities and computational power. The results will be disseminated in publications and in the form of open source software, and accessible via the project website (http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/projects/2018-nsf-reproducibility/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organic molecular crystals play an important role in a range of fields including chemistry, biochemistry, materials science, pharmacology, and engineering. One everyday example of organic molecular crystals are pharmaceutical tablets, which are typically formulated to optimize properties such as shelf-life (i.e. thermal stability) and solubility (i.e. dissolution upon ingestion). A perhaps less appreciated role of organic crystals has been their pivotal impact in understanding the structure and function of biomolecules (i.e. proteins) via X-ray crystallography experiments. Whereas drug molecules typically consist of only a few dozen atoms, proteins generally consist of thousands of atoms whose packing (i.e. 3-dimensional arrangement) is described by a process called ""protein folding"". A driving force behind the folding of proteins is the hydrophobic effect, which is also responsible for the commonly observed tendency of oil and water to separate. The work in Dr. Schnieder's group focuses on the rigorous incorporation of all forces that contribute to protein folding into efficient algorithms for the computational prediction of peptide and protein crystal structures (polymorphs). The approach combines advanced models of molecular interactions commonly used to predict small molecule crystal polymorphs with sophisticated molecular dynamics sampling algorithms needed to describe protein folding. The impact of this project is to expand the boundaries of the crystal structure prediction (CSP) field beyond small organic molecules (i.e. dozens of atoms) to include peptides and proteins (i.e. hundreds or thousands of atoms). Dr. Schnieder's research is fully integrated with a three-pronged strategy for educational outreach that strengthens and further diversifies training in Simulation Based Engineering & Science (SBE&S). The project's educational plan includes: outreach to underrepresented high school students to help make computational science fair projects and creation of a modern Computational Biochemistry course to train (under)graduates in applying SBE&S methods to fundamental problems in computational (bio)chemistry.  The third aim is the continued dissemination of open source Force Field X software (http://ffx.biochem.uiowa.edu). Leadership in SBE&S and high-performance computing (HPC) is of critical importance to the global competitiveness of the United States. <br/><br/>Physics-based protein folding via molecular dynamics (MD) inherently accounts for temperature, pressure, solvent environment and entropic contributions such as the hydrophobic effect. On the other hand, nearly all current crystal structure predication (CSP) approaches perform either a systematic or stochastic search of a potential energy surface, rather than a free energy surface, followed in limited cases by approximate inclusion of entropic considerations. The premise of this project is that a generally applicable solution to the ""protein crystal folding problem"" requires efficient inclusion of temperature, pressure and solvent environment (hydrophobic effect, pH, etc.) during polymorph discovery simulations. Due to the slow nucleation kinetics of crystallization, ordinary unbiased MD is not efficient for CSP. To overcome this, a novel family of algorithms are being developed to help open the door to polymer crystal property prediction. The first objective focuses on two novel alchemical thermodynamic paths, which do not require a priori knowledge of the crystalline state and that dramatically accelerate phase transitions 1) between vacuum and crystalline states (i.e. sublimation/deposition) and 2) between solvated and crystalline states (i.e. solubility). Both paths efficiently include the influence of temperature and pressure, while the latter path additionally includes the influence of the solvent environment. The second objective focuses on the first constant pH MD (CpHMD) algorithms for a polarizable force field (e.g. AMOEBA) to account for protonation changes as a polymer (e.g. a protein or nucleic acid) with numerous titratable residues folds and/or undergoes a crystalline phase transition. Beyond the focus of this project on protein crystals, the sampling algorithms and CpHMD theories are broadly applicable to a range of simulation applications, including protein-ligand binding, molecular design and refinement of structural models against experiment (i.e. X-ray and neutron crystallography, CryoEM, NMR, etc). The project's educational plan includes: 1) outreach to underrepresented high school students to facilitate computational science fair projects, 2) creation of a modern Computational Biochemistry course to train (under)graduates in applying SBE&S methods to fundamental problems in computational (bio)chemistry, and 3) continued dissemination of the open source Force Field X software (http://ffx.biochem.uiowa.edu).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collections in the Auburn University Museum of Natural History span plants and animals, with particularly strong holdings from the very diverse Gulf of Mexico coast region, and important collections from the rest of the world.  Auburn University completed a new, state-of-the-art facility for their collections in 2013.  Since moving to the new facility, the collections have seen remarkable growth, not just in terms of the number of specimens, but in the outreach that the museum is able to perform for people in the state and region.  The museum absorbed collections from other university units and orphaned collections from other institutions in the area, putting strain on the space available.  The collections stored in alcohol (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates) have grown at a particularly fast rate, and the alcohol storage area is limited because of needed safety measures for the proper storage of flammable liquids.  <br/><br/>This project will provide compactorized shelving that will dramatically increase the amount of space within the alcohol collections.

Open house events at the Wehle Center are planned to provide programs to underserved children in the area.

Many research projects aim to investigate barriers to participation and solutions to overcome those barriers.  These research projects, however, can take place in isolation, without useful discussion or collaboration across projects.  This project aims to identify connections across researchers in broadening participation.  Computational analysis of research papers, and their citations, will map and illuminate the structure of this network.  Guided by this map, the project team will interview and study a range of researchers, with focus on how these researchers generate and store data.  Through this project, the researchers will learn how to better share data; compare and strengthen research findings; and build community toward more effective national-scale research on broadening participation.  This in turn will aid larger scale interventions, making more meaningful strides toward diversity and inclusion across science and engineering.<br/> <br/>This research will begin with computerized analysis of federal grant awards and publications arising from those awards.  The project team has expertise managing and analyzing large complex data sets, synthesizing patterns, identifying gaps in knowledge, quantifying trends, and creating visualization tools.  This analysis will reveal the structure of diversity and inclusion research communities.  From these communities, key scientists will be recruited for further study.  This will include in-depth interviews and a focus group gathering.  This study will reveal problems and solutions to build data collaborations; ways researchers execute their data management plans; how they utilize datasets as scarce resources, beyond the contexts of hypothesis generating and testing; and how shared data and data-management practices can foster a stronger, empirically grounded research community in broadening participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the world's agriculture concentrated onto large commercial farms, many producers elsewhere have abandoned farming for more profitable industries, such as tourism. Yet, it is widely recognized that food security depends on maintenance of a diversified economy that includes at least some modicum of local food production. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, investigates this economic niche of local farmers, who continue to farm even as economic benefits wane. The researcher asks why people chose to continue traditional livelihoods and self-sufficiency even when it seems to counter economic self-interest.  In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of navigating food insecurity, improving economic and agricultural policies, and promoting environmental, cultural, and economic sustainability.<br/><br/>Dana Conzo, under the supervision of Dr. Krista Harper of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, will explore why agricultural producers remain committed to small-scale farming when participation appears to not be in their short to medium-term economic interest. It tests a classic hypothesis in economic anthropology that human economic behavior is often driven by materially irrational but culturally strategic aims. This project will be conducted in St. Kitts; the Caribbean has long been recognized as an ideal laboratory for examining longitudinal political economic trends because of its long engagement with capitalist production and colonialism. St. Kitts' integration into the global economy began as a sugar producer and has continued as a luxury tourist destination, making it an appropriate location to investigate how and why people maintain cultural practices in changing cultural, economic, and political landscapes. Using a range of established ethnographic and geographic techniques for data collection and analysis, such as participant observation, interviews, and spatial analysis in ArcGIS, the investigator will interview small-scale agricultural producers and trace the island's food and economic flows. The findings will contribute to debates in economic anthropology about autonomy, food security, land and labor practices, and globalization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much like any system of resource extraction (e.g. oil and natural gas, minerals, precious gems) there is the opportunity for accumulating great wealth and power by controlling the production, distribution, and consumption of a highly sought after raw material. Obsidian, a widely used volcanic glass, was the principal material used for all cutting, scraping, and piercing tools for over three millennia throughout pre-Hispanic central Mexico. However, previous archaeological studies into obsidian political economies have focused on the systems of obsidian distribution and consumption, due to the types of sites investigated, ignoring the initial systems of extraction and production. As a result, the means by which resource distribution networks develop and how commodity production is connected to consuming populations is poorly understood. Likewise, the details of how economically and political centralized polities might gain from their control over such resources and the nature of that control have not been vigorously researched. Since raw material quarrying was common throughout the ancient world, the questions addressed in this study have universal applicability, while the methodology can be replicable across the globe in similar contexts.<br/><br/>Dr. Knight and his research team will examine whether obsidian extraction was the result of centralized control by a regional polity, or organized by local populations asserting their territorial rights to the land. Obsidian from the Zaragoza-Oyameles source in eastern Puebla, Mexico dominates chipped stone assemblages at sites throughout much of south eastern Mexico from ca. 400 B.C. to A.D. 1000, and is found in lesser amounts well beyond this region. The ancient, regional center of Cantona may have had its economic clout underwritten by its control over this obsidian source. However, the nature of that control has never been investigated or even modeled. The data collected by Knight and his team of archaeologists, osteologists and faunal experts from broad-scaled excavations at the Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian quarries and associated habitation sites, will directly address the assumption of political and economic control. Utilizing the strengths of several disciplines, they will reconstruct who and how many were involved in obsidian extraction, the methods used to quarry the material, what types of tools were produced and in what quantity, and the nature and degree to which obsidian extraction and production benefited local inhabitants, as opposed to, and/or in addition to the Cantona elite. Since archaeological investigations of quarries are relatively rare, the interdisciplinary approaches developed here can be used universally as a template for future research and student training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike existing methods of distillation where the bulk of the body of liquid is heated for evaporation/boiling, this technology focuses the stored heat onto a thin layer of liquid and allows the rest of the bulk liquid to remain unheated, leading to maximum efficiency and phase-change rate. A physical model has been developed, and laboratory testing under typical solar radiation intensity conditions has shown encouraging results.

Both the fluid and the surface may move and their motion is coupled.  This coupling makes prediction of the motion difficult and leads to new phenomena. In this work, liquid motion on soft substrates will be investigated by both theory and experiments through four research problems. The first research thrust relates to the surface-tension driven wave motion in liquids on soft solids, and is relevant to technologies such as inkjet printing and microfluidics.   The second area involves the motion of a drop on a soft surface due to gradients in the stiffness of the surface, and is relevant to the motion of cancer cells in human tissues.  The third investigation involves splashing of liquids on soft surfaces, and could impact forensic analysis and the aerosol delivery of drugs to neonates.  The final objective involves the spreading of liquids on deformable viscoelastic solids, and is applicable to the manufacture of flexible electronics and the design of biomedical devices.  The research is integrated with undergraduate education through long-term, focused projects and undergraduate summer research experiences, and with graduate education through curriculum development and graduate student research and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>The interaction of soft substrates with fluid interfaces is common to many biological, medical, and industrial processes; flexible electronics are manufactured using immersion lithography, ultrasonic waves are used for medical imaging of soft tissue interfaces, aerosol drug delivery for neonates suffering from respiratory distress syndrome as well as adults being treated for asthma and COPD relies upon droplet deposition on biological tissue, and forensic analysis interprets complex blood splat patterns. Describing these substrate deformations has led to the development of the field of elastocapillarity, in which elastic stresses are coupled to surface tension (capillarity). The aim of this CAREER award is to advance the field of elastocapillary fluid mechanics through carefully-selected theoretical and experimental studies of four canonical problems that focus on the dynamic coupling between the elastic and fluid fields: elastocapillary waves, droplet durotaxis, spreading on compliant substrates, and drop impact. Theoretical models will describe capillary instabilities in soft solids, Marangoni-driven flows that arise from gradients in substrate elasticity (durotaxis), and contact-line dynamics during spreading on compliant substrates. Table-top experiments on drop impact will be designed to facilitate undergraduate learning through research. Elastocapillarity is a new, interdisciplinary field that encompasses a wide range of traditional disciplines, such as fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, and mathematics. The lack of a well-developed course curriculum and a continuously evolving subject matter requires innovative strategies to educate students in this emerging interdisciplinary field, broadly categorized as ""learning through research"", which incorporate focused long-term Creative Inquiry projects and summer research opportunities. Delivering educational content via targeted extended research projects can serve as a template for other emerging scientific fields. Targeted mentoring through the graduate research and professional development seminar series will improve research culture and help place under-represented students in academic/scientific careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, egg-tending behaviors can reduce growth of pathogens on eggshells and thereby reduce egg mortality. However, many egg-layers lack parental care and instead leave eggs unattended and exposed to environmental pathogens. The PIs are interested in how such animals prevent egg loss in the absence of parental care, and propose a novel source of protection, protective microbes that passively transfer from the reproductive system of the mother to eggshell surfaces during egg-laying. A collaborative team centering on behavioral ecology and microbiology will examine maternal and eggshell microbiome and their interactions with soil pathogens utilizing lizards as a model system to test the hypothesis that the microbiome affects reproductive success, signaling, and behavioral interactions of lizards. The PIs will mentor undergraduate and high school students in research, especially women and STEM underrepresented minorities. They will provide high-quality interdisciplinary training to the next generation of scientists by involving students in all aspects of their research and by translating their work into class-based projects.  The proposed research has the potential to shed light on the role of the microbiome on animal behavior.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The interdisciplinary research group will investigate the novel hypothesis that vertically-transmitted cloacal microbes function in egg protection. Preliminary data from Sceloporus virgatus (a phrynosomatid lizard with no parental care) suggest that mature eggs have more bacteria, less fungal growth, and higher hatch success when oviposited than when surgically removed without cloacal contact. The team will: 1) quantify temporal variation in cloacal microbiomes of S. virgatus to test whether females? microbiota change in preparation for egg-laying; 2) use both experiments and observational study to characterize vertical transmission and the role of transmitted microbes in reducing egg infections; 3) relate cloacal microbiota to female reproductive success and signals/cues of reproductive value; and 4) conduct comparative studies across Sceloporus spp. to examine the relationship of reproductive mode (oviparous vs. viviparous) and infection risk on antifungal capacity of cloacal microbiota. Vertical transmission during oviposition is expected to be a general phenomenon, so results should be broadly applicable to other oviparous taxa. The proposed work includes training in sequencing and bioinformatics for the PI, who is based at an undergraduate-serving institution. These methods will be implemented, along with culture-based techniques, in vitro analyses, and field study, in collaboration with carefully mentored undergraduate and high school students. The research will be foundational to the integration of microbiology and behavioral ecology, contributing to long-standing theoretical questions about costs and benefits of parental care (or lack thereof) and sexual signaling, expanding knowledge of microbial diversity and composition in an understudied host lineage, and potentially identifying new antifungal agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is inspired by postcolonial debates that introduced notions of agency and negotiation in the structuration of colonial experiences. Local processes of colonial negotiations have been overshadowed by the splendor of the American, Asian, and European riches circulating through this region during the expansion of the imperial enterprise. As a result, non-European people still lack historical agency in the archaeological narratives of colonial Panama. Previous archaeological research highlights the disappearance of indigenous ceramic styles from the archaeological record and their replacement by European and creole styles. This evidence is used to affirm the extinction or assimilation of indigenous groups located in the areas the Spaniards occupied. However, in light of postcolonial debates, the previous statement raises questions about the process of technological change and the role of political and economic variables in colonial Panama. Did local communities keep control of some aspects of ceramic production? Did the Spanish appropriate local knowledge and resources in the production of ceramic technologies? The study of technology is a window to understand the impacts of colonization not accessible through documentary sources. This research will supplement and diversify the elite perspective of Spanish history and its narratives to include the participation of local and non-European communities in the construction of colonial Panama. <br/><br/>Based on a combination of historical, archaeological, and archaeometric research, MS. Navas will study indigenous production and consumption of ceramics under the supervision of Dr. Rodrguez-Alegra, as part of her doctoral dissertation research at the University of Texas. She will focus on the possible continuity, transformation or disruption of ceramic production and consumption after European colonization. The researcher aims to identify raw materials and technologies used in the production of ceramics in the pre-Columbian and colonial periods. Her study will be centered on compositional analyses of pastes, slips, and glazes of ceramic samples collected in previous excavations from three different Spanish colonial settlements: Nata de los Caballeros, Old Panama (Panama Viejo), and the Panama Historic District (Casco Antiguo). The inclusion of samples from these three sites will allow a regional comparative study of technological and compositional changes in ceramics from different production centers over the long term, starting in the Late Ceramic period (700 AD to conquest) to the nineteenth century. The analyses of the samples will be based on neutron activation analysis (NAA), petrographic thin section analysis, and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). These techniques will permit the identification of the constituent raw materials and techniques used in the production of ceramics and patterns of continuity or change in their use during the colonial period.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to produce a plan for increasing the enrollment and diversity of students pursuing STEM teaching careers within DU's computer science and biological laboratory science bachelor's degree programs. FUSE will accomplish this objective by (1) establishing new dual enrollment pathways for high school and community college students to enter DU's computer science and biological laboratory science degree programs on an accelerated schedule and at reduced cost; (2) creating future teacher clubs at diverse high schools that expand opportunities for high school students to participate in teaching experiences and develop an early interest in a STEM education career; (3) creating service-learning opportunities within the computer science and biological laboratory science programs that provide teaching experiences; and (4) developing a new education course and capstone internship experience to prepare computer science and biological laboratory science majors to enter STEM education and prepare for the Michigan Test for Teacher Certification. <br/><br/>DU's College of Urban Education will collaborate with existing and new school partnerships (Hope Academy, Eaton Regional Education Service Agency, and Grand Rapids Community College). These partnerships will support the establishment of middle college and dual enrollment programs with a curricular focus on computer science and biological laboratory science. Additionally, service learning programming will be developed in partnership with the Expanded Learning Opportunities (ELO) network. ELO provides afterschool and summer programs for 67% of African-American children and 41% of Latino children within the project's geographic area. DU has campuses throughout Michigan's urban areas where shortages of STEM educators exist. FUSE will support the ability of the College of Urban Education to establish the partnerships and infrastructure necessary to implement a new STEM education pathway throughout the state. Students will benefit from the new curricular elements developed through the FUSE project, including a foundational teacher education course, education-based service learning, and a capstone internship experience in education. FUSE responds to the national call for change in STEM teacher preparation as well as Michigan's need for effective teachers to serve students in urban schools.

Customarily, ICM satellite meetings center on a narrowly focused topic within a particular mathematical sub-discipline and are held in the host country or surrounding region. ""A Pan-Hemispheric Celebration of Mathematics"" will be broader in scope than most ICM satellite meetings and will highlight four important areas at the forefront of current mathematics: algebraic geometry and topology; combinatorics; differential geometry and geometric analysis; and mathematical biology. The meeting will feature a vibrant mix of pure and applied perspectives with strong interdisciplinary connections, particularly to physics, biology and computer science.<br/><br/>The meeting will be organized around extended plenary lectures in each of the focal areas, given by leading experts in the field. These plenary lectures will be supplemented by parallel invited special sessions, with the event structured so as to offer participants a dual opportunity to learn broadly about important developments at the frontier of four important areas and to delve more deeply into one of them. Funding from NSF will be used to attract a diverse range of non-speaker participants, with a goal of advancing pan-hemispheric dialogue.

UV light is a harmful to DNA and proteins. In flowering plants, pollen is particularly susceptible to UV damage, but dark pigments in flower petals may protect the pollen by absorbing UV light. The intensity of UV light reaching Earth has increased greatly during the 20th century and may continue to increase, especially in some regions. This project explores whether protective pigmentation in flowers has increased in response to increasing amounts of UV light.  Because flower color is important for attracting pollinators, understanding how it may have changed is necessary to understand how effectiveness of pollination may also have changed.  Pollination effectiveness, in turn, is important for the economic success of many agricultural crops and for the ecological well-being of all flowering plants. This project will also provide research experiences and mentoring for students from underrepresented groups, and will engage the general public through outreach activities at multiple events.<br/><br/>Researchers will test the prediction that temporal increases in UV-B radiation have driven increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation in the petals of flowers. Because UV-B has increased most in polar and temperate regions during the last century, they predict that species with polar and temperate distributions will display larger increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation than sub-tropical species. Additionally, the researchers will test the prediction that species with pollen-bearing structures exposed to sunlight will respond to changes in UV-B, while those with pollen structures recessed within the flower (protected) will not. Researchers will use herbarium specimens and bioclimatic databases to gather data on flower pigmentation and abiotic conditions for 75 diverse taxa with different geographic distributions. They will also sample color across a 55-year time span and will use comparative models to assess whether rapid changes in UV-B have elicited rapid change in flower coloration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Social, emotional, and cognitive capacities mature during adolescence. Life experiences of adolescents can play a significant role in shaping the maturing brain.  This award funds a symposium among a diversity of scientists and other professionals to examine topics such as  synaptic plasticity in adolescent brains, environmental factors influencing adolescent brain development, neuroimaging methods used to study the brain, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Approximately 200 people across a wide range of professions are anticipated to attend the symposium.  The broader impacts include enhanced understanding across multiple fields, which in turn, informs training, research, and policy.  In addition, a summary of the symposium will be published to reach a wider audience. The information presented will benefit society by informing researchers, and health care professionals about the vulnerability of the developing adolescent brain and how this vulnerability can contribute to adolescent well-being.<br/><br/>The adolescent brain experiences dramatic neural reorganization.  The mechanisms underlying decision-making and risky behaviors  of adolescents need to be examined with this reorganization in mind.  This award supports a symposium which will take place as a component of the 2018 Annual Meeting of the Developmental Neurotoxicology Society (DNTS). The symposium will bring together major contributors to the field of adolescent brain development. Presentations will address numerous topics such as (a) how endocannabinoids impact cortical development; (b) what neuroimaging has revealed about cortical network development; (c) how discord between impulsivity and control contribute to risky behaviors, and (d) how exposure to common stimulants  contribute to  abnormal brain functioning.  Experience-dependent plasticity will also be discussed.  Conference attendees will be researchers, policy makers, basic scientists, clinical researchers,  and government representatives (e.g., Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control). The symposium summary will be published as a means of making the information available to the scientific community.  A better understanding of the connection between environmental factors and brain development may help us determine how to foster well-being among adolescents in our society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.<br/><br/>	The major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time. This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes.A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes.

Modern agriculture is based on the adoption of selection as a method to improve crops. Furthermore, dealing with emerging diseases and antibiotic resistance is helped by understanding how natural selection operates. This project examines the fact that the strength and direction of natural selection routinely differs between males and females of a species. The consequence of this selection depends on whether the same genes are expressed in males and females. The research team will explore selection on males and females using field studies, genomic analyses, and statistical modeling using Silene latifolia, an herbaceous flowering plant. This plant is an ideal model for this research given extensive prior work demonstrating important phenotypic and genetic differences between males and females. Workshops to the scientific community will be presented on how to write scientific articles and the genomic techniques used in this study. Outreach to the general public will include a project involving high-school students in Kansas in genetic research, and a demonstration on flowers at a community-level science festival in Indiana.<br/><br/>The research team will collect phenotypic and fitness measurements on all individuals within a S. latifolia population from Virginia, and then interrogate these individuals, and their progeny, at Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. The combination of phenotypic, genotypic, and fitness data will allow the researchers to determine if selection is evident at the scale of individual loci and if it differs between males and females. This species has heteromorphic sex chromosomes (males are XY), and a genome-wide characterization of selection will enable a test of the prediction that selection should differ between autosomes and sex chromosomes. While there is a great body of work measuring natural selection in plant populations, this experiment will provide unprecedented detail on a typically hidden component of selection, the differential success of male plants in siring. Finally, the project will allow both undergraduate and graduate students to engage in and learn field techniques, laboratory methodology, and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This means they are often thought of as being liquid water, also called warm clouds, or ice, also called cold clouds. Those clouds that contain liquid water droplets and ice crystals at the same time are called mixed phase clouds. Mixed phase clouds are currently poorly understood because of the complicated mixture. Our lack of understanding of clouds, particularly those that are mixed in phase, limits our ability to understand precipitation, the atmosphere chemistry and climate. This project will determine the particles on which the droplets and ice crystals in mixed phase clouds form by deploying a new inlet and both warm and cold cloud chambers at Storm Peak Laboratory. Storm Peak is a high altitude site located in the Rocky Mountains in north-central Colorado that is among only a handful of sites worldwide that offers scientific laboratories where mixed phase clouds exist for long time periods. Using this new inlet, the research team will carry out two-season long observational studies of droplet and ice crystals within mixed phase clouds. This project will allow a resolution of the question of which atmospheric particles make droplets, which make ice crystals, and which do not effectively make either.<br/><br/>A graduate student will work on this project full time, thereby being trained in this important area of atmospheric science. A post-doctoral fellow will also work on this project part-time, increasing their research experience in this area. The collected data will be archived and presented to the atmospheric sciences community. This will include both papers and presentations, with a focus on providing data to help improve models that include precipitation, climate and air quality. Beyond the scientific community, a documentary of the project at Storm Peak will be made in partnership with Science for the Public, a WGBH-Boston television and multimedia production.

Since the 1980s, within a relatively static framework set by the two other branches of government, courts' rulings on legal disputes have continuously changed the strength of patents in the US. Meanwhile, there is still controversy regarding the impact of the strength of patents on innovation. The debate has been stymied by difficulties in understanding the effect of various facets of patent policy. This project offers a solution to advance our understanding of how courts shape the patent system by (1) distinguishing three aspects of strength in the analysis: patentability, breadth and ability to exclude and (2) examining the heterogeneous impact of these court decisions on the rate and direction of firms' innovative activities. The research answers the following three questions. First, what influences decision-making for patent-related Supreme Court decisions? Second, do firms react to decisions in the direction expected by the Court? Lastly, do firms benefit from participating in policymaking? As a result, the project also provides new insights on the policymaking process by the courts, focusing on the constraints and external influences in decision-making, including firms' incentives to advocate for their position. In addition, this project provides an understanding of the aggregated effect of apparently disjointed cases on the overall rate and direction of innovation. <br/><br/>The first part examines the policymaking process in the court based on all US Supreme Court patent cases over the period 2000-2015 to provide an understanding of the effect of participation of stakeholders (as party in a case, amici or through lobbying) on the decisions that change patent strength. The second part provides theoretical and empirical insights on the long-debated relationship between patent strength and innovation. It challenges the view that weaker patents lead to fewer innovations. To confront theories in the existing literature predicting changes in firm strategy leading to both increases and decreases in innovation, mixed methodology is used by combining the analysis of court documents with quantitative estimations of the impact using a panel data set of patent and firm data to examine the mechanisms behind patent policymaking and firm strategy. Lastly, the third part examines whether firms participating in patent policymaking obtain benefits reflected in their performance. For all three parts of the project, strong empirical evidence is provided regarding the mechanisms behind patent policymaking and firm strategy. An original research design is used to estimate the impact of a patent policy change on firms' behavior while controlling for competing explanations for the effects. The project also relies on unique data, an exhaustive panel data set matching patents with time series firm-level data on the entire population of French firms, based on unique identifiers, over the period of 1995-2014. Such data allow novel insights by distinguishing impacts on propensity to use patents from intensity of engagement in innovative activities and identifying population level evidence on firm formation and first-time involvement in innovative activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on crowdsourcing and human computation.  While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of this cross-disciplinary conference, HCOMP believes strongly in inviting, fostering, and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research.  More information about the conference is available online at http://www.humancomputation.com/2018/.  The Doctoral Consortium will be a research-focused full-day meeting immediately following the conference technical program on July 8.  It will enhance the scientific workforce in this emerging research area by nurturing a group of promising young investigators interested in human computation and crowdsourcing, allowing them: to attend the conference; to learn of potential career paths within academia and industry; to access an international network of researchers who can support their professional development; and to see firsthand the interdisciplinary nature, diversity and interrelationships of research in human computation.  The faculty mentors also will serve as the review committee for student applications. The organizers will promote diversity by selecting no more than one or two students from any one school, and by prioritizing the selection of women and underrepresented minorities.  <br/><br/>The full-day Doctoral Consortium will include activities to guide the research of these promising young researchers. The Consortium will allow participants to interact with established researchers and with other students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussions, and invited presentations. Each participant will give a short presentation on their research and will receive feedback from at least one faculty mentor and from fellow students. The feedback will be geared toward helping the student participants understand and articulate how their research is positioned relative to other work on human computation and crowdsourcing.  Activities led by the faculty will include a panel discussion to give students more information about the process and lessons of research and life in academia and industry. To further integrate the Doctoral Consortium participants into the conference itself, students will have a chance to present their work in an interactive poster session, and their papers will be posted online on the workshop webpage. These activities will benefit the participants by offering each fresh perspectives and comments on their work from researchers outside their own institution, both from faculty and other students; providing a supportive setting for mutual feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions; and enabling participants to form a cohort of new researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, adults with ID/DD show poor outcomes on almost all indicators of successful adulthood. This project examines the influence of the tension between the need for care and encouragement of autonomy on the adult lives of people with ID/DD. More specifically, this study investigates disabled adulthood as a collection of care arrangements--created by significant others, programs, and government support--that shapes the opportunities for autonomy. This research has three goals: to assess the design of a novel independent living program for high functioning adults with ID/DD, to contribute to the literature on the ethics of care, and to situate the regulations governing state and federal funding for disability in the context of the daily life of adults with ID/DD.  Findings from this study have the potential for broader impacts through influence on government policy concerning care and directly on caregiving for adults with ID/DD.<br/><br/>This project will use ethnographic research, interviews, and qualitative analysis of government regulations and assessment tools to investigate disabled adulthood as a set of arrangements balancing care and autonomy. On the micro level, this study will describe the process of negotiating the relationship between care and autonomy for adults, family members, and staff at an independent living program. On the program level, this study will assess the program design and operation of a novel type of independent living program, one that provides as-needed care to individuals with ID/DD who live in their own apartments. On the institutional level, this study will investigate the influence of government regulations for entitlement programs like Medicaid, SSI/SSDI, and food stamps on the adult lives of people with ID/DD, including their ability to make autonomous decisions and to engage in adult behaviors like employment, marriage, and the activities of daily life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award to Spelman College has potential broader impact in a number of areas and will assist in building its research capacity and enhance the educational and research experiences of underrepresented students.  This study seeks to understand beta-cell death, a process that has been suggested to occur partially as a result of an increase in amylin, a protein that is co-secreted from beta-cells. A broader understanding of the role of amylin and UCP2 will contribute to understanding how cells communicate so that they can maintain a healthy cell status.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to clarify the role of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) in beta-cells, which are cells known for secreting insulin. Although the secretion of amylin is not often discussed when describing beta-cells, amylin has been shown to be co-secreted with insulin. The role of amylin in negatively impacting beta-cell function has recently been described. UCP2 is known for decreasing the number of oxygen radicals resulting from a metabolic process, which suggests that UCP2 may work to keep beta-cells healthy since a high number of oxygen radicals can lead to poor cell function. This project will investigate the influence of UCP2 on amylin's function, thereby affecting the role that amylin plays in beta-cells. In addition, the project examines the influence of UCP2 on amylin in neuronal cells, which are cells that have also been shown to have increased levels of amylin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Poor understanding of how roots respond to stress is an obstacle to understanding plant responses to environmental change. In addition, how quickly roots decompose affects how nutrients are recycled from dead root tissues, which can further influence plant growth. However, current models of root decomposition are based on what is known about the breakdown of aboveground parts of plants, like leaves and stems. Furthermore, little is known about how root chemistry varies with local soil conditions which limits understanding of how plants respond to nutrient poor soils, or how this in turn influences soil nutrient recycling. This research will study how soil conditions and microbes influence root chemistry of important forest tree species in eastern North America. Results of this research will also improve models of root decomposition by incorporating root chemical composition. This project will also provide several benefits to society. It will create workshops for high school students and a summer course and curriculum development materials for K-12 teachers. It will also provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>Fine roots (less than 2mm diameter) have a disproportionately large influence on plant adaptation and key ecosystem processes, yet they remain one of the least understood components of Terrestrial Biosphere Models. Commonly used parameters, such as element ratios, that predict decomposition of aboveground tissues fail to adequately predict the decomposition of fine roots. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that this disconnect is due to the unique chemical construction of roots, which is shaped by their immediate biotic and abiotic soil environments. The PIs propose to investigate the chemical plasticity in fine roots of different tree species developed under different soil resource availabilities and associations with different species of mycorrhizal fungi. The PIs will link observed chemical plasticity to decomposition dynamics of fine roots using decomposition experiments and by utilizing advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques. The PIs propose to develop parameters that incorporate root chemistry to improve predictions of fine-root decomposition. The proposed project would be one of the first attempts to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular-level chemical profile of fine-roots that facilitate plant stress adaptation, and to develop robust parameters to predict fine-root decomposition and soil organic matter formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process improvement that will be facilitated by sensor technology will reduce manufacturing time and cost by 20-40%, improve part quality consistency, and improve molding productivity by 100%. Each percentage point improvement in productivity corresponds to cost savings in excess of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and/or recycling of defective plastic parts.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will enable the team to determine the ideal parameters of a multivariate shrinkage sensor for industrial polymer manufacturing.  The insights gained from at least one hundred customer interviews will drive decisions on the commercial potential of a new multi-mode shrinkage monitoring sensor that will obviate the need for manual inspections and enable fully automatic production by directly measuring molded products as they are made, before the mold opens, so that defectives parts can be automatically diagnoses and recycled.  Through I-Corps, the team will assess current sensor design, its relative value compared to existing sensors and inspection procedures in the polymer manufacturing industry, and facilitate identification of customer segments with a critical unmet need for in-mold shrinkage sensor capability. Further, key learning from the I-Corps process will drive refinement of sensor development with the goal of developing a more commercially relevant sensor and provide industrial connections for sensor testing in the future.

This research benefits society by providing new materials that can improve our quality of life. Dr. Do is also actively involved in outreach activities that integrate his interests in industrial chemistry at the University of Houston (UH). Dr. Do is creating programs that give high school and undergraduate students the opportunity to interact with professional scientists and learn about chemistry in everyday life. Dr. Do excites students about pursuing careers in STEM fields. Dr. Do is also engaging in hands-on laboratory training and mentoring of young chemists to prepare them to become the next generation of scientific leaders. <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Do at the University of Houston (UH) is developing new sustainable routes to access technologically useful polyolefins. This research seeks to eliminate the need to use expensive alpha olefin co-monomers in the preparation of low- and medium-density polyethylene and to overcome the tendency of transition metal catalysts to be inhibited by polar vinyl olefins. Dr. Do's bimetallic catalysts take advantage of metal-metal cooperativity to achieve reactivity patterns that are distinct from those of conventional monometallic catalysts. These studies are being guided by mechanistic investigations using spectroscopic tools to interrogate the nature of observable reaction intermediates and computational methods to evaluate the energy barriers of discrete reaction steps. This work is critical to our understanding of olefin polymerization catalysis and may provide insights into where catalyst design improvements could be made. Dr. Do is also initiating educational outreach plans that will introduce young students to the chemical profession. The objectives of Dr. Do's educational activities are to make learning chemistry accessible to the general public and give chemistry majors at UH the practical skills that they need to be successful in their independent careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 30% (or 120,000) of these unique specimens are housed in two herbaria at the New Mexico State University (NMSU), one of which is the State's oldest herbarium. Together the NMSU herbaria represent the premier plant reference resource for the southern half of New Mexico, adjacent states, and northern Mexico. The goals of the project are to consolidate the NMSU herbaria, modernize their collections data management infrastructure, and update their management procedures, ultimately preserving the collections long-term, while broadening the data accessibility for education, research, and public use. With a multidisciplinary team of botanical researchers and local science educators, a series of academic and outreach initiatives will be implemented to increase literacy in the plant sciences within different sectors of the population. At NMSU, an official Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), researchers will pursue the recruitment and engagement of students, using hands-on experiences aimed at the care, protection and use of herbarium specimens and their associated data. Skills learned will improve participation in further education and training opportunities (e.g., graduate school) in STEM fields, while increasing downstream employment prospects. Through partnership with a local scientific education non-profit organization, the project will develop comprehensive botanical outreach materials to increase awareness and interest in natural history collections, plant biology and biodiversity, and biogeography among at least 1,500 K-12 students in an underserved Hispanic region located in southern New Mexico.<br/><br/>Activities and expected outcomes include: 1) physical preservation, curation, and integration of herbarium specimens into a unified online digital herbarium (e.g., all specimens databased, barcoded, and imaged), 2) update of currently insecure, disparate databases of the herbaria into a single modern natural history collection management system, 3) acquisition of specimen data from a backlog of important uncurated specimens, 4) development of comprehensive botanical outreach and educational kits for local K-12 students, 5) training of undergraduate research assistants, and 6) implementation of professional workshops, and a crowdsourcing online campaign, all specifically tailored to a wide variety of stakeholders (e.g., students via NMSU's Graduate Certificate in Museum Studies, curators of other natural history collections on campus, land managers and owners, researchers, and citizen scientists). The collaborative nature of the project across campus and the region leverages knowledge and expertise in efficient and exciting directions, creating new research and outreach opportunities that make use of these important herbarium collections and their valuable and unique biodiversity information.

Regeneration of the natural bone is an additive advantage over currently used fixative implants. These implants are also a source of secondary infections and fracture, such risks are mitigated with the formation of natural tissues, eliminating the need for surgical recall. The U.S. reports ~7.5 million Emergency Department visits related to craniomaxillofacial (CMF) injuries, at a cost of $55.2 billion annually. The technology proposes a fundamental shift in CMF bone reconstruction, allowing regeneration of craniofacial bone using guided 3D printed osteoconductive scaffolds. This translates to reflecting a soft tissue flap over a defect to allow a laser or image guided analyzer to study the defect volume and contours, after which a robotic extruder deposits the scaffold into the desired area.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project addresses reconstruction of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bone defects caused by trauma, developmental anomalies or benign/malignant tumors. Our technology is transforming CMF reconstruction by 3D printing osteoconductive/inductive scaffolds directly into defects.  Preliminary studies on critical-sized calvarial defects in a rat model demonstrated the regeneration of bone while preserving dural tissue. A methacrylated Gelatin-Laponite nanosilicate bio-ink was utilized to print a mesh-like scaffold for a critical-sized defect in rat calvaria. The in-situ printing in the defects helped maintain the micro-pattern stability of the scaffold and the nano-silicate particle-enhanced bone regeneration.

In practice, representations of large graphs need to be partitioned and stored on a cluster of machines to ensure the desired response time and throughput. Such a classic cross-server partitioning problem has been extensively studied and has been shown to be highly complex. Furthermore, modern deep storage architecture further complicates the problem with the need of ""cross-hierarchy"" partitioning, i.e., placing graphs into different layers of the storage systems. This change makes existing solutions inadequate. This research aims to pursue a holistic approach that exploits both graph structure and workload characteristics to achieve better performance for distributed graph representations in future deep storage architecture.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project includes two synergistic research tasks, together forming a novel graph partitioning solution for deep storage architecture. The first task focuses on an online graph placement algorithm, which could instantly distribute the continuously arriving graph vertices and edges to proper server and specific internal storage layer based on an elaborate heuristic score. Building upon the first task, the second task focuses on adjusting current partitions dynamically according to the workloads. This adjustment is based on a new promotion/demotion algorithm that not only promotes/demotes a single vertex but also changes the priorities of its neighbors according to the Matthew Effect.<br/><br/>With the increasing importance of large graph structures and the emergence of new storage technologies, existing graph storage systems experience significant challenges towards graph partitioning. This research effort aims towards building highly efficient distributed graph storage systems in future storage architecture. In addition, this project integrates the research activities with education and outreach efforts to train broadly inclusive and globally competitive science workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, mimicking the molecules of life (one of the NSF ""Grand Challenges"" for 21st century science) presents an opportunity to controllably harness this power to benefit humanity. Currently, many medicines are adaptations of molecules produced by living organisms. By constructing artificial analogs of the enzymes that Nature uses to build molecules, new potential medicines may be discovered. In this project, Dr. Gorske is developing enzyme mimics to accomplish this goal. The design of these enzyme mimics is allowing undergraduates to construct them with minimal training. This is enabling students to gain experience conducting meaningful research prior to choosing a major. Such early access to these research experiences, which include both summer research internships and course-related laboratories, is stimulating interest in pursuing science as a career. Especially, underprepared and underrepresented students and groups are being exposed to STEM fields. In the process, students are contributing directly to the development of new technology for facilitating the discovery of urgently needed medicines.<br/><br/><br/>With support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Gorske of Bowdoin College is developing biomimetic catalysts for nucleophilic trifluoromethylations that deliver enantiopure alpha-trifluoromethyl alcohol and beta-trifluoromethyl carbonyl subunits for construction of new biological probes and medicines. These studies are elucidating the structural design parameters of peptidomimetic catalysts that maintain their competency in polar solvents and facilitate nucleophilic trifluoromethylation reactions. In turn, the results of these investigations are informing iterative cycles of catalyst design and structure-activity relationship analysis that aim to produce highly enantio- and regio-selective nucleophilic trifluoromethylation catalysts with wide substrate scope. More broadly, a new class of structured catalyst scaffolds designed to be generally applicable to a wide range of reactions is being realized, while simultaneously providing early but authentic research experiences for undergraduates. These experiences are specifically designed to enhance learning outcomes and enthusiasm for pursuit of STEM careers, especially among members of underrepresented groups in STEM fields that are identified through partnerships with both internal and local external organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will examine the key inter-relationships between airflow, surface properties, changes in sand transport and bedform shape that lie behind a meaningful understanding of how nascent dunes emerge. The project will promote international collaboration among the United States, the United Kingdom, and Namibia. It will generate public educational materials about desert landscapes and geomorphology, foster partnerships with National Parks in both the United States and Namibia, and provide quality scientific training and field experience to students.<br/><br/>Field monitoring of surface properties and bedform change at high resolution will be performed at three carefully chosen locations of known dune development. Complementary laboratory experiments will enable accurate characterization of flow very close to the 3D surface of modelled dunes that, together with the field datasets, will drive a computer model to test the sensitivity of dune initiation and growth to different controls in a range of environmental conditions in deserts, coasts and on other planets. In concert, this approach represents an opportunity to overcome an enduring plateau for understanding the origins of one of the major terrestrial landform systems. The team will work with staff at Great Sand Dunes National Park in the United States and the Namib-Naukluft National Park in Namibia to create broadly accessible public engagement materials. At a dedicated impact workshop in Gobabeb, Namibia, the team will showcase to interested local Namibian and international delegates the project findings and how these findings could be used to influence societal and economic issues.

The Campanian Ignimbrite, which erupted from the Campi Flegrei near Naples, Italy, 40,000 years ago, is the deposit from one of the youngest truly large pyroclastic density currents on Earth. The currents reached over 80 km from the vent and devastated an area currently occupied by more than 4 million people. Traditional models for these currents assume they are tens to perhaps 100 meters thick, but our past work shows the Campanian current moved as a kilometer-thick flow across the landscape, overtopping ridges 1.5 times that height.  This great mobility makes this sort of ""expanded"" pyroclastic density current much more hazardous and the damage less predictable. This dilute current required an enormous amount of gas, more than can be explained by the amount dissolved in the magma prior to eruption.  Two other possible sources are the entrainment of air and the involvement of water from a hot hydrothermal system within the volcano. This project will determine the amounts of gas from the magma, air, and hydrothermal system involved in the current. This information will be used to make better predictions of which volcanoes might produce highly mobile currents and design hazards maps that take this mobility into account. Two undergraduate students, two graduate students, a post-doctoral researcher, and a professor will work on this project at Northern Arizona University and a graduate student and a professor will work at Oxford University. Three Italian researchers will also collaborate in this project. The results may be used for hazards assessments and response plans, including for the US Naval Support Activity in Naples.<br/><br/>A recent thermal magnetization study of the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) found the temperature of emplacement was above 580 oC even at 80 km from the vent. This limits how much air could have been incorporated, but, to calculate precise quantities, a better knowledge of the magmatic temperature and whether other sources of gas, such as magmatic gas and hydrothermal fluids, were significant, is needed. This project will include 1) field investigations to better characterize the CI stratigraphy and link distal and proximal deposits and define the relative timing of volcanic events; 2) complete volatile analysis (H2O, CO2, S, F and Cl) of melt inclusions and apatite microphenocrysts via Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ion probe, and electron microprobe. Back-calculating volatile concentrations during open-system degassing is a new technique that should reveal much about the Campanian Ignimbrite magma history; and 3) a study of the glass transition temperature at varying strain rates and residual water contents to better define the emplacement temperature. Current models and interpretations of datasets may need to be modified to include the potential role of hydrothermal fluids in ""supercharging"" an eruption, as hydrothermal water does not appear in many petrologic measurements of gases. A model for explosive eruptions that includes the potential contribution of erupted hydrothermal systems will help define volcanic hazards more accurately and may elucidate a possible cause for paroxysmal pyroclastic density current-producing eruptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will utilize both newly developed and well-established geochemical approaches to develop a detailed history of oxygen levels in the oceans during this time interval. It is important to understand the history of oxygen concentrations in ancient oceans because changes in oxygen levels impact marine life, critical biogeochemical processes in the oceans and atmosphere, and the formation and preservation of economic hydrocarbon and mineral deposits.

Our lack of understanding of clouds, particularly those that are mixed in phase, limits our ability to understand precipitation, the atmosphere chemistry and climate. This project will determine the particles on which the droplets and ice crystals in mixed phase clouds form by deploying a new inlet and both warm and cold cloud chambers at Storm Peak Laboratory. Storm Peak is a high altitude site located in the Rocky Mountains in north-central Colorado that is among only a handful of sites worldwide that offers scientific laboratories where mixed phase clouds exist for long time periods. Using this new inlet, the research team will carry out two-season long observational studies of droplet and ice crystals within mixed phase clouds. This project will allow a resolution of the question of which atmospheric particles make droplets, which make ice crystals, and which do not effectively make either.<br/><br/>A graduate student will work on this project full time, thereby being trained in this important area of atmospheric science. A post-doctoral fellow will also work on this project part-time, increasing their research experience in this area. The collected data will be archived and presented to the atmospheric sciences community. This will include both papers and presentations, with a focus on providing data to help improve models that include precipitation, climate and air quality.

The results of the project will be shared globally as well as with local communities and National Parks officials through workshops, talks and field visits. <br/><br/>University at Albany-SUNY doctoral student, Yajaira Nez-Corts, supervised by Dr. Robert Rosenswig, will investigate how the development of economic and political power had an effect on household economies from all segments of the social hierarchy. During AD 800-1500, the appearance of monumental centers in Costa Rica indicates a reorganization of social, political and economic relationships. Such changes coincide with an amplification of interregional exchange and chiefly interaction for Central Costa Rican polities. These large-scale developments are best measured by their impacts in all levels of society, but especially by their impact on the smallest and remote residential units. This study will evaluate previously held assumptions about the relationship between elite power and control of resources and valuable objects by studying household economic differentiation, activity organization, and access to exchange networks at Lomas Entierros site. The researchers will analyze domestic assemblages in combination with house architecture in order to characterize manifestations of wealth, power, and material culture usage. Data from house structures located in the main core of the site and humbler edifices on its periphery will provide contrastive examples from higher and lower social status contexts. This project also incorporates LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data to understand the settlement system and spatial organization of the site. The results will contribute to the debate about sources of political and economic power and will inform anthropological models on political and household organization in the ancient past.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While hosts have developed restriction factors that limit viral replication in the infected cells, some viruses have acquired their own unique accessory proteins that could counteract the host restriction factors. Recent reports have demonstrated that one accessory protein in a mouse gammaretrovirus can facilitate its replication by counteracting two host restriction factors through unknown mechanisms, and it will be a powerful tool to clarify novel mechanisms in host-viral interactions. The long-term goal of this project is to clarify the detailed mechanisms of host-virus interactions, and determine how viral accessory proteins regulate viral replication at cellular and organismal levels. The proposal aims to identify and characterize new viral proteins that can counteract host factors, clarify how the retroviral proteins interact with the host factors, and describe host-virus co-evolution through computational analysis. The expected outcomes will advance knowledge on fundamental aspects of innate-immunity and host-virus co-evolution, and thus will substantially enhance understanding and advance fundamental knowledge in genetics, virology and cell biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern settings, however, such as the Internet of Things and machine-to-machine communication, require devices to communicate short messages with very small delays while maintaining a high degree of reliability. This conjures up a long-standing challenge in coding theory: design low-complexity channel codes that provide high reliability and low latency. This project aims to develop error-correcting technologies well-suited to such demands of the evolving information infrastructure.<br/><br/>This research will investigate two rich classes of code-designs: stream codes and Reed-Muller codes. Stream codes, recently proposed by the investigator and co-authors, combine the powerful features of convolutional encoding and iterative decoding, while Reed-Muller codes are classic code designs that have recently been shown to achieve capacity in erasure channels. Preliminary studies suggest that both stream and Reed-Muller codes have remarkable performance at short lengths, but using highly complex decoders, posing the issue of whether computationally efficient decoder may be found. This project focuses on developing novel algorithmic and analytical frameworks aiming to: (i) design efficient decoding algorithms; (ii) develop new theoretical frameworks for the analysis of the proposed algorithms; and (iii) establish fundamental length-rate-complexity trade-offs in the non-asymptotic regime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.<br/><br/>	The major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time. This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes.A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes.

One aspect of biodiversity that directly impacts human health is its importance in mitigating risk of disease transmission from wildlife.  A prominent theory in ecology is that greater diversity of species reduces the risk of disease transmission, through an effect called dilution. Evidence for the dilution effect has been found in several disease systems, including Lyme disease.  Greater species diversity of small mammals that serve as hosts for Lyme disease result in less transmission of the disease.  However, even in this well-studied system, there is little research on the importance of genetic variation within the Lyme disease pathogen. This project focuses on the Lyme disease system, to address a critical question in disease ecology: how does species diversity of hosts influence pathogen genetic diversity and what does the culmination of these interactions mean for disease risk? This project also will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students, will develop active learning focused courses on disease ecology, and will engage the public in tick-borne disease biology through citizen science opportunities. This research has clear public health implications as Lyme disease is the most reported tick transmitted disease in the United States<br/><br/>This study will incorporate empirical field studies and mathematical modeling to characterize and predict the relationship between host diversity and pathogen genetic diversity in the Lyme disease system in the western United States.

The first challenge addressed by this project is to account for uncertainty in the position and velocity of each agent. This uncertainty can be caused by inaccurate measurements or imperfect communications. To capture uncertainty, this project uses probability distributions to quantify the collective behavior of all the agents. This is called the macroscopic description of the network. The second challenge addressed by this project is to find control laws that achieve a desired macroscopic behavior of the network, using only distributed algorithms and local information. That is, the project will find rules by which each agent will control its own velocity, based only on knowledge of a few neighboring agents, but in such a way that a desired macroscopic probability distribution is obtained. The local dynamic behavior of the individual agents is called the microscopic description of the network, and the goal of this project is to find rules for microscopic behavior that give rise to a desired macroscopic result. An example is the control of a large group of autonomous mobile robots that pick up and deliver packages across a wide geographic region. The macroscopic goal is that, for each point in the region, the probability density of a delivery robot being available should match the probability density that a package needs to be picked up. For large numbers of robots, it is impractical to achieve this macroscopic goal by controlling every individual robot from a single command center. Instead, to avoid prohibitive requirements for communication bandwidth, information storage, and data processing, the computational task should be distributed among the individual robots -- however, the individual robots can only share data with a few nearby units. The challenge addressed by this project is for the individual robots to plan their movements based only on this limited local exchange, in such a way that the entire network of robots spreads out across the delivery region in a pattern mirroring the customer demand. This project advances the national prosperity and helps to secure the national defense by improving the ability to control large networks of mobile robots for commercial applications such as package delivery, or security applications such as surveillance and interdiction.<br/><br/>The macroscopic deployment problem is approached in three steps. The first step is to define a single fictitious agent that captures the macroscopic state of the multi-agent network. This is done by choosing the mean and the covariance of the individual states of all the constituent agents of the network to be the statistical quantities that determine the probability distribution of the state of the representative agent. Tools from stochastic optimal control theory are then applied to steer the network towards areas of high importance. The second step is to solve the microscopic deployment problem for the constituent agents of the network, by assigning tasks to different agents based on their suitability to accomplish these tasks. The proposed solution approach is based on a divide-and-conquer scheme that is centered around a special class of Voronoi-like spatial partitions (sub-divisions of the workspace of the multi-agent network). The expected outcomes of this effort will include 1) stochastic control algorithms for the solution of the macroscopic control problem, 2) partitioning algorithms for the computation of Voronoi-like subdivisions of the network's workspace, 3) distributed algorithms for the solution of the microscopic control problem that leverage the Voronoi-like partitions and Lloyd's algorithm. The third and final step is to validate the proposed algorithms via a set of experimental demonstrations that will take place at the facilities for robotics research at the PI's home department.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prescriptive analysis helps competing entities in optimizing their scheduling and facility location decisions. Predictive analysis helps central authorities (e.g., government and regulators) in optimizing system efficiency and equity through infrastructure investments, incentives creation, and regulations. Under this project's integrated vision for research and education, the research program directly informs the educational program. The educational program includes the development and dissemination of an active learning module for high-school mathematics focused on underrepresented minority students; an undergraduate research internship program for underprepared prospective engineering students; and undergraduate and graduate course development in OR and game theory. These educational activities contribute toward strengthening and diversifying the pipeline of researchers and practitioners skilled in OR and analytics, in turn fostering the long-term growth of the very disciplines which the research program builds upon. Educational and outreach activities also focus on highlighting the economic, social and political complexities associated with planning and operations of civil infrastructure systems.<br/><br/>Scheduling and facility location problems (together called as spatio-temporal location problems) share similar underlying mathematical structures that allow researchers to analyze them jointly. However, under dynamic pricing, spatio-temporal location decisions become interdependent with pricing decisions which are made at a later stage through complex interactions between competing service providers and their customers. This necessitates the use of two-stage game theoretic models. This project develops a comprehensive framework that relies on combining and mutually reinforcing mathematical, computational and empirical insights. The key innovations are the tight interplay between mathematical, computational and empirical ideas, a holistic approach that enables the optimal tradeoff between modeling precision and solution tractability, and a comprehensive testbed comprising large-scale real-world networks from aviation, railways, transit, hotels and gasoline distribution. The project not only makes deep contributions to the theoretical and applied research in competitive transportation scheduling, but also triggers further exploration enabling similar future contributions to the competitive facility location theory and applications. Additionally, this general approach could be usefully employed in other, otherwise intractable, applications of multi-stage game theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project combines physics-based modeling of images and shapes, with the versatility of robust optimization and deep learning, to recover 3D shape and semantic information. The work establishes connections between computer vision, machine learning, computer graphics and perception. Vision is a powerful sensing modality since images encode rich information about shape and semantics. However, image formation is a physical phenomenon that often includes complex factors like shape deformations, occlusions, material properties and participating media. Consequently, practical deployment of autonomous or intelligent vision-based systems requires robustness to the effects of diverse physical factors. Such effects may be inverted by modeling the image formation process, but hand-crafted features and hard-coded rules face limitations for data inconsistent with the model. Recent advances in deep learning have led to impressive performances, but generalization of a purely data-driven approach to handle such complex effects is expensive. To address these challenges, this project develops technologies of handling the diversity of real-world images through incorporation of physical models of image formation within deep learning frameworks. The project creates a cross-disciplinary educational program in vision, graphics, learning and perception through coursework that draws connections across wide areas such as physically-based modeling, deep learning, 3D reconstruction and semantic understanding. The program also develops K-12 educative modules that provide experiential insight into novel technologies such as virtual reality or self-driving, with a focus on outreach to students from under-represented backgrounds.<br/><br/>This research lays the foundations for physically-motivated learning of 3D shape and semantics, with benefits such as higher accuracy, better generalization or greater ease of training. It develops theoretical frameworks that relate unknown material behavior to 3D shape, which allows robust optimization frameworks and convolutional neural network architectures for material-invariant shape estimation. It designs novel network structures that model complex transformations, to generalize recovery of shape or semantics across non-rigid and articulated deformations, or distortions due to refraction and participating media. Further, it uses physical models of appearance or motion to bridge the domain gap between simulations and real images, leading to weakly supervised frameworks that mitigate the expense of data annotation. These advances enable novel applications for light field imaging, augmented reality, self-driving in challenging weather, or underwater robotic exploration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-term goal of this public investment of money and trust is to improve our nation's health, economy, and social policies. In order to determine which researchers and projects will receive funding, grant agencies employ a process of peer review in which expert researchers evaluate the merits of submitted proposals. This longstanding social technology -- of relying on expert evaluation to inform determinations of merit -- empowers grant agencies to make funding decisions based on a fuller understanding of the social and scientific excellence of each project. As such, it is critical for grant agencies to employ rigorous and fair peer review processes in order to recruit, retain, and fund the best minds. This project builds on a growing scientific literature that studies how grant peer review works with an eye towards identifying ways of improving its effectiveness. More specifically, grant proposal review procedures commonly require reviewers to score applications along multiple dimensions -- for example, a proposal's approach, innovation, versus significance -- as an intermediate step in determining the proposal's overall score. When procedures are left unspecified for how reviewers should combine individual scores (along multiple dimensions) into overall scores, evaluators might arrive at overall scores in ways that subtly advantage and disadvantage grant proposals submitted by applicants from different social groups. Any such difference is what we call commensuration bias. This research identifies and evaluates approaches for measuring commensuration bias by analyzing peer review data from applications submitted to an ongoing intramural collaborative biomedical research program that utilized the independent peer review services of the American Institute of Biological Sciences. This project aims to offer concrete, efficient policies that ensure fair review for any grant agency that requires scoring of applications along multiple criteria, including the National Institutes of Health, which is the world's largest public funder of biomedical research in the world.<br/><br/>There is currently no established methodology for detecting commensuration bias. The availability of criteria and overall scores from individual reviewers makes it possible to examine how individual reviewers evaluate multiple criteria simultaneously and how they unconsciously combine criteria scores to arrive at overall scores. In addition to hierarchical linear models that assume overall application score is an additive function of criteria scores, this study uses Bayesian regression trees to model non-linear decision processes and multivariate analyses to model the distribution of criteria scores. This range of statistical approaches allows this study to avoid making strong assumptions about the nature of commensuration and provides tools needed to inform two main types of potential policy recommendations: (a) those that focus on the restructuring or modification of programmatic review procedures as a whole and (b) those that focus on the monitoring of unusual peer review scores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flowering plants dominate the majority of terrestrial ecosystems and most depend on animal pollinators to complete their lifecycle. Biologists hypothesize that the interaction with pollinators ultimately increases the number of flowering plants over time. However, important details are lacking about how this might be happening. Flower color, shape, and size are widely understood to reflect adaptation to pollinators. Yet, emerging evidence indicates that microscopic changes in floral features may also have large effects in driving new species to evolve. This project will investigate how biochemical, microscopic and macroscopic traits of flowers vary with different animal pollinators in the water-willow genus, Justicia. Researchers will determine the evolutionary relationships among Justicia species native to North, Central and South America to analyze trait data, including field-based observations of pollinator behavior. The project will train high school, undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups and community college students, as well as a post-doctoral research associate. Researchers will provide outreach to the public about the ecological and economic importance of pollination biology through educational exhibits at the University of Colorado Boulder Museum of Natural History and Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that variation in morphological traits intimately involved with the reproductive success of flowering plants are inter-correlated and are associated with functional groups of animal visitors. Researchers will investigate the evolutionary history of New World Justicia (Acanthaceae; the Acanthus family), whose ca. 400 species show remarkable diversity in micro-morphological floral traits essential to reproduction, including anthers, pollen and stigmas, and support a range of vertebrate and invertebrate pollinators. Outcomes of the research will include a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for New World Justicia species based on nuclear genomic data, a quantitative analysis of macro- and micro-morphological variation in relationship to pollinator type, and improved taxonomic circumscriptions for this widespread yet poorly characterized lineage. Research will facilitate the discovery and description of species new to science, build herbarium research collections, and expand ethological information about pollinating animals. Targeted fieldwork in five Neotropical countries will strengthen international collaborations among US and Latin American scientists and facilitate investigation of this species-rich lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team has developed a nitinol-based foot orthoses. Compared to the current foot orthoses that are made of nonmetallic materials, the nitinol-based foot orthoses can provide enhanced functional capabilities including optimized energy dissipation capacity, improved comfort, long functional life, and lightweight. The life expectancy of the nitinol orthoses is twice as long as that of the plastic orthoses. The foot orthotic insoles market is currently estimated to be worth $2.6B and will grow to $3.7B by 2021. Thus, commercialization and application of the proposed foot orthoses will greatly impact the footwear industry. This project is the beginning of a new science and technology based company that will enhance the technology infrastructure and upon completion provide jobs for the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce of the state of Mississippi.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of the novel foot orthoses previously developed by the team. The foot orthoses are made of nitinol using additive manufacturing methods. Their cellular structure generated during the additive manufacturing process can absorb more shock energy from every step a customer takes, therefore offering adjustable cushioning and comfort to the customer. Due to the shape-memory property and superelasticity of nitinol, the designed foot orthoses are easier to deflect under human body-support interaction forces, and can withstand corrosive environments and fatigue loading conditions. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunities of the developed foot orthoses to gain a clear identification of market of the technology, as well as a deeper insight into the needs of potential customers.

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation.  Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes.  More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate.  Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers.  Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign includes several education and outreach activities including support for undergraduates to participate in fieldwork and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education.  In addition, the project builds international scientific collaboration through partnerships with researchers in Costa Rica and Mexico. The project also supports fieldwork participation by three graduate students, and outreach to local students is conducted through short courses at the University of Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The eight week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  The radar determines cloud properties such as the relative abundance of ice particles versus liquid droplets, and uses Doppler shift to measure updraft and downdraft speeds in clouds.  The aircraft sampling is augmented by observations collected at ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>The specific focus of this project is easterly waves, which play a dominant role in the variability of tropical convection and serve as precursors for hurricane formation.  Easterly waves in the southwestern Caribbean are generally thought to propagate into the region from West Africa.  But it is not clear whether easterly waves in the eastern Pacific originate locally or reintensify after crossing Central America from the Caribbean.  Some studies suggest that formation or reintensification occurs through instabilities of strong low-level jets which occur where winds are funneled through gaps in the Central American mountains.  Generation and intensification could also happen through interaction with convection, either over Central America or off the Pacific coast of Colombia, regions where a strong diurnal cycle produces episodes of intense convection and rainfall.<br/><br/>The role of jet stream instabilities in generating or reinvigorating easterly waves is examined using data from meteorological analyses produced using observations from the OTREC campaign (provided by collaborators at ECMWF).  The interaction of easterly waves with convection over Central America is examined using satellite data and surface meteorology stations in Costa Rica. These include GPS receivers already deployed as part of the COCONet network (see EAR-1042906), which record the total precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere.  These assets are augmented with an additional 10 GPS ground stations and 10 surface weather stations, as well as two weather balloon launching stations. A key issue to be examined with the surface stations is the timing of the maxima in precipitable water vapor and precipitation, as the lag between the two (i.e. whether precipitation peaks first or precipitable water peaks first) provides valuable information regarding the organization and vertical structure of convection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The properties of porous materials are completely different from those of non-porous solids, as the pores give both structure and function. For example, chemical mixtures flowing through a porous solid may begin to separate, as one component of the mixture may act more strongly with the surface of the pore. This principle is the basis for the use of porous materials as mass separating agents, and the application of nearly unlimited materials as adsorbents and membranes. Today a number of new applications for porous materials are emerging, including as electrodes in the electrical energy storage systems, batteries, supercapacitors, and advanced membranes for water desalinization that have molecular-level specificity for solutes. Advanced characterization techniques will continue to catalyze these new developments, as these techniques increase our understanding of molecular interactions with pores, which is a necessary aspect of creating new paradigms for material design for chemical and biological separations.<br/><br/>This award supports participation of graduate students, post-doctoral research associates, and untenured junior faculty, for travel to the 8th International Workshop on Characterization of Porous Materials in Delray Reach Florida, USA, on May 6-9, 2018. In this interdisciplinary workshop, the latest developments relevant to the characterization of porous materials will be presented by participants from academia, government, and industry. Multiscale characterization and modeling is the theme of the meeting, as indicated by the sub-title: ""From Angstroms to Millimeters"". As this area undergoes a Renaissance, applying ever more complex characterization techniques to new problems, the advanced characterization is enabling the design of new materials with molecular-level specificity combined with process-level optimization. These advances will help to commercialize new materials to help reduce the parasitic energy losses from chemical separations in the production of commodity chemicals, processes which account for over 10% of the worlds energy consumption.

Symptoms and progression of JIA vary greatly between individuals, and there are many possible treatment options depending on the extent of disease. However, diagnosing JIA on a patient-by-patient basis is difficult because reliable tools for assessing the condition do not yet exist, and treatment is often a trial-and-error process. This project will focus on developing wearable joint health-sensing systems that continuously provide data on joint condition, inside and out of the clinic. The PI will focus on advancing the ability to measure and analyze sounds produced by joints during movement. The study will test the hypothesis that joint sounds decrease as joint health improves with therapy. Sounds collected with the wearable devices will be analyzed and compared with patients' joint health to understand possible relationships that can be used to improve diagnostic capabilities. Research and education are integrated through the incorporation of undergraduate research teams in the sensing brace design process and incorporating de-identified dataset analysis in courses at Georgia Institute of Technology. Additionally, the PI will host K-12 teachers in his lab to develop science and engineering modules to take back their classrooms.<br/><br/>Dr. Inan's long-term career goal is to fundamentally advance knowledge in the field of wearable joint health sensing and, thereby, enable personalized therapies and devices for patients with joint disorders, such as arthritis. Toward this goal, Dr. Inan's research objectives are to: (1) design and implement a sensing brace capable of accurately measuring the sounds of the joints in the clinic and at home; (2) investigate algorithms for quantifying differences between the characteristics of joint sounds of patients with JIA and healthy controls; and (3) conduct a feasibility study in patients with JIA by sending the sensing brace home and evaluating the changes in joint sound characteristics measured throughout treatment. The PI's preliminary data suggests that joint sounds can potentially serve as a physiological biomarker for patients with arthritis. The project will first develop a wearable heterogenous sensor array for acoustical sensing with sufficient battery life. Experiments will collect joint sound data from JIA-affected and healthy patients. Graph mining algorithms will be applied to analyze the high-dimensional joint acoustical emissions data and correlate the data with joint health. At project completion, Dr. Inan will have developed a new physiological measurement tool for diagnosing and treating JIA patients based on their specific symptoms and responses to treatment, ultimately improving their quality of life and minimizing permanent joint damage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will enhance current approaches to disease detection and monitoring in remote and low-resource settings by rapid and sensitive detection of infectious agents and automated data-logging. The commercial impact of the detection system leverages current smartphone capability in concert with advances in imaging, microfluidics, and enhanced computation to deliver detection of multiple important human pathogens all within a portable format.  Further, widespread user experience with smartphone technologies mitigates the need for additional training steps and lowers barriers to adoption. This project will support extensive customer discovery with field workers, healthcare community workers, clinicians, nurses, and procurement officials within governmental and aid organizations. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project integrates the smartphone with external hardware and disposable microfluidic chips to enable a portable pathogen detection platform. The intellectual merit of the project stems from the implementation of newly developed particle diffusometry technology, an optical-based method that quantifies the Brownian motion of particles within a fluid. Combining particle diffusometry with nucleic acid-based DNA amplification methods that are standard for point-of-care device industry allows for order of magnitude increases in the sensitivity of pathogen detection. In the presence of pathogens, DNA amplification occurs and causes a decrease in the motion of particles in the sample solution that is imaged by the smartphone camera/external hardware microscope lens system. A smartphone application performs all of the quantitative computation, providing both detection results and immediately logging the data. Data can be readily pushed to the cloud where organizations can track detection events in real-time. Therefore, this I-Corps project will explore the market potential for smartphone-based pathogen detection in remote and low-resource settings and for applications where disease surveillance and monitoring is of great utility.

Persistent environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspection, and security surveillance are essential for large indoor facilities to provide safety and comfort. Existing aerial sensing solutions are mainly for outdoor applications. They are not suitable for human-occupied indoor environments due to short flight duration, disturbing noise level, and safety concerns. The proposed technology is based on specially designed robotic blimps that offer long flight duration, quiet sound profile, and safety for collision. The technology can potentially fill the market vacancy for indoor aerial sensing. In addition to indoor aerial sensing, the robotic blimps can also be marketed as a research and teaching tool for researchers, teachers, students, and hobbyists who are interested in performing indoor experiments on human friendly flying robots. The robotic blimps may also be extended to serve as companion robots for the elderly, or as intelligent toys for children. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of an aerial sensing solution that is developed around a robotic blimp. The blimp is cushioned with Helium-filled envelope, and can fly safely among people. Buoyancy from the Helium gas helps reduce the power consumption of the blimp, enabling it to operate quietly for hours. Unique aerodynamic shape of the blimp ensures high maneuverability in indoor environments. The blimp represents an integration of research efforts in mechatronic design, mobile sensor networks, and control systems. The blimps have been successfully employed to support a broad spectrum of research supported by NSF grants, including indoor wind field mapping, swarming control, and human-robot interactions. The basic functionalities of the blimp are stable and reliable, ready to be transitioned into the commercialization stage. Through this I-Corps program, the team will develop better understanding of market scale, customer needs, and commercialization feasibility of the invention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Crystal growth can be controlled to desired size, shape, and structure by fine tuning of the local environment in which nucleation takes place at the molecular level.  The goal of this project is to understand crystal nucleation in liquids confined by soft hydrogel matrices. The confinement geometry and chemistry within the matrices may alter nucleation pathways and resulting crystallization. Advanced molecular simulation techniques will be used to discover the mechanisms by which soft hydrogel matrices influence crystal nucleation. The educational part of this project includes the development of a new short course and outreach activities to K-12 students in the Houston area.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis will be tested by deploying rare-event molecular simulation techniques to address three specific aims: (1) to elucidate the mechanisms by which soft hydrogel matrices influence ice nucleation thermodynamics; (2) to identify the effects of soft confinement on the crystallization kinetics of water in hydrogels; (3) to probe the pathways for calcium carbonate precipitation in polymer brushes with tunable architectures. Free energy methods will be used to compute nucleation barriers and identify metastable intermediates, while path sampling algorithms will be employed to characterize crystallization kinetics and mechanisms. This combination of techniques will reveal the effects of matrix properties (density, surface chemistry, and morphology) on nucleation and thereby transform understanding of the physical processes controlling crystallization in soft matrices.  A course focusing on reproducibility in science will be developed, The Art of Reproducible Science, and will be taught to graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Houston and broadly disseminated through online video tutorials.

One surprising aspect of civil war is the degree to which economic and social life endures in the face of interminable dislocation and turmoil.  The informal financial system under study has endured and even expanded in the face of war, even as formal institutions have mostly broken down.  This research will explore how the system operates and how it has shaped the dynamics of the conflict.  The project will build knowledge on the internal dynamics and drivers of civil wars, which will help to inform the development of actionable policies aimed at their mitigation, prevention, and termination.  Its conclusions will be of relevance to a range of policymakers and non-governmental organizations interested in the micro-dynamics of civil conflict, including how everyday civilians experience and manage the realities of war.<br/><br/>This project will employ ethnographic research in two sites neighboring the war zone to illuminate this financial system, an unregulated system based on networks of brokers who send and receive cash on behalf of their customers, including refugees, humanitarian organization, businessmen, and smugglers, among others.

What constitutes the innovation capital of the economy? By addressing these questions from a novel perspective, this research will advance our knowledge about some of the most important issues that relate to national prosperity and welfare. The investigator also identifies a new source of market failure that is very likely to attract future research in this area.<br/> <br/>This research contains three projects. The first is concerned with where innovation resources go, how they are allocated across different R&D areas. The theory developed shows that the market allocates excessive innovation resources to high return areas relative to the social optima, as appeared to be the case in the dot.com boom. The source of the inefficiency is the lack of property rights on open problems that combined with R&D resources, give rise to innovations. It is a novel contribution of this project to recognize this source of inefficiency, and examine the specific channels and its potential magnitude. The second project is concerned with the incentives to innovate versus imitate and the interaction of the two forces in driving growth. Intellectual property rights affect the way in which innovators and imitators split the surplus created by knowledge transfer. This project further examines the impact on long run growth and welfare. The third project examines quantitatively the role of firms vis-a-vis inventors as sources of innovation and the properties of the match between the two.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is critical to understand these patterns to explain the very low presence of female inventors in today's innovation economy. This problem holds significant implications for the inclusive growth of economies. To better understand the gap, this project examines the differences in the regional context where female and male inventors operate. While prior work has explored the role of location (e.g. agglomerations of firms) on innovation, little is known about the role of location on gender-based inventor activity. The goal of this project is to fill this hole by examining key questions such as: Where are female inventors located? What locations and fields have a higher relative presence of FIs (i.e., higher inclusivity)? Within given regions what types of organizations are more inclusive? Do regional industry clusters support higher rates of FIs? How do female versus male inventors source knowledge inside their organizations and in the external environment? To answer these questions, the research develops new indicators on the geography of inventors and their patents by gender. The mapping of inventors is extended to European Union countries to aid comparability in FI inclusivity across countries, and inform policies to promote gender equality. The project also develops an inventor mapping tool that provides interactive maps and visualizations that help policy makers, firms, and researchers to understand variation across regions in the participation and performance of inventors by gender. In this way, this project can inform the design of policy initiatives (e.g., programs to mobilize inventors) to influence locational attributes and firm practices that could reduce the inventor gender gap and, ultimately, reduce the inefficiencies in the match between science and technology skills and innovation.<br/><br/>To address our core questions regarding the gender gap, this project develops new statistics on female inventor inclusivity (e.g., percent of inventors that are women and the percent of patents attributed to women) at the organization, field (industry cluster and technology class), and regional levels since 2000 onwards. These inclusivity indicators, together with data on STEM education and occupations, will identify what locational and organizational attributes are associated with female participation. Beyond detailed descriptive analysis and visualizations, the new data is used to assess a variety of explanations for the gender gap in patenting. First, women are not selecting STEM-based skills that are compatible with participation in patenting. Two, women in STEM are under-represented in patent-intensive fields and organizations. Third, women are more geographically constrained than men (e.g., due to lower income or family obligations), and so, they could benefit specially from being in locations and organizations where is easier to access knowledge and collaborate with nearby inventors. Overall, this work offers important policy and managerial advice to improve the inclusivity and performance of the innovation economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cryoplanation terraces are large upland landform features that give the impression of gigantic staircases, found in periglacial, or cold but nonglacial environments.  Although these elevated bedrock terraces have been identified and discussed in scientific literature for more than a century, debate continues about the nature of the processes responsible for their formation.  Development rates, calculated from dates of rock exposure across terrace treads, will be used to test one of the more prominent hypotheses advanced in the literature.  This hypothesis states that these terraces are formed through intensified erosion associated with snowbanks that last well into the summer months.  Recent methodological developments in geochemistry, specifically the method known as cosmogenic nuclide dating, will provide the infusion of contemporary technology necessary to make progress on this long-standing scientific issue, and has the potential to make transformative advances in the understanding of landscape development in periglacial regions.  Results from this research will be shared with the U.S. National Park Service and used to enhance park management as well as the experiences of park visitors through development of interpretive displays and trail guides in several national parks and monuments.  Further, the project will enable a graduate student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>The great antiquity of cryoplanation terraces makes terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides the most appropriate dating method for determining their age and rates of development.  Rock samples for cosmogenic nuclide dating were collected from two locations in the interior of Alaska using a transect-based sampling strategy across individual terrace treads.  Dating the exposure of the clastic rocks (clasts) will facilitate calculation of erosion rates for individual terraces, and can be compared to known erosion rates at existing late-lying snowbanks.  The PIs hypothesize that: (a) calculated development rates will be comparable with those of measured snowbank erosion; (b) exposure dates for individual rock clasts will coincide with Quaternary cold intervals; and (c) terrace treads are time-transgressive surfaces with the exposure age of clasts increasing toward the outer edge of terraces.  The landforms in this region where the rocks for this analysis were collected are representative of those in the much larger domain of unglaciated landscapes of the Northern Hemisphere.  Therefore, the methodologic and analytic approach adopted for this project are potentially applicable throughout this vast region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Award supports fundamental research that will investigate how EM waves exert forces inside ceramic materials, potentially enabling the three-dimensional (3D) printing of ceramics. These 3D printed ceramic parts will find use in various areas including sustainable infrastructure, transportation, clean energy, water management, aerospace, and healthcare. Such technological advances in manufacturing advanced materials using EM waves will lead to a smaller energy footprint compared to conventional methods and as such can provide significant savings in energy use in the manufacture of high-strength materials. This research requires linking together advances in multiple disciplines such as electrical and computer engineering, electromagnetics, materials science, mechanical, and chemical engineering. Accordingly, an integrated research and education plan using game-based technology enhanced learning will allow students to explore this multidisciplinary area through hands-on training and visualization of materials processing.  Popular builder's games are well equipped for teaching students how building (processing) can change the way materials assemble (structure) and lead to differences in properties such as mechanical behavior and strength. Games create a higher level of student engagement and a more stimulating learning environment, reaching a broader spectrum of learners in classrooms, addressing the challenge of cultivating a diverse and highly skilled workforce in manufacturing in the United States.<br/><br/>This research will support a multifaceted investigation to discover the mechanisms of electromagnetic (EM) field induced charge transport in refractory ceramic oxides such as zirconia, under ponderomotive driving forces. EM field interactions will be selectively localized to conduct both solid and liquid phase synthesis experiments to grow ceramic films on conducting (metal) layers under microwave radiation. The research team will first use various nanoscale characterization tools to conduct static ex-situ studies on atomic structure; defect structure; and microstructural changes in films grown under (i) no applied field and (ii) different intensity, frequency, and polarizations of the applied field. Next, dynamic in-situ studies will use polarized neutron reflectometry to follow tracer ions in a film, comparing transport properties like diffusion coefficients for varying field parameters at fixed temperature. Computational methods including molecular dynamics simulations will predict and compare diffusion coefficient values for each experimental case. This study is the first to combine experiment and computation to demonstrate the effect of ponderomotive forces on atomic scale transport phenomena under EM fields. Finally, knowledge about the influence of ponderomotive forces on ceramic processing will be applied to create a novel platform for additive manufacture of ceramics at low temperatures, using a layer-by-layer approach. The research tasks will proceed simultaneously with an education and outreach program, which involves an integrated game/classroom approach to learning processing-structure-property relationships in additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An essential part of this effort is determining the sources of trace elements to the oceans, one of which is from the atmosphere: dust falling from the air, and rain, both deliver elements to the sea surface. This project would collect and analyze samples of rainwater and of particles from the atmosphere, along a U.S. GEOTRACES expedition from Alaska to Tahiti in the fall of 2018. The timing of the expedition corresponds to the part of the year with the highest atmospheric dust concentrations in the Gulf of Alaska and may also capture the tail end of peak fire season in Asia. In contrast, the southern end of the proposed ship track is known to have very low atmospheric dust. Aerosols will be influenced by human activity in Asia as well. The anticipated differences in atmospheric deposition along the ship track will allow the assessment of the role of this process on trace element and isotope cycling. The project will support a postdoctoral investigator. The relevance of ocean-atmosphere studies to the public will be communicated at campus open house events and in online forums in collaboration with the GEOTRACES management team.<br/><br/>In alignment with the mission of GEOTRACES, the proposed research will address the following biogeochemical and oceanographic questions: 1) What is the magnitude of atmospheric aerosol deposition (wet and dry) to the surface of the Pacific Ocean? 2) What is the chemical composition of these aerosols and how does composition vary based on source (e.g. Alaskan glacial flour, Asian mineral dust, emissions from biomass burning, anthropogenic emissions)? 3) What is the fractional solubility of trace elements in Pacific aerosols and does solubility vary based on aerosol source? 4) What is the potential bioavailability of soluble aerosol Fe? 5) How is the soluble fraction of aerosol trace elements distributed across operationally defined size classes? 6) How does atmospheric deposition impact distributions of other GEOTRACES parameters? Atmospheric aerosol and precipitation samples will be collected over the 70-day expedition and the investigators will provide sub-samples to collaborators and other interested scientists. These samples will be analyzed for a suite of key trace elements from bulk and size-fractionated aerosol samples, aerosol leachates, and rain samples.

Understanding the current effects of glacier retreat on water supply in these regions can shed light on future water security threats in snow and ice-covered mountainous watersheds worldwide.  Glaciers are the ""water towers"" of the mountains: they store ice during wet periods and gradually release meltwater during dry periods. However, whether groundwater aquifers serve as extended reservoirs and whether plants also take up significant glacial meltwater remain unresolved questions.  These uncertainties make it difficult to predict the future reliability of water supply in mountainous watersheds, as glacier melt first accelerates and then eventually disappears, and as plants move to higher elevations in response to warming temperatures.  This project will develop a new and general computational watershed model that will incorporate chemical and isotopic data for tracing water flow source regions, as well as measurements from innovative low-cost, open-source environmental monitoring technologies. Results from the model can inform communities that rely on stream discharge from ice and snow-covered mountainous watersheds about present with regard to future water resources vulnerabilities, and can facilitate adaptation strategies as glacier retreat accelerates. <br/><br/>	The recession of glaciers will curtail their ability to modulate river discharge and its variability. Studies of this hydrologic consequence typically classify meltwater and groundwater as distinct contributors to streamflow, but this oversimplifies the potentially complex relationships among glaciers, their underlying groundwater systems, and ecohydrologic pathways. The investigators propose to assess these relationships using an integrated data-model approach in four rapidly changing, glacierized Ecuadorian watersheds, two each at Volcn Chimborazo and Volcn Cayambe. This work will produce a new isotope-enabled watershed model with reactive transport, to which data assimilation will be introduced in order to condition uncertain simulations in data-sparse watersheds with robust environmental tracers.  Open-source data loggers and sensors for measuring model input data will further advance critical-zone process understanding beyond data-intensive sites to remote settings that are undergoing some of the most rapid environmental change in the world.  This work will shed light on less-studied volcanic ranges that potentially facilitate greater infiltration of meltwater through their fractured bedrock, as well as expand the established water-resources focus on glacier retreat to also consider vegetation shift when examining the hydrologic response of glacierized mountainous watersheds to glacier retreat.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Self-assembly, where an apparently disordered array of existing components results over time in highly organized structures, is everywhere in the world around us. Many natural systems utilize a small palette of interactions as rules to coax the limitless range of molecular components into well-defined structures. These are most evident in biological systems, where intricate yet robust assemblies permit the delicate dance of life. Researchers have long sought to replicate these behaviors in laboratory syntheses, creating designer molecules and particles which self-assemble into materials with advantageous mechanical, optical, or electrical properties. These efforts have met varying degrees of success. Though working with a similar palette to biology, designed systems often fall short of biological precision, resulting in disordered aggregates of material rather than the desired arrangements.<br/>Colloidal materials, created by the dispersion of small pieces of one phase of matter into another, are ideal places to study the processes and mechanisms of self-assembly. Particularly, this is true for solid colloidal particles which may be designed to mimic the interactions of molecules. As the Brownian motion and rearrangements are readily observable under a microscope, the evolution of ordered structures during assembly may be easily tracked experimentally and potentially controlled. This CAREER award supports the use of powerful computational modeling to develop a comprehensive picture of the clusters colloidal materials are likely to assemble into, and how specific aggregates may be achieved by modifying the structure and composition of colloidal particles.

Self-assembly is ubiquitous in biological systems, and the intricate yet robustly forming structures there inspire scientists and engineers to mimic the natural world within the laboratory. Many successful approaches have derived directly from biology, by simulating the underlying chemistry or directly utilizing biomolecules to promote specific interactions. Though the rules of assembly in the biological and synthetic worlds may be similar, the mere decades of research into designed self-assembly have yet to optimize synthetic processes to the degree observed in the biological realm. Thus, many attempts result in partially ordered systems full of unintended assemblies rather than strict selective formation of the desired structures.<br/>Colloidal materials are ideal places to study the processes and mechanisms of self-assembly, due to highly tunable particle-particle interactions. Additionally, the Brownian motion and structural rearrangements of colloidal aggregates are readily observed under a microscope. Therefore, clusters which quickly form can be followed through their nucleation, growth, and rearrangement from locally preferred configurations toward a global thermodynamic minimum. Over the past few decades, there has been a great increase in colloidal research focusing on synthesis of novel particles which can self-assemble into defined structures, and in particular open crystalline structures which have desirable photonic properties. Even so, many of these new assembly methods have seen little success in creating truly tunable open structures as they focus largely on minimizing inter-particle energies and can contain many features leading to mis-assembly. This CAREER award supports work utilizing powerful flat histogram and reactive pathway sampling algorithms to obtain stable and metastable basins of the free energy surface controlling colloidal assembly, as well as transition pathways between these states. This information forms a comprehensive picture of the self-assembly of colloidal cluster, and directly informs the experimental syntheses of new colloids which tilt the free energy surface through specific interactions, targeting robust cluster assemblies and staged assembly processes to create bespoke open colloidal lattices.<br/>Integrated research and education plans within this proposal follow a threefold approach of classroom engagement, public outreach, and research mentoring. The primary effort concerns the expansion of a classroom outreach program the PI has initiated with South Bend, Indiana public schools to examine the science of cooking. These activities demonstrate how the texture, composition, flavor and visual appeal of everyday foods derive from skillful manipulation of molecular-level interactions. The PI will extend initial classroom demonstrations into interactive and edible lab investigations targeting Indiana high school physical science and scientific literacy standards. This work will also support the involvement of talented undergraduates in computational materials research and the incorporation of molecular assembly and related concepts into the undergraduate thermodynamics curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, many insects have specific calls which are barriers to mating between species. This diversity is in large part under the control of genes. Patterns of gene expression and regulation during development can also result in specific behaviors. However, it is unclear how differences in behavior relate to genetic differences: what is the contribution of changes in the actual genes relative to that of changes in gene regulation? This remains a fundamental open question of general importance, far beyond the diverse calls of insects. In this research this question is addressed in a katydid species that produces two alternative calls in response to the environment experienced during development. The differences between these calls within a population are due to differences in gene regulation. Population-level differences also occur across the geographic range of this insect, and this variation is largely caused by differences in individual's genes. This allows the assessment of the contributions of both genes and genetic regulation to the diversity of behavior in this species. This project integrates genetics, neurobiology, behavior, and evolution. Its outcomes contribute to the understanding of the genetic foundation of biodiversity and are relevant in many areas outside of animal behavior, including medical research. Broader impacts include training opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds that prepare them for the challenges of careers in life sciences. Outreach activities introduce the public to modern biology research in a relatable study system. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the genetic underpinnings of the call diversity in Neoconocephalus katydids. The species Neoconocephalus triops undergoes developmental plasticity (DP) that results in two alternative advertisement calls with species-level differences in two temporal properties (pulse rate and verse pattern). DP can be induced reliably by varying the photoperiod before sexual maturation. First, the relevant developmental stages and tissues (central pattern generators, CPG) in the CNS that contribute to the call pattern generation will be identified. Aim 1 identifies the location of the CPGs using lesion experiments, calcium imaging, and selectively heating of individual ganglia. In aim 2, the investigators identify the sensitive phase of phenotype induction by varying the exposure time of short day conditions and analyzing adult call phenotypes. Aim 3 explores the genetic underpinnings of the diversity of call patterns. RNAseq will be conducted using tissues containing the CPGs collected at the relevant times identified in aim 2.  Correlations between phenotypes and differences in gene expression patterns as well as genetic differences among populations will be identified. Comparisons include two call phenotypes of three populations that differ significantly in call pattern and extent of DP. In aim 4, the investigators will manipulate the expression levels of candidate genes identified in aim 3, using RNAi and examine the consequences for call phenotypes, moving from identifying correlations to testing causation. The outcomes provide testable hypotheses about the genetic control of call variation, which plays a significant role in the diversification of this group.  Training and outreach activities are focusing on the public and students of rural areas in MO, KY, and WV, which are traditionally underserved groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is however less recognized that sea level rise can push water tables above the land surface to flood low-lying depressions. Lakes and wetlands that form by groundwater flooding expose connected aquifers to direct, continuous evaporation, which can result in substantial losses of water resources. Impacts from groundwater flooding and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where evaporated freshwater is replaced by seawater that percolates through the bedrock. These models incorporate impact of climate and predicted that lakes should remain fresh, and groundwater resources continuous, beneath islands in humid regions. In arid regions, lakes would be hypersaline, and much fresh groundwater would be replaced by seawater. In contrast to expectations, modern lakes that are formed by groundwater flooding in the arid southern Bahamas islands have salinities that range from fresh to hypersaline. This paradox between modeled and observed lake salinity underscores our lack of understanding of how groundwater flooding impacts island water resources. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that how groundwater flooding will impact island water resources. We will test the impact of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, the degree of connectivity between lakes and the ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change on this process. The results of this study should improve predictions of freshwater resource loss of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from groundwater flooding, perhaps the primary environmental factor triggering their loss of habitability. The modeling tools to be developed as part of this project will be freely distributed to the hydrological community. A field hydrogeology curricular exercise, with learning outcomes of quantitative coastal hydrology, will be developed to be used by the more than 100 student groups that visit the Gerace Research Centre (base of operation for this project) each year. Project results will be presented as part of a guest lecturer series at the University of the Bahamas and at international conferences. The project will enhance human resources by introducing coastal hydrology to 2 geology PhD students, and one civil engineering postdoctoral researcher at Michigan Tech. Each PI will work with their institution's diversity office to ensure that these positions are effectively advertised to under-represented groups.<br/><br/><br/>Evaporation of lakes and wetlands that form on islands by groundwater inundation reorganizes groundwater flow paths and lowers water tables. Impacts from groundwater inundation and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where the Ghyben-Herzberg relationship results in losses from freshwater lenses (the primary freshwater resource) being 40x the lowering of the water table. Primary controls on groundwater inundation will be sea-level rise and island topography, but impacts to freshwater resources could be moderated by climate (precipitation, and evaporation), aquifer permeability, ratio of groundwater contributing area to lake surface area, and distance between the lake and coast. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that groundwater inundation will reduce freshwater lens volumes through interactions of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, degree of connectivity between lakes and ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change. Hypothesis testing will take a three-pronged approach. First, DEMs of San Salvador Island, Bahamas, will characterize lake hydrogeological setting (catchment/lake area ratios). Field observations of hydrogeological parameters and weather data will be used to estimate groundwater fluxes and lake evaporation; chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, lake water, and precipitation will be used to estimate recharge thresholds and lake water sources (ocean, groundwater, recharged precipitation). Second, a package for simulating dynamic flow and solute transport between lakes and groundwater will be developed and integrated into the SEAWAT/MODFLOW model in cllaboration with USGS. The model will be parameterized with observational data collected on San Salvador Island. Third, transient responses of island freshwater lenses to multiple sea level rise, climate change, and lake formation scenarios will be tested with the newly developed numerical modeling tool. Simulations will determine the nature of relationships between freshwater lens volumes and sea level, climatic variables, and island-lake hydrogeological settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Relationships between tectonic plates and the underlying mantle layer also remain debated, and those relationships are necessary to fully understand what actually drives plate motion on Earth. Locations like Indochina are particularly complex, influenced by a number of competing tectonic and mantle driving forces, and are thus important laboratories for better understanding how our planet functions as a dynamic, tectonic system. This study investigates the origins of recent volcanic activity and faulting in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The goal of this research is to better understand the geologic setting of Indochina, particularly what tectonic and mantle processes drive faulting and volcanic activity. This work benefits society because it directly promotes scientific progress by investigating fundamental scientific questions about the planet and processes that shape it. The study contributes to broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by providing support for two early career women scientists. The project supports STEM education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, thus contributing to the development of a diverse, globally competitive workforce. The project will contribute to increased public literacy and public engagement with STEM supporting outreach events with the University of Nebraska State Museum to disseminate scientific research and educate the local community, and through a written report detailing any new findings regarding potential hazards associated with recent volcanic eruption timing and newly discovered faults. The project facilitates collaboration between several U.S. universities, as well as international collaboration between U.S. and Vietnamese scientists.  <br/><br/>In detail, this project aims to test, develop, and refine a robust, comprehensive regional model that explains the dynamic origins of faulting and volcanism in Indochina, thereby increasing understanding of tectonics and mantle dynamics in complex regimes through the combined approaches of structural geology and igneous geochemistry. The project rationale is the advancement of scientific understanding of plate boundary and microplate dynamics and lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling effects. The central hypothesis for this project states that tectonic extrusion and coupled asthenospheric flow and upwelling have driven rotation of the Southern Indochina microplate, including propagation of strike-slip and normal faulting, and produced voluminous crustal magmatism without mantle plume involvement. The specific research goals for the proposed study are: 1) to evaluate age relationships between fault movement and volcanic activity in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, 2) to gather data to define the stress field of the Central Highlands and assess whether it is consistent with an extrusion- or extension-dominated tectonic regime, and 3) to assess the evidence for mantle upwelling in the same region by identifying mantle source origins (lithosphere vs. asthenosphere) for lavas erupted over time and with geographic distribution. These objectives will be achieved through field mapping of fault orientations and kinematics; isotope dating of volcanic eruptions; and comparative major element, trace element, and radiogenic isotope measurements in basalts and mantle xenoliths. The research is expected to trigger a thorough assessment of relationships between volcanism and faulting, the origin of the tectonic stress driving faulting, and identification of local magma sources over time, leading to a reconciled tectonic model for Indochina.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The water table moves up and down over short and long timespans, particularly near rivers. Water table fluctuations introduce oxygen to shallow groundwater, which can react with ecologically important dissolved substances like organic carbon, nitrate, iron and manganese and have cascading effects on contaminants like arsenic. This project aims to understand how groundwater chemistry evolves in response to water table fluctuations over a range of timescales. Field observations, controlled laboratory column experiments, and computer models will quantify the movement of reactive solutes such as oxygen, nitrate, iron, and manganese beneath a fluctuating water table. Results will improve our understanding of dynamic changes in both groundwater and river water quality and the management of these vital water resources. This project will also introduce a broad audience of citizens and future scientists to dynamic surface water-groundwater interactions through the creation of a hands-on outdoor laboratory facility and museum exhibit.  <br/><br/>Water table fluctuations play an important role in reactive solute transport and water quality near rivers. When the water table rises, entrapped soil air exchanges oxygen with surrounding pore water, which travels downward when the water table falls. The enhanced supply of oxygen stimulates aerobic respiration, nitrification-denitrification, and oxidation of dissolved iron and manganese in groundwater. Water table fluctuations can propagate tens to hundreds of meters into an aquifer in response to changes in river stage. Yet the implications for reactive transport and water quality near rivers remain poorly understood. The overarching goal of this project is to quantify relationships between water table fluctuations, redox transformations, and solute export from aquifers to rivers. This project leverages novel sensor technology to observe the effects of water table fluctuations on groundwater chemistry in controlled column experiments and natural riparian aquifers. The four field sites in this study experience a range of water table fluctuations in response to tides, storms, and seasons. Each site has unique properties that influence reactive transport near the water table. However, pairs of sites also have commonalities in climate, lithology, catchment scale, land use, and geomorphology. Numerical fluid flow and reactive transport models will quantify dynamics in biogeochemical transformation rates and solute fluxes in these riparian aquifers. Observations and model results will be synthesized to generate a quantitative understanding of the effects of water table fluctuations on reactive solute transport in dynamic riparian aquifers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current methods for app design are largely based on either individual designer expertise and intuition, leading to variable results, or else require a large number of active users and engineering resources that are typically only available to large companies.  This project's goal is to solve the research challenges involved in automatically capturing and aggregating design features and user interactions across the large number of existing mobile applications already available for download and develop a platform allowing designers to learn from the choices and experiences other designers have made.  The platform will allow designers to find relevant third-party apps that have relevant design requirements and features, define experiments involving those design choices, and run the experiments by leveraging the existing user base of those apps.  This will help individual designers explore options more cheaply than developing their own prototypes while providing data-driven arguments to support design decisions and communicate with other members of their project teams.  The platform could also lead to tools to accumulate collective design knowledge, identifying emerging trends as well as best practices, useful for both practicing designers and as an educational resource for existing courses on web and app design.  <br/><br/>Developing the platform will require a number of technical advances.  The first involves developing scalable systems for capturing design features and interaction data from large numbers of mobile apps and combining them into representations useful for data mining.  To do this, the team will expand the existing ERICA platform for black-box design capture in a single application, developing it into a background monitoring app that captures interaction and design data for any app the user gives permission for, while detecting and obscuring personally identifying information.   The monitoring app will be deployed primarily via long-term crowdworkers who are paid to install it and participate in designer-defined experiments.  The second main advance is creating functional semantic embeddings for interface components based on the collected data that define common features, app states, and functions.  To do this the team will capture visual, textual, structural, and interactive information about each interface element, then use multimodal embeddings of the data to first classify individual interface elements, then use those labels to identify semantics of app screens and interaction flows between elements and screens.

The well-defined oxide-encapsulated electrocatalysts will be investigated for alcohol oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction using a suite of imaging and spectroscopy techniques that will enable i.) deconvolution of transport and kinetic effects, ii.) elucidation of the mechanisms by which ultrathin oxide overlayers influence reaction selectivity, and iii.) the development of design rules that can be applied across a wide range of materials and reactions. Experimental measurements will be closely coordinated with numerical modeling and density functional theory calculations performed by collaborators. A specific focus of this research is to compare the catalytic properties of buried oxide/metal interfaces to those at oxide/metal/electrolyte triple-phase boundary sites. Overall, the proposed research will lay the groundwork for the rational design of stable oxide-encapsulated electrocatalysts capable of highly efficient and selective generation and use of fuels.  Beyond the specific research, the project will launch an initiative entitled ""Crowdsourcing for Energy Innovation"" that will leverage emerging crowdsourcing principles and online tools to i.) accelerate training of today's students to become the inventors and evaluators of tomorrow's energy technology, ii.) increase participation in the Nation's innovation network, and iii.) increase student and public awareness of cutting-edge clean energy technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, many insects have specific calls which are barriers to mating between species. This diversity is in large part under the control of genes. Patterns of gene expression and regulation during development can also result in specific behaviors. However, it is unclear how differences in behavior relate to genetic differences: what is the contribution of changes in the actual genes relative to that of changes in gene regulation? This remains a fundamental open question of general importance, far beyond the diverse calls of insects. In this research this question is addressed in a katydid species that produces two alternative calls in response to the environment experienced during development. The differences between these calls within a population are due to differences in gene regulation. Population-level differences also occur across the geographic range of this insect, and this variation is largely caused by differences in individual's genes. This allows the assessment of the contributions of both genes and genetic regulation to the diversity of behavior in this species. This project integrates genetics, neurobiology, behavior, and evolution. Its outcomes contribute to the understanding of the genetic foundation of biodiversity and are relevant in many areas outside of animal behavior, including medical research. Broader impacts include training opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds that prepare them for the challenges of careers in life sciences. Outreach activities introduce the public to modern biology research in a relatable study system. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the genetic underpinnings of the call diversity in Neoconocephalus katydids. The species Neoconocephalus triops undergoes developmental plasticity (DP) that results in two alternative advertisement calls with species-level differences in two temporal properties (pulse rate and verse pattern). DP can be induced reliably by varying the photoperiod before sexual maturation. First, the relevant developmental stages and tissues (central pattern generators, CPG) in the CNS that contribute to the call pattern generation will be identified. Aim 1 identifies the location of the CPGs using lesion experiments, calcium imaging, and selectively heating of individual ganglia. In aim 2, the investigators identify the sensitive phase of phenotype induction by varying the exposure time of short day conditions and analyzing adult call phenotypes. Aim 3 explores the genetic underpinnings of the diversity of call patterns. RNAseq will be conducted using tissues containing the CPGs collected at the relevant times identified in aim 2.  Correlations between phenotypes and differences in gene expression patterns as well as genetic differences among populations will be identified. Comparisons include two call phenotypes of three populations that differ significantly in call pattern and extent of DP. In aim 4, the investigators will manipulate the expression levels of candidate genes identified in aim 3, using RNAi and examine the consequences for call phenotypes, moving from identifying correlations to testing causation. The outcomes provide testable hypotheses about the genetic control of call variation, which plays a significant role in the diversification of this group.  Training and outreach activities are focusing on the public and students of rural areas in MO, KY, and WV, which are traditionally underserved groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This switch in human food supply has similar timing to the end of the African Humid Period when a drop in rainfall in Northern Africa and southern Europe decreased oceanic productivity and dried-up wetlands and savanna in North Africa. Hence, it is possible that the end of the African Humid Period played a role in reducing the yields of marine fisheries exploited by Neolithic people and 'nudging' them to find other resources. This project will reconstruct marine fish abundances through the Neolithic-Bronze Age transition by counting and identifying fish teeth in deep sea sediments. The research will support US involvement in the international ""EMPIRE"" Expedition to the Aegean and Adriatic seas. Sediment cores collected during the cruise will provide a first quantitative assessment of how those civilizations were affected by available fish stocks. The use of fish teeth is a novel new proxy system for directly studying fish communities and will provide a 'proof-of-concept' test for the method. The results will be significant because fish teeth make it possible to quantify fish stocks in the past, show the relationship between fish communities and environmental change, and assess our impact on fish populations through fishing. Prior to this new work on fish teeth, almost all studies of ocean productivity have focused on unicellular plankton and have been blind to changes in the fisheries resources that societies rely on. <br/><br/>The project will obtain samples that can be used to test the links between human resource use and the natural abundance of fish. While archaeologists can tell us how many fish people have been consuming, there has been no other direct way to assess what fisheries resources have been like, or how fishing pressure may have changed those resources over time. This project will examine whether the intensity and pattern of human exploitation of fish is linked to the availability of marine resources by supporting participation in an international research cruise (EMPIRE Expedition) designed to quantify changes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems during the rise of human civilization around the Aegean and Adriatic. The expedition will collect ""Kasten"" cores that recover the large volumes of sediment needed for fish tooth research. These cores will be sampled using custom-built plastic core boxes (purchased through this project) so that the cores can be delivered intact to the US to allow for evaluation of core stratigraphy using XRF and x-ray imaging. The project will return large amounts of new core material from the Mediterranean to the Scripps Geological Collections where it will be available to the US community through normal sample requests. The project will enable proof-of-concept research on fish communities to be integrated with the larger international effort to understand human impacts on vegetation, soil erosion, ocean production, and paleoclimate in the region. In turn, this environmental work will be linked with human cultural development seen through archaeological and historical data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The topic of the conference has its origins in 19th century enumerative geometry, when mathematicians computed numbers of geometric figures satisfying various conditions.  The subject grew into a testing ground for Intersection Theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern mathematics.  This workshop will bring together researchers and students coming from different backgrounds, to present various points of view on the subject of Schubert Calculus.<br/><br/>A large part of Schubert Calculus concerns the cohomology rings of Grassmannians and flag manifolds, as well as their generalizations. The subject has deep connections to combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic geometry, and the last 15 years have seen remarkable developments in the techniques of Schubert Calculus.  A guiding problem is to find combinatorial formulas for the multiplication of Schubert classes in flag varieties; several new cases of this problem were solved.  New research has extended our understanding of Schubert calculus to the infinite-dimensional affine (and Kac-Moody) flag varieties, simultaneously deepening the connection with representation theory.  Major goals of this conference include sharing new results and introducing a new generation of students to the techniques, applications, and open problems in the field.

In the past 15 years, driven by increasingly challenging fuel economy standards, sheet steels used in automotive bodies have achieved strengths that are five times those of previous alloys. Normally, increasing strength results in a compromise in ductility - the ability for a material to stretch or bend without fracture - but these new Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) sheets minimize the severity of this compromise. The primary way this has been achieved is by designing the microscopic structure of the steels to resist fracture, based on new understanding of how to control this structure when manufacturing steels. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Award supports fundamental scientific research to uncover the relationships between the processing of these steels, the microscopic structure, and their properties and performance. A broad range of deformation conditions will be studied to better understand the material response and allow the design of steels with even better properties. This will further improve the automobile structures and help meet stringent fuel economy standards, and can also be translated to other sectors to improve the efficiency and performance in many other steel applications.<br/><br/>This work will aim to close the design loop to develop a fundamental understanding of austenite stability during thermomechanical processing (TMP) of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) alloys that use the Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) mechanism to yield exceptional combinations of strength and ductility. The ability for strain-induced austenite-to-martensite transformation to suppress strain localization, and thereby produce excellent properties, is dependent on the thermal and mechanical stability of the austenite; if austenite is too stable, it will not transform during deformation, and if austenite is unstable, it will not be retained at room temperature. Current approaches to stabilize austenite focus on increasing carbon content by performing precise thermal cycles that allow diffusion of carbon from other phases to austenite. Here the research focuses on the use of deformation conditions, including strain rate, strain state, temperature, and stress state/pressure, to understand how to further control austenite stability by performing focused mechanical testing of specifically designed alloys. The understanding developed in this work will result in a science-based understanding of austenite stability in AHSS that can be incorporated into thermodynamic and mechanical materials models, and which will enable the use of Integrated Computation Materials Engineering (ICME) and Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) principles to realize advanced manufacturing and further improve the exceptional properties that can be realized in these low-alloy, low-cost materials that underpin our efforts for lightweight structures in the transportation sector and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are now examples of major companies building large-scale, distributed fuzzing infrastructure, which runs on hundreds of virtual machines that relentlessly process over millions of test cases per day. The performance of fuzzers is critical, as a faster, smarter fuzzer will find more security bugs in the target program more quickly.<br/><br/>This project takes a novel approach to fuzzing performance by shortening the execution time of each fuzzing iteration by trying to achieve more test coverage in a fixed time interval, whereas other approaches focus on convergence to input sets that are more likely to trigger a vulnerability. In the process, the project will overcome hidden scalability and performance bottlenecks caused at the system software layers, such as operating system and hypervisor.

Considering that neighborhood conditions, especially in cities, are shaped by the commercial enterprises that serve the community, understanding the varied experiences of black business-ownership and white business-ownership during redevelopment will inform public discourse regarding wealth attainment, employment, and neighborhood conditions. Furthermore, this project will have practical implications for public policies aiming to encourage more inclusive redevelopment programs and to develop infrastructure that will more effectively support commercial and residential retention. <br/><br/>This project employs a mixed-method design to address three research questions.

These data will be used to illustrate and compare businesses in size, number of paid employees, and receipts. Second, archival material from two prominent Detroit newspapers published between 1997 and 2018 are used to examine how the incorporation of black-owned businesses in media accounts of redevelopment compare to the incorporation of white-owned businesses.

This overwork culture stems from the expectation that ideal workers should put work before family and demonstrate unlimited and undivided commitment to work. This norm may be especially problematic for American women, whose time availability is more likely to be limited by caregiving responsibilities. This study investigates this ideal worker norm, and the conditions under which the norm might change.  The project studies organizational policies that allow time off and flexibility in work schedules and locations, as well as conditions under which these policies are implemented.  It also investigates female managerial representation in the organization, which may be important for organizational adoption of new policies to help women in the workplace. The project will also examine how these organizational conditions affect employee outcomes, such as employee assessment of their fit to the ideal worker norm, and their careers and health. This project shows how changes in the overwork culture may be possible in contemporary American workplaces.<br/><br/>The project conducts a nationally representative, probability-based survey of employees and then matches employee data to organization-level data drawn from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) EEO-1 database. EEO-1 data offer workplace gender and race composition at the establishment level, as well as basic workplace characteristics, such as industry and establishment size. This linked employee-employer data will allow examination of how the ideal worker norm varies by workplace characteristics, and how different organizational conditions influence employee outcomes while controlling for other organizational characteristics.  The probability-based employee sample allows findings to generalize to employed adults working in medium to large organizations in the United States.

However, these vaccines must be delivered into the intradermal region of the skin, which is known to promote an enhanced immune response. Such a precise, consistent delivery of these drugs, which can be quite viscous, has not yet been achieved. One potential method to resolve this issue is needle-free jet injection, whereby liquid is forced out of a narrow orifice at high-speed and punctures the skin. This technique has been routinely applied for deeper (subcutaneous and intramuscular) injections, but now holds promise for intradermal delivery as well. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to provide a deep understanding of the key factors governing intradermal injection with liquid jets. The project will also encompass significant educational activities, including a multi-year undergraduate research program, industry-based training and an outreach program for the local homeschool community.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive picture of needle-free jet injection into intradermal regions of the skin. This complex process involves creation of a high-speed, slender and coherent jet, which impacts and punctures the skin and then disperses in a poro-elastic heterogeneous matrix of tissue. None of these features have been adequately assessed, either experimentally or theoretically. We propose to fill this broad knowledge gap with the combination of a rigorous experimental campaign and theoretical treatment focused in three specific aims: (i) Understanding the role of rheology in jet characteristics, (ii) Defining the criteria for maintaining jet coherency, and (iii) Determining the factors limiting fluid accumulation in the intradermal region. On the experimental side, we will use high-speed video tracking and dynamic force measurements to characterize the jet start-up, steady-stream speed and peak force for a variety of configurations and fluids. We will also perform both ex-vivo and in-vitro injection studies to examine the accumulation of fluid in the intradermal region. On the modeling front, we will focus on stability and coherence of the jet as a function of geometry prior to the orifice and fluid properties. Our approach is expected to yield unprecedented understanding and provide the platform for future innovation in needle-free injection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project uniquely builds on an established statewide network of reform-focused individuals and organizations that are part of the Michigan Science Teaching and Assessment Reform (Mi-STAR) program. MTP will focus on the middle school level and emphasize applications of science and to real-world problems that are relevant to students and their families in Michigan. <br/><br/>To implement MTP, Michigan Technological University will collaborate with high-need Kalamazoo Public Schools and Saginaw Public Schools, and with two non-profit organizations: Michigan Science Teacher Association and Michigan Earth Science Teacher Association. MTP will provide financial support for two cohorts: ten Master Teaching Fellows with master's degrees in their field and ten Fellows with bachelor's degrees in a STEM discipline, who are also enrolled in the institution's Master of Science in Applied Science Education.  Upon completion of the initial professional learning training, Fellows with a master's degree will move into leadership positions in their schools and districts and will also serve as mentors for MTP teachers pursuing a master's degree. MTP will prepare Fellows pursuing a master's degree to assume increasing levels of leadership in their schools and districts. An outcome of the project will be its production of teacher-leaders who are prepared to help other teachers effectively implement ""three-dimensional"" instructional practices, which are performance expectations for students in the Next Generation Science Standards and Michigan Science Standards.

In addition, the project will explore the potential for improving the effectiveness of the catalytic materials by synthesizing them as nanoparticles rather than traditional micron-sized particles.  The new materials can be formed through combinations of many different elements, and the study will also develop methods for predicting the best combinations of elements for specific chemical reactions, thereby streamlining the catalyst discovery process and promoting U.S. competitiveness in the fuels and chemicals manufacturing sectors.  The project will be linked to educational and outreach efforts that will train the next generation of engineers, and increase public awareness of new energy-efficient technologies such as fuel cells and batteries.<br/><br/>Preliminary efforts in the investigator's laboratory have established a working understanding of how supported nanoparticle intermetallic compounds (IMCs) may be synthesized with well-defined bulk and surface compositions.  The project will utilize those findings to enable a systematic study of IMC surface chemistry as a function of constituent elements in the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehyde and nitro compounds. Experimental and computational methods will be used to examine the selectivity of C=C, C=O, and N-O activation, dissociation, and hydrogenation as a function of IMC bulk and surface composition and electronic structure information.  Synthesis of oxide-supported non-noble metal nanoparticle IMCs will focus on developing clear understanding of the physical phenomena that dictate their bulk and surface composition as a function of element selection, oxide choice, and preparation environment. Formation of the bulk crystal structure of the nanoparticles will be investigated by ex- and in-situ x-ray diffraction and neutron scattering. Complementary high-resolution energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy will verify bulk composition and quantify elements not incorporated into the IMC nanoparticles. Surface composition of the IMCs will be analyzed using low energy ion scattering. Diffusion of constituent elements, particle growth, and bulk crystal structure will be analyzed as a function of synthesis variables to produce a complete picture of how well-defined nanoparticle IMCs may be produced. Results of these studies will allow for a general procedure to be developed for the synthesis, characterization, reactivity evaluation, and stability analysis of the IMC catalysts.  Beyond the targeted reactions, the project will enable atomic- and electronic-level understanding of how nanoparticle IMC catalysis can be controlled and widely utilized in chemical transformations important to the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The educational component of the proposed program will serve to develop a surface and materials chemistry education program at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  In addition, a YouTube video series, focused on materials, surface, and catalytic science, will be developed in a format accessible to the general population to promote a greater understanding of the impact these sciences have on everyday life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is responsible for a vast array of geological processes, from the generation of continental crust to the modulation of atmospheric composition. Yet, some fundamental questions about its history remain unresolved: when plate tectonics began on Earth and how it has evolved through time. This project aims to resolve the likely mode of mantle convection in the Precambrian (i.e., after the solidification of the putative magma ocean in the early Earth to the beginning of the Phanerozoic at 540 million years ago), by building a robust theoretical framework and exploring its implications for geological and geochemical observations. Reconstructing the evolutionary path of plate tectonics on Earth is one of the most fundamental geophysical problems, providing a global context for geological, geophysical, and geochemical processes, and the radius of the potential impact of this research would cover nearly all branches of solid Earth sciences. Expected research results should also find their applications in the physics and chemistry of terrestrial planets at large and are expected to become part of the theory of habitable planets. This project will provide support and training for a postdoctoral associate and a graduate student, as well as summer intern or thesis projects for undergraduates.  <br/><br/>The planned research has the following five major objectives: (1) Establishing a regime diagram of mantle convection as a function of internal Rayleigh number, the temperature dependency of viscosity, yielding criteria, and the internal heating ratio, so that we can estimate how the mode of convection has evolved in the past, (2) quantifying the relation between quasi-steady-state solutions and transient situations, in terms of the mode of convection and heat-flow scaling, so that we can analyze collectively different numerical approaches to the evolving mantle dynamics in a unifying fashion, (3) understanding 3-D effects on the mode of mantle convection on the basis of newly-developed scaling laws and published simulation results, (4) exploring the influence of the thermal evolution of the core on surface tectonics by a systematic investigation of coupled core-mantle evolution models, and (5) connecting internal mantle dynamics with surface observables, such as global sea level, plate velocity, and geomagnetic field strength, so that we can build falsifiable hypotheses for the evolution of mantle convection in the Precambrian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, we still have a limited understanding of the diverse reasons that people access these technologies, which are likely to relate to cultural, religious, and socioeconomic factors. This research will address this gap by examining gamete transfer and donation in an understudied U.S. population. This project explores what impact the availability and effectiveness these technologies have in influencing reproductive decision-making. The findings from this project will be disseminated to organizations and individuals who inform public health practices and policies related to healthcare decision-making. The project also provides training for undergraduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis.<br/> <br/>Dr. Daisy Deomampo of Fordham University will investigate the following research questions: How do sociocultural beliefs influence experiences of infertility and the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs)? How do views and practices in reproductive medicine and science shape popular ideas about gamete donation? How do legal cases shed light on sociocultural understandings of the value of gametes? The research will focus on a cohort of Asian American gamete donors and recipients, selected because they are overlooked in research on gamete donation, yet have a high rate of ART utilization, and an older mean age of mothers at first birth compared to other ethnic groups. In order to comprehend how diverse groups in Asian America experience social and cultural issues related gamete donation, this ethnographic study is located in three metropolitan areas with significant diversity in Asian populations: New York, NY, Los Angeles, CA, and Honolulu, HI. Data collection will include in-depth interviews and participant observation with doctors, donor coordinators, and gamete providers and recipients. This project will also include textual analysis of court cases, media coverage, online forums, and policy documents. These data will be used to facilitate analysis of two important themes: the social construction of identity in medical practice, and the role of identity in shaping ideas about reproduction and genetic inheritance. By exploring the social meanings attached to identity and DNA in the context of gamete donation, this project will offer much-needed ethnographic perspective on the bioethical and policy implications of reproductive technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many words that reflect subjective attitudes, including adjectives such as 'fun,' 'frightening' and 'unhealthy.' An important question is whose perspective or opinion these subjective words are anchored to--whose opinion it is that something is frightening, or fun, or unhealthy. Identifying whose opinion these kinds of subjective words reflect is important. For example, consider a physician deeming a certain individual to be unhealthy compared to a friend with no medical training conveying the same sentiment. However, identifying whose opinion a subjective adjective is anchored to is not always straightforward. The type of sentence in which the word occurs influences its meaning. If someone states 'The situation was frightening,' that speaker is often interpreted as the arbiter of what counts as 'frightening,' but if someone asks a friend 'Was the situation frightening?' then the perspective shifts and the friend's opinion of what counts as frightening also matters. The current project aims to improve understanding of how people understand subjective words, including shifts from one person's perspective to another's perspective, and how language-based and social-interaction-based factors influence this. This research may inform theories of language use, as well as the design of interventions to improve communication in contexts such as health, legal and educational settings.  An understanding of the relation between language and people's personal opinions/attitudes may also be relevant when dealing with social tensions due to attitude divergence, as well as investigations of subjective perspective-taking in nontypical populations.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to our understanding of subjective perspective-taking and its interfaces with language. The research uses both online and offline experimental methods to examine the mechanisms and representations involved in the interpretation of subjective linguistic expressions. The researchers will investigate whether and to what extent subjective expressions of different types trigger perspective-shifts during language processing, and whether this is modulated by top-down contextual factors. The project will also gauge the extent to which interpretation of perspective-sensitive elements is guided by the linguistic context in which they occur and how the perspective-holder is activated during real-time processing. Current debate in psycholinguistics regarding perspective-taking primarily focuses on objective situations where individuals differ in what they know or can observe directly, whereas much of the recent debate on perspective in theoretical linguistics has centered on subjective differences between individuals' opinions and attitudes.  The studies in this project will broaden the empirical basis of work on perspectival processing and will further our understanding of how humans process perspective-sensitive linguistic material.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multiple drives or multi-drives open a new dimension of research into optimizing their combined performance metrics through energy savings, cost savings, increased reliability, and enhanced performance. Therefore, a hierarchy of controls is essential to coordinate among these drives to maximize these metrics. The project's technical success will be partially assessed through an industrial advisory board, which will be formed to ensure quick transitioning of the proposed research into products in areas of national need. The project also aims at establishing new courses, upgrading existing courses, and participating in curricular undergraduate and graduate activities, to promote electric drives and related application areas of national interest. Under-represented minority students will be recruited to participate in research, educational and outreach activities through existing and new initiatives at the University of Connecticut. A new K-12 outreach program will be established with low-income high-minority-population high schools in the State of Connecticut, with focus on solar powered motor drives. <br/><br/>Technical Description: This project will establish foundations for control, fault diagnosis, fault mitigation, and coordination between multiple motor drives, i.e. multi-drives. It will mainly utilize supervisory and switching control concepts at the local and global drive levels. The research objective at the local drive level is to achieve highly reliable operation by switching between controllers or reconfiguring the drive based on available feedback, sensor signals, and health information. Therefore, different faults in these drives will be diagnosed and mitigated with single algorithms, and techniques to reconfigure and thus extend the lives of these drives will be proposed. These algorithms will also focus on minimizing the dwell time during which a drive remains in failure mode. At the multi-drive global system level, coordination and optimization will address how roles and priorities are shared among these drives to minimize their energy consumption. This will be achieved through discrete-time supervisory control and energy optimization. Results from this research will be integrated in two graduate motor drives courses as well as a graduate certificate course, and in undergraduate senior design projects and a new course. A trained workforce from technicians to graduate students is expected to result from K-12 through graduate educational and outreach programs, especially a new K-12 program with focus on under-represented minority and low-income students who may start a career path in STEM. Publications, theses and dissertations, technical workshops, and seminars will be integral in disseminating this research at local, national, and international levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To that end, this project will conduct a number of experiments to address two key questions that link visualization design to cognition.  The first question addresses how different techniques for visualizing the same data affect people's ability to carry out common analysis tasks, as well as how the designs affect their visual perception of and attention to different aspects of the data.  The second focuses on the kinds of conceptual models people form about a dataset when they explore it using different visualization designs, and how visual and interactive elements of the designs affect those models.  Developing better understandings of how people reason with visualizations will advance both cognitive psychology and visualization design.  Students studying information visualization will be involved in the research, directly benefiting their design abilities and having potential benefits in domains where visualizations are becoming increasingly common, including journalism, education, business, and medicine. <br/><br/>To address questions of how visual and spatial elements of a given design affect attention and task performance, the project team will first create a taxonomy of the visuo-spatial properties of common visualizations based on existing research scattered across a variety of academic disciplines, mapping visualization features to their ability to support various analysis tasks such as comparison, interpretation, ranking, and categorization.  They will validate and extend the taxonomy through a series of experiments that look at time spent, error rates, eye gaze data, and qualitative participant feedback to triangulate conclusions about how different designs support observations and inferences over the data and which kinds of visualizations provide observational advantages for which kinds of tasks.  The project team will design a series of analysis tasks that emphasize different cognitive processes derived from both Bloom's taxonomy and different types of knowledge (factual, conceptual, and procedural) in order to conduct experiments that get at the kinds of mental models people form when using different visualization designs.  Participants in these experiments will be given time to explore the visualizations, then perform the tasks using a think-aloud protocol while the project team collects eye gaze data.  Participants will then be asked to reflect on their analysis activities through a series of interviews, and draw a series of representations of the data that capture different sorts of relationships that might compose a mental model.  A followup study will look at the effect of providing multiple visualizations and levels of control of which visualizations are shown, to address how interacting with multiple visualizations of the same data affects the mental models that people form.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High courts are called on to be final arbiters of constitutional meaning. The Kenyan Supreme Court's invalidation of the August 2017 presidential election and directive for a new election in late October 2017 presents a crucial test of the Court's institutional legitimacy, or rightful authority to render constitutional and legal rulings for the polity. This project examines how the public has responded to this landmark ruling, as well as to the new election that the Court has ordered. Do citizens' ethnic and partisan affiliations drive their assessments of the Supreme Court's legitimacy in light of this landmark ruling? Or can perceptions of procedural fairness and other non-policy factors overcome ethnic or partisan bias and build a reservoir of legitimacy for the Court? These questions are incredibly important in an emerging democracy like Kenya with a high court that has a short institutional history. Mass and elite responses to the Court's actions will set a strong precedent for the future of the rule of law and democratic governance, not only in Kenya but in Africa writ large. Moreover, a history of mass public protests and violence in response to controversial elections makes understanding the public's response to this episode extremely important for theoretical, empirical, and normative reasons. <br/><br/>	This project will test theoretical hypotheses centered on process-based (procedural fairness, subscription to democratic values) versus outcome-based (ethnic or partisan disagreement with Court outcomes) models of institutional legitimacy. These hypotheses with a two-wave national panel survey, which includes a survey experiment, of Kenyan citizens. Using an oversample of control group respondents from the first wave, descriptive statistics related to legitimacy and other Court-related assessments and examine the effects of process and outcome-based factors on legitimacy and other evaluations will be generated. A field experiment will also be conducted to allow identification of the causal effects of procedural fairness and elite cues, both countervailing and aligning with ethnopartisan preferences' on Supreme Court legitimacy. The experiment will also examine whether procedural fairness and countervailing elite cues can attenuate ethnopartisan bias in legitimacy judgments. Finally, the second wave survey will allow the identification of how different ethno-partisans' attitudes toward the Supreme Court change in light of the outcome of the new election.  Examining these changes will provide an additional test of the outcome-based model and examine how and whether reactions (both positive and negative) to the court?s decision persist into the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analysis of dementia patients' brains has linked the presence of numerous and wide-spread microinfarcts, in some cases thousands in a single brain, to increased cognitive impairment. Animal studies support this finding. While a causal link has been established, the cellular, molecular, and physiological events that occur during small blood vessel stroke and their role in neurological impairment remain unknown. Performing high-resolution cellular experiments in humans or animal brains is extremely challenging. To overcome this limitation, this project focuses on the development and validation of a tissue-engineered, microfluidic, in vitro, microstroke model that accurately recapitulates the cascade of events that occur in vivo. Development and validation of this fluidized, in vitro, microstroke model has the potential to provide significant insights into the fundamental biological changes induced by microstrokes. It is envisioned that the biological discoveries achieved with this model could significantly impact human health and potentially lead to the development of intelligently designed therapies to treat microstroke and dementia in future applications. To increase exposure across a broad range of students, from elementary to undergraduate, an educational plan has been developed that aims to spark interest in students to pursue science, technology, engineering and math education through Art in Science Exhibits, hands-on Art in Science Modules, laboratory research experiences, as well as to incorporating research in microphysiological systems into existing undergraduate courses.<br/><br/>The project focuses on developing and validating a tissue-engineered, microfluidic, in vitro, microstroke model that can be used to study the cellular, molecular and physiological events that occur during microstroke-induced neurological impairment occlusion- and reperfusion-induced changes.

The Research Plan is organized under 3 specific aims:  1) Quantify the influence of capillary occlusion and reperfusion on cerebrovascular flow in a 3D synthetic, biomimetic, vascular network based on a 3D image stack of the vascular system of an entire mouse brain that was generated by high-resolution imaging, via knife edge scanning microscopy, of perfused india ink; 2) Quantify the influence of capillary occlusion and reperfusion on human stem cell derived brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and 3) Quantify the influence of capillary occlusion and reperfusion on microinfarct progression by spatiotemparally monitoring the progression of a capillary occlusion- and reperfusion induced microinfarct in hydrogel encapsulated human astrocytes and neurons.  Fulfillment of these aims requires further development and implementation of advanced biofabrication techniques (two-photon hydrogel degradation and polymerization), advanced biomaterials (enzymatically-degradable constructs and semi-synthetic blood clots), and incorporation of differentiated human neural stem cells (BMECs, astrocytes, and neurons) to create a microphysiological stroke model using all human cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without causal information, researchers cannot predict the effects of new interventions, estimate retrospective counterfactuals, and, perhaps more importantly, construct meaningful, in-depth explanations of the phenomenon under investigation. With the unprecedented accumulation of data, the challenge of finding meaningful explanations can be summarized under the rubric of ""data-fusion"" -- namely, deriving a causal interpretation from a combination of experimental and observational studies collected under disparate, non-exchangeable conditions (Bareinboim and Pearl, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A, 2016). Despite all the recent progress, it is still non-trivial to apply state-of-the-art causal inference methods in many large-scale settings. In particular, the scientist's available knowledge does not always match what the theory expects, and the theory does not accept as input (and generate as output) more relaxed causal specifications. Given the completeness of the theory, these requirements cannot be strictly waived. In reality, however, some researchers continue to make their claims even when the required conditions are not met. There is an increasing recognition throughout the empirical disciplines that many of the scientific findings articulated today are too fragile, incapable of resisting to a more rigorous scrutiny or even being reproduced. The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between the conditions entailed by the theory (which, if followed, would generate robust and scientifically-grounded claims) and the knowledge available at the hands of the scientist. Specifically, the project seeks (1) to characterize the trade-off between the combination of data and background knowledge (scientific theories) available versus the strength of newly hypothesized causal explanations, and (2) to construct approximation schemes allowing inputs that are coarse and imprecise, while generating outputs that are still causally meaningful. The proposed research is expected to offer foundational grounding for most of the data science inferences made today, which will impact the practice of several data-intensive fields that are built on cause-and-effect relationships, including econometrics, education, bioinformatics, and medicine. The project also contains a significant educational component. Similar to the importance of physics and calculus in basic science education in the 20th century, causal inference will be a vital component of the curriculum of undergraduate studies in a modern, data-rich society. The project develops a new educational platform tailored to teaching causal inference concepts, principles, and tools to STEM students. The primary goal of this new platform is to move from acausal claims obtained from pervasive regression-based techniques, as well as vague and self-evident statements such as ""association does not imply causation"", and go towards a more fundamental understanding of the conditions necessary to support causal statements.<br/><br/> The goal of this proposal is to develop a principled framework for approximations in causal inference. There are two possible approximation dimensions, one regarding the input and the other the output of a given problem instance. First, we will develop sufficient and necessary identification conditions to accept as input a model that is not fully specified (e.g., a causal DAG), but only a coarser description of the phenomenon is available. We will further develop effective procedures for determining whether a causal quantity can be approximated from a combination of observational and experimental datasets, given structural knowledge about the underlying data-generating process. The project will further leverage both results to design efficient learning algorithms under the relaxed assumption that the input is just partially specified and the output can be an approximation of the target causal distribution. Finally, we will consider the problem of learning causal explanations when multiple biased datasets are available, including when plagued with selection bias, confounding bias, and structural heterogeneity. The goal is to develop a general algorithmic theory of approximate causal inference that is capable of producing more robust, reproducible, and generalizable causal explanations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses the question: What ideas about fairness underpin an economic system that uses data about individuals and their past behavior to determine who gets what going forward? Economic sociologists have long studied how markets and the people who decide their contours, like business leaders and regulators, institutionalize certain understandings of good and bad, of legitimate and inappropriate. Over time, these ideas about how markets should operate become taken-for-granted assumptions that seem natural and obvious, but when market practices are new, these ideas are not yet settled on. By studying the big data economy in its early years, this project seeks to capture how certain ideas about market fairness are becoming accepted?and others are being left aside. <br/><br/>To understand these dynamics, the project focuses on the case of car insurance pricing and leverages a series of U.S. policy debates to study how market actors?including companies, regulators, and consumers?morally frame the use of personal data in insurance pricing. The project also studies how different moral frames enable or deflect the use of various types of information, such as credit scores, social media posts, and real-time driving data. The project draws from policy and industry documents, in-depth interviews, and ethnographic observations at insurance conferences to analyze how different ways of construing fairness lead to different business practices and policy outcomes. To complement these data, the project includes a survey of American consumers to understand the moral intuitions of the people whose lives are affected by these policies and practices. With this analysis, the project contributes to economic sociology?s morals and markets literature and burgeoning efforts to understand the practices of mass data collection, predictive analytics, and algorithmic decision-making, which increasingly give markets their shape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The potential for machine learning to dramatically impact and change people's lives necessitates that machine learning methods be robust, explainable, and understandable---rather than black-box. This research develops new techniques that are both computationally motivated and theoretically sound for robust machine learning at scale. The work is situated in the context of three modern classes of applications. (1) Economists are interested in analyzing the efficacy of microcredit, small loans to individuals in impoverished areas with the goal of eliminating poverty. (2) Biologists are interested in using single-cell RNA sequencing data to understand cells' relationships and development trajectories. (3) The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to generate a wealth of complex data across energy readings in buildings, within transportation infrastructure, from vehicles on the road, and from many other sensor sources. The PI is working directly with area experts so as to have immediate, broad impact across application domains. In an educational component of the project, the PI is a core part of developing a new graduate curriculum and degree in statistics, data science, and statistical machine learning at MIT. The methods and applications in this proposal feature in a new course on modern machine learning methods. The PI is also developing a high-school level introduction to machine learning as part of the established Women's Technology Program (WTP).<br/><br/>The issues of robustness and explainability particularly arise in domains with nontrivial spatial and temporal dependencies, where the amount of data is often massive, and where practitioners typically have some expert knowledge about the domain before engaging with a particular dataset. These are precisely the domains where existing machine learning methodologies are less well-developed. The need to bring structural knowledge to bear on the problem suggests the use of Bayesian methods, which can incorporate this knowledge via prior and modeling assumptions. To live up to the promise of these methods, though, practical approaches need to be robust to assumptions as well as to noisy or adversarial data, lest this data change important decisions in ways not understood by the practitioner. This research incorporates advances in statistical physics to assess the sensitivity of a data analysis to assumptions and data values. And to realize the advantages of the proposed robust and understandable machine learning framework, practitioners must face extreme scalability issues---both from a computational perspective as well as a modeling perspective. On the computational side, this research builds on recent advances from computational geometry to scale to data sets at modern sizes. On the modeling side, note that while small-scale problems exhibit dense spatio-temporal dependencies, large-scale problems tend to be sparser, and practical approaches must reflect this sparsity to be reliable at scale. This work incorporates advances in probability theory to model sparse IoT networks. This proposal is highly interdisciplinary---bringing together ideas from machine learning, statistics, physics, theoretical computer science, probability theory, and systems and applying these ideas to microcredit, single-cell RNA sequencing, sensor networks, international trade, and industrial applications including customer service at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, harmful algal blooms in lakes can appear suddenly in response to subtle changes in environmental conditions. Knowing when and where they are likely to happen in time to prevent them or to reduce their impact can be quite challenging. Some scientists have suggested that there may be early warnings of algal blooms detectable by frequent measurements of water quality. Recent advances in technology now make it possible to measure water quality in real time using sensors.  These high frequency data provide a way to develop early warnings of imminent blooms of harmful algae. An effective early warning system will help scientists understand what causes harmful algal blooms and develop strategies to prevent them. This research will study how to use spatial patterns, in addition to changes over time, to more effectively detect early warnings in lakes where harmful algal blooms are expected to occur. The goal is to create a new approach to predicting when and where large changes to ecosystems will occur. The results will be useful for management as harmful algal blooms are a serious water quality and public health problem. Early warnings before blooms begin could help managers protect beaches, water quality, and other important public resources. This project will also involve outreach to journalists to help educate the public about efforts to prevent harmful algal blooms.<br/><br/>Empirical evaluation of spatial pattern in ecosystems requires a means of repeatedly generating spatially rich data. The Fast Limnology Automated Measurement (FLAMe) platform rapidly determines the spatial distribution of a suite of variables including phytoplankton pigments that are diagnostic of algal blooms. The project will generate pigment maps and a variety of spatial statistics using the FLAMe platform. Spatial patterns will be studied for lakes across a natural nutrient loading gradient and for a set of eutrophic lakes. Dynamic spatial models of lake phytoplankton will be developed to evaluate existing indicators and possibly develop new ones. Lakes near thresholds for algal blooms are hypothesized to have higher spatial variance, autocorrelation, and skewness than either more oligotrophic (low nutrient inputs) or more eutrophic lakes (high nutrient inputs). Spatial early warnings will be tested in a whole lake manipulation that compares a nutrient enriched lake to an unenriched reference lake. The enriched lake is hypothesized to increase in spatial variance, autocorrelation, and skewness prior to the development of a bloom. The research will provide new knowledge of spatial patterns in lakes as nutrient status changes, as well as new insights about spatial variability and change indicators. The study will systematically explore spatial indicators for blooms and generate hypotheses testable in other types of ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The initial focus is on producing a cell-based therapy for wound healing. If successful, the technology that is developed could lead to breakthroughs in treatments for other life-threatening diseases. An education plan will promote opportunities and training at the high school through post-graduate levels. A progressive program at the high school level that impacts hundreds of students per year will increase exposure to research opportunities and promote retention in STEM career paths. Community outreach programs will also be supported, and research findings will be integrated to enhance these programs.<br/><br/>Establishing new criteria for rational design of biomanufacturing approaches for therapeutic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) exosomes is the focus of this project. Exosomes have therapeutic bioactivity, including vascularization. Many of the therapeutic effects associated with cell-based therapies are now being ascribed to protein, nucleic acid, and/or lipid transfer from exosomes and other extracellular vesicles secreted by implanted cells. The general hypothesis is that MSC exosome production and therapeutic bioactivity are defined by the cell culture microenvironment and the status of producer MSCs. The research objectives are to: 1) investigate the mechanism of vascularization bioactivity; 2) investigate the mechanism of cell density effects on production; and 3) develop quantitative predictive criteria to enable quality control of exosome production.

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia.  The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign grants is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation.  Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes.  More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate.  Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers.  Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign features several education and outreach activities.  These including support for undergraduate participation and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education.  In addition, the Principal Investigators (PIs) maintain a blog during the period just before, during, and just after the field campaign, helping to communicate the science to a broader audience.  The award also provides funding for the education of a graduate student and to bring three additional graduate students to the campaign, allowing them to gain valuable experience in fieldwork.<br/><br/>The eight week campaign deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  The radar determines cloud properties such as the relative abundance of ice particles versus liquid droplets, and uses Doppler shift to measure updraft and downdraft speeds in clouds.  The aircraft sampling is augmented by observations collected at ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we still lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce.  Over the eastern Pacific tropical convection occurs in a narrow east-west strip a few degrees north of the equator, in a region where near-surface winds come together in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ).  The near-surface wind convergence is a consequence of a strong north-south sea surface temperature (SST) contrast between the ""cold tongue"" along the equator and the warmer waters to the north. Surface winds near the equator tend to blow across SST contrasts and converge over the warmer water, and surface convergence induces rising motions favorable to convection.<br/><br/>But the PIs argue against the notion that convection in the eastern Pacific ITCZ is driven primarily by surface convergence, pointing out that surface convergence does not automatically result in strong convection and heavy rainfall.  Instead they hypothesize that thermodynamic factors including convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), and the influence of moisture through entrainment and downdrafts are key to understanding convection in the region.<br/><br/>The project also considers convection over the southwest Caribbean, where convection occurs despite a lack of SST contrasts and a relatively dry atmosphere.  The PIs suggest that convection in these unfavorable conditions constitutes a self-sustaining equilibrium state which can develop given the right initial state, although the same environmental conditions would equally favor suppressed convection.  Such multiple equilibrium behavior is seen in idealized models and has been associated with self-aggregation in cloud resolving models, and the PIs hypothesize that it is implicated in the active and suppressed phases of easterly waves.<br/><br/>The research is conducted using data collected during the campaign in combination with a variety of numerical models including a cloud resolving version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.  The PIs have several strategies for representing the relevant dynamics and thermodynamics in an idealized form, often using a small doubly-periodic domain. Observational comparisons use data from OTREC as well as earlier field campaigns (EPIC and TEPPS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An essential part of this effort is determining the sources of trace elements to the oceans, one of which is from the atmosphere: dust falling from the air, and rain, both deliver elements to the sea surface. This project would collect and analyze samples of rainwater and of particles from the atmosphere, along a U.S. GEOTRACES expedition from Alaska to Tahiti in the fall of 2018. The timing of the expedition corresponds to the part of the year with the highest atmospheric dust concentrations in the Gulf of Alaska and may also capture the tail end of peak fire season in Asia. In contrast, the southern end of the proposed ship track is known to have very low atmospheric dust. Aerosols will be influenced by human activity in Asia as well. The anticipated differences in atmospheric deposition along the ship track will allow the assessment of the role of this process on trace element and isotope cycling. The project will support a postdoctoral investigator. The relevance of ocean-atmosphere studies to the public will be communicated at campus open house events and in online forums in collaboration with the GEOTRACES management team.<br/><br/>In alignment with the mission of GEOTRACES, the proposed research will address the following biogeochemical and oceanographic questions: 1) What is the magnitude of atmospheric aerosol deposition (wet and dry) to the surface of the Pacific Ocean? 2) What is the chemical composition of these aerosols and how does composition vary based on source (e.g. Alaskan glacial flour, Asian mineral dust, emissions from biomass burning, anthropogenic emissions)? 3) What is the fractional solubility of trace elements in Pacific aerosols and does solubility vary based on aerosol source? 4) What is the potential bioavailability of soluble aerosol Fe? 5) How is the soluble fraction of aerosol trace elements distributed across operationally defined size classes? 6) How does atmospheric deposition impact distributions of other GEOTRACES parameters? Atmospheric aerosol and precipitation samples will be collected over the 70-day expedition and the investigators will provide sub-samples to collaborators and other interested scientists. These samples will be analyzed for a suite of key trace elements from bulk and size-fractionated aerosol samples, aerosol leachates, and rain samples. A sequential extraction scheme designed to solubilize aerosol Fe as a function of its FeOx morphology and particle size will be used on selected samples because an understanding of aerosol trace element fractional solubility is fundamental to future work to assess the bioavailability of aerosol derived trace elements. The proposed work will provide data that directly contribute to the GEOTRACES objectives related to atmospheric deposition and will help to address temporal variability as this cruise section follows the CLIVAR/Repeat Hydrography P16N line.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is however less recognized that sea level rise can push water tables above the land surface to flood low-lying depressions. Lakes and wetlands that form by groundwater flooding expose connected aquifers to direct, continuous evaporation, which can result in substantial losses of water resources. Impacts from groundwater flooding and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where evaporated freshwater is replaced by seawater that percolates through the bedrock. These models incorporate impact of climate and predicted that lakes should remain fresh, and groundwater resources continuous, beneath islands in humid regions. In arid regions, lakes would be hypersaline, and much fresh groundwater would be replaced by seawater. In contrast to expectations, modern lakes that are formed by groundwater flooding in the arid southern Bahamas islands have salinities that range from fresh to hypersaline. This paradox between modeled and observed lake salinity underscores our lack of understanding of how groundwater flooding impacts island water resources. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that how groundwater flooding will impact island water resources. We will test the impact of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, the degree of connectivity between lakes and the ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change on this process. The results of this study should improve predictions of freshwater resource loss of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from groundwater flooding, perhaps the primary environmental factor triggering their loss of habitability. The modeling tools to be developed as part of this project will be freely distributed to the hydrological community. A field hydrogeology curricular exercise, with learning outcomes of quantitative coastal hydrology, will be developed to be used by the more than 100 student groups that visit the Gerace Research Centre (base of operation for this project) each year. Project results will be presented as part of a guest lecturer series at the University of the Bahamas and at international conferences. The project will enhance human resources by introducing coastal hydrology to 2 geology PhD students, and one civil engineering postdoctoral researcher at Michigan Tech. Each PI will work with their institution's diversity office to ensure that these positions are effectively advertised to under-represented groups.<br/><br/><br/>Evaporation of lakes and wetlands that form on islands by groundwater inundation reorganizes groundwater flow paths and lowers water tables. Impacts from groundwater inundation and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where the Ghyben-Herzberg relationship results in losses from freshwater lenses (the primary freshwater resource) being 40x the lowering of the water table. Primary controls on groundwater inundation will be sea-level rise and island topography, but impacts to freshwater resources could be moderated by climate (precipitation, and evaporation), aquifer permeability, ratio of groundwater contributing area to lake surface area, and distance between the lake and coast. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that groundwater inundation will reduce freshwater lens volumes through interactions of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, degree of connectivity between lakes and ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change. Hypothesis testing will take a three-pronged approach. First, DEMs of San Salvador Island, Bahamas, will characterize lake hydrogeological setting (catchment/lake area ratios). Field observations of hydrogeological parameters and weather data will be used to estimate groundwater fluxes and lake evaporation; chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, lake water, and precipitation will be used to estimate recharge thresholds and lake water sources (ocean, groundwater, recharged precipitation). Second, a package for simulating dynamic flow and solute transport between lakes and groundwater will be developed and integrated into the SEAWAT/MODFLOW model in cllaboration with USGS. The model will be parameterized with observational data collected on San Salvador Island. Third, transient responses of island freshwater lenses to multiple sea level rise, climate change, and lake formation scenarios will be tested with the newly developed numerical modeling tool. Simulations will determine the nature of relationships between freshwater lens volumes and sea level, climatic variables, and island-lake hydrogeological settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, available manufacturing processes for two-dimensional materials require high temperatures or complex chemical treatment, which limits their large-scale production. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award investigates scalable electrochemical exfoliation and functionalization of two-dimensional materials with the aim of controlling their structures and properties for high-performance energy storage devices. Two-dimensional materials come in many compositions and are increasingly utilized in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, smart grids, and renewable energy systems. The capability to produce high quality two-dimensional materials contributes significantly to the nation's economy and advances prosperity and welfare. The award aligns well with NSF's Quantum Leap effort because two-dimensional materials with controlled film thickness and point defects are candidate materials for quantum devices, including sensing, computing and communicating. This research is multidisciplinary, including manufacturing, electrochemistry and nanotechnology, and motivates students with diverse backgrounds to consider future careers in science and engineering. The project develops an energy education module in collaboration with high school teachers to teach energy storage mechanisms and calculation of energy and power densities tied with chemistry, physics, and math curricula. The energy education module can be tested and expanded over a broad range of underrepresented students through NSF INCLUDES program. <br/><br/>The electrochemical manufacturing process has many advantages over conventional manufacturing techniques of fabricating two-dimensional (2D) atomic layer materials, including low-cost, simple operation, rapid production rate, and in-situ functionalization, by taking advantage of scalable and controllable nature of the electrochemical process. However, some scientific barriers, such as mechanistic understanding of electrochemical exfoliation and quantitative methods for controlling the structure and properties, need to be overcome in order to realize the full potential of electrochemical manufacturing of 2D materials. This project investigates comprehensive and general expansion, exfoliation and functionalization mechanisms during the manufacture of these materials in electrochemical processing, specifically, structural changes and gas formation as a function of applied potential. It evaluates properties of the electrochemical processed materials, and establishes processing parameter-structure-property relationships. The work can potentially transform the manufacturing process of 2D materials into a highly scalable and controllable process that can fabricate structure- and property-tuned 2D nanomaterials for specific target applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the current effects of glacier retreat on water supply in these regions can shed light on future water security threats in snow and ice-covered mountainous watersheds worldwide.  Glaciers are the ""water towers"" of the mountains: they store ice during wet periods and gradually release meltwater during dry periods. However, whether groundwater aquifers serve as extended reservoirs and whether plants also take up significant glacial meltwater remain unresolved questions.  These uncertainties make it difficult to predict the future reliability of water supply in mountainous watersheds, as glacier melt first accelerates and then eventually disappears, and as plants move to higher elevations in response to warming temperatures.  This project will develop a new and general computational watershed model that will incorporate chemical and isotopic data for tracing water flow source regions, as well as measurements from innovative low-cost, open-source environmental monitoring technologies. Results from the model can inform communities that rely on stream discharge from ice and snow-covered mountainous watersheds about present with regard to future water resources vulnerabilities, and can facilitate adaptation strategies as glacier retreat accelerates. <br/><br/>	The recession of glaciers will curtail their ability to modulate river discharge and its variability. Studies of this hydrologic consequence typically classify meltwater and groundwater as distinct contributors to streamflow, but this oversimplifies the potentially complex relationships among glaciers, their underlying groundwater systems, and ecohydrologic pathways. The investigators propose to assess these relationships using an integrated data-model approach in four rapidly changing, glacierized Ecuadorian watersheds, two each at Volcn Chimborazo and Volcn Cayambe. This work will produce a new isotope-enabled watershed model with reactive transport, to which data assimilation will be introduced in order to condition uncertain simulations in data-sparse watersheds with robust environmental tracers.  Open-source data loggers and sensors for measuring model input data will further advance critical-zone process understanding beyond data-intensive sites to remote settings that are undergoing some of the most rapid environmental change in the world.  This work will shed light on less-studied volcanic ranges that potentially facilitate greater infiltration of meltwater through their fractured bedrock, as well as expand the established water-resources focus on glacier retreat to also consider vegetation shift when examining the hydrologic response of glacierized mountainous watersheds to glacier retreat.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, these are influenced by the aerosol particles that act as nuclei for the formation of cloud droplets. This project will investigate on how the aerosols and cloud droplets interact within a turbulent environment, in the context of both the aerosol first and second indirect effects (albedo and lifetime effects).<br/><br/>The studies will be performed in the Pi Chamber, in which clouds are generated through isobaric mixing within a turbulent environment. The laboratory environment allows for aerosol-cloud interaction in the presence of constant thermodynamic forcing and turbulence properties. The laboratory system does not attempt to reconstruct the full complexity of the atmosphere, but rather aims to isolate specific aspects of the aerosol-cloud system.<br/><br/>Objectives of the project are to investigate the transient response of clouds as they interact with and cleanse the surrounding aerosol population; To investigate supersaturation variability in a turbulent environment; To investigate the growth of cloud droplets in a steady-state, turbulent environment, specifically to understand the relative roles of the phase relaxation time and the turbulence correlation times; To continue development of a Large Eddy Simulation (LES)/bin-microphysics model for comparison with and interpretation of laboratory observations, with the eventual purpose of serving as a bridge to the full atmospheric context; And to perform initial exploratory work on the ability to form and measure mixed-phase clouds.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Results from the Pi Chamber have already led to the verification that cloud droplet growth by condensation is fundamentally different when the phase relaxation time is small or large compared to the turbulence correlation time; and to the illustration that this provides a mechanism for accelerating aerosol activation and cloud collapse. Both of these processes are fundamentally linked to aerosol-cloud interactions and their influence on indirect effects. This research builds directly on those results and will lead to a deeper understanding of cloud cleansing of aerosols, supersaturation variability in turbulent flows, and how that supersaturation variability influences the broadening of cloud droplet size distributions, key aspects of the precipitation formation problem. The results also will be compared with a LES/bin microphysics cloud model that can serve as a link to studying the phenomena identified in the laboratory in the context of the more complex atmosphere. Finally, the study will provide further insight into the conditions necessary to generate steady-state mixed-phase clouds.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Precipitation formation and radiative properties of clouds are critical aspects of the climate and weather forecasting problems. They are therefore issues of immediate societal relevance and have potential to translate to tangible economic benefits and improvements in the human condition.<br/><br/>The Pi Chamber uses Rayleigh-Benard convection as the mechanism for producing supersaturation for cloud formation. The research will contribute to the diverse community of researchers studying Rayleigh-Benard convection. It will have relevance to the vast range of applied problems studied by that community, from stellar atmospheres to the earth's mantle to applications of myriad engineering problems involving turbulent heat transfer.<br/><br/>Finally, the Pi Chamber provides valuable opportunities for education: from outreach at the K-12 levels, to undergraduate internships and senior projects, and finally to graduate student and postdoctoral research. The current project includes support for two full-time graduate students who will become well versed in the operation of the cloud chamber as well as with the wide range of associated instrumentation.  Outreach events in the cloud chamber lab will be continued on a regular basis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process is called nitrogen fixation and it is important ecologically because it allows microorganisms to live in habitats where they would otherwise be unable to grow.  Nitrogen fixation occurs both on land and in the oceans.  One of the key questions facing oceanographers today is resolving how much nitrogen fixation is occurring in the surface ocean and how it varies temporally, on timescales of days to seasons, and spatially, across different biomes.  This work will develop high throughput analysis of nitrogen fixation at sea so that measurements can be made in real-time onboard oceanographic research vessels.  This will help improve targeted sampling of the water-column and facilitate the comparison of nitrogen fixation with rates of photosynthesis which are currently conducted on timescales of minutes to hours.  The work will be done at the Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE) where Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders majoring in an ocean or earth science-related field are given opportunities for scientific training and laboratory experience.  To engage the high-school students in the work and inform them about opportunities in scientific careers, we will hold one to two outreach events per year targeting sixth to eighth grade girls at local public charter schools.<br/><br/>This research will use a highly-sensitive reduced gas analyzer to quantify the production of hydrogen gas which is a metabolic by-product of the nitrogen fixation process.  To improve the detection limit, seawater samples will be sparged with the inert gas argon to inhibit the reduction of nitrogen gas by the nitrogenase enzyme.  Under this scenario, nitrogenase transfers all the electrons used to reduce nitrogen gas into the production of hydrogen.  This technique of amplifying the production of hydrogen via nitrogen fixation is familiar to the biohydrogen research community and will be developed for sea-going oceanographic purposes.  This proposal will test the method on laboratory cultures of diazotrophs to verify the ratio of hydrogen gas production to traditional methods of nitrogen fixation analysis such as stable isotope incorporation into biomass.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events result in more than just the loss of physical property, as community and neighborhood attributes encompass many different aspects of an individual's social relationships and the cultural institutions. Moving to a new community changes these attributes and will affect an individual's political attitudes and behaviors. This research is therefore able to address not just the immediate policy implications of such displacements but also a classic and important question in social science: how does local context affects political opinions and behaviors? The ongoing post-Harvey migration provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of social contact and political context in a case where these encounters could not have otherwise been anticipated by the individuals affected. This project will examine the political consequences of Hurricane Harvey by studying post-Harvey migration patterns as an unexpected or exogenous shock. The exogenous shock will allow an understanding of (1) variations in the decision of displaced individuals to move to different areas and how this affects their associated experiences once they move, and (2) how people's political attitudes and behaviors change in response to rapid demographic shifts in their communities. <br/><br/>This research holds great significance because geographic residence is rarely if ever randomly assigned, which makes it difficult to establish whether observed correlations are the result of contextual effects or individuals' self-selection into particular ideological and social communities. Similarly, social contact may have a positive effect because those individuals willing to engage across social barriers are also the individuals who are more likely to change their minds on political issues. This research project teases apart these potentially confounding variables to truly understand their independent effects. To study these relationships, publicly available data from Twitter and the Texas voter registration file will be used. The ongoing post-Harvey migration provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of social contact and political context in a case where these encounters could not have otherwise been anticipated. This work will build on results on the political attitudes of displaced individuals after Hurricane Katrina.

For example, harmful algal blooms in lakes can appear suddenly in response to subtle changes in environmental conditions. Knowing when and where they are likely to happen in time to prevent them or to reduce their impact can be quite challenging. Some scientists have suggested that there may be early warnings of algal blooms detectable by frequent measurements of water quality. Recent advances in technology now make it possible to measure water quality in real time using sensors.  These high frequency data provide a way to develop early warnings of imminent blooms of harmful algae. An effective early warning system will help scientists understand what causes harmful algal blooms and develop strategies to prevent them. This research will study how to use spatial patterns, in addition to changes over time, to more effectively detect early warnings in lakes where harmful algal blooms are expected to occur. The goal is to create a new approach to predicting when and where large changes to ecosystems will occur. The results will be useful for management as harmful algal blooms are a serious water quality and public health problem. Early warnings before blooms begin could help managers protect beaches, water quality, and other important public resources. This project will also involve outreach to journalists to help educate the public about efforts to prevent harmful algal blooms.<br/><br/>Empirical evaluation of spatial pattern in ecosystems requires a means of repeatedly generating spatially rich data. The Fast Limnology Automated Measurement (FLAMe) platform rapidly determines the spatial distribution of a suite of variables including phytoplankton pigments that are diagnostic of algal blooms. The project will generate pigment maps and a variety of spatial statistics using the FLAMe platform. Spatial patterns will be studied for lakes across a natural nutrient loading gradient and for a set of eutrophic lakes. Dynamic spatial models of lake phytoplankton will be developed to evaluate existing indicators and possibly develop new ones. Lakes near thresholds for algal blooms are hypothesized to have higher spatial variance, autocorrelation, and skewness than either more oligotrophic (low nutrient inputs) or more eutrophic lakes (high nutrient inputs). Spatial early warnings will be tested in a whole lake manipulation that compares a nutrient enriched lake to an unenriched reference lake. The enriched lake is hypothesized to increase in spatial variance, autocorrelation, and skewness prior to the development of a bloom. The research will provide new knowledge of spatial patterns in lakes as nutrient status changes, as well as new insights about spatial variability and change indicators. The study will systematically explore spatial indicators for blooms and generate hypotheses testable in other types of ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ubiquitination is a modification of proteins with a number of biological functions including signaling. For example, when DNA is damaged, ubiquitination plays a critical role in activating specific response pathways to initiate DNA damage repair.  A newly developed quantitative chemical proteomics approach is  applied to reveal just how this takes place. Experimental studies are expected to identify novel ubiquitination-dependent regulatory mechanisms and find previously unknown enzymatic activities in DNA damage response. During the project, undergraduate biochemistry students train with interdisciplinary techniques in chemical synthesis and quantitative proteomics through a fully integrated chemical proteomic training program. Additional outreach programs promote biochemistry education for high school students through specifically designed field learning activities.<br/><br/>The research projects integrate the new isotope-encoded stoichiometry analysis method and chemical proteomics strategies to functionally dissect ubiquitination signaling pathways. Compared to the traditional relative quantification, this approach enables site-specific absolute quantification of ubiquitination prevalence and, therefore, allows the identification of ubiquitination targets that are stoichiometrically activated in specific biological processes. This strategy is applied to determine the dynamic activation of ubiquitination signaling during DNA double-strand break. Temporal dynamics analysis and functional validation reveal key regulatory ubiquitination targets that are critical for the activation of specific response pathways. In vitro and in vivo quantitative analysis determine the substrate dynamics and specificities of important ubiquitination E3 ligases in double-strand break and repair. Overall, these studies provide mechanistic insights into the ubiquitination-mediated signaling and regulatory pathways in DNA damage and response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One challenge facing military spouses is that of finding work and maintaining a career in the face of repeated moves and deployments.  This project will reveal whether and the extent to which the public and employers view military spouse job seekers differently than their civilian peers, and if so, how frequent geographic mobility in the past, or assumptions about moves in the future, influence the perceptions of military spouses as job candidates. The project studies how stereotypes of military spouses as frequent movers and job changers may lead to anticipatory discrimination based on presumptions of future behavior when seeking work. Because military spouse employment problems may influence the retention decisions of their service member, this issue has implications for recruiting and retention of a high-quality military force. In doing so, this study offers evidence that may be useful in creating effective policy solutions for military families, as well as other dual income households. <br/><br/>This study will use complementary experimental and qualitative methods, including survey vignette experiments with actual hiring agents and a series of employer interviews, to identify whether and to what extent hiring agents treat military spouses seeking employment differently than similar civilian peers, and why. The project develops and tests a theory of anticipatory discrimination by explicitly evaluating how past geographic mobility and future expectations of geographic stability influence evaluations of women job seekers, and whether past and future geographic stability accounts for any differential evaluations of military spouse job seekers. The survey experiment is complemented by interviews with actual hiring agents in four labor markets to understand their past experiences with military spouse employees, how they perceive them as applicants, and how hiring decisions are influenced by anticipated futures of these applicants.  The proposed research enhances the study of military spouses and tied migrant labor market outcomes in several ways. First, the project provides explicit attitudinal and behavioral evidence of differential treatment of military spouses relative to civilian spouses. Second, the study broadens the research base on military spouse and tied migrant employment by locating employers as central influences on military spouse unemployment. Third, the proposed research also tests how military spouses and civilian tied migrants are evaluated across labor markets characterized by different levels of military presence. While the case under study centers on one type of worker, similar processes operate with other groups. The concept of anticipatory discrimination may offer new ways to conceive of legal protections for categories of workers based around presumed or actual future statuses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the ability to forecast the track of tropical cyclones has improved, gaps remain in the knowledge and understanding of their formation or genesis, which is reflected in poorer forecasts.  Recent results suggest that the African easterly waves pathway to genesis in the Atlantic Basin is influenced by the passage of eastward-moving convectively coupled Kelvin Waves.  However, a quantitative assessment of the processes and predictability of these interactions is lacking.  This collaborative research project between the University of Miami and the University at Albany seeks to provide such a quantitative assessment and to seek a more definite answer to an outstanding question in the tropical storm research: ""why do some African easterly waves develop into Tropical Cyclone (TC) and others do not?"".  The project is divided into three phases.  The first phase will use three decades of observational and reanalysis data to test hypotheses on the physical mechanisms related to the attribution of genesis or lack of genesis to convectively coupled Kelvin Waves, on time scales of 1-3 days.  The second phase will use two decades of archived ensemble forecast data to investigate and quantify the predictability in the context of these physical mechanisms.  The third phase will extend these ideas out to 1-2 weeks, accounting for the roles of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and El Nio and the Southern Oscillation.  One novel aspect of the project is the awareness of the need to take account of convectively coupled Kelvin Wave amplitude and favorability of African Easterly Wave structures for genesis.  A second novel development is to use ensemble forecasts to push the boundaries of predictability, in identifying the extent to which the complex interactions are predictable out to 1-2 weeks, and connecting the predictability ideas to the governing physical mechanisms and large-scale flow regimes.<br/><br/>The research will provide quantitative information to support tropical forecasters.  The research will also bridge the gap between the weather and subseasonal prediction communities by advancing our understanding of science and predictability beyond traditional weather time scales, which is recognized nationally and globally as a priority.  This will lead to the identification of regimes where predictive skill of genesis and tropical cyclone activity is high or low, thereby providing information to forecasters and ultimately the decision makers who take actions based on a potential tropical cyclone threat.  A by-product of the research will be the feedback provided to operational modeling centers on strengths and weaknesses of their ensemble forecasts.  Diagnostic tools developed in this research will be shared with the research community.  The project will also advance Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education by funding two students to pursue doctoral research, and in advancing new undergraduate and graduate courses on tropical meteorology.  An annual exchange between Miami and Albany will enable the students to visit meteorological centers and facilities in their reciprocal cities.  Undergraduate Honors thesis projects will be developed.  Several outreach activities related to tropical cyclones, aimed at increasing scientific literacy among decision-makers, the media and public will be continued as part of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Millimeter Wave (mmWave) bands are expected to deliver multi-Gigabit-per-second (Gbps) wireless data rates that will be central to next-generation (5G) cellular networks as well as wireless local networks. Networks using these bands will also enable new applications such as virtual and augmented reality, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and a surge of multimedia and Internet-of-Things traffic. Millimeter wave technology, however, is fundamentally different from existing wireless technologies such as WiFi and cellular networks due to its physical properties, including directionality, wide bandwidth, and sparsity. As a result, today's mmWave systems face new challenges, in terms of mobility, medium access, and control overhead, which prevent them from scaling and supporting mobile networks. The research proposed in this project will address these challenges to unleash the potential of mmWave technologies. The project will design and build practical, scalable, mobile millimeter-wave networks for next generation communication systems. The project will also integrate mmWave communication into novel applications like virtual reality (VR) and self-driving cars. The proposed research will be disseminated through close collaboration with industry and publication in top research venues. It will also be integrated into education through the design of new undergraduate and graduate wireless classes and involvement in community outreach programs. <br/><br/>The proposal will enable practical, agile and mobile mmWave networks and integrate them into higher layer applications.

Glaciers are the ""water towers"" of the mountains: they store ice during wet periods and gradually release meltwater during dry periods. However, whether groundwater aquifers serve as extended reservoirs and whether plants also take up significant glacial meltwater remain unresolved questions.  These uncertainties make it difficult to predict the future reliability of water supply in mountainous watersheds, as glacier melt first accelerates and then eventually disappears, and as plants move to higher elevations in response to warming temperatures.  This project will develop a new and general computational watershed model that will incorporate chemical and isotopic data for tracing water flow source regions, as well as measurements from innovative low-cost, open-source environmental monitoring technologies. Results from the model can inform communities that rely on stream discharge from ice and snow-covered mountainous watersheds about present with regard to future water resources vulnerabilities, and can facilitate adaptation strategies as glacier retreat accelerates. <br/><br/>	The recession of glaciers will curtail their ability to modulate river discharge and its variability. Studies of this hydrologic consequence typically classify meltwater and groundwater as distinct contributors to streamflow, but this oversimplifies the potentially complex relationships among glaciers, their underlying groundwater systems, and ecohydrologic pathways. The investigators propose to assess these relationships using an integrated data-model approach in four rapidly changing, glacierized Ecuadorian watersheds, two each at Volcn Chimborazo and Volcn Cayambe. This work will produce a new isotope-enabled watershed model with reactive transport, to which data assimilation will be introduced in order to condition uncertain simulations in data-sparse watersheds with robust environmental tracers.  Open-source data loggers and sensors for measuring model input data will further advance critical-zone process understanding beyond data-intensive sites to remote settings that are undergoing some of the most rapid environmental change in the world.  This work will shed light on less-studied volcanic ranges that potentially facilitate greater infiltration of meltwater through their fractured bedrock, as well as expand the established water-resources focus on glacier retreat to also consider vegetation shift when examining the hydrologic response of glacierized mountainous watersheds to glacier retreat.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ignoring this uncertainty typically leads to inferior solutions that perform poorly in practice due to the notorious flaw of averages, whereby plans based on the assumption that average conditions pre-vail are usually wrong. These decision problems are often also dynamic in nature they span across multiple time stages and involve high dimensional non-anticipative recourse decisions which further increase the problem complexity. Thus, effective and efficient solution schemes for these decision problems are highly desirable. Traditional solution schemes, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality and are extremely challenging to solve. Recent advances in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) have been successful in mitigating the intractability of various single-stage decision problems under uncertainty. In DRO, we seek a decision that performs best in view of the most adverse distribution of uncertain parameters that is consistent with the available statistical and structural information. Thus, DRO not only improves computational tractability but also alleviates the overfitting effects characteristic of the traditional solution schemes. By leveraging and inventing new techniques in DRO, the proposed research work aims to significantly advance the state-of-the-art methodologies for addressing the challenges of dynamic decision problems and to initiate the effort for industrial-size applications. The research outputs of this work will have a significant and immediate practical impact on important applications in energy, engineering, machine learning, operations management, finance, etc., and on learning problems in robotics and automatic control. This CAREER work will also advance the state of pedagogy by developing an integrated curriculum that bridges the gap between the deep theory of decision-making under uncertainty and the real-life practice. The proposed curriculum is aimed at future practitioners and researchers, and is designed to equip these experts with the analytical skills and tools to deal with real-life decision-making problems under uncertainty.<br/><br/>The proposed research work is aimed at addressing a major gap in the theory and practice of decision-making under uncertainty. It concentrates on four main research thrusts: 1) Derive exact mixed-integer conic programming (MICP) reformulations for convex dynamic problems as well as for dynamic problems with discrete decisions 2) Deal with the case of endogenous uncertainty whose representation depends explicitly on the chosen decisions 3) Systematically integrate data into the description of uncertainty. Obtain provable out-of-sample performance guarantees from the resulting data-driven DRO models 4) Derive exact MICP reformulations for inverse optimization problems in the dynamic setting. The proposed research effort endeavors to develop more powerful solution schemes which leverage standard off-the-shelf MICP solvers for various intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty. The work will establish a new connection between generic dynamic DRO models and renowned classes of mixed-integer conic programs. The resulting connection will give us a better understanding of the inherent difficulty of the decision problems and enable us to derive attractive performance guarantees for the new solution schemes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because companies in the sharing economy span a range of services, and because their platforms have become hugely popular, local actors and organizations are now in a political struggle over the implications for other markets and regulatory policy. Such contentious politics have brought into question the viability of sharing economy platforms as city policymakers consider revising local regulations to accommodate the platforms or in some cases, banning them wholly. Most research on the development of new markets focuses either on the social structures that facilitate a market's emergence or on the politics involved to adapt it to existing norms and rules. This project synthesizes the two different perspectives to examine how one of the largest markets in the sharing economy, the short-term rental or ?home-sharing? sector, develops in the context of other local structures and politics. Findings from this research will show new configurations of power emerging from local sharing economy markets. These findings will also contribute to public conversation and policy discussions on the sharing economy, market regulation, lobbying and municipal government transparency.<br/> <br/>The research combines the richness of qualitative investigation with the scope of computational and quantitative methods. Specifically, it analyzes quantitative data from short-term rental websites, the Census, nonprofit organizations, and hotels for 300 U.S. cities and metropolitan areas. It will also use new and original data collected by the researchers, including a dataset on municipal budgets and short-term rental ordinances as well as interview, historical, and participant observation data from a case study of short-term rentals in Los Angeles. In doing so, it extends scholarly understandings of markets to account for the ways in which the local and organizational contexts in which markets emerge also shape the politics over their regulation. Additionally, it considers the distinct resource and political constituency of sharing economy markets--the crowd--in these processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. <br/><br/>The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses.

Introductory calculus is an important course in undergraduate STEM curricula, and the design and teaching enhancements proposed in this project have the potential to increase the retention, graduation, and quality of STEM majors nationwide. The mathematical-modeling approach to differential equations uses best practices in STEM undergraduate teaching: it is hands-on, problem-based, inquiry-driven, and incorporates group learning. The project will create teaching materials that focus on real world data and encourage students to transfer knowledge between mathematics and other disciplines. The project will combine in-person and virtual support for faculty seeking to adopt a mathematical-modeling approach in their own classrooms. This support includes workshops, panel discussions, presentations at regional and national conferences, and mentoring in an online community. The project will support different levels of faculty engagement: some faculty will introduce a few modeling activities into their classes while others will complete a full curriculum shift to mathematical models. Finally, the project will conduct research on the efficacy of specific approaches to faculty development. <br/><br/>The first part of the project will support the development of peer-reviewed, open-source teaching materials that will be made available to the public through SIMIODE's HUBZero platform. The online platform will allow users and authors to share comments, modifications, and extensions of the material. The project will also promote awareness of this modeling approach through dissemination of teaching materials at conferences. Secondly, the project will provide initial and long-term support for faculty development via an online community and in-person workshops.  These workshops will focus on incorporating these materials into courses, thus encouraging a sustained pedagogical shift from technique-driven to a model-driven approach. Summer workshops and annual mini-courses at national conferences will demonstrate the modeling approach to teaching differential equations and will provide in-person mentoring and support to faculty adopting this approach. Throughout the project, the assessment team will review the effectiveness of the online communities and in-person workshops so the program staff can modify them to provide the best support. SIMIODE employs a double-blind peer review of published materials by a Board of Contributing Advisors that includes material authors and users. The Board and participants will also provide feedback on the efficacy of the project's activities in delivering faculty support needed to affect pedagogical change. The online community platform will provide the flexibility needed to adapt multiple approaches in faculty support, (e.g., webinars; group or individual mentoring) as dictated by the ongoing formative project assessment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All cells are coated in a sugar-rich coating of long molecules called a glycocalyx.  The glycocalyx changes dramatically in many lethal diseases, but little is known about how changes in this cell coating make a disease better or worse.  This project will create new tools for precision engineering of the mechanical properties of the glycocalyx.  They will be used to determine the role of glycocalyx in cell migration.  Cell migration is crucial in how many diseases progress.  For example, the results of the project could lead to new approaches to preventing the spread of metastatic cancer cells.  The tools for glycocalyx engineering are expected to be applied broadly in biotechnology to generate protective and anti-adhesive coatings on cells for diverse applications, including cell-based therapies and cellular production systems for bio-manufacturing. Therefore, results from this research will be important beyond basic research.

Recent studies emphasize that cells can migrate independent of integrins in 3D environments, where the glycocalyx is believed to provide traction against the extracellular matrix (ECM) for propulsion.  Despite the growing appreciation for the role of the glycocalyx in cell migration and mechanotransduction, our overall physical understanding of the structure and its precise mechanisms of action in cell motility remain primitive.  The research will address this challenge through development of a new toolkit for precision engineering of the glycocalyx and application of the toolkit, along with nanoscale imaging approaches, to understand the physical function of the glycocalyx in cell migration.  The research will test the specific hypothesis that the glycocalyx provides physical cues that direct acquisition of specific migration phenotypes in confined 3D environments.

Carbon chemistry at depth is responsible for carbon sequestration and volcanism. The growth of diamonds at depth not only drives an industry, but also traps and preserves our only samples of Earth's deep interior. Earth's lower mantle, the Earth's biggest layer, has great capacity for carbon even at very low concentrations and is thus important to the global carbon budget. The project will integrate research in the role of the mantle in Earth's deep carbon cycle with an education plan that includes recruitment of diverse students to laboratory geoscience and improves teaching of spatial reasoning, a critical skill for Earth scientists, at Michigan State University (MSU) and beyond. The whole-Earth carbon cycle is a timely subject well-suited to outreach to attract students with interest in environmental problems to careers in geosciences. Short modules on carbon mineralogy and geochemistry will be developed for gateway courses in geology and global change at MSU. The effectiveness of these exercises will be assessed in terms of recruitment of undergraduate majors and developing spatial reasoning skills for geoscience careers. Undergraduate and graduate research assistants will participate both in the lab and in geoscience teaching evaluation.<br/><br/>The primary research goal is to determine the stability of carbon-bearing phases in petrologic context at conditions of the lower mantle. Depth- and region-dependent differences in mantle mineralogy and oxygen fugacity (fO2) will result in changes in the speciation and host phases of carbon within the mantle phase assemblage. Quantifying the relationship between stability of carbon-bearing phases and pressure, temperature, redox conditions, and major mineralogy is critical to understanding the fate of carbon in Earth's interior. Experiments performed in laser-heated diamond anvil cells will provide some of the first experimental constraints on carbonate and carbide stability and physical properties in petrologic context of mantle phase assemblages at pressure-temperature conditions reaching the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB). The results of the proposed experiments will be necessary to an integrated understanding of the origin, storage, and flux of carbon among a community including geochemists, cosmochemists, volcanologists, petrologists, mineralogists, and geophysicists. Earth's carbon cycle and popular interest in diamonds offer an opportunity to teach and recruit students through coursework and research assistantships. The education component of this project is a collaboration between the PI and geocognition expert Dr. Julie Libarkin to develop and evaluate educational modules incorporating deep carbon context and developing 3D reasoning skills.

In addition, this research program will benefit society and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education by creating a wide range of automation systems that can improve the quality of care of critically ill patients, expediting the deployment of new medical devices with advanced automation capabilities, facilitating the evaluation and approval of emerging healthcare automation capabilities, and training STEM workforce especially from underrepresented minorities.  <br/><br/>With the long-term vision of enabling interpretable white-box autonomy in healthcare by advancing generalizable methodologies for medical cyber-physical systems (M-CPS), the objective of this CAREER program is to investigate physiological modeling, coordinated and resilient multivariable closed-loop control, and regulatory science methodologies in circulatory resuscitation.  An integrated research, education, and outreach program is proposed to achieve this objective.  On the research front, physiological modeling and closed-loop control methodologies applicable to white-box autonomy in a wide range of circulatory resuscitation scenarios will be investigated.  Specifically, generalizable methodologies for (1) patient physiology and pharmacology modeling and (2) coordinated and resilient multivariable closed-loop control will be developed.  The value of these methodologies will be demonstrated by developing interpretable white-box physiological closed-loop control algorithms for circulatory resuscitation.  On the education and outreach front, members of the next-generation M-CPS workforce will be trained and regulatory science for evaluating critical care autonomy capabilities will be advanced.  Specifically, (1) graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students will be attracted into STEM and M-CPS, (2) collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration will be performed to investigate testing methodologies and tools for physiological models and closed-loop M-CPS via its Medical Device Development Tools Program, and (3) newly created knowledge will be disseminated to further advance M-CPS research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The subject of Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) has provided a critical testing ground where ideas from theoretical physics inform rigorous mathematical frameworks that lay the foundation for a quantum theory of gravity.   TQFTs have been particularly well studied in 3-dimensions, bringing about unprecedented interaction between mathematics and theoretical physics. Since the world we live in is 4-dimensional (including time),  truly understand it requires an extension of the techniques of 3-dimensional TQFTs into 4-dimensions.  This enhancement of mathematical structures has come to be called ""Categorification"".    This conference will advance this ambitious program to understand 4-dimensional TQFTs, while proving important opportunities for the establishment of new collaborations and the scientific development of young scientists.<br/><br/>The ""TQFT and Categorification"" conference  aims to bring together researchers from different horizons around the central question of lifting the techniques from the study of 3-dimensional TQFTs to 4-dimensions.  The conference will be organized around three central themes: Heegaard-Floer homologies and symplectic geometry,  Algebraic categorification (including Khovanov homology, categorified quantum groups, and categorification at roots of the unity),  and  TQFT (including connections to physics,  super homologies, and non-semisimple invariants).

Global costs of rapid sea-level rise to infrastructure (e.g., houses, roads, farms, ports) are likely to be large.  A possible source of water for sea-level rise is the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and Thwaites Glacier in particular.  Ice sheets and glaciers contain vast quantities of water (in the form of ice) that is continually shed to the ocean, and continually replenished by snowfall (from water that evaporates from the oceans).  If the amount of ice that Thwaites Glacier loses to the ocean over the next decades is much greater than the amount it receives as snowfall, then sea level in all the world's oceans would rise, possibly as much as a meter (approximately 3 feet).  In order to estimate how likely such a catastrophic scenario would be, we need to better understand the surface over which Thwaites Glacier slides.  If we can better characterize that layer (""is to smooth? Is it rough? Is it soft? Is it hard?""), then computer models of Thwaites would be much improved and we can make better projections of the amount of ice that Thwaites Glacier would shed to the ocean.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project are to learn whether basal conditions allow for rapid retreat of the Thwaites Glacier grounding line or whether retreat may re-stabilize near its current grounding line. These objectives will be achieved by using dedicated ice-flow modeling to guide targeted field surveys and experiments over two seasons, and to measure the most important unknown quantities and incorporate them into the models. Numerical models will be used to generate hypotheses for basal conditions that are testable through geophysical surveys and to project future behavior of Thwaites Glacier after assimilating the resulting data. The geophysical methods include seismic, radar, gravity, and electrical surveys that together will allow for a fuller characterization of the bed.  We will conduct field surveys in areas representative of different parts of the glacier, including across the margins, near the grounding line, and along the central axis of the glacier into its catchment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent studies show that these courses often promote the fixed mindset, or the belief that programming aptitude is an inborn trait. Psychology research shows that students with the fixed mindset view mistakes as indications of low ability and perform poorly in the face of challenge. In contrast, students with the growth mindset believe that programming aptitude is malleable and excel when challenged. This project aims to design, build, and evaluate programming tools that help students develop the growth mindset by automatically detecting and praising good learning behaviors as students write code. This research will contribute scientific knowledge about the growth mindset in the domain of computer science and provide insights about the process of learning to program. The project team will deploy the tools to hundreds of students at their own university and release them for free online for any student or teacher to use. If successful, this intervention has the potential to improve the experiences, skills, and diversity of students who successfully complete programming courses and go on to participate in employment and research in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a new growth mindset intervention that leverages the programming environment by using artificial intelligence techniques to automatically detect and praise good learning processes in real time. Programming environments provide a unique opportunity to track and understand student learning behaviors, and offer a scalable environment for praising good practices automatically. By exposing and praising the learning process, this intervention will teach students to attribute their successes and failures to malleable learning processes, rather than an innate aptitude for computer science. This research will be conducted in two phases. First, the project team will develop heuristics that detect good learning processes using behavioral log data, leveraging the computer science education literature and studying the behavior of fixed and growth mindset students to identify good processes. Second, the team will iteratively design and build a programming environment extension that uses the validated heuristics to automatically detect and praise good learning process, and evaluate this intervention through a controlled ten-week study with university students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In commercial fishing, drones<br/>will replace manned aircraft for fish-finding operations, radically reducing cost and risk. In maritime<br/>security, drones will provide surveillance around ships, including locating a ?man-overboard? in<br/>time to save the person?s life. In the oil and gas industry, drones will provide rapid-response to oil<br/>spills by mapping the location and extent of the oil slick, limiting the environmental and economic<br/>damage. In hydrographic surveying, drones will identify and geo-locate navigation aids, at a<br/>fraction of the time and cost of current survey methods.

In the transport industry, drones<br/>will delivery packages the ?last mile? from a delivery truck to a customer?s door. In law enforcement<br/>and border security, drones will operate from moving patrol vehicles while officers remain safe<br/>and mobile in the vehicle.

Another lesser-known, non-conventional mode of inheritance is called microchimerism, whereby cells travel between mother and baby during pregnancy, and some colonize and persist for decades after birth. This doctoral dissertation project leverages data from a multigenerational, longitudinal health and nutrition study to investigate microchimerism as a mediating factor in immune tradeoffs throughout the life course. The research aims to better understand how microchimerism may be associated with fetal growth during pregnancy, infant feeding practices, early childhood infectious disease, and pregnancy outcomes in adults. The publicly available data from this longitudinal study and the newly-generated microchimerism data will provide opportunities for student-driven research for undergraduates, including individuals from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Microchimerism is thought to influence host immune function by directly contributing stem cells that differentiate and develop into functional immune cells and expressing foreign antigens that trigger host immune responses. Most microchimerism research has focused on relationships with autoimmune disorders, cancer, transplant biology, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, leaving considerable gaps in understanding why some individuals are colonized by microchimeric cells more than others, and how these differences might impact evolutionary fitness. To clarify these issues, population-based data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey spanning three generations of participants will be used to investigate the following specific aims: 1) evaluate whether having been breastfed in infancy predicts microchimerism in adulthood, 2) assess whether microchimerism is associated with lower risk of early life infection, and 3) determine whether adult women with microchimerism from their mothers have lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes as they have offspring of their own.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Virtual reality is a multidisciplinary field involving human-centered computer simulations that seek to imitate or augment real world senses (usually sight, sound, and touch) and experiences.  VR research includes the development and assessment of methods and systems, and facilitating and understanding user perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors.  First organized by the IEEE Computer Society in 1993 and held annually since 1995, IEEE Virtual Reality is the premier international conference and exhibition in this field and includes technical paper presentations, workshops, tutorials, research demonstrations, and exhibits from industry.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.ieeevr.org/2018.  The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide a unique venue for interactive, supportive, and prestigious mentoring for mid-level graduate students in virtual reality, to afford these students a valuable opportunity to get independent perspectives on their research from senior individuals with a wide collective breadth and depth of knowledge, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the VR community.  Due to this year's timing constraints, the 18 DC student participants (including 10 from US educational institutions and 8 from non-US institutions) have already been selected.  Special efforts were made to recruit participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field of computer science, including women, persons of color, and people with disabilities.<br/><br/>This year's IEEE VR Doctoral Consortium builds on the successful format of the previous such events, which were also supported by NSF.  The main activities of the DC will take place on Sunday, March 18, in parallel with the first day of IEEE 3DUI.  The workshop will include morning and afternoon sessions in which each student presents his/her work to the other student participants and a panel of senior VR researchers, with sufficient time set aside after each talk for discussion and constructive feedback that addresses the strengths of the work, challenges and issues that may arise, and implications of the results.  A group working lunch attended by all the students and mentors will be particularly valuable for unifying the individual goals and projects presented within the group as part of a ""big picture"" envisioning of the future of the field over the next 10-20 years.  The VR conference will begin the evening of Monday, March 19, with a welcome reception, where DC participants will network with what they have learned during the full day event.  DC attendees will also take part in a poster session, which will give them more opportunities to network and discuss their research.  Additional smaller activities, including a lunch with key leaders in the VR research community, will take place at scattered times over the rest of the week; in particular, small groups of 2-3 students will meet for mentoring lunches and/or other networking events with senior members of the VR community.  The conference organizers will generously provide as much financial support as possible to the DC through the conference's budget, including meeting space, audio-visual rental, and food and beverage during breaks for free.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the evolutionary context of this adaptive shift is not fully understood, in part because of methodological constraints in obtaining evidence of weaning from the fossil record. This doctoral dissertation project will analyze chemical signatures preserved in the teeth of wild mountain gorillas to determine how those signatures may be related to weaning and socioecological factors. Findings from this project could then serve as a foundation for applying this approach to the human fossil record.  This project will include scientific training and mentorship of students, including individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  It will also bolster research collaborations, support public science outreach and education, and inform ongoing primate conservation efforts.  <br/><br/>The investigators will test a developing method for reconstructing the timing of early-life dietary transitions from the distribution of calcium-normalized strontium and barium intensities in teeth, and to investigate weaning age variation within a single well-documented wild population of Virunga mountain gorillas from Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. The chemical signature of mountain gorilla food resources will be characterized in order to provide a context for interpreting variation in enamel and dentine barium and strontium intensities. Estimated weaned age from trace element analysis will then be compared to longitudinal records on wild mountain gorilla diet and suckling. The following questions will be addressed: 1) How well do trace element distributions in teeth correspond to behavioral observations of suckling and other metrics for determining weaning age (e.g., interbirth interval)? and 2) How does the weaning chemical signature vary within a wild mountain gorilla population? The ability to partner behavioral and chemical data from individuals in this population represents a unique opportunity to test an emerging methodology for recovering relatively high resolution evidence of weaning in the human fossil record.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, governments vary in terms of refugee integration policies. They allocate different amounts of resources for the economic, social, cultural, and legal participation of refugees. Second, the degree of success in the integration of immigrants and refugees varies by host societies. Examining this topic using an international comparative study design will allow for the development of a typology of reactions to refugees, as well as similarities and differences in the mechanisms of integration. This research will discover what works well and less well in the countries, and why. <br/><br/>The primary method of data collection in this qualitative project will be via in-depth interviews with Syrian refugees and other key informants including representatives of organizations who work with refugees. Interviews will be conducted with at least twenty Syrian refugees in each country--Canada, Germany, Turkey and the United States--in addition to about five key informant interviews per country. Interviews will take place in important refugee destinations in each country: Toronto; Buffalo; Istanbul; and Berlin. A purposive snowball sampling method will be used to recruit respondents. All interviews will be voice-recorded with a digital recorder and fully transcribed.

Convex optimization problems are a special class in which the constraints are simple enough that continuous problems gain geometric and/or discrete structures. These structures have been studied extensively over the past century. Some of these techniques like linear programming have become fundamental tools in all fields of science.  More recently, there have been interesting cases in which continuous methods have yielded advances in discrete optimization. In this project, the PI seeks to develop significantly more efficient algorithms to solve convex problems, especially problems come from graph and combinatorial problems. A major obstacle to developing nearly linear-time algorithms for both continuous and discrete problems is the lack of understanding of convex geometry and its connection to algorithms. <br/><br/>This project focuses on three key topics and related goals: 1) Algorithmic Convex Geometry: understand how well convex sets can be approximated by ellipsoids (KLS conjecture), explore ways to deform an explicit given polytope as a Riemannian manifold and use the deformations to develop faster polytope sampling algorithms; 2) Combinatorial Optimization: break the square root iterations barrier for solving linear programming by understanding the relation between convex geometry and interior point methods to develop a fine-grained complexity for interior point methods; 3) Convex Optimization: investigate cutting plane methods via the geometry of localization sets, develop efficient cutting plane methods via algorithmic convex geometry and explore non-convex optimizations via sampling algorithms.

The investigators will collect longitudinal data on behaviors and physiology from 49 Cayo Santiago rhesus macaque mothers during their first 3 months postpartum, when maternal care steeply decreases in preparation for the reproductive transition to the next offspring, and when maternal aggression towards others is heightened. Advances in field endocrinology, including the measurement of fecal hormone metabolites, will enable the continuous tracking of physiology along with a rich suite of behaviors and provide new methods for future studies.

In emergencies, forecasters predict the transport of ash using numerical models, but they typically assume that particles fall as individuals to simplify the analysis.  In reality, fine ash particles combine together into larger clusters, accelerating their rate of fall.  This allows the ash to fall out of the cloud.  Rates of aggregation depend on many factors, including moisture, electric charge, and turbulence.  There is limited existing data on the effects of these properties, particularly for turbulent flows, even though aggregation affects up to 95% of fallout in some eruptions.  Hence, there is a need for better experimental measurements of aggregation processes, along with more advanced models that include the phenomenon.<br/><br/>This study aims to improve forecasting of volcanic hazards through both high-accuracy experiments and upgraded models.  Ash aggregation will be examined in two different, relevant flow conditions: homogeneous turbulence and high-speed jets.  High-resolution optical techniques will be used to study the flow, turbulence, and particle clustering.  The results will be integrated into state-of-the-art analytical models, including some used for forecasting.  Further, this research will be presented to the broader public through a series of hands-on demonstrations at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kinetic tremors, where the limb oscillates around a target, result from cerebellar damage and resemble the behavior of feedback error-driven control systems, where slow sensory feedback results in the limb repeatedly over- and under-shooting its target. This deficit suggests that the cerebellum normally computes a 'forward model', i.e. a prediction of body kinematics, bypassing slow sensory feedback to guide movement. Physiological measurements support this model, where Purkinje neuron activity correlates perfectly with movement kinematics, yet the utility of this encoding is obscure at the level of the cerebellar nuclei, which form the sole output of the cerebellum. This proposal advances the hypothesis that the forward kinematic model of Purkinje neurons is refined in the cerebellar nuclei via convergence with a previously unrecognized corollary discharge afferent that exclusively targets the nuclei. The experiments proposed will test this hypothesis using a novel closed-loop reach paradigm in mice with awake-behaving neural recordings and neuronal branch-specific optogenetic manipulations.

This underrepresentation carries over into important aspects of their professional careers.  For example, women authors tend to publish less frequently in top field journals, find their work cited less frequently, and are often evaluated differently than men across a range of indicators.  This project seeks to identify the set of factors that help to explain why women are underrepresented in political science and to devise a mentoring program to assist women early in their careers.  To do so, they propose to conduct a cohort study of individuals who attended graduate school in the 1990s.  Next, they will administer a survey to learn more about perceptions of scholarly journals and publication success.  Finally, they propose an experimental mentoring program to identify the most effective strategies for promoting success for female scholars in political science. The research team is comprised of a number of successful scholars, most of whom are women, and will have the support of the American Political Science Association in helping to administer the studies and implement the mentoring program.     <br/><br/><br/>This project examines the factors that lead to the significant underrepresentation of tenured women in political science.

Many diseases are related to problems with the vascular system. Pericytes are special cells that stabilize growing blood vessels and maintain vascular health.  Illnesses like diabetic retinopathy, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer become worse when pericytes are disrupted. This project will increase fundamental understanding of pericytes by developing experimental and computational models of their involvement in blood vessel formation and function, with a specific focus on their interactions with the protein scaffold in tissues known as the extracellular matrix. The project will test the hypothesis that defects in the production of certain components of the extracellular matrix have profoundly negative consequences for pericyte behaviors and could therefore contribute to their dysfunction in certain diseases. The educational component of this project includes working with STEM education leaders to extend the research goals for the development of activities and lessons for primary and secondary educators to use as ""cross-curricular"" supplemental material. Training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students will also be incorporated, advancing the careers of students interested in gaining research experience and developing independent projects.<br/><br/>The project focuses on elucidating the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in mediating pericyte(PC)-endothelial cell (EC) interactions and their role in vascular development and maintenance of blood vessel integrity.

Much of this DOM is highly resistant to degradation (refractory) and aged, but the nature and reasons behind the accumulation of refractory DOM in the ocean is one of the unresolved mysteries of the marine carbon cycle. While marine sediments have been shown to be a globally important source of DOM to the ocean, the connection between sediment DOM dynamics and the oceanic DOM cycle remains elusive, because information is lacking on the molecular composition and reactivity of pore water DOM.  To fill this knowledge gap, this project will address the question of how refractory DOM is produced in sediments and the fate of benthic DOM in the water column.

However, the connection between sediment DOM dynamics and the oceanic DOM cycle remains elusive because information about the molecular composition and reactivity of pore water DOM is lacking.  To help fill this knowledge gap, this project will address the question of how refractory DOM is produced in sediments and the fate of the benthic DOM flux in the water column.   The proposed study explores a novel and potentially transformative idea that deamination of peptides in sediments is a source of refractory and 14C-depleted DOM in seawater. This idea is consistent not only with the fact that the majority of seawater dissolved organic nitrogen occurs in amide form, but also with recent reports about the widespread occurrence of nitrogen-bearing formulas in deep-sea refractory DOM. The central hypothesis will be tested through a unique blend of bottom-up (molecular level DOM analyses) and top-down (bulk-level elemental and isotopic analyses, and numerical modeling) approaches. This work will involve a combination of geochemical profiling of sediment cores collected across a range of redox conditions, and long-term sediment incubation studies conducted under controlled laboratory conditions.  At the heart of the proposed work is structural elucidation and quantification of intact and deaminated peptides in pore-water DOM using a state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system (ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer), which is expected to provide an unprecedented wealth of molecular-level information about pore water DOM.

Communities learn from the experience of disaster but often that learning does not lead to a policy change that reduces risks. Furthermore, communities vary in their capacity to mitigate future disasters. The broader impact of this study is to identify the limits on policy learning about disaster mitigation after a community has experienced a disaster. It is critical to understand why one community may be more vulnerable to a disaster than its neighbor. Hurricane Harvey presents a case for understanding the limits on policy learning after a disaster because of the range of communities it affected across Southeast Texas. Data will be collected using a series of semi-structured interviews over several months with local government officials - mayors, emergency managers and city planners - in communities affected by Hurricane Harvey. The intellectual merit of this project is the use of data collected directly from local government officials on policy learning after a disaster across time.   <br/><br/>This project asks what are the constraints on policy learning after disaster? The central theory of this project is that local governments will attempt to engage in policy learning after a natural disaster but those efforts will not necessarily lead to a policy change that reduces future risk. This theory is based on the idea that the process of policy learning can stall or halt when local governments are assessing information about mitigating natural hazards. This study examines policy learning after disaster in the context of Hurricane Harvey because of the range of communities it impacted across Southeast Texas. It hypothesizes that information is the critical factor for policy learning and that learning can be constrained by (1) the types of sources a community looks to for information, (2) whether the information is credible, (3) whether the local government officials tend to be myopic in how they consider the information. Data will be collected using a series of semi-structured interviews over several months with local government officials?mayors, emergency managers and city planners in communities affected by Hurricane Harvey. Previous studies of policy learning have relied on ex-post analyses of government documents to infer the presence and meaning of policy learning. However, this project will gather data in real time, thereby capturing the decision making process for how information is considered and used.  Furthermore, it allows local government officials who are engaged in the process of policy learning to speak for themselves and their communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. <br/><br/>The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses. Improving humanitarian logistics operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed study explores a novel and potentially transformative idea that deamination of peptides in sediments is a source of refractory and 14C-depleted DOM in seawater. This idea is consistent not only with the fact that the majority of seawater dissolved organic nitrogen occurs in amide form, but also with recent reports about the widespread occurrence of nitrogen-bearing formulas in deep-sea refractory DOM. The central hypothesis will be tested through a unique blend of bottom-up (molecular level DOM analyses) and top-down (bulk-level elemental and isotopic analyses, and numerical modeling) approaches. This work will involve a combination of geochemical profiling of sediment cores collected across a range of redox conditions, and long-term sediment incubation studies conducted under controlled laboratory conditions.  At the heart of the proposed work is structural elucidation and quantification of intact and deaminated peptides in pore-water DOM using a state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system (ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer), which is expected to provide an unprecedented wealth of molecular-level information about pore water DOM. The proposed work will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of organic matter decomposition and benthic DOM cycling and shed light on the connections between the modern-day oceanic and sedimentary carbon and nitrogen cycles as they relate to the formation of refractory DOM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results from this work are expected to reveal how the interactive effects between the underlying background state of the Pacific and individual El Nio/La Nia events have changed over the longer context of Earth's climate history. Thus, enhanced knowledge of Pacific decadal variability and its historical effects on both global and regional climate will help guide precautionary efforts taken to ameliorate their anticipated economic and societal impacts in the future. This team of researchers continuously and consistently disseminate their research results through the Education and Outreach Program at The Ohio State University's Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center, dedicated to providing climate information to students, the public and policymakers at all levels. In addition, this project provides support, training, and mentoring for a female postdoctoral researcher representing the next generation of the scientists in this field.<br/><br/>Pacific Ocean surface temperatures oscillate between warm and cold phases every few decades, and these multi-decadal shifts in the background state of the Pacific Ocean affect both regional and global climate. On the regional scale, the underlying warm or cold background state of the Pacific Ocean modulates how individual El Nio/La Nia events affect temperature and precipitation in specific areas. To better predict the impacts of El Nio events on global climate, it is essential to know the background state of the Pacific Ocean. However, our current understanding of this behavior is limited due to relatively short modern instrument observational records. Thus, other methods, such as modeling and/or the use of paleoclimate proxy data, are often used to define Pacific Ocean temperatures prior to the instrumental period. The key goal of this project is to establish a history of Pacific decadal variability and its global climatic influences for the past millennium using a combination of global climate model simulations and readily available ice core records from four different regions around the Pacific Basin. Each ice core provides records of local to global scale climate primarily through annual layer thicknesses (accumulation), stable water isotopic ratios (temperature), and concentrations of both insoluble dust and major anions and cations (atmospheric chemistry). Each record provides distinct insights on precipitation and temperature which will be used to reconstruct the history of basin-wide Pacific variability. The model simulations will serve to improve interpretation of the ice core data and advancing the understanding of underlying mechanisms driving the observed ice core responses to Pacific climate variability. The use of the ice core records also helps evaluate and possibly enhance model capabilities to physically represent critical processes responsible for local climate variability across the Pacific.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, participation in active research can greatly enhance their educational experience and can be effective in motivating them to graduate studies. The proposed theme encompasses innovative and novel topics that can help PWD meet barriers of different kinds - attitudinal, architectural, and technological - in accessing employment, navigating public spaces, freely communicating, and living independently. Our REU program is a summer-long research experience for 10 carefully selected participants. The program includes close mentoring that will provide participants with a balance between technology research focus and grounding in pragmatic aspects that shape PWD's lives and assistive applications. The program also encompasses five weeks of intensive training in scientific research techniques and the technical areas, followed by five weeks of instruction in broader aspects of computer coding, technical writing, presentation skills, and aspects of a graduate career. The proposed innovative theme will excite students intellectually, as well as supporting their passion and creativity.<br/><br/>People who have disabilities make up one of the largest minorities in the world.

Understanding the actions of such organizations during crisis situations and recovery efforts is critical to preparing for future natural disasters. Nonetheless, there is only limited research into their role and their coordination with federal, state, and local governments. Focusing on the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, this project will address important questions in the field of political science.

The conclusions drawn from this research will contribute to improved coordination between government and private/non-profit organizations during future natural disasters.<br/><br/>The supplementation of state capacity by non-state actors is a recurring, although understudied, phenomenon within the United States.

In this project, we redirect scholarly attention to the role of private providers by addressing two key questions: 1) During times of crisis, how do non-state entities identify and react to gaps in government capacity to respond? 2) How do non-state entities work to coordinate their efforts with those of government, and why do these efforts prove effective or ineffective? We address these questions by conducting three waves of semi- structured, elite interviews in affected areas of both Texas and Florida.

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation.  Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes.  More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate.  Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers.  Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign features several education and outreach activities.  These including support for undergraduate participation and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education. In addition, the PI performs science outreach through the Expanding Your Horizons program, which conducts a one-day conference for about 300 middle school girls, giving them the opportunity to explore careers that use math and science.  The project also provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>The eight week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  The radar determines cloud properties such as the relative abundance of ice particles versus liquid droplets, and uses Doppler shift to measure updraft and downdraft speeds in clouds.  The aircraft sampling is augmented by observations collected at ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we still lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce.  Over the eastern Pacific tropical convection occurs in a narrow east-west strip a few degrees north of the equator, in a region where near-surface winds come together in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ).  There are convincing arguments that rising motions associated with heavy rainfall in the ITCZ should have a bottom-heavy vertical profile, meaning that the bulk of the rising motion in clouds occurs in the lower and middle troposphere.  But the idea of a bottom-heavy profile is contradicted by satellite observations (from the NASA TRMM mission) which appear to show a large fraction of stratiform precipitation.  Such precipitation typically falls from upper-level clouds in regions of widespread convection characterized by a top-heavy profile of rising motion.  In this project OTREC campaign data is used to resolve the vertical profile contradiction and test an alternative interpretation of the satellite data.<br/><br/>A further issue is the extent to which convection in the ITCZ is driven by the near-surface wind convergence in the region.  Some argue (see for example AGS-1758603) that convection in the eastern Pacific ITCZ is largely due to thermodynamic factors associated with stability and energy balance, with near-surface convergence playing a secondary role. Here the PI hypothesizes that the thermodynamic arguments are not sufficient and the wind convergence plays a dominant role.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many climate models simulate strong open sea deep convection within the Weddell and occasionally the Ross Sea, with periods ranging from decades to centuries. This process brings a large amount of heat from the subsurface and releases it to the atmosphere, changing ocean and atmospheric temperatures and winds globally, and producing large holes in sea-ice called polynyas. Interestingly, the largest Weddell Sea polynya observed since the 1970s was seen from satellite pictures this past (2017) October, making an understanding of polynyas ever more urgent. The mechanisms underlying Southern Ocean convective variability, the reasons that it differs widely across climate models, and the impacts of variability on ocean circulation, heat and salt cycles remain unclear. This makes it difficult to determine whether models simulate (or fail to simulate) Southern Ocean convection for the right reasons, whether such events are likely to reoccur and whether past changes in convection are exerting an impact on the course of modern climate. This proposal will directly inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR6) assessment project, focusing on a previously understudied area, expanding our fundamental knowledge of the Southern Ocean and its role in the global climate system, and developing new model diagnostics. By providing insights into the relationship between deep ocean convection and ocean/climate indices on multiple timescales, this proposal will potentially inform design of future observational networks. The proposed work will enhance education and dissemination of research via undergraduate teaching and strong outreach activities both in West Philadelphia, where Dr. Marinov will partner with a public elementary school, and in Baltimore, where Dr. Gnanadesikan will continue his strong involvement in the Science Olympiad.<br/><br/>The project is organized around four major scientific questions and underlying hypotheses:1. What produces SO deep convection and determines its frequency and intensity across coupled climate models? 2. What are the global oceanic implications of Southern Ocean convection? 3. How do changes in convection impact the transient climate response and climate sensitivity? 4. How do eddy parameterizations and model construction affect the representations of SO convection and resulting oceanic teleconnections? The team will run a set of new simulations and PIs will analyze (a) a suite of models already run at Johns Hopkins (JHU), (b) a suite of new model runs at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GDFL), (c) models submitted to the IPCC-AR5/IPCC-AR6 as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project versions 5 and 6 (CMIP5,6). PIs will examine how different models become ""preconditioned"" for convection by producing a buildup of heat at depth or salt anomalies at the surface; how convective variability produces changes in key water masses and how heat, salt, mass transport signals evolve over time. They will examine the impact of convective variability within a large ensemble of the same coupled climate model, as well as within versions of the GFDL models which differ in model construction (hybrid vs. level coordinate), resolution (1 vs.   degree ocean), and eddy mixing coefficients. A side benefit of the proposal will be building a set of novel metrics than can be used for routine benchmarking and evaluation of GFDL and CMIP6 models. These metrics will help evaluate strengths/weaknesses of SO simulations, including tracking corrections in long-standing model errors from one model generation to another.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The National Science Foundation (NSF) GEM program is a cornerstone of NSF's Magnetospheric Physics Program which supports the study of the physics of the magnetosphere and the coupling of the magnetosphere to the atmosphere and to the solar wind. The GEM program focuses on the development of global magnetospheric models. The success of this effort depends on open cooperation and exchange of ideas and the development and sharing of models. Through various data-model challenges, models are compared and validated in an open and constructive process. The means of achieving the open communication and cooperation required for GEM lies largely in the regular GEM workshops. This workshop award supports the science of the program by providing an opportunity for Principal Investigators (PIs) and students present results and discuss outstanding issues in an interactive setting. There are two GEM workshops each year: the week-long GEM Summer workshop in June which includes a student day and the one-day Mini-GEM workshop in December which is held the Sunday before the American Geophysical Union's Fall meeting. This award provides coordination support for both GEM workshops and travel support for approximately 75 students to attend the Summer workshop. <br/><br/>Basic research in magnetospheric physics is a critical component of the National Space Weather Action Plan and associated efforts. The magnetosphere is the dynamic force field protecting Earth from Solar radiation. Space Weather impacts on Earth occur in and propagate through the magnetosphere. The severity of the impacts depends on the condition of the magnetosphere at the time of impact. Scientific modeling of the magnetosphere is critical for building the tools that can transition to operationally relevant models. Another very important component of the GEM workshops is a strong student-oriented educational element. The majority of this award is for support of student participation in the GEM Summer workshops. Most of the student support is directed toward graduate students but may also toward very talented undergraduate students (attending a U.S. university). In large part, the GEM workshops act to mentor the students and facilitate the transition from student to researcher in the science community.

In emergencies, forecasters predict the transport of ash using numerical models, but they typically assume that particles fall as individuals to simplify the analysis.  In reality, fine ash particles combine together into larger clusters, accelerating their rate of fall.  This allows the ash to fall out of the cloud.  Rates of aggregation depend on many factors, including moisture, electric charge, and turbulence.  There is limited existing data on the effects of these properties, particularly for turbulent flows, even though aggregation affects up to 95% of fallout in some eruptions.  Hence, there is a need for better experimental measurements of aggregation processes, along with more advanced models that include the phenomenon.<br/><br/>This study aims to improve forecasting of volcanic hazards through both high-accuracy experiments and upgraded models.  Ash aggregation will be examined in two different, relevant flow conditions: homogeneous turbulence and high-speed jets.  High-resolution optical techniques will be used to study the flow, turbulence, and particle clustering.  The results will be integrated into state-of-the-art analytical models, including some used for forecasting.

Despite this extensive empirical progress, however, a satisfactory understanding of their behavior is still missing.  As neural networks enter more and more into human-facing services (self-driving cars, medical diagnostics, etc.), this status quo and in particular its safety ramifications becomes worrisome.  This project aims for a theoretical understanding of the foundations of neural networks, divided into three pieces: (a) the representation question regarding which phenomena can be succinctly approximated by neural networks; (b) the optimization question of how to efficiently fit neural networks to data; and (c) the generalization question on why neural networks can fit not only the data they have seen but also the data they have not seen.  Developing this understanding will form the core of this project's three broader impacts: (1) the research component will aim to improve safety and reliability of user-facing deployments of neural networks; (2) as an educational component, the research will be simplified and incorporated into freely available course notes; (3) the award supports two outreach efforts co-founded by the PI: UIUC-ML, a university-wide ML seminar; and the midwest ML symposium, a yearly midwest ML gathering.<br/><br/>In more detail, the technical focus of this project, divided into the three learning theoretic topics above, is as follows. The core representation question is: what makes neural network representation special?  In more detail, the proposed representation questions are firstly to characterize the power gained by adding a single layer to a network, and secondly to characterize the representation properties of recurrent neural networks, namely neural networks which evolve their state along with a time series they consume.  Next comes the topic of optimization, where the key mystery is how neural networks manage to perfectly fit their data with simple iterative descent schemes, despite the apparent nonconvexity of the problem.  The plan here is to establish an even stronger property: these iterative schemes manage to output networks which not only fit their data, but do so confidently, in the classical sense of margin theory.  Finally, the proposal closes with the topic of generalization.  The first goal is to develop refined generalization bounds to the point that they can be algorithmically enforced via effective regularization schemes, and secondarily to apply these techniques to the fitting of neural networks to probability distributions, specifically the problem of training Generative Adversarial Networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

S. universities and working towards either their Master's degree or a Doctorate) to attend the 2018 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2018), to be held March 7-11 in Tokyo, Japan, and to participate in a full-day Student Consortium (workshop) that will be held on March 9.  Sponsored by ACM, the annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent interactive user interfaces.  Attracting 200-300 attendees, they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry worldwide who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) come together to exchange insights and to present outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place.  Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter; and unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain-computer interfaces, and gesture recognition. To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc.  IUI 2018 will be the 23rd conference in the series; more information about the conference is available online at http://iui.acm.org/2018.  This funding will enable attendance at the IUI conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons.  It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for career advancement.  The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants.  The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference.  The organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community.  Women and students who are members of underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged to participate.  To further assure diversity, no more than two students will be accepted from any given institution.<br/><br/>The IUI 2018 Student Consortium will build on the success of previous such events.  The heart of the Consortium will be a full-day workshop on March 9.  Student trainees will be afforded exposure to their new research community by giving a 20-30 presentation on their work and receiving feedback from peers and a panel of senior researchers.  A group lunch and dinner will encourage social interaction among the student cohort and informal personal interaction with the mentors.  The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in a poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Single-instance database algorithms are prone to three distinct problems. First, in the context of Big Data science, the size of the data compared to the number of variables makes it difficult to develop complex predictors without overfitting, and more traditional learning algorithms may lead to over-simplified models that do not capture important related influences or interactions between different types of healthcare information. Second, training and testing predictive models on a single database can lead to learning noise or other irrelevant local practices or differences in definitions that are correlated with, but not causally related to, the outcome in question. This leads to models that do not work in other institutions or in the future when practices or the environment changes. Third, sharing data between institutions, and in particular, across borders, is extremely problematic because of trust, legal issues, privacy issues and national policies. The significance of solving these issues is threefold: 1) it would allow the creating of strong generalizable data science models, which leverage enormous pools of data from around the world; 2) it would also allow the identification of rare diseases or patient types, which, as we compile databases, become less rare; and 3) perhaps most importantly, it would allow the free exchange of data science models and generalized approaches to solving medical problems in the cloud.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a set of distributed deep learning and cloud computation techniques for cross-institution and cross-border machine learning on health and medical data without the need for protected health information to leave the generating institution. The goals are to create demonstration programs which illustrate feasibility and open source the architecture. The scope of this project encompasses the broad set of machine learning-based tasks multiple institutions may want to apply to their healthcare data in the cloud, as well as the technical issues surrounding transfer learning of knowledge across domains (e.g., institutions/demographics) and tasks (e.g., types of classification and prediction problems). The project has three specific aims: 1) develop a cloud-based infrastructure which preserves regional autonomy of data, but allows the sharing of parameters of the partially trained deep neural network (including weights and hyperparameters) between regions, to allow transfer learning across domains and tasks; 2) develop a standardized coded model for deep learning approaches in medical applications; and 3) evaluate the effect of training and testing the model across multiple centers and national boundaries, by comparing improvement in performance with cross-institutional training without loss of privacy protection, using metrics of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and model calibration. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by taking four databases (including, a database of intensive care unit patients with sepsis, a free text corpus of nursing progress notes, voice recordings taken from a public corpus classically used for speaker identification, and a public database of full-face images used for classification of facial expressions) and placing them in the cloud (Google, AWS and Azure) at different geopolitical locations (namely US and Europe) and developing a distributed deep learning architecture that learns to improve its performance by sharing weights across borders, but not sensitive patient data. This project has the potential to make several contributions to the field. First, it will demonstrate that medical data across geopolitical boundaries can be made available in an interoperable manner (using the FHIR standard) and can be used for training of deep learning algorithms in a privacy-preserving manner, thus addressing both the concerns of Health Insurance, Portability and Privacy Act (HIPPA) and interoperability. Secondly, it will provide open-source deep learning algorithms for several medical datasets and data types that can be used across institutions to solve similar problems with some fine-tuning (e.g., via transfer learning). Third, it will provide a set of open-source meta algorithms for transfer learning (across domains and tasks) implemented on the cloud in containers (dockers) that can be downloaded for local use or transferred across the different cloud vendors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, many insects have specific calls which are barriers to mating between species. This diversity is in large part under the control of genes. Patterns of gene expression and regulation during development can also result in specific behaviors. However, it is unclear how differences in behavior relate to genetic differences: what is the contribution of changes in the actual genes relative to that of changes in gene regulation? This remains a fundamental open question of general importance, far beyond the diverse calls of insects. In this research this question is addressed in a katydid species that produces two alternative calls in response to the environment experienced during development. The differences between these calls within a population are due to differences in gene regulation. Population-level differences also occur across the geographic range of this insect, and this variation is largely caused by differences in individual's genes. This allows the assessment of the contributions of both genes and genetic regulation to the diversity of behavior in this species. This project integrates genetics, neurobiology, behavior, and evolution. Its outcomes contribute to the understanding of the genetic foundation of biodiversity and are relevant in many areas outside of animal behavior, including medical research. Broader impacts include training opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds that prepare them for the challenges of careers in life sciences. Outreach activities introduce the public to modern biology research in a relatable study system. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the genetic underpinnings of the call diversity in Neoconocephalus katydids. The species Neoconocephalus triops undergoes developmental plasticity (DP) that results in two alternative advertisement calls with species-level differences in two temporal properties (pulse rate and verse pattern). DP can be induced reliably by varying the photoperiod before sexual maturation. First, the relevant developmental stages and tissues (central pattern generators, CPG) in the CNS that contribute to the call pattern generation will be identified. Aim 1 identifies the location of the CPGs using lesion experiments, calcium imaging, and selectively heating of individual ganglia. In aim 2, the investigators identify the sensitive phase of phenotype induction by varying the exposure time of short day conditions and analyzing adult call phenotypes. Aim 3 explores the genetic underpinnings of the diversity of call patterns. RNAseq will be conducted using tissues containing the CPGs collected at the relevant times identified in aim 2.  Correlations between phenotypes and differences in gene expression patterns as well as genetic differences among populations will be identified. Comparisons include two call phenotypes of three populations that differ significantly in call pattern and extent of DP. In aim 4, the investigators will manipulate the expression levels of candidate genes identified in aim 3, using RNAi and examine the consequences for call phenotypes, moving from identifying correlations to testing causation. The outcomes provide testable hypotheses about the genetic control of call variation, which plays a significant role in the diversification of this group.

For many species, the decision with whom to mate depends on information communicated via the release of 'pheromones', a complex blend of chemicals that are released by one animal to be sensed by another. Therefore, understanding how pheromones affect mating behaviors has broad implications for animal behavior and evolutionary biology. Because pheromones communicate precise information, the links between pheromone production and perception are expected to be relatively stable within species. However, previous studies suggest that pheromones are remarkably flexible, and can change rapidly as new species evolve. One possible explanation for this apparent puzzle is that some shared genes co-regulate the independent processes responsible for pheromone production and perception. These shared genes could provide a path for the evolution of pheromone signals without losing the link between pheromone production and perception. This hypothesis will be tested by taking advantage of the fruit fly courtship ritual as a model. Studies will focus on genes that encode proteins that function as pheromone receptors in the nervous system, as well as regulators of pheromone cuticular production, and their possible role in pheromonal differences between males and females and across related fruit fly species. In addition to training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students, the broader impacts of this project will include genetics and neuroscience outreach and education activities associated with the public education system in the St. Louis region. <br/><br/><br/>Mating pheromones are essential for the maintenance of species boundaries in diverse animal taxa. However, it is puzzling how, as closely related species diversify, pheromones could evolve without fitness costs associated with their decoupling from related mate choice behaviors. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that mating pheromone production and perception are genetically linked via the action of pleiotropic genes. Specifically, the project will test the hypothesis that members of the Gustatory receptor protein family in Drosophila play a role in the sensory perception of specific cuticular pheromones as well as in the regulation of their synthesis by acting as regulatory autoreceptors in the pheromone-producing oenocytes. Approaches will include a combination of behavioral, chemo-analytical, and state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9-dependent genome editing approaches to establish a genetic linkage between the perception and production of pheromones, to investigate the role of pleiotropic chemoreceptors in regulating the female pre-to-post-mating phenotypic switch from attractive to repulsive pheromonal profile, and the role of pheromone receptor evolution in promoting assortative mating and speciation in the genus Drosophila. Findings will provide novel mechanistic insights into the regulation of mating behaviors by pheromones in particular, and the evolution of mating signals in general. In addition to diverse genetics and neuroscience outreach activities in the St. Louis region, the investigator and co-workers will use studies of mating behaviors as training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students in experimental design, behavioral and genetic data collection and analyses, and scientific presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wind shear can interact with the tropical cyclone vortex through a process called ventilation to inject cool, dry environmental air into the tropical system.  While it is well known that these processes exist, there is significant uncertainty as to how ventilation occurs and how it modulates tropical cyclone development.  This project will shed light on these issues by conducting a series of high-resolution numerical modeling simulations.  The main societal impact of the project will be improved knowledge of the factors that affect hurricane intensity, which is especially important for forecasts of hurricanes near populated and vulnerable areas.  The researchers also plan outreach events for students and the general public to enhance scientific literacy.  Two early career researchers will also be educated and trained under this project, ensuring the development of a highly capable workforce.<br/><br/>The research team plans an idealized modeling study to increase understanding of how dry air and vertical wind shear work synergistically through the process of ventilation to modulate tropical cyclone development.  The CM1 model will be used with different combinations of vertical wind shear and relative humidity, starting from tropical cyclones states with different initial intensities.  The simulations will be analyzed to test the following hypotheses:  1) low- and mid-level ventilation both increase as the relative humidity decreases and the vertical wind shear increases, but the ventilation pathway depends on the intensity of the TC, 2) mid-level ventilation is accomplished by vortex Rossby waves in the inner core and descending radial inflow in the stratiform region of TC rainbands, 3) ventilation increases lateral entrainment of low-moist static energy air into convection and convective/turbulent mixing of low-moist static energy air into the boundary layer, thereby weakening TC convection and the secondary circulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study the influence of a specific subgroup of these segments on cell behavior.  In addition, the principal investigator will develop a uniquely-structured undergraduate research program. She will also mentor next-generation STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) teachers, and promote the participation of underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities in STEM fields. When completed, this project will have developed new molecular tools for harnessing the power of biological systems to produce important products, and helped encourage and prepare highly-skilled students with diverse backgrounds to engage in STEM careers. <br/><br/>This proposal addresses the low orthogonality that is frequently encountered between well-characterized biological components and genetic contexts.  The canonical Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle dissects natural complex biological subjects into distinct functional parts through a ""subtraction"" hierarchy. However, the interplay among multiple layers in new combinations brings about unwanted design imprecision.  Selecting three distinct yeast species as testbeds, the principal investigator will systematically characterize the highly exposed nucleosome-depleted genomic regions and create synthetic insulators to counteract genetic context influence on heterologous gene and pathway expression.  The concept of insulating transcriptional elements to create designed regions that regulate gene expression with high orthogonality has been applied with some success in bacterial genetic circuits.  Efforts in yeast systems, with a higher degree of complexity, are very limited.  The highly exposed nucleosome-depleted regions will be further exploited to address lack of stable episomal plasmids faced by many nonconventional yeasts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, Noyce scholars will attend semiannual seminars and receive monthly instructional coaching. <br/><br/>This project includes partnerships between three colleges at UTC, the high-need school district of Hamilton County, and Chattanooga State Community College (CSCC). Through these partnerships, CSENSP will provide 30 two-year scholarships to juniors and seniors majoring in biology, chemistry, geology, physics, applied mathematics, or computer science. Scholarship recipients (?Noyce scholars?) will commit to teach for four years in a high-need school district. Additionally, the partnership with CSCC will enable 44 transfer students to join the STEM teacher candidate pipeline while at CSCC. These transfer students will later be eligible to become Noyce scholars. The results of formative and summative assessment of the project will inform the STEM teacher preparation community about best practices for STEM teacher preparation for high-need schools and districts. The students' pedagogical assessment instrument will provide composite data of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, via qualitative and quantitative assessments. Project outcomes will include providing best practices for use of data-driven recruitment to effectively recruit, advise, support, retain, and motivate students to successfully complete a STEM curriculum and have an impactful STEM teaching career.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, floods can also be described as  a collection of random processes  using statistics in addition to physical modeling.The relationship between flood severity and likelihood (""flood frequency analysis"") has become a centerpiece in flood risk management practice. Changes in land use due to urbanization and climate variability implies that existing data and methods may no longer be valid. Meanwhile, study of the links between dynamic and statistical behavior of  floods  has been hindered by the lack of long-term, high-resolution observations of rainfall, soil moisture, and streamflow. This leaves us with limited understanding of how factors such as soil moisture and river channel dynamics modulate extreme rainfall to produce long-term flood frequency. This research presents a hybrid approach that uses recent advances in hydrometeorological observations, data processing approaches, models, and theory to better understand floods in a changing world. It also proposes several innovative education and outreach initiatives that will reach K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and instructors using a combination of physical-virtual active learning tools, interactive web-based ""apps,"" and lesson modules to reinforce learning and assess outcomes.<br/><br/>The research will advance understanding of the role of four-dimensional (surface rainfall rate, time, and x,y spatial coordinates) storm structure as a driver of rainfall and flood frequency. The first objective focuses on regional geospatial rainfall structure and its linkages to rainfall and flood frequencies and trends. The second objective focuses on the physical drivers of flood frequency including rainfall, soil moisture, and their interactions. The principal inveatigatgor will use stochastic-dynamic modeling to establish the cross-scale links between flood severity and frequency that have thus far proven elusive. The proposed work will advance understanding of flood variability at multiple, coupled scales and provides tools that leverage modern computing power, regional high-resolution rainfall observations, and distributed computational watershed models. Using a framework for physically-based flood frequency analysis, this research will provide better insights into underlying drivers and their links to nonstationary flood frequency and severity. This research has an education/outreach component to train a diverse and ""data literate"" generation of professionals able to create a flood-resilient nation. Activities and teaching modules will also improve data literacy and geospatial understanding of flood hydrometeorology and the water cycle among a range of audiences including UW-Madison students, K-12 science fair attendees, high school science teachers and students, water resources practitioners, and the public. These initiatives are motivated by recent research showing that diverse teaching approaches including group activities, technology, and real world examples can reinforce learning and attract underrepresented groups to STEM.

UPTEMPO aims to increase the number and diversity of highly-effective mathematics teachers in high-need California schools. At SDSU, several impediments prevent high-achieving students from considering mathematics teaching: (1) women and underrepresented minorities often feel that they do not belong in STEM fields; (2) those who are STEM majors rarely engage in authentic teaching experiences that pique their interest in education; and (3) students who are interested in teaching choose not to pursue a teaching career because they must complete and pay for a fifth-year credential program. UPTEMPO activities aim to address each of these impediments. The project will partner with Grossmont College, a nearby community college, to attract new candidates to STEM. To attract STEM majors to teaching, UPTEMPO will create multiple authentic teaching experiences. Experiences will range from tutoring (in a middle school, high school, or community college) to teaching labs for undergraduates enrolled in precalculus at SDSU. Additionally, to support STEM teacher prospects, the project will develop new pathways, also called on-ramps, to expedite SDSU students? ability to earn a mathematics teaching credential. Noyce Interns and Scholars will be mentored by SDSU's Noyce Master Teaching Fellows and other exemplary teachers in partnering school districts. <br/><br/>UPTEMPO will support initiatives to attract (via new on-ramps) and retain (via authentic experiences and research-based coursework) candidates from Grossmont College and San Diego State University. The project aims to produce at least 44 new secondary teachers of mathematics by 2023. Thirty-two Noyce Scholars will be enrolled in SDSU's credential program as post-baccalaureates. The remaining 12 will be undergraduates enrolled in the institution's new 4-year teacher certification program. All Noyce Scholars will participate in teaching experiences in San Diego Unified School District or Sweetwater Union High School District, both of which are high-need school districts that are partnering with UPTEMPO. Given the lack of a single ?best way? to attract and retain teaching candidates, UPTEMPO will provide multiple pathways (or on-ramps) for Noyce Scholars and follow these Scholars through their first three years of teaching. This sustained interaction will provide the field with valuable research regarding the efficacy of specific affordances provided by the different pathways, as well as the ability of these affordances to meet specific candidate needs. The project will also investigate the process of supporting mathematics majors to develop caring perspectives toward students. As such, project could contribute to the diversification of the teaching community coupled with an ongoing supply of excellent teachers of mathematics for K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In emergencies, forecasters predict the transport of ash using numerical models, but they typically assume that particles fall as individuals to simplify the analysis.  In reality, fine ash particles combine together into larger clusters, accelerating their rate of fall.  This allows the ash to fall out of the cloud.  Rates of aggregation depend on many factors, including moisture, electric charge, and turbulence.  There is limited existing data on the effects of these properties, particularly for turbulent flows, even though aggregation affects up to 95% of fallout in some eruptions.  Hence, there is a need for better experimental measurements of aggregation processes, along with more advanced models that include the phenomenon.<br/><br/>This study aims to improve forecasting of volcanic hazards through both high-accuracy experiments and upgraded models.  Ash aggregation will be examined in two different, relevant flow conditions: homogeneous turbulence and high-speed jets.

Disasters magnify the challenges of managing within this environment, especially when the institution is constrained in its ability to accommodate the unique needs of students who are facing significant difficulties after a natural disaster. The short term disruption caused by a disaster can lead to long-term consequences for public institutions, but many of these more pronounced consequences may not be fully attributable to the effects of the disaster, but instead may be a function of the inability of policy frameworks and administrative structures to adapt to the needs of public institutions and policy beneficiaries after extreme events. Especially important are the financial consequences of enrollment loss and the constraints that come with accreditation structures. This study will use administrative interviews and data on student success to examine the role of policy design in post-disaster decisions and its influence on student success. We hope that our findings will motivate discussions among federal education officials and accreditation organization leaders about the ways in which they may consider options that would enable institutions to better support students in their efforts to rebuild their lives and pursue their educational goals.<br/><br/><br/>Theories of publicness, political control, policy implementation, and the politics of attention mostly speak to the challenges faced by public sector leaders in times of relative stability (not in response to extreme events), and many discussions of disaster response are limited to elected officials and/or federal agencies. This project seeks to examine how these dynamics play out in disaster recovery efforts for public higher education institutions and their students. We will use a mixed methods design, with qualitative interviews of administrators and a quantitative analysis of student data. The study site is Lamar University in Beaumont, TX. The administrative interviews focus on the ways in which efforts to accommodate and support those affected by the storm were influenced by accreditation-related constraints (in this case, from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) and concerns about the effects on funding streams (tuition revenue, state appropriations, and federal financial aid). The quantitative analysis examines how the decisions immediately following the storm affected student enrollment and persistence and the extent to which these effects vary by student-level risk factors or level of storm damage for the individual's household.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the constituents of blood, white blood cells represent a particularly rich source of information due to their active involvement in the immune response of the body. As such, technologies that can rapidly characterize blood samples and extract reliable information are in ever-increasing demand for both clinical and basic research applications. The proposed work aims to develop smart microchips that can reliably analyze white blood cells from small blood samples without any sample preparation. These microchips will be low-cost, disposable, and will include built-in electrodes that can convert the chemical information from white blood cells into electrical signals to be interpreted by a smartphone and transmitted to the healthcare provider. The proposed research therefore has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by enabling people to self-administer blood tests at home or in mobile settings. Besides his research, the PI is fully committed to the educational aspects of his profession and aspires to be a role model for next-generation engineers. The PI's educational goal is to create application-focused multidisciplinary courses, research opportunities and learning experiences for students. To this end, the PI proposes (1) to organize innovation tournaments to develop micro/nanotechnologies for solving biomedical challenges, (2) to implement a laboratory module in the graduate- and undergraduate-level courses, (3) to involve and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in conducting the research activities of this proposal, (4) to mentor high school teachers to attract K-12 and High School Students and underrepresented groups to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.<br/><br/>Despite being highly effective in manipulating cells, microfluidic devices lack native sensing schemes and hence often act as upstream sample preparation elements before quantitative measurements typically performed with a laboratory instrument. The disconnect between microfluidic manipulation and quantitative measurements is an important limitation that hampers the widespread adoption of these tools outside of academic research laboratories, for example in resource-limited or in point-of-care settings, where they can be truly transformative in healthcare delivery. The PI's career goal is to develop polymer-based lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platforms with built-in sensor networks, whose purposely simple hardware will be augmented by complex computational algorithms, to function as content-aware, autonomous microfluidic devices for quantitative cell analysis. To achieve this goal, the PI will adopt a highly multidisciplinary approach combining traditionally-distant disciplines such as microsystem engineering, information theory, data science, and biomedicine. This proposal will (1) design and fabricate plastic microfluidic chips wired with networks of<br/>interconnected electrical micro-sensors, each individually designed to produce a signature response that can be recognized among others through computation, (2) develop computational algorithms to process compressed data from the sensor network by utilizing both model-based signal processing and machine learning approaches, (3) develop open- and closed-loop controlled microfluidic systems, where a host of<br/>actuators are combined with spatiotemporal data generated by networked sensors to extract biological information from the sample under test, (4) combine all of the developed concepts to create an autonomous and adaptive microfluidic system that can analyze whole blood samples by label-free immunophenotyping of white blood cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Healthier fish stocks and habitat are in turn good news for people who depend on the sea, especially in lower-income coastal regions where people increasingly rely on fish for food. One way to structure local involvement in decision-making is community-based management (CBM), in which resource-dependent communities take active part in making and enforcing rules (for example, how, where, and when community members are allowed to fish). CBM has been offered as a way to improve developing-world fish stocks and food security for vulnerable global populations, and has been embraced globally by funders, non-governmental organizations, governments and communities. In particular, international non-governmental conservation organizations (INGOs) actively work to encourage communities around the world to adopt CBM. Understanding how INGOs affect communities' decisions to undertake CBM is thus relevant to national governments seeking to improve food security, INGOs seeking to balance human needs with ecosystem needs, network organizations seeking to empower sustainable local communities, and local communities seeking to maintain local livelihoods and culture. However, how INGOs ultimately influence the ""why"" and ""how"" of communities' decisions to engage in CBM remains poorly understood. <br/><br/>This project proposes to investigate causal links between the activities of INGOs and community-level adoption and implementation of CBM through a process tracing approach. Data will be collected through fieldwork in Fiji, a nation where INGO involvement in CBM is common. Interviews will be conducted with local leaders in purposively selected Native Fijian case study communities that are matched on community size and reliance on marine resources, but that vary on INGO involvement, adoption of CBM, and implementation of CBM. In order to triangulate findings, data collection will also include formal CBM adoption and implementation documentation, as well as interviews with representatives of INGOs active in the case study communities. Process tracing analysis will be used to identify INGO activities and influence on a) material and normative incentives for local adoption and implementation of CBM, and b) local decision-making structures. Process tracing analysis will also test whether local decision-maker attitudes mediate INGO influence on CBM uptake. Counterfactual cases will allow for exploration of alternate pathways to local adoption and/or implementation of CBM. Generalizability of initial case findings will be examined through a broader survey of INGOs active in CBM in other regions of the world.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most new polymeric products contain two or more polymers and functional additives resulting in desired properties contributed from each component. The process extrudes multiple materials at the same time in a single-step process using two or more polymeric materials shaped to form a multilayer structure for unique applications. These include optical, mechanical, and gas barrier films, such as brightness-enhancing filters for electronic screens, ultra-strong safety and security window films, or elastomeric barrier films for cushioning bladders in athletic shoes. Foams can be prepared from any plastic by introducing a gas or supercritical fluid within the plastic during processing. This award supports fundamental research that will provide needed knowledge about a new coextrusion foam manufacturing technology for fabricating lightweight composites. This process will also significantly reduce production costs by decreasing material usage as well as increasing performance-to-weight ratios through proper engineering of the material microstructure. This interdisciplinary research encompasses manufacturing, polymer chemistry, polymer physics and materials science. Companies manufacturing value-added plastic materials will benefit from the results.  Students from underrepresented groups will participate in the research and a new program will be developed with a local museum to inspire interest in polymer materials for K-12 students. <br/><br/>The gas/supercritical fluid concentration-dependent crystal nucleation/growth, crystal lamellae orientation, and subsequent bubble nucleation/growth behaviors under geometric constraints pose fundamental challenges in the coextrusion foam process. Further, the materials and process parameters largely influence the microstructure and bubble morphologies. These complex, coupled phenomena affect the properties of the final composite. The objective of this research is to close the knowledge gap in the understanding of microstructural evolution and bubble nucleation/growth mechanisms in coextrusion foam processes. The research team will develop a physics-based model to understand and predict the effects of the gas/supercritical fluid concentration and the interphase compatibility on the microstructure evolution of semi-crystalline polymers and will conduct experiments to verify the model. The team will also perform atomistic and macroscopic modeling simulations to understand the bubble nucleation and growth behaviors, and will test the hypothesis that various stress states influence the solubility and diffusivity by using a newly developed dielectric method. Based on these research results, the process parameters will be selected to achieve satisfactory microstructure and foam morphologies without time-consuming trial-and-error procedures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The amount of water stored in snow, or snow water equivalent (SWE), depends on its depth and density, both of which vary in space and time. New technologies permit mapping of snow depth across large watersheds, but there is no similar advance for measuring snow density. Instead, snow density models are used, but different models can yield divergent results across mountain landscapes. Therefore, understanding why snow density models differ is essential for reducing uncertainty in SWE. This project will improve knowledge of the physical processes that affect snowpack density, focusing on how forests yield predictable variations in snowpack density across watersheds. The project will advance snow density modeling and thus predictions of SWE, snowmelt, and runoff. Snow density models will be used to transform snow depth datasets into SWE datasets, benefiting hydrologic research. The project will train one graduate student, develop two field classes, and support multiple undergraduate interns at the university and through programs that strives to increase diversity in geoscience students.<br/><br/>Spatial variations in snowpack density are driven primarily by differential compaction due to the mass of overlying snow - density tends to increase with greater snow depth. In contrast, secondary processes lead to increased density as depth decreases (e.g., wind compaction) or decreased density as depth increases (e.g., new snowfall). The guiding hypothesis is that landscape properties and climate govern the relative importance of primary and secondary densification processes. Snow in open areas is typically deeper than in forests, so snowpack density is predicted to be greater in open areas. However, secondary processes can enhance or counteract this effect, depending on environmental factors. Hypotheses that assess the roles of primary and secondary densification effects will be tested using coordinated field investigations and modeling experiments. Field investigations in distinct snow climates with landscape controls (e.g., forest vs. open) will measure differences in snow density, depth, water content, and layer characteristics. Snowpack will be simulated with process-based modular snow models and reference models. Field data will be used to quantify model errors, evaluate model representation of primary and secondary effects, and test model sensitivity to meteorological uncertainty. Models will be further evaluated using data from the NASA SnowEx campaign and the second Snow Model Intercomparison Project. Robust models identified will be applied to produce datasets of density, SWE, and uncertainty for community usage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the ability to forecast the track of tropical cyclones has improved, gaps remain in the knowledge and understanding of their formation or genesis, which is reflected in poorer forecasts.  Recent results suggest that the African easterly waves pathway to genesis in the Atlantic Basin is influenced by the passage of eastward-moving convectively coupled Kelvin Waves.  However, a quantitative assessment of the processes and predictability of these interactions is lacking.  This collaborative research project between the University of Miami and the University at Albany seeks to provide such a quantitative assessment and to seek a more definite answer to an outstanding question in the tropical storm research: ""why do some African easterly waves develop into Tropical Cyclone (TC) and others do not?"".  The project is divided into three phases.  The first phase will use three decades of observational and reanalysis data to test hypotheses on the physical mechanisms related to the attribution of genesis or lack of genesis to convectively coupled Kelvin Waves, on time scales of 1-3 days.  The second phase will use two decades of archived ensemble forecast data to investigate and quantify the predictability in the context of these physical mechanisms.  The third phase will extend these ideas out to 1-2 weeks, accounting for the roles of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and El Nio and the Southern Oscillation.  One novel aspect of the project is the awareness of the need to take account of convectively coupled Kelvin Wave amplitude and favorability of African Easterly Wave structures for genesis.  A second novel development is to use ensemble forecasts to push the boundaries of predictability, in identifying the extent to which the complex interactions are predictable out to 1-2 weeks, and connecting the predictability ideas to the governing physical mechanisms and large-scale flow regimes.<br/><br/>The research will provide quantitative information to support tropical forecasters.  The research will also bridge the gap between the weather and subseasonal prediction communities by advancing our understanding of science and predictability beyond traditional weather time scales, which is recognized nationally and globally as a priority.  This will lead to the identification of regimes where predictive skill of genesis and tropical cyclone activity is high or low, thereby providing information to forecasters and ultimately the decision makers who take actions based on a potential tropical cyclone threat.  A by-product of the research will be the feedback provided to operational modeling centers on strengths and weaknesses of their ensemble forecasts.  Diagnostic tools developed in this research will be shared with the research community.  The project will also advance Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education by funding two students to pursue doctoral research, and in advancing new undergraduate and graduate courses on tropical meteorology.  An annual exchange between Miami and Albany will enable the students to visit meteorological centers and facilities in their reciprocal cities.  Undergraduate Honors thesis projects will be developed.  Several outreach activities related to tropical cyclones, aimed at increasing scientific literacy among decision-makers, the media and public will be continued as part of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Governance systems are composed of networks of public, private, and international organizations that make collaborative decisions to solve public issues. Increasing the effectiveness of governance systems is critical for improving human security and prosperity across the world, especially in developing country settings. Large-scale natural disasters often create windows of opportunity for improving the effectiveness of governance systems by reforming the rules and norms that guide decisions, interactions and operations of networked organizations. Collaborative post-disaster reconstruction operations provide opportunities for augmenting the effectiveness of governance systems by improving resource capacity, informational infrastructure, and social support base of interorganizational networks. While much work has been done on expanding resource capacity of governance systems, especially in the context of post-conflict reconstruction and state building, little research has examined the sociotechnical foundations of governance effectiveness: how information and trust facilitate social learning and adaptive capacity, especially at the nexus of post-disaster reconstruction and governance reforms. <br/><br/>Specifically, this dissertation research traces Nepal's new constitution of September 20, 2015 and the resulting transition from a unitary governance system to a federal system of seven autonomous provinces back to the April/May 2015 earthquakes and the post-earthquake reconstruction efforts. The objective of such process-tracing is to reveal the mechanisms of change that logically connect the earthquakes and post-earthquake reconstruction operations with the changes in Nepal's governance system. Setting up a pre-post research design with a focus on short and medium-term effects, the research uses several sources of secondary as well as original expert interview data to measure changes in resource capacity, informational infrastructure, and the social support base. Resource capacity measures are constructed using government statistical reports, foreign aid donor reports, the Prime Ministers Disaster Relief Fund data and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs financial tracking data. The informational capacity of the system is measured using knowledge graph datasets of the ""Global Data on Events, Location and Tone"" database that records organizations and their dyadic interactions in the context of Nepal's governance system and post-disaster reconstruction. Changes in the social support base are measured using news articles, opinion surveys of news organizations and think tanks as well as multiple waves of post-earthquake citizen feedback surveys conducted by civil society organizations and international development organizations. Semi-structured expert interview data and field observations from Nepal cross-validates the findings of the study and uncovers nuances to the specified mechanisms of change. The resulting analyses show how the 2015 earthquakes and post-earthquake rebuilding projects have significantly shaped the governance system of Nepal. This case study contributes to the broader literature in collaborative disaster governance, humanitarian assistance, and post-disaster governance reforms in developing countries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conferences themselves focus on two factors that are tightly associated with plant growth and survival: water and photosynthate (sugars produced by plants during photosynthesis, that are used for building plants and that are the basis for all food consumed by all organisms on Earth). Most participants already work on the transport of one or both of these factors, but they usually only work at one or two of the following scales: gene transcription, cell physiology and development, wood or inner bark physiology or development, whole plant size and shape, or function of communities or entire landscapes. This conference provides an important venue to bring together researchers working on these different scales.  The smaller conference is for early-career scientists, and the larger conference has special activities designed to help early-career scientists make meaningful relationships with more established scientists.  The organizers expect that all scientists will benefit from these relationships, and so the conferences will not only move the fields of plant biology forward, but will enrich the worker-base to ensure continuing advancements in the field.<br/><br/>This award will support the travel and registration costs of about 15 early-career scientists for two linked conferences, the five-day Gordon Research Conference (GRC), and the two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) in the area of Multiscale Plant Vascular Biology (target sizes 200 scientists, and 50 early-career scientists, respectively). It is increasingly recognized that knowledge of water and photosynthate movement through systems gives much information about how that system functions, from the levels of subcellular parts up through landscapes.  That same information may be used to understand how robust a system is to perturbation, and the basis for that robustness, which can be used in predictions and management for applications such as development of suitable plants for future conditions, understanding the links between plant physiology and climate-change-induced ecosystem shifts, and linking community transpiration to ground and atmospheric water stores. The GRC will focus on plasticity in these systems to help predict what is possible, and may show how the variability stabilizes or destabilizes systems at multiple scales. The GRS will provide a forum for early-career researchers in these fields to identify knowledge gaps in the role of vascular transport on climate change and that can be addressed through multidisciplinary collaborations. The conferences have three broader impacts. 1) Learning opportunity for a range of scientists, with an emphasis on early-career and participation of under-represented groups. The GRC will have four activities to encourage mixing and mentoring. The GRS has an agenda to facilitate peer interaction. The meetings are being advertised broadly through scientific societies and organizations that work to increase diversity in biological sciences.  2) Advancement of science, the elaboration of which may ultimately help ensure our continued existence on Earth given the importance of primary producers (plants) and the many risks to their health and productivity. 3) Development of community in a fragmented field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award provides resources for a workshop that brings together theorists and experimentalists to discuss a possible new kind of superconductivity that may have application in the development of quantum computers. The workshop will be held at Rice University on April 24-25, 2018. Whether a material conducts electricity or not provides a natural classification of materials into metals like copper and insulators like silicon. Within the past 20 years, it was realized that insulators can be bit more interesting. There are the classic insulators like silicon and rubber, but there are also topological insulators which have an insulating bulk and intrinsic metallic states that surround the surfaces and edges. Bismuth selenide, a compound made from the elements of bismuth and selenium, provides an example of a topological insulator. Since the discovery of topological insulators, new classes of topological materials have been proposed, among these are topological superconductors. Superconductors have no resistance to the flow of electricity. This reflects the collective quantum mechanical behavior of the electrons in the superconducting state. Topological superconductors have a superconducting bulk. While topological insulators have associated metallic surface states, topological superconductors have exotic surface states that behave differently than collections of ordinary particles like electrons and photons - the ""particles"" of light, but in a way that could form the basis of computation by manipulation of a quantum mechanical state. Topological materials are robust to noise and defects that would disrupt most quantum mechanical states and severely limit their use in quantum computers.<br/>Driven by potential applications to quantum computing, there is now an intense worldwide search for materials that exhibit the experimental signatures of topological superconductors. This two-day workshop will bring together scientists from around the world that use experiments to probe candidate materials, as well as those that develop the theory and phenomenology of topological superconductivity.  An important distinguishing feature of this workshop will be a focus on bulk topological superconducting materials and two-dimensional surface states. The workshop will address an acute need to gather and focus theoretical and experimental leaders in this nascent field, which has received much less attention than other efforts to engineer quantum computers. Graduate and undergraduate students will be encouraged to attend the workshop to excite interest in the next generation. A report on opportunities in research on topological superconductivity will result from this activity.

In recent years, a class of low-cost chemical materials, known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have been identified as promising materials for water-based hydrogen production to power fuel cells and as a raw material for the manufacture of chemicals.  Despite their promise, additional scientific understanding and engineering design will be needed to maximize the performance of the dichalcogenide materials to levels rivaling more expensive state-of-the-art platinum-based catalysts. To that end, the project will explore fundamental aspects of the dichalcogenide materials and their effectiveness for hydrogen generation utilizing a unique reactor system. The research will help pave the path to a sustainable energy and chemicals future while also laying ground work for long-term competitiveness of the U.S. in the fuels and chemical manufacturing sectors.  The research will be integrated with educational and outreach activities emphasizing participation by under-represented groups. <br/> <br/>The project seeks answers to the extent that electronic transport properties and interfacial effects (rather than the free energy of hydrogen adsorption) limit the overall rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on TMDCs.  A single-crystalline flake nanodevice will be employed as a HER micro-reactor, which allows precise control of the density and types of catalytic sites, and accurate measurements of charge transport within the catalyst, as well as the Schottky barrier at the catalyst/current collector interface. Three aims are proposed to study how the TMDC electrical properties, interfacial Schottky barrier, and the hydrogen adsorption free energy change as a function of 1) the phase transition from the semiconducting 2H to the semi-metallic 1T' phase of TMDCs, 2) strain engineering of TMDCs, and 3) different current collectors. The changes in the various properties will be correlated with the measured HER activities using a standard three-electrode cell coupled to the individual TMDC nanodevices in sulfuric acid electrolyte solution. Semiconducting MoS2 and WS2, and semi-metallic MoTe2 and WTe2 nanoflakes will be used for the proposed research, grown by chemical vapor deposition or exfoliated mechanically from bulk crystals grown by chemical vapor transport.  Beyond optimization of TMDC materials for HER, the nanodevice platform can be applied to other electro- and photo-catalysts to correlate their catalytic properties to critical parameters such as energetics of catalytic sites, equilibrium electrical properties, interfacial effects, and excited states induced by photons. The project will link the research to education and outreach activities via three outreach programs targeting, respectively, the general public (a weekend Energy symposium at Yale West Campus), under-represented undergraduate students (a monthly seminar series given by minority faculty members), and local high school students (a demonstration HER kit and workbook based on TMDC thin films).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of this DOM is highly resistant to degradation (refractory) and aged, but the nature and reasons behind the accumulation of refractory DOM in the ocean is one of the unresolved mysteries of the marine carbon cycle. While marine sediments have been shown to be a globally important source of DOM to the ocean, the connection between sediment DOM dynamics and the oceanic DOM cycle remains elusive, because information is lacking on the molecular composition and reactivity of pore water DOM.  To fill this knowledge gap, this project will address the question of how refractory DOM is produced in sediments and the fate of benthic DOM in the water column.  The research will focus on the relationship between protein/peptide dynamics and sediment DOM cycling, examining peptide deamination as an important pathway for the production of refractory and 14C-depleted DOM in continental margin sediments. These objectives will be met through a combination of geochemical profiling of sediment cores collected across a range of redox conditions, and long-term sediment incubation studies conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. At the heart of this proposed work is structural elucidation and quantification of intact and deaminated peptides in pore-water DOM using state-of-the-art analytical techniques.  The study will help better understand how the present-day carbon cycle operates, as well as how it may respond in the future. The proposed work will integrate research and education using several approaches. All PIs routinely integrate their research into their classes, which range from introductory-undergraduate to advanced-graduate courses and will continue to do so here.  All three PIs are also committed to engaging women and underrepresented minority students. <br/><br/>Marine sediments are a globally important source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the ocean.  However, the connection between sediment DOM dynamics and the oceanic DOM cycle remains elusive because information about the molecular composition and reactivity of pore water DOM is lacking.  To help fill this knowledge gap, this project will address the question of how refractory DOM is produced in sediments and the fate of the benthic DOM flux in the water column.   The proposed study explores a novel and potentially transformative idea that deamination of peptides in sediments is a source of refractory and 14C-depleted DOM in seawater. This idea is consistent not only with the fact that the majority of seawater dissolved organic nitrogen occurs in amide form, but also with recent reports about the widespread occurrence of nitrogen-bearing formulas in deep-sea refractory DOM. The central hypothesis will be tested through a unique blend of bottom-up (molecular level DOM analyses) and top-down (bulk-level elemental and isotopic analyses, and numerical modeling) approaches. This work will involve a combination of geochemical profiling of sediment cores collected across a range of redox conditions, and long-term sediment incubation studies conducted under controlled laboratory conditions.  At the heart of the proposed work is structural elucidation and quantification of intact and deaminated peptides in pore-water DOM using a state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system (ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer), which is expected to provide an unprecedented wealth of molecular-level information about pore water DOM. The proposed work will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of organic matter decomposition and benthic DOM cycling and shed light on the connections between the modern-day oceanic and sedimentary carbon and nitrogen cycles as they relate to the formation of refractory DOM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will support low-income students with demonstrated financial need and academic promise to succeed in STEM disciplines at Portland State University (PSU) project. Over five years, this project plans to provide scholarships to 36 students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in STEM. The specific aim is to improve successful transfer of urban STEM students from two-year institutions to baccalaureate STEM programs at PSU.  To accomplish this goal, the program will implement: (1) A summer S-STEM bridge program; (2) A course-based undergraduate research experience for students during their first year; and (3) Direct placement of S-STEM Scholars in internships and/or independent research experiences in their second year. The project will provide students with financial support, training in professional skills (communication skills, teamwork, ethics, etc.), and research opportunities necessary for success in STEM.  In addition, the project will cultivate a sense of belonging among the Scholars to support students as they transition into a university environment.<br/><br/>The project goal is to increase the number of low-income, urban STEM students who transfer from a community college, graduate with a STEM bachelor's degree, and pursue graduate degrees and/or gain employment in STEM careers. The project will: (1) Improve the processes for recruiting and successfully transitioning urban transfer students from two- to four-year STEM programs; (2) Provide financial, academic, and social support to STEM transfer students; (3) Evaluate project activities that lead to STEM transfer success; and (4) Disseminate project outcomes. To evaluate if students successfully transition and reach their highest potential, the project will use mixed-methods, quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess program outcomes, including monitoring academic progress, administering pre/post surveys, and conducting focus groups. Students? sense of belonging will be measured to determine how participation in the program results in changes to this important affective attribute.  If so, the investigators will explore the relationship of this change to mitigating transfer-shock, which can constrain transfer students from persisting to graduation. A survey will measure three constructs known to be associated with success: attitude toward STEM, career goals in STEM, and sense of belonging. Furthermore, focus groups will contribute to an in-depth understanding of the student experience. The project will measure perceptions and success within three groups of students:  Scholars, non-Scholar STEM transfer students, and four-year STEM students. Comparisons among these groups will support understanding the efficacy of the project's activities to help students achieve academic goals (e.g., timely graduation), mitigate transfer-shock (provide scaffolding for building a sense of belonging in STEM), and give Scholars tools for success (i.e., strong letters of recommendation, internships). Evaluation data will inform education research about what does and does not work to mitigate transfer-shock and facilitate success in baccalaureate STEM. The project has the potential to produce a sustainable institutional road-map for mitigating transfer shock, and improving overall persistence, graduation, and success for underserved STEM students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spurred by the need to reduce emissions, the electric generation mix is drifting away from traditional fuel-based sources, towards new renewable sources with very different characteristics. However, integrating renewable sources into the existing grid in an efficient and reliable manner will not be possible unless one devises appropriate mechanisms to overcome the technical challenges associated with high levels of renewable penetration. The main challenges that hinder high levels of renewable penetration include (a) the increased dynamic degradation induced by renewable sources, (b) the uncertainty and intermittency in energy production levels, and (c) the incentives misalignment that preclude renewable energy sources to behave in a more grid-friendly manner. <br/><br/>To address these challenges this CAREER proposal aims to develop a new generation of decentralized controllers, distributed algorithms, and market designs that can unlock today's grid rigidity, capture the value of fast timescale actions in operational costs, and allow a seamless integration of renewables. This is achieved by focusing on two main goals. The first goal aims to develop analysis and design tools that allow the systematic design of (i) decentralized algorithms with robustness guarantees, (ii) dynamics-aware distributed optimization algorithms that can perform real-time optimization without introducing system-wide instabilities, and (iii) multi-timescale markets that integrate operations and controls. The second goal is to leverage the developed tools in the design of new control features that are aimed at boosting the grid flexibility.

This will enable them to understand their own levels of aptitude and interest in a career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and give them the tools to prepare for the next stage in education and career development. The intellectual merit of this REU Site lies in constructing a new and critically needed pipeline for the next generation of sustainable energy researchers, equipped to address the broad theme of sustainable energy research and social and environmental issues, which is a theme of local significance and global implications. The research, educational, and career mentorship provided by the program is envisioned to stimulate the students to look at their academic work in a new light and to provide a spark for possible careers in academic research or industrial innovation. Participating students will tackle various research topics by working collaboratively with other participants, interact with faculty mentors and Ph.D. students from different engineering departments, and develop a holistic perspective of sustainable energy and environment research. The site is designed to guide students to work both independently and collaboratively, with each team consisting of two undergraduate students. Each student will be required to write a conference paper style report of their research for publication and deliver an oral and poster presentation of their summer research projects in the final competition at the end of 10-week program. The REU site fits within an initiative in the College of Engineering at TAMUK to involve undergraduate students in research and boost the participation of US citizens (especially Hispanic and female students) in graduate research.

Fertilization requires pollen to land on the female flower and form a pollen tube, a rapidly elongating single-celled projection which grows through the female tissue, in some cases for several centimeters. This pollen tube is able to reorient its growth in response to chemical guidance cues to deliver the male reproductive cells to the female. The pollen tube, like other plant cells is surrounded by a cell wall and cell expansion requires the proper secretion of new cell wall material that is specifically targeted to the specialized, flexible cell wall at the growing tip. The internal secretory machinery and the cell wall must be appropriately coordinated with each other and with the direction of elongation for successful sustained growth. Despite the importance of this process for agricultural production, a major gap exists in our understanding of how the external cell wall and the intracellular secretory apparatus coordinate to maintain a stable but responsive tip region over time. This project will elucidate the linkage between these two compartments using genetics, biochemistry and cell imaging approaches. The research will also support the training of graduate and undergraduate students. Research activities will be integrated into an introductory plant biology lab course giving students an authentic research experience. In addition, the project will provide interactive, hands-on activities to the general public in collaboration with the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History. This project was co-funded by the Plant, Fungal and Microbial Developmental Mechanisms Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences. <br/><br/>Flowering plant fertility depends on the sustained rapid elongation of pollen tubes and their ability to reorient growth to effectively target receptive ovules. Proper pollen tube elongation requires hydroxyproline (hyp) O-arabinosylation, the posttranslational addition of arabinose sugar chains to hydroxyprolines. Arabinosyltransferase mutants exhibit shorter, wider and sometimes branched pollen tubes, suggesting impaired tip-region stability. The secretion required for pollen tube elongation depends on the highly dynamic F-actin structures at the pollen tube tip. F-actin organization is controlled, in part, by the nucleation activity of class 1 formin homology proteins. The extracellular domains of these proteins contain predicted arabinosylation motifs which have been implicated in interaction with the cell wall. This project will test the hypothesis that the pollen tube cell wall and actin cytoskeleton are coordinated via hyp O-arabinosylation of the class 1 formin homology proteins, limiting their actin organizing activity to appropriate cortical domains though interaction with the overlying cell wall.  Altered cell wall polarity and actin organization will be assayed in the mutants and wild type. The in vivo glycosylation status of the class 1 formins will be determined for three important members of this protein family, including two known regulators of pollen tube actin. Furthermore, the effect of the extracellular domains on protein mobility and localization in the pollen tube will be determined. This research will establish an essential point of connection between two major cell components required for pollen tube polarization and growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will engage in a combination of neuroscientific and behavioral research in order to disambiguate between competing causal theories that are unlikely to be distinguished on the basis of behavioral evidence alone. The project is supported by a CAREER award to Vanderbilt University by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>Competing theories of the underlying cause of DD suggest that there is a deficit either in the representation of numerical magnitude, or in the connection between those representations and symbolic numbers. The project will attempt to disambiguate between these theories by providing a multimodal characterization of the neural networks involved in basic nonsymbolic and symbolic number processing in DD children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as well as structural metrics of grey and white matter. The project will examine the development of those networks and will examine the extent to which those networks predict typical and atypical mathematical skill development. Investigators will study children with DD, children with dyslexia (DL), and typically developing (TD) children longitudinally from kindergarten to 2nd grade. By contrasting between these three groups, the investigators will be able to identify atypical brain and behavioral phenotypes that are specific to DD, as well as identify any commonalities between DD and DL.

To avoid saturating available storage capacity, such data must be compressed at a high ratio. Biological sequences are created over the course of evolution by mutation processes, including substitution, insertion, deletion, and duplication. While these processes shape the statistical properties of genomic sequences and play a critical role in determining which compression approaches will provide improved performance, they are not taken into account by current methods. The goal of this project is to provide a principled approach to biological data compression by developing and leveraging mutation models that approximate the generation process of genomic sequences.<br/><br/>The main research thrusts of the project are: 1) determining the fundamental limits of the compressibility of biological sequences; and 2) developing and evaluating encoding and decoding algorithms that approach these limits. Identifying the limits of compression relies on developing combinatorial and stochastic string-editing models that represent sequence generation through genomic mutations. These models are then studied from an information-theoretic point of view to determine their combinatorial and stochastic capacities, thus providing bounds on the compressibility of genomic sequences. The second thrust leverages the statistical properties arising from mutation models, such as repeat structures, to develop efficient compression tools. In addition to improving compression methods, the success of these research directions will enhance our understanding of complex sequence generation processes, enable the generation of faithful synthetic data, and facilitate the quantitative study of the role of mutations in generating novel biological functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign grants is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation. Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes. More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate. Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers. Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign includes several education and outreach activities including support for undergraduates to participate in fieldwork and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education. In addition, the Principal Investigators (PIs) of this grant incorporate results from the campaign into their outreach to New Mexico high schools, in part through a class on weather and climate offered in the Masters of Science Teaching program at New Mexico Tech. They also develop materials for K-12 classroom teaching in their state. The project supports a graduate student and a postdoctoral research fellow, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>The eight-week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights of the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar. Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce. The PIs have developed a theory in which deep convection over warm oceans is controlled by three thermodynamic factors: heat and moisture coming from the underlying ocean, the ""saturation fraction"" of the atmospheric column (a kind of bulk relative humidity), and moist convective instability (with a counterintuitive association between weaker instability and heavier rainfall). But the theory assumes uniform atmospheric and oceanic conditions, and this assumption may not hold in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Instead, the region features a large north-south contrast in sea surface temperature (SST) accompanied by a narrow east-west convection band called the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The sharp SST contrast provides an alternative explanation for ITCZ convection, as near-surface winds generally blow across the temperature contrast and converge over the warmer SSTs. Rising motion where low-level winds converge can produce convection, but the observed convection does not clearly match expectations based on SST contrast arguments.<br/><br/>A further issue involves the vertical structure of convective clouds, as convective clouds in the eastern Pacific ITCZ are relatively shallow yet they produce rain rates similar to their deeper counterparts over the western Pacific. The PIs have an explanation for the development of heavy rain from mid-depth convection which can be tested using campaign data. A further mystery is that satellite data from the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) seem to show a large amount of stratiform rain in the eastern Pacific, even though high stratiform rain fraction is usually associated with the anvil cloud and decaying cloud plumes found in regions of deep convection. The PIs argue that cloud features identified as stratiform rain in TRMM data should instead be classified as weak cellular convection, thus removing the inconsistency between stratiform rain amounts and relatively shallow convection. The combination of dropsonde and airborne radar data should suffice to distinguish between stratiform rain clouds and weak cellular convection.<br/><br/>In contrast, SSTs in the southwest Caribbean are quite uniform so convection does not develop from SST-induced wind convergence. Moreover, mid-tropospheric air over the area is relatively dry and thus not conducive to convection and heavy rainfall.  Yet convection and heavy rainfall still occur, often associated with the passage of easterly waves.

For example, wheelchair-mounted assistive robot arms can help people with motor impairments perform activities of daily living (like eating) independently, increasing their self-sufficiency and quality of life. However, robot assistance is limited by the fact that robots cannot always recognize when people want or need help. The goal of this research is to develop algorithms that enable robots to recognize when a person is having difficulty with a physical task, based on their behavior before they reach a failure point, and then provide the necessary assistance to complete the task. This work will draw from psychology to explore how nonverbal behaviors like eye gaze, body posture, and facial expression can reveal people's need for assistance. The project will include a data collection study of nonverbal behavior during robot operation. The nonverbal behavior collected during this study will be open sourced to enable other researchers to draw insights about human behavior during human-robot interactions. The work will improve the usefulness of collaborative and assistive robots and lead to better integration of personal robots in workplaces, homes, and assistive care environments.<br/><br/>The main research question in this work is: can robots recognize that a person needs assistance based on their nonverbal behaviors during a human-robot interaction? To investigate this, the project has four goals. Goal 1: Recognize the need for assistance. The work will begin with a large-scale data collection of people's nonverbal behavior (eye gaze, body posture, and facial expressions) during an assistive human-robot manipulation task. Using machine learning approaches, the project team will train predictors on the data that can use nonverbal behavior patterns to recognize when people need assistance. Goal 2: Provide assistance. By monitoring real-time nonverbal behaviors during a human-robot interaction, this system will use the trained predictors from Goal 1 to identify when a person needs help. Once the system predicts that assistance is required, it should be able to provide that assistance seamlessly and in real time using shared autonomy. Goal 3: Evaluate the system. Individual system components will be validated separately, then a full-scale evaluation will be conducted to measure the utility of the implemented system in a real-world assistive human-robot interaction. Goal 4: Create and disseminate an open source data set. A major goal of this project is to collect and share a data set of nonverbal behavior during assistive human-robot interaction, which represents a novel contribution to the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the ability to improve radio frequency and microwave wireless functionality is inhibited by the platform-centric model in place today, where capability improvements must be achieved by developing new individual systems. Such improvements must often occur without increasing the size, weight, and power of the system, since increasing transmit energy, signal gain, or spatial diversity will result in larger size, aperture, or power, if not all three. This research seeks to break the platform-centric paradigm by investigating new techniques in dynamic distributed antenna arrays, where individual elements in a distributed antenna array use dynamics in time and space to significantly enhance the system functionality. Such dynamic arrays will lead to improvements of radar systems, enabling greater capabilities for sensing the earth and its atmosphere from satellites, improving target discrimination in military radar, and enabling greater safety on autonomous vehicles. In addition, the project will implement an educational plan for teaching new perspectives of antenna array theory and new antenna array design concepts. The outreach plan will educate under-represented student groups in engineering, both at the college and secondary levels, to help expand STEM education in central Michigan.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to explore the use of spatial and temporal dynamics of distributed antenna arrays to create new modalities for radar and remote sensing. In particular, this research will advance knowledge by exploring theoretical methods of formulating array concepts in terms of a physical antenna array dynamics with waveform dynamics, and will investigate new sensing modalities leveraging dynamic antenna arrays. Recent developments by the PI's group and others have led to dramatically increased connectivity between sensors on mobile platforms such as UAVs and autonomous vehicles. Such connectivity and mobility set the stage for truly distributed sensing capabilities, where a new dimension of control and motion of the array elements can be exploited in innovative ways. This research will explore how spatio-temporal dynamics in such distributed arrays can be formulated, analyzed, implemented, and utilized to create new remote sensing modalities. Specifically, the project has the following objectives: 1) Obtain a systematic theory of spatio-temporal modulation in antenna arrays whose elements are dynamic in space and frequency. This will develop the foundations of a new antenna array theory that incorporates spatial frequency domain antenna analysis and spatio-temporal dynamics to open a new dimension of control enabled by dynamic movement of the array elements. 2) Explore the capabilities enabled by dynamic antenna arrays for new radar and remote sensing measurements. This will lead to orders-of-magnitude improvements in the angular resolution of radar measurements, and will enable the creation of new radar measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon means that estimates of earthquake hazard based on the assumption that faults fail individually can underestimate the size of the largest possible earthquake in a region, and in turn the level of seismic hazard. The November 14, 2016 magnitude 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake in the northern South Island, New Zealand, stands out as one of the most complex earthquakes known, with rupture of the ground surface observed on more than 20 faults. The earthquake was followed by tens of thousands of aftershocks, and it also triggered a number of what are called ""slow slip events"" - fault slip occurring over days to months instead of seconds to minutes like most earthquakes. The Kaikoura earthquake is the latest in a series of damaging earthquakes in the northern part of the South Island in New Zealand that have struck in this decade. This project will examine several key questions related to the complicated geologic evolution of this region. This project will take advantage of data and results from a broad range of studies that have been carried out over the past two decades. It will also utilize seismic data from temporary arrays that were deployed to record aftershock and were operated, in part, with support of RAPID funding from NSF. The tasks of this project are to image the three-dimensional seismic velocity and attenuation structure, to relocate earthquakes that occurred in the region with high-precision, and to determine the fault slip geometry using the aftershock locations. This work will contribute to our understanding of how multiple-fault failure occurs in large earthquakes, thereby contributing to improving seismic hazard estimation. The work will be carried out in close collaboration with New Zealand scientists from GNS Science and Victoria University of Wellington. In addition, as part of the broader impacts, this project will mentor a female postdoctoral scholar.<br/><br/>The November 14, 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake in the northern South Island, New Zealand, stands out as one of the most complex seismic events known. Surface rupture has been mapped on at least 21 faults. Post-seismic slow slip events were triggered over a broad area, including substantial slip on the South Island megathrust underlying the activated crustal faults. The Kaikoura earthquake is the latest in a series of damaging earthquakes in the Canterbury and Marlborough regions of the South Island that have struck in this decade, starting with the Darfield and Christchurch earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, continuing with the Seddon and Lake Grassmere earthquakes of 2013, and culminating in the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake. We note that the Mw 7.1 Darfield earthquake was also a complex, multi-fault rupture.This project will examine several hypotheses related to the complex tectonics of this region of transition from subduction to strike-slip. The proposed study will take advantage of data and results from a broad range of studies that have been carried out in this region over the past two decades, and utilize data from temporary aftershock arrays supported in part by NSF through RAPID awards. The main analysis tools are seismic velocity and attenuation tomography that incorporate recent and planned methodological developments, high-precision earthquake relocation, and focal mechanism analysis. The work will be carried out in close collaboration with New Zealand scientists from GNS Science and Victoria University of Wellington and will engage a female postdoctoral scholar in the data analysis and interpretation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research supported by this award will investigate if and how these experiences actually affect people's lives going forward.  Anthropologists have studied how cultural beliefs and practices produce spiritual experiences but less is known about the long-term effects of the experiences that informants describe. Do these experiences matter, and if so, how? Answering this question is important for understanding how and why people make major changes in their lives.  These changes could include mundane choices of school or career, or weighty choices such as whether to stop using drugs or join a terrorist organization.  Understanding the full range of factors involved in personal change is critical for developing interventions, counseling programs, and policies that will help Americans to live healthy, safe, and productive lives.  <br/><br/>University of Virginia anthropologist, Dr. China Scherz, and her team will investigate this question by studying the effects of spiritual experience in the lives of people attempting to make a major life change. Building on two years of preliminary research, they have chosen to focus the final phase of their study on recovery from alcohol addiction. The research will be conducted in Uganda because spiritual experiences are more commonly foregrounded in Ugandan recovery narratives due to the limited options for biomedically based addiction treatment.  Over the course of a year, the researchers will will gather data with qualitative ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, and mapping exercises. They  will follow 25-30 people who have tried to stop drinking, focusing on the effects of spiritual experiences in their lives over time.   Results of this research provide a model for including spiritual experiences in social scientific understandings of life transformation, which will be generalizable to many United States populations. The study will also provide the first extended analysis of contemporary modes of conceptualizing and addressing problem-drinking in an African context.  Poverty, access to schooling, and diseases including HIV, tuberculosis, cancer, and other non-communicable diseases in many sub-Saharan African countries have been increasingly linked to high levels of alcohol consumption.  Addressing these problems is important to U. S.  interests in global health and development. This study will highlight novel and cost-effective ways to capitalize on local paradigms for addressing problems related to substance abuse and mental health.   Dr. Scherz's ties with academics and policy-makers at leading national psychiatric and medical facilities in Uganda and in the United States will facilitate the dissemination of results and the translation of the study's findings into meaningful program and policy recommendations. This study will also help to develop a cohort of researchers working in this area by providing opportunities for Ugandans and U.S. undergraduates to develop their research skills and capacities through hands-on practice and mentorship.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional wisdom holds that animals - from humans to fruit flies - choose the ""best"" partner based on that partner's vigor and health, but more and more work has shown that reproductive decisions are heavily shaped by one's own personality, psychology, and experiences. In particular, people and animals who are bold and extroverted tend to seek different mates and act differently during courtship than those who are shy and introverted.  Part of this may have to do with learning - extroverts learn better from positive rewards, introverts learn better from negative experiences. This project explores the genetic and behavioral connections between personality, learning, and mate choice.  This is done by testing mate preferences, shyness and boldness, and learning ability in the same individuals, and by using genomic technology to search for a common genetic basis underlying these features.  This work will help us understand how reproductive decisions change with the environment and drive the origin of new animal species. The project will support graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. A main focus is to expand an ongoing mentorship program focused on community outreach and high-impact learning experiences for high school students. In this project, high school and college-age students will be trained during the school year as counselors for an elementary-level STEM summer camp focused on animal behavior and local natural history, applying their science knowledge towards engaging younger students.<br/><br/>Hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of mating preferences have focused on their adaptive value with respect to mating decisions. A growing body of work has shown that biases unrelated to mating, notably at the sensory periphery, can shape mating preferences. If these biases are under divergent ecological selection, this can facilitate reproductive isolation. This project focuses on whether interspecific differences in mating preferences can emerge from personality, an ecologically important suite of behavioral traits. The swordtail fish species Xiphophorus malinche and Xiphophorus birchmanni diverge in both mating preferences and personality traits. The proposed project seeks to unravel the common mechanisms underlying personality, preference development, and mating decisions. This will be accomplished by (1) measuring phenotypic correlations between non-sexual exploratory and risk-avoidance behavior, mate-sampling patterns, and mating preferences; (2)  using aversive and appetitive conditioned-response paradigms to evaluate the relationship between personality and learning mode; (3) characterizing the relationship between learning in sexual and non-sexual contexts; and (4) using hybrid genetic lines to elucidate genetic covariance between personality and preference and identify candidate genomic regions.  The project will support graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. A primary objective is expansion of an established mentorship program out of the CICHAZ field station in central Mexico, which currently focuses on community outreach and high-impact learning experiences for high school students. Under the current proposal, high school and college-age students will be trained during the school year as counselors for an elementary-level STEM summer camp focused on animal behavior and local natural history, applying their science knowledge towards engaging younger students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interaction often leads to exotic, often unexpected, phases of matter. To study these phases and phenomena, it is important to minimize the imperfections, such as impurities and defects. The goal is to experimentally explore and understand the new phases that arise in electron systems with the least amount of imperfections. Results of the research are communicated through publications and conference presentations to the specialized as well as general science and engineering communities. While the subject of this work is fundamental, progress in this area benefits society in the long term as it may lead to novel, transformative concepts for electronic devices and information processing systems, such as a quantum computer, whose operation relies on quantum and/or interaction phenomena. The project also incorporates a high quality and comprehensive educational component as it includes the education of students in critical, state-of-the art areas of science and technology, including the fabrication, characterization, and physics of very high-quality, thin-film semiconductor structures. Well-trained students in these fields are invaluable resources for the US as well as for the rest of the world. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This project encompasses an experimental investigation of electron interaction physics in high-quality, quantum-confined semiconductor structures. The research includes studies of both fabrication, via the molecular beam epitaxy technique, and of the electronic transport properties at low temperatures and high magnetic fields where electron correlation phenomena dominate. The emphasis of the work is on high-quality two-dimensional electron systems confined to selectively-doped AlAs and bilayer GaAs quantum wells. The two-dimensional electrons in AlAs have parameters that are very different from those of the standard two-dimensional electrons in GaAs: they have a much larger and anisotropic effective mass, a much larger effective Lande g-factor, and they occupy multiple conduction band valleys. The bilayer electron systems in GaAs double quantum wells, on the other hand, are specifically designed so that the measured electronic properties of one layer could be used to probe the physics of the other layer. An example is a system where the composite fermions in a layer with high density are used to probe a Wigner crystal formed in an adjacent low-density layer.

Current supply chain networks, financial networks and other industries have complex interconnected structures, where the performance of one participant can affect the performance of the entire system.  In such cases, systemic risk arises when the failure of one supplier or financial institution cascades through the network, which can be costly to overall welfare. This award supports a fundamental understanding of incentives that manage network vulnerabilities, mitigate systemic risk, and resolve failures, while allowing for profit-maximizing behavior of individual participants. The interdisciplinary nature of this research will create new channels of communications between academics, practitioners, and policy makers, leading to synergistic efficiencies in the design of effective policies. The accompanying educational plan aims to broaden STEM interest in stochastic networks through hands-on activities based on lab curricula and digital libraries, and to provide opportunities for underrepresented communities.<br/><br/>This research will build a strategic decision-making framework encompassing a broad class of networks, and will develop techniques to provide timely solutions for systemic risk mitigation. The framework will model the reaction of agents in the network as their joint decision-making process adapts to shocks and failures, and account for agents' facing incomplete information on the state of the network.  The proposed research fills an important gap in the network literature, which mostly consider agents that both mechanically follow pre-specified agreements and transparently observe the entire network.  The analytical infrastructure leverages and extends state-of-the-art techniques from stochastic analysis, game theory, and risk management. The project will develop mathematical techniques to recover Nash equilibria in constrained, weighted, and directed stochastic networks through the solution of non-linear discontinuous functional fixed-point equations. It will produce numerical algorithms to approximate the sequential equilibria that arise when agents are uncertain about the state of the network, and update their higher-order beliefs on beliefs of other agents and their interactions. The performance assessments of the control policies will be informed by available data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improving the cybersecurity environment for small businesses benefits businesses directly through costs savings that result when threats, and corresponding downtime are avoided, and earnings realized with uninterrupted business operations. The public benefits more broadly since it is most often their data, and their bank accounts, that are compromised when a system is hacked or breached. To address these challenges, this project at Mt Hood Community College (MHCC) in Oregon is designed to advance efforts to support the statewide small business cybersecurity environment through Cooperative Local Internships as a Novel Innovation in Cybersecurity (CLINIC). CLINIC will create the infrastructure for ongoing efforts at the college to produce highly qualified technicians in response to local and regional workforce demands, and further support work in the field by creating a cybersecurity toolbox geared towards the needs of small businesses. The CLINIC project aims to begin the process to answer the following long-term research question: How, and in what ways, does providing the small business community with access to a better trained cybersecurity workforce, in conjunction with cybersecurity resources, impact the small business cybersecurity environment? Within the scope of this capacity building project, the Co-PIs will examine two smaller sub-questions: (1) How, and in what ways, does the CLINIC internship model improve alignment between the cybersecurity program and workforce demand? and (2) Does providing support and technical assistance to small businesses increase the efficacy of cybersecurity toolbox resources?<br/><br/>The CLINIC internship will provide students the opportunity to use the tools and resources, particularly a self-assessment tool, in a guided, real-life environment. The existing cybersecurity program offerings and career pathway will be refined to include a small business cybersecurity option, featuring stackable cybersecurity credentials for small business environments that double as both cybersecurity associate degree program requirements and stand-alone certifications. An expanded survey of Oregon small businesses will result in continued alignment of project and program components and allow feedback to inform project activities continually refined through the external evaluation process. This project will utilize the evidence-based approaches of career pathways and internships to contribute to, and underpin, a broader effort to transform the regional small business cybersecurity environment through a multi-pronged approach that increases technicians in the workforce, and connects the workforce with stackable small business cybersecurity certifications. The project will examine how and in what ways self-assessment tools are utilized by small businesses to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats, how having access to these tools in combination with a cybersecurity literate workforce impacts the business environment with respect to cybersecurity, and how this project may be best replicated in other settings through an evaluation of the utility of the deliverables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many practical applications, it is required that these waves propagate through nonreciprocal channels/devices able to exhibit different responses when source and observation points are interchanged. This is the case of isolators that protect sources and antennas from high-power reflections, circulators able to distribute signals to different outputs, or Faraday rotators that control the polarization of light. These components are fundamental building blocks for telecommunications, defense, health care, and space industries. Unfortunately, breaking reciprocity usually requires bulky and costly magnetic materials that are not compatible with integrated circuits. This project proposes novel approaches to break and engineer reciprocity at the micro/nano-scale by exploiting exciting properties of two-dimensional materials without requiring external magnetic fields. The findings will be applied to develop low-cost, compact, and highly-efficient nonreciprocal platforms that enable novel functionalities and are compatible with integrated circuits and other optoelectronic components. The main goal is to establish a new paradigm for nonreciprocal devices, lessening the dependence on magnetic materials and exploiting unusual responses to reshape many areas of the coming technology. The educational and outreach efforts will focus on engaging Hispanic students, ranging from K-12 to college, in science, technology, engineering and math. Summer fellowships will foster the participation of undergraduate Hispanic students in a research project about nonreciprocal antennas, allowing graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to interact and share knowledge and experiences learnt by implementing similar concepts at different frequencies. The organization of a workshop about reciprocity will bring together top experts in the field with graduate and Hispanic undergraduate and high-school students, enabling technical discussions and broadening the impact of this exciting topic on all society.<br/>  <br/>This project combines and exploits unique properties of two-dimensional materials to break and manipulate time-reversal symmetry in the absence of magnetic bias. First, nonreciprocal responses far beyond what is currently attainable using magneto-optics effects will be realized by pumping two-dimensional materials subjected to uniform strain with circularly-polarized light. This platform will permit to investigate the response of many systems under effective magnetic bias much larger than those attained in common laboratories and will enable the practical development of strain engineering. Such responses will be applied to realize Faraday rotators and nonreciprocal hyperbolic/phase profile metasurfaces, enabling functionalities such as one way giant optical forces and nonreciprocal beam steering/lensing. Second, the ultrafast field effect of two-dimensional materials will be exploited to judiciously modulate in space and time their electric properties. Spatiotemporal modulations will be applied to realize low-loss, efficient, and integrated nonreciprocal photonic and plasmonic platforms able to enhance the spectrum efficiency and data-rate in the telecommunication industry. The technology proposed in this project is low-cost, compatible with integrated circuits, and aims to significantly advance the current frontiers in the field of nonreciprocity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will be conducted at the French Paleolithic site of Pech de l'Az IV.  While evidence for human use of fire appears to extend back to around 1 million years ago, several lines of evidence suggest that fire was not used regularly until much later, at around 300,000 to 400,000 years ago.  More recent evidence shows that the frequency of fire use, at least for some Neandertal groups, was not constant, however, and that it actually decreased during colder periods of the Pleistocene.  Perhaps this is because they lacked the ability to start fires themselves and thus had to acquire it from natural wildfires, which were more prevalent during warmer periods.  Nonetheless, this pattern implies that fire for warmth or cooking was not necessary for their survival.  This, in turn, raises the question of exactly how did they use fire when it was available. The research is significant because it examines the fundamental relationship between technology and human behavior and sets it into a deep chronological context.<br/><br/>The research to be conducted at Pech de l'Az IV is designed to obtain the maximum amount of information concerning the numerous hearth features at the site.  Much of this information comes from newly-developed analytical techniques that can determine from the sediment and associated artifacts the temperatures of ancient fires and the fuels used, as well as being able to detect the presence of organic materials.  In order to apply these methods, this project will significantly enhance the precision and accuracy of current excavation techniques by removing blocks of intact sediment from the site and excavating it under highly controlled techniques in a laboratory setting.

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. <br/><br/>The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses. Improving humanitarian logistics operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While large, destructive ruptures occur only rarely, much smaller events, often called microseismicity, occur much more often, with the vast majority of them not felt by people. However, the surface motion due to these much smaller events can be recorded by sensitive instruments called seismometers and analyzed to reveal their location and properties. In fact, microseismicity provides us with a unique window into the stress environment, structure, and physical properties of the Earth's crust and their changes over time.  In California, for example, most of microseismicity occurs in the same depth range that is expected to host large, destructive events. However, the ground motions recorded for the microseismicity are currently analyzed based on relatively simple models of earthquake sources from several decades ago. The rapid recent progress in computing, laboratory experiments, and observations has enabled us to create much more realistic numerical models of how these microearthquake ruptures might occur.  This study will use new numerical models of microseismicity to advance understanding and improve information about the properties of the crust, gained through the important window of microseismicity studies, while advancing our understanding of fault mechanics and of realistic sources of microseismicity. The resulting insight into earthquake physics will contribute to the physics-based simulation capability for seismic hazard analysis. These results may benefit the society at large.<br/><br/>The project will advance understanding of several scientifically and practically important types of microearthquake sources, such as foreshock-like events, repeating earthquakes, ruptures of heterogeneous patches, and fluid-injection-induced events, by producing and analyzing the synthetic far-field seismograms of their dynamic models. The goals are to (i) determine how well the synthetic spectra are fit with the currently used expressions based on the simple models, determine source parameters using the existing seismological approaches, and study how they relate to the actual source properties that can be determine from these models; (ii) look for seismological signatures that would indicate that the sources in question are more complex than the basic seismological assumptions, and potentially distinguish between several characteristic types of sources; and (iii) investigate the possibility of creating alternative approaches to seismological source-parameter estimates for such sources, using models more consistent with the specific seismological signatures identified.  The study will examine whether different types of sources can be associated with a typical set of parameters in the currently used spectral fitting expressions, or whether some of them require more advanced approaches such as two-corner-frequency functions.  It will also look at how the spectral properties for different types of sources vary over the focal sphere and consider differences between P- and S-wave spectra, which may be different for different types of sources. The research will potentially enable observational scientists to conduct more detailed seismological studies in areas with suitable station coverage, knowledge of the structure, and data quality. The results of the proposed activities will be broadly disseminated. Several graduate and undergraduate students, including from groups that are underrepresented in science, will gain valuable research and teaching experience carrying out the proposed interdisciplinary activities. In addition, a wider group of students will be educated about the issues involved in this research through course projects in two relevant courses taught by the researcher.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They also represent a control on carbon capture and storage, high-level radioactive waste storage, groundwater sources and storage and shale hydrocarbon extraction. Fine-grained soils play an equally important role in agriculture and soil carbon storage. This importance of clay-rich media derives largely from their distinct hydrologic and mechanical properties (ultra-low permeability, swelling-shrinking and cracking). These properties are of singular importance in controlling fluid flow in the subsurface (where fine-grained rocks constitute roughly two-thirds of the sedimentary rock mass), yet they remain a sparsely charted frontier research area in groundwater hydrology.<br/> <br/><br/>This project will develop a general theory of the hydrologic properties of fine-grained soils and sedimentary rocks. This goal requires understanding the coupled hydrologic, mechanical, and chemical properties of porous media on multiple scales, from the nanometer scale (where aggregation and swelling of clay particles takes place) to the 10-100s of meters that control the bulk mechanical and flow properties of the rock. The proposed research relies on a combination of simulation methodologies adapted to each length scale of interest, along with rigorous experimental validations at each scale. Key projected outcomes include detailed fundamental understanding of the meso- and nanoscale properties of fine-grained media and new constitutive relations describing the coupled hydrologic-mechanical-chemical properties of these media. The major education and outreach goal is to develop the use of molecular dynamics simulations as a pedagogical tool that can illustrate the fundamental basis of important scientific concepts and phenomena in an intuitive, and hands-on manner.

Specifically, the project will use computer modeling and flight simulations as mechanisms to provide unique entres to STEM and STEM careers for predominately underrepresented elementary and middle school students in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Named for the first African-American woman to receive a pilot's license, the Bessie Coleman Project builds on extant knowledge and understandings of complex systems in aviation and aerospace to develop, implement, and test the impact of a culturally specific, place-based, thematic curriculum and extension activities on youth engaged in informal STEM learning programs related to computer science. This focus on the intersectionality of computer science learning and 21st century information and communications technology (ICT) skill preparation is a national priority at the forefront of educational reform. Research has shown strong evidence that computer coding can motivate student learning and broaden student opportunities in STEM. Likewise, research has shown encouraging benefits of students learning coding as a pathway to develop computational thinking skills. K-12 schools, academic institutions, and informal STEM education sectors across the country are particularly interested in effective strategies to prepare teachers and students in computer science and coding, particularly youth from underrepresented groups in STEM. This project explores the potential and impact of the Bessie Coleman Project as an effective approach to address this national need among three critically underrepresented groups in computer science in four different states. The findings will advance knowledge applicable for both formal and informal contexts.<br/><br/>Over the three-year project duration, approximately 1,000 rural and urban elementary and middle school students will engage in a broad range of project activities - from 3D computer modeling and game design (grades 4-5), to flight simulation using drones and Raspberry Pi (grades 6-8). The students are predominately of Native American, African-American/Black, Hispanic and Asian descent, participating in after school computer science clubs and summer camps at project sites in Colorado, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming. Expeditions to air and space museums, opportunities to engage with field experts, guest speakers, and other extended learning opportunities are integral to the program. Forty-two classroom teachers and 12 informal educators and staff from Boys & Girls Clubs and Makerspaces will receive training to implement and facilitate the program in their site locations.  An iterative research design is used to investigate the three overarching research questions: (a) What learning experiences involving emerging technologies effectively enable diverse populations of students to gain familiarity and relevant competencies with these technologies, and what factors influence the outcomes of the learning experiences? (b) What culturally-responsive instructional and curricular practices and models, including place-based education, used by teachers enhance student understanding of and interest in STEM occupations, and what factors influence the outcomes of the practices and models? and (c) In what roles and in what ways do business and industry workforce members (i.e., STEM professionals) motivate students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for STEM careers in the STEM workforce and support teachers in efforts to promote STEM workforce awareness and interest? Formal and summative evaluations are carried out by an Advisory Board and an external evaluator. The research and project findings are locally and nationally disseminated through libraries, a resource guide, a blog, community involvement, conference presentations and journal publications. Ultimately, the project endeavors to increase students' computational thinking abilities, STEM interest and motivation, and persistence in STEM career pathways, especially in computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

General-purpose graph algorithms and graph-based machine learning methods have had some success when applied to a number of security problems ranging from detecting malicious websites and compromised devices in computer networks to detecting compromised or inauthentic accounts in social networks.  However, because the existing methods are designed for generic contexts rather than for specific security problems, there is room to improve their performance in detecting bad actors in networks.  Further, in security contexts, there is often a determined adversary trying to evade detection that general-purpose algorithms are not designed to consider, which makes them vulnerable to attack.  This project will develop novel graph inference algorithms that consider unique characteristics of security problems, analyze the spectrum of possible attacks on such algorithms, define measures of their robustness against attack, and develop methods to improve their robustness.  The project team will create and share datasets related to graph-based security analytics along with software that implements their algorithms and robustness measures with both industrial practitioners and other researchers.  They will also mentor undergraduate and graduate students in the research, using the problems and data to support new college courses and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) outreach activities for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The work focuses on collective classification algorithms that simultaneously label all nodes in a network as malicious or benign.  The first main research thrust involves advancing analytic techniques that combine random walk and loopy belief propagation-based algorithms through local rules that model the joint probabilities of a given node and its neighbors being malicious.  To do this, the team will develop versions of the algorithms that relax assumptions that neighboring nodes have strong homophily, developing characterizations of neighboring nodes' relationships and creating novel Markov Random Field formulations that leverage these characterizations.  The second research thrust will model the attack surface of collective classification algorithms, characterizing the goals and capabilities of attackers, the cost of evasive moves such as creating nodes or edges and generating network activity, and the effect of different goals, capabilities, and levels of evasion on the algorithms' performance.  The third thrust will be to develop methods to identify such evasion by developing attacker-resistant link prediction algorithms and similarity metrics, then mitigate evasion efforts through developing local rule-based techniques that add noise to graphs in ways that confound attacks.  The team will evaluate the metrics and algorithms on datasets from a number of domains, including malicious users in social networks, malicious URLs in the web graph, malicious domains embedded in domain name service redirects, and malicious orders in an e-commerce marketplace.  These problems, and the associated datasets, will be integrated into an existing course on data-driven security and a new graduate seminar course on collective classification. Results from all activities will be used as cases and materials in both existing and new courses, as well as a K-12 summer program and cybersecurity competition organized around detecting malicious actors in networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many climate models simulate strong open sea deep convection within the Weddell and occasionally the Ross Sea, with periods ranging from decades to centuries. This process brings a large amount of heat from the subsurface and releases it to the atmosphere, changing ocean and atmospheric temperatures and winds globally, and producing large holes in sea-ice called polynyas. Interestingly, the largest Weddell Sea polynya observed since the 1970s was seen from satellite pictures this past (2017) October, making an understanding of polynyas ever more urgent. The mechanisms underlying Southern Ocean convective variability, the reasons that it differs widely across climate models, and the impacts of variability on ocean circulation, heat and salt cycles remain unclear. This makes it difficult to determine whether models simulate (or fail to simulate) Southern Ocean convection for the right reasons, whether such events are likely to reoccur and whether past changes in convection are exerting an impact on the course of modern climate. This proposal will directly inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR6) assessment project, focusing on a previously understudied area, expanding our fundamental knowledge of the Southern Ocean and its role in the global climate system, and developing new model diagnostics. By providing insights into the relationship between deep ocean convection and ocean/climate indices on multiple timescales, this proposal will potentially inform design of future observational networks. The proposed work will enhance education and dissemination of research via undergraduate teaching and strong outreach activities both in West Philadelphia, where Dr. Marinov will partner with a public elementary school, and in Baltimore, where Dr. Gnanadesikan will continue his strong involvement in the Science Olympiad.<br/><br/>The project is organized around four major scientific questions and underlying hypotheses:1. What produces SO deep convection and determines its frequency and intensity across coupled climate models? 2. What are the global oceanic implications of Southern Ocean convection? 3. How do changes in convection impact the transient climate response and climate sensitivity? 4. How do eddy parameterizations and model construction affect the representations of SO convection and resulting oceanic teleconnections? The team will run a set of new simulations and PIs will analyze (a) a suite of models already run at Johns Hopkins (JHU), (b) a suite of new model runs at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GDFL), (c) models submitted to the IPCC-AR5/IPCC-AR6 as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project versions 5 and 6 (CMIP5,6). PIs will examine how different models become ""preconditioned"" for convection by producing a buildup of heat at depth or salt anomalies at the surface; how convective variability produces changes in key water masses and how heat, salt, mass transport signals evolve over time. They will examine the impact of convective variability within a large ensemble of the same coupled climate model, as well as within versions of the GFDL models which differ in model construction (hybrid vs. level coordinate), resolution (1 vs.   degree ocean), and eddy mixing coefficients. A side benefit of the proposal will be building a set of novel metrics than can be used for routine benchmarking and evaluation of GFDL and CMIP6 models. These metrics will help evaluate strengths/weaknesses of SO simulations, including tracking corrections in long-standing model errors from one model generation to another.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reuse is a growing sector of the U. S. economy. While ""recycling"" aims to recover reusable components and materials from waste to produce new goods, reuse refers to recirculating goods in their original form. Despite claims of economic and environmental benefits, reuse economies are significantly understudied, and empirical research is scarce. In this project, University of Maine anthropologist, Dr. Cynthia Isenhour, has partnered with economist Dr. Andrew Crawley, also from the University of Maine, to examine reuse markets and their potential to advance social and economic public policy goals.  <br/><br/>Isenhour and Crawley use an innovative combination of geospatial analyses, economic modeling, surveys, and ethnography to examine diverse reuse exchanges, their meaning, and their social, economic, and environmental potential at national, regional, and community levels.  Reuse economies have deep historical precedent and encompass a diverse range of exchanges, including ""take-it"" shops at waste transfer stations,  antique stores, architectural salvage, flea markets, community sharing initiatives, and web-mediated peer-to-peer sales.  In this project the investigators define reuse as the redistribution of previously owned material goods, in their original form, from one agent to another through a transfer of ownership (sale, swap, barter, gift) or temporary use agreement (borrow, rental, lease, share, loan). Through national geospatial analyses and ethnographic grounding in rural Maine, Isenhour and Crawley will advance theory in studies of regionalism, place-based development, and local processes supporting economic resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though directed care by trained physical therapists has been shown to effectively prevent such injuries, the resources available for such re-training are limited. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of those at greatest risk for such ligament tears depends upon expensive, time-consuming observations by trained clinicians using qualitative metrics that have been shown to be challenging to consistently apply. This project will develop automated prehabilitative techniques to diagnose those at increased risk for ACL injury by constructing and quantitatively analyzing an individual-specific musculoskeletal model of motion. This will ensure the reliable behavior of the diagnostic technique created in this project. Importantly, this broadly deployable approach will add a preventive component for the treatment of ACL injuries that afflict more than 200,000 people annually and drastically affect a patient's quality of life thereafter. More broadly, these models of motion will fundamentally change how human assistive devices are controlled. The ability to leverage systems-based techniques during control will enable the wide distribution of such assistive devices, which currently require careful physician and engineer-guided tuning. This project promotes the progress of science and contributes significantly to advance the national health. The integrated education plan not only has direct impact on undergraduate education but also provides great opportunities for K-12 students to explore STEM careers by exposing them to robotic control via hands-on examples.<br/><br/>This project supports the development of numerical techniques to diagnose an increased risk for ACL injury given articulated pose observations from a set of cameras of an individual performing a functional motion screen. To construct and verify the reliable behavior of these methods, this project will explore the following three research objectives: First, a new convex optimization tool to identify all parameterizations and associated control inputs of a hybrid dynamical model that explain a given set of observations. Second, a novel diagnostic tool that tractably evaluates injury risk metrics across all identified model parameterizations to ensure that misdiagnosis does not occur. Finally, a real-world, two yearlong longitudinal evaluation on 25 healthy subjects and 125 patients who are undergoing rehabilitation after an ACL reconstructive surgery. These innovations in dynamics, controls, and optimization will enable the development of a completely automated, robust, individual, and motion specific technique to identify those at increased risk for ACL injuries that cannot be currently achieved with the existing human-guided approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One well-known feature of existing data is that people shift from risk seeking in some situations (e.g., buying a lottery ticket), to risk aversion in others (e.g., purchasing insurance). To explain this basic instability of risk taking, economists have recently proposed new theories in which attention directly shapes risk-taking. However, empirical work that tests these new attention-based theories has lagged substantially due to constraints on data availability. In this CAREER proposal, this problem is addressed by collecting direct measures of attention in experiments using eye-tracking and neural data to inform the mathematical modeling of behavior and decision processes. The work will also use proprietary data from the field to test the generalizability of the main findings from the controlled laboratory experiments. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to integrate research on attention into standard economic analyses, which will dramatically increase explanatory power of current economic models and inform public policy. The educational component of this project will target several different levels of education from middle school students to PhD candidates.  The PI will create a new undergraduate course in neuroeconomics, offer summer research internships to undergraduates, and train a business school PhD student in cutting edge methods in behavioral and neuroeconomics. There will also be a significant outreach component in which the PI will work with a STEM elementary school to broaden access to basic principles of behavioral economics. <br/>The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop novel experimental tests of attention-based theories of economic choice. There are three specific research goals. First, the PI will conduct an experimental test, using eye tracking data, to characterize the attention function that maps monetary payoffs into measures of attention. Under several of the theories to be tested, there is an assumption that attention to monetary payoffs is deployed in a manner similar to how attention is allocated to sensory stimuli (e.g., a visual photo). The experiment will be designed to test these properties, which will provide much needed guidance for a rapidly growing theoretical literature. Second, the PI will experimentally test for broader sources of attention allocation to payoffs -- including visual properties of the choice set. The PI will also test for feedback loops between attention and risk preferences. Third, the PI will test whether the attention mechanism that affects risk taking in a controlled laboratory setting can be generalized to high-stakes environments in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These devices are more vulnerable than ever to malicious tampering by untrusted entities, with threats over a broad range of attack vectors.  Malicious functionality can be added to the devices during the design process, fabrication, or assembly, leading to compromised systems, often without detection.  This collaborative effort seeks to further the national defense by developing novel methodologies and technologies that enhance trust and security of these devices and their respective systems.<br/><br/>The proposed Center will enable researchers and practitioners from diverse areas -- integrated circuits, design, cryptography, system safety and resilience, etc. -- to position device security as a coherent, collaborative discipline.  It will be a hub for industry-focused research and a repository for related data.  It will foster dialog to promote advances across disciplinary boundaries.  The University of Connecticut site will lead collaborative efforts in counterfeit integrated circuits and secure embedded systems.  It will develop novel hardware authentication technologies; formal verification techniques for secure embedded systems; risk models for the design of secure embedded systems; and methods to design secure embedded processors.<br/><br/>The proposed Center will influence the design, protection, and resilience of cyber-physical systems from vulnerabilities associated with device security and workforce development needed for industry, government, and military.  The Center will disseminate research results and synthesized theories on device security through multiple channels, including courses taught at the six sites and professional/scholarly activities.  The results bring a significant return on investment, as they improve the readiness of industry for emergent conditions and improve resilience to threats in terms of property loss, lost trust, and system safety with respect to missions, injuries, casualties, cascading effects, etc.<br/><br/>The collaborative group for the Industry & University Collaborative Research for Hardware and Embedded System Security and Trust is composed of George Mason University, Northeastern University, University of Connecticut, University of Texas at Dallas, University of Virginia, and Wright State University.

Water and CO2 analysis is an increasingly important tool in research on volatile element effects on mantle processes, volcanic activity and the environment. Detailed understanding of the distribution and chemical behavior of water and carbon dioxide in a range of rock types and conditions will be enabled by the acquisition.

Recent laboratory experiments have revealed infrared (IR) band-specific diffusivities in both clinopyroxene and olivine, meaning that the rate of water loss from a crystal depends on the specific defect that hosts H. Different defects can lose water at rates that vary over orders of magnitude. IR imaging becomes necessary to illuminate the zonation profiles for specific defects. Recent work finds pervasive H zonation profiles in volcanic crystals with rapid mapping, and potentially each crystal can tell its specific ascent history. Magma ascent rate is a parameter otherwise difficult to constrain, but one that may be critical to the vigor of eruption. Water zonation in minerals found in mantle xenoliths also records the timing of magma ascent and xenolith re-equilibration, essential for understanding the water content, and thus strength, of mantle lithosphere. IR imaging of water zonation in crystals and melts, at higher resolution and for greater populations of samples, has the capability to provide a new understanding of not only the volatile history of tectonic plates, but also the volatile budget, migration rate and explosive potential of magmas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will analyze how a public investment like rail transit affects land values, residential location decisions, and neighborhood changes in ways that influence metropolitan-wide patterns of segregation, with special emphasis given to the movements of lower-income residents.  The project will enhance basic understanding of fundamental theories regarding residential sorting.  It will help fill an important gap in the current state of knowledge of gentrification processes by modeling where potentially displaced residents move.  The project will help identify motivating factors that influence decisions to stay or leave a neighborhood impacted by new transit development through community-engaged scholarship that focuses on the perspectives of local residents and that connects residents, researchers, and key stakeholders and decision makers.  Given widespread investments in rail transit, project results will provide information and perspectives that can be used to address social and public policy issues in many communitiesacross the United States and elsewhere.  The project also will promote technical literacy and education by engaging students and community partners in an applied, mixed-methods geography course where they will examine the issue, participate in surveying residents, perform basic analyses on the collected data, and map and measure segregation trends following the implementation of a new rail transit line.<br/><br/>Much of the recent scholarship examining relationships among rail transit investments, displacement, and gentrification has emphasized how land values and aggregate-level neighborhood outcomes are impacted by transit.  This research project will focus on the movement of lower-income residents in response to transit investments by addressing the following research questions:  (1) Are lower-income residents more likely to move out of neighborhoods following the placement of new transit stations than other residents?  (2) Do lower-income residents relocate to neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic composition?  (3) What are the motivating factors that affect relocation decisions both into and out of transit neighborhoods?  (4) Where and for which income groups do residential economic segregation trends change following the establishment of a new transit system?  To gather quantitative data about residential movements and to understand the rationale behind these locational decisions, the investigators will employ a mix of multi-scalar methods.

We will carry out a detailed study of the molecular basis and thermodynamic origin of affinity and activity. The structure-affinity and structure-activity relationships formulated will be exploited to develop experimental and computational methods for the evolution of high-affinity leads. This will result in a general framework for assessing the structural limits of functional compatibility between enzymes (i.e., their ability to synthesize, functionalize, and/or bind similar molecules), and for working within those limits to build new inhibitors. The ultimate goal is to validate the approach of screening metabolic pathways to produce molecules with targeted biological activities rather than targeted structures.

People recognize words far more easily than even the best computer speech recognition systems, even though the actual sounds we hear as consonants and vowels vary greatly depending on context (what sounds come before or after), who is talking, and the setting (a quiet room versus a crowded airport). Most current models of speech recognition cannot handle the huge variability in real speech because they do not operate on the actual speech signal. Also, they do not learn, so they cannot model how people acquire language. This project addresses these challenges by comparing current models of speech recognition to each other and to human capabilities, with the goal of understanding how human speech processing is so robust and flexible.  In addition, simplified ""deep learning"" networks will be developed and evaluated as models of human speech recognition. Deep learning networks are similar to cognitive models in that they learn abstract representations of the data, not task-specific rules or algorithms. These networks have been used to create accurate commercial speech recognition systems. By comparing them to human performance, the investigators may provide new insights into why human speech recognition is so robust. The results of this project will have technical implications (better understanding of human flexibility may aid in improving computer speech recognition) and health implications (better understanding of human speech recognition will aid in developing better interventions for language disorders). The project will also support the training of a postdoctoral researcher and a PhD student, both of whom will develop skills that can be used to contribute to research and development in academia or industry. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of a ""shallow deep network"" model called ""DeepListener"" that will be compared with the behavior of human listeners. A close match in the millisecond-level behavior of the network (for example, in which words are temporarily confusable with each other) and human performance suggests that human speech processing may emerge from similar principles as those in the model. In preliminary work, DeepListener learned to recognize 93% of 2000 real words (200 words produced by 10 talkers). DeepListener will be evaluated by detailed comparison to standard neural network models of cognitive theories and to human performance. The ways in which DeepListener is similar and dissimilar to human performance and competing models will help to advance scientific theories of human speech recognition. This project will follow emerging standards for open science: experiments will be pre-registered and data and computer code will be made freely and publicly available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photocatalysts that make fuels, such as methane, using only carbon dioxide, water and sunlight would have significant benefit to society. However, developing photocatalysts capable of sunlight-to-fuel conversion is a challenging problem that requires a fundamental understanding of the chemical reactions taking place on the nanocrystal surface. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Sadtler at Washington University in St. Louis is developing microscopy methods to watch individual, light-driven reactions as they occur on single nanocrystal photocatalysts. Together, Professor Sadtler and his students are gaining new insights into why some atomic sites on the surface of nanocrystals are particularly active for catalysis. Professor Sadtler is also infusing his research into education. He is developing new courses that use atomic structure and chemical bonding as a basis to teach the frontiers of chemistry and materials science, as well as working with high school teachers and students in the St. Louis area.<br/><br/>Metal oxide semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable stoichiometry are promising photocatalysts to produce liquid fuels through solar water splitting, partial methane oxidation, and the reduction of carbon dioxide. However, the contribution of specific structural and morphological features among individual catalyst particles to their ensemble activity is not well understood because each particle is different and possesses a variety of potential reaction sites. This project uses super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and redox-active fluorogenic probes to monitor photoinduced charge-transfer events on individual metal oxide nanocrystals with nanoscale spatial resolution. Correlation of the reactivity maps with the atomic resolution of scanning transmission electron microscopy performed on the same particles reveals how the distribution of oxygen vacancies in individual particles affects their reactivity. To further develop structure-activity relationships in metal oxide photocatalysts, the single-molecule, single-particle data are compared to measurements of bulk photocatalytic activity for methane oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disasters magnify the challenges of managing within this environment, especially when the institution is constrained in its ability to accommodate the unique needs of students who are facing significant difficulties after a natural disaster. The short term disruption caused by a disaster can lead to long-term consequences for public institutions, but many of these more pronounced consequences may not be fully attributable to the effects of the disaster, but instead may be a function of the inability of policy frameworks and administrative structures to adapt to the needs of public institutions and policy beneficiaries after extreme events. Especially important are the financial consequences of enrollment loss and the constraints that come with accreditation structures. This study will use administrative interviews and data on student success to examine the role of policy design in post-disaster decisions and its influence on student success. We hope that our findings will motivate discussions among federal education officials and accreditation organization leaders about the ways in which they may consider options that would enable institutions to better support students in their efforts to rebuild their lives and pursue their educational goals.<br/><br/><br/>Theories of publicness, political control, policy implementation, and the politics of attention mostly speak to the challenges faced by public sector leaders in times of relative stability (not in response to extreme events), and many discussions of disaster response are limited to elected officials and/or federal agencies. This project seeks to examine how these dynamics play out in disaster recovery efforts for public higher education institutions and their students. We will use a mixed methods design, with qualitative interviews of administrators and a quantitative analysis of student data. The study site is Lamar University in Beaumont, TX. The administrative interviews focus on the ways in which efforts to accommodate and support those affected by the storm were influenced by accreditation-related constraints (in this case, from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) and concerns about the effects on funding streams (tuition revenue, state appropriations, and federal financial aid).

This doctoral dissertation project will study cranial anatomy in a number of primate species, taking into account trajectories of growth and development, and use those data to reconstruct the growth and development trajectories of ancestral species. The project will advance knowledge about primate adaptation and life history, and will also generate novel shape measurement tools for studying growth, development and anatomy that will be useful across a number of biological disciplines. Undergraduate students will participate in the processing and analysis of shape measurements, thereby teaching them technical skills in geometric morphometrics, mathematics, and statistical analysis. The project will also support public science outreach activities to share these biological concepts and methodological advances with a broader audience. <br/><br/>The objective of this investigation is to examine how evolution has shaped craniofacial growth and development to produce the morphological diversity observed in catarrhines. Geometric morphometric methods will be used to measure an ontogenetic cranial series of 26 extant catarrhine species, from which trajectories of ontogenetic shape change will be calculated. To address ancestral morphologies, this project will reconstruct the cranial ontogenetic trajectory of the last common ancestor (LCA) of all extant catarrhines, as well as those of the LCA of cercopithecoids, hominoids, and hominins, allowing for a comparison of ancestral trajectories with those of extant taxa. As adult morphologies are largely the product of patterns of growth and development, these ancestral ontogenetic trajectories will be used to make determinations about the cranial shapes of adult catarrhine ancestors. This project will also address the role of cranial size in the production of adult morphologies through an evaluation of the hypothesis of size as a 'line of least evolutionary resistance,' whereby size changes may be a first step in adaptation and diversification, with size responding more quickly than shape to environmental change. Using the latest advances in phylogenetic comparative methods, this hypothesis will be tested through direct comparisons of vectors of ontogenetic shape change in the catarrhine skull, and by examining the catarrhine phylogeny for rate shifts in the evolution of cranial size and in cranial size-shape relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long term success of ML as a field relies on transforming it into an easily usable, seamless technology with rigorous, provable guarantees on performance. Further, to have a positive impact on society, ML technologies need to be equipped to handle the social challenges that accompany any large multi-user systems. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to make socially-responsible ML a readily accessible black-box technology that is applicable in large multi-user interactive systems.  In particular, the project focuses on three concrete challenges. The first challenge is to make ML a plug-and-play technology by automating the process of designing task specific ML algorithms. The second challenge is to develop ML methods for modern applications such as predicting user preferences in social networks, where data is evolving and complexly interconnected. The third challenge is to develop theory and algorithms for recommendation systems that are socially responsible and do not polarize its users. <br/><br/>In recent years, exploring inherent connections between probability theory and sequential prediction problems have lead to a unifying theory and algorithm design principles for online learning. This CAREER project will build on these developments. Using the so called Burkholder method from probability theory and advances in the field of mathematical programming, the project will aim at automating the process of designing new and effective online learning algorithms. Building on the recently developed idea of online relaxations, the project will introduce novel methodology for designing computationally efficient algorithms for learning from interconnected data points. Finally, using and extending ideas from classical statistics to deal with control and nuisance variables, the project will develop new methods for recommender systems that can avoid polarizing users. The CAREER program will advance STEM education by developing new educational components related to ML. ``Machine Learning for the Masses'' workshops will be co-organized with Women In Computing at Cornell aimed at involving women and underrepresented minorities and exposing undergraduates to research and job opportunities in the field of ML during their formative years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is however less recognized that sea level rise can push water tables above the land surface to flood low-lying depressions. Lakes and wetlands that form by groundwater flooding expose connected aquifers to direct, continuous evaporation, which can result in substantial losses of water resources. Impacts from groundwater flooding and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where evaporated freshwater is replaced by seawater that percolates through the bedrock. These models incorporate impact of climate and predicted that lakes should remain fresh, and groundwater resources continuous, beneath islands in humid regions. In arid regions, lakes would be hypersaline, and much fresh groundwater would be replaced by seawater. In contrast to expectations, modern lakes that are formed by groundwater flooding in the arid southern Bahamas islands have salinities that range from fresh to hypersaline. This paradox between modeled and observed lake salinity underscores our lack of understanding of how groundwater flooding impacts island water resources. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that how groundwater flooding will impact island water resources. We will test the impact of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, the degree of connectivity between lakes and the ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change on this process. The results of this study should improve predictions of freshwater resource loss of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from groundwater flooding, perhaps the primary environmental factor triggering their loss of habitability. The modeling tools to be developed as part of this project will be freely distributed to the hydrological community. A field hydrogeology curricular exercise, with learning outcomes of quantitative coastal hydrology, will be developed to be used by the more than 100 student groups that visit the Gerace Research Centre (base of operation for this project) each year. Project results will be presented as part of a guest lecturer series at the University of the Bahamas and at international conferences. The project will enhance human resources by introducing coastal hydrology to 2 geology PhD students, and one civil engineering postdoctoral researcher at Michigan Tech. Each PI will work with their institution's diversity office to ensure that these positions are effectively advertised to under-represented groups.<br/><br/><br/>Evaporation of lakes and wetlands that form on islands by groundwater inundation reorganizes groundwater flow paths and lowers water tables. Impacts from groundwater inundation and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where the Ghyben-Herzberg relationship results in losses from freshwater lenses (the primary freshwater resource) being 40x the lowering of the water table. Primary controls on groundwater inundation will be sea-level rise and island topography, but impacts to freshwater resources could be moderated by climate (precipitation, and evaporation), aquifer permeability, ratio of groundwater contributing area to lake surface area, and distance between the lake and coast. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that groundwater inundation will reduce freshwater lens volumes through interactions of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, degree of connectivity between lakes and ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change. Hypothesis testing will take a three-pronged approach. First, DEMs of San Salvador Island, Bahamas, will characterize lake hydrogeological setting (catchment/lake area ratios). Field observations of hydrogeological parameters and weather data will be used to estimate groundwater fluxes and lake evaporation; chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, lake water, and precipitation will be used to estimate recharge thresholds and lake water sources (ocean, groundwater, recharged precipitation). Second, a package for simulating dynamic flow and solute transport between lakes and groundwater will be developed and integrated into the SEAWAT/MODFLOW model in cllaboration with USGS. The model will be parameterized with observational data collected on San Salvador Island. Third, transient responses of island freshwater lenses to multiple sea level rise, climate change, and lake formation scenarios will be tested with the newly developed numerical modeling tool. Simulations will determine the nature of relationships between freshwater lens volumes and sea level, climatic variables, and island-lake hydrogeological settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising approach to this challenge is the use renewable electricity to produce energy-rich chemical fuels that can be stored, transported, and used whenever necessary. This approach requires catalysts that are capable of efficiently converting inert molecules such as water and carbon dioxide into chemical fuels like hydrogen and methanol. Currently, such catalysts are typically derived from expensive, rare metals such as platinum. To make the electrochemical production of fuels more economically feasible new catalysts that are based on inexpensive and abundant elements are needed. In this project supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. William Harman, Chemistry Department, University of California - Riverside, is exploring platforms based on carbon and boron that mimic many of the important features of commonly used metals catalysts. Their ability to reduce carbon dioxide to fuels and fuel precursors is being developed and inexpensive catalysts are being designed. In addition to providing a vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students at UCR, this research program incorporates outreach to community colleges in the inland southern California area with a focus on promoting opportunities for study in STEM fields among underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>	Due to their intrinsic redox activity and unique modes of reactivity, transition metals have dominated the field of electrochemical small molecule activation.  Recently, materials based on graphitic carbon, often doped with heteroatoms, have emerged for applications in electrocatalysis. This project is preparing carbene-supported and zwitterionic diboraanthrancenes and diboraanthracenes with tethered metal ions. These species are redox active and are capable of coupling electron transfer and small molecule activation. Based on this behavior, catalysts are designed for the electrochemical synthesis of energy rich species, such as methanol, from small molecules, such as carbon dioxide. This research program incorporates a summer research experience for undergraduates at local community colleges as well as outreach to this community regarding opportunities for advanced study in chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems will revolutionize healthcare through early identification of patients at risk, cell-level diagnosis and treatment using nanoprobes, and robotic surgery. They will reduce traffic congestion and help eliminate fatalities by powering autonomous vehicles and unmanned drones. And, they will make businesses safer by detecting and defending in real-time against financial fraud and internet attacks.  More generally, these systems will transform how people sense and interact with the surrounding world making it more adaptive and responsive to our needs.  In order to fulfill this vision, a new generation of AI systems is needed to power mission-critical applications where human safety and well-being are at stake, and can work in adversarial environments that change continually and unexpectedly.  Besides being intelligent, these decision systems need to address four challenges. First, they must react in real-time (i.e., making decisions in seconds or even milliseconds) to support applications such as robotic surgery and self-driving cars. Second, AI systems need to learn continually on live data streams as their environments evolve chaotically.  Third, these systems need to be secure, i.e., ensure privacy, data confidentiality, and decision integrity. Finally, as these systems make decisions on behalf of humans, their decisions need to be explainable to someone with limited understanding of AI. For example, if an AI system diagnoses a patient with a rare disease or deems a certain test unwarranted, the system should provide an explanation in terms of the patient's history and that of the larger population, and not point to the AI algorithm's internal computations. The goal of this Expedition project is to build AI decision systems to address these challenges by developing open source platforms, tools, and algorithms for Real-time, Intelligent, Secure, and Explainable (RISE) decisions. Achieving this goal requires a holistic approach that combines AI, security, systems, and hardware research.  For example, to successfully deploy a fleet of delivery robots in a crowded city requires not only advances in AI (e.g., the ability to perceive and safely navigate complex urban environments), but also advances in systems (e.g., new hybrid edge-cloud systems able to coordinate vehicles in real-time), security (e.g., ensure the information collected by robots' sensors does not compromise customer's privacy), and computer architecture (e.g., hardware and software co-design to reduce power consumption and improve security). <br/>    <br/>The RISE project aims to empower a large community of pioneers to build innovative applications and solutions based on the tools and ideas it will create, and broaden research participation, allowing students and researchers across many disciplines to contribute and build on its artifacts.  Building and fostering a community around a common open platform for AI systems will enable the next decade of innovation centered around widespread, intelligent, and trustworthy computing. The key technical contribution is in the areas at the interface of systems, hardware, and security, which would enable real-time AI. In the Systems domain, there are two key ideas: 1) the design of micro-kernel to fundamentally transform the time scale at which decisions using deep models are made; and, 2) incorporating the ability to replay the state and the decision history of the system. In the security and hardware domain, investigators are designing general purpose systems capable of running on a variety of hardware and cloud platform with an added key feature of tunable security that provides a trade-off between security and performance. In the AI domain, the major contributions of the project are in developing real-time systems and hardware supports that would assign tasks suitably to back-end and edge for fast accurate decision making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes.

While most of the organic material produced by phytoplankton in the sunlit surface waters of the oceans is eaten and recycled in the surface waters, a small amount sinks to the deep ocean in what is called the ""biological carbon pump."" The biological pump is particularly hard to study in high latitude regions, which can be difficult to get to and challenging to work in. It is also particularly important to understand the biological pump in these parts of the ocean, where much of the world's deep ocean waters are formed. The export of carbon to deep waters can be estimated by carefully measuring the amount of excess oxygen left behind in surface waters. Oxygen in seawater can be measured very precisely using sensors deployed on moorings, floats, and gliders. These sensors can be deployed for years at a time, but their measurements must be carefully calibrated. In this project, investigators would use carefully calibrated oxygen sensors on gliders to, in turn, calibrate the oxygen sensors on a set of moorings in the high latitude North Atlantic Ocean, to study the biological carbon pump over a period of two years. The project would train several undergraduate students and a graduate student, and result in the development of educational laboratory materials that incorporate glider and mooring data from the project.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to observationally constrain the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of the biological carbon pump (determined as annual net community production; ANCP) and its influence on air-sea carbon dioxide flux by using biogeochemical sensor measurements from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Irminger Sea Array. However, existing OOI oxygen sensor calibration suffers from both pre- and post-deployment drift, currently precluding the ability to calculate ANCP by oxygen mass balance. The investigators therefore propose to improve the accuracy and utility of OOI Irminger Sea oxygen measurements by deploying two gliders configured for air calibration of their oxygen sensors when surfacing between profiles. These air-calibrated gliders will be used to intercalibrate all 12 existing oxygen sensors on the Irminger Sea Array and produce a calibrated oxygen product incorporating data from all sensors, which will ensure sufficient accuracy to calculate ANCP. Both the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of ANCP, including upper ocean biological productivity and thermocline respiration, will be determined using an oxygen mass balance approach within a data- constrained 1D physical model. A suite of 1D model simulations including the inorganic carbon system, gas exchange, and ANCP determined from oxygen mass balance will be used, together with OOI carbon dioxide measurements, to diagnose influences of physical and biological drivers of air-sea carbon dioxide flux, improving both quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how the biological pump influences the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing methods to manufacture hierarchical nanostructures with long-range order require the use of templates that are limited in terms of fabrication scalability, cost, and time. They also lag behind on generating controlled composition variations in three-dimensional structures. This award supports fundamental research to produce needed knowledge for the study of a facile process to generate scalable and reconfigurable three-dimensional templates for the directed assembly of hierarchical nanostructures with rationally designed structure, topology, composition, and long-range order. This research promotes scientific understanding of the self-assembly process and provides strategies to direct the assembly by engineering the environment. Since assembly process is common in nature, e.g., living cells assemble into functional organs following a hierarchical order, knowledge from this research contributes to the understanding of life and life's engineering, which impacts the NSF Big Idea of 'Understanding the Rules of Life'. The multi-disciplinary research, involving acoustics, fluid dynamics, materials science and manufacturing, provides unique training and research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. The project involves community college students, especially, those from under-represented minorities, in research and help achieve academic success in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The assembly of hierarchical nanostructures directed by acoustically-modulated emulsion can overcome several limitations existing assembly methods have, including disordered structures in long range, high cost, lengthy time, low scalability, and limited control of composition and anisotropy. However, fundamental scientific barriers are yet to be overcome to fully exploit the application potential of hierarchical nanostructures. This research is to fill the knowledge gap on the dynamics of nanoparticles and nanoparticle-loaded droplets in the Pickering emulsion system when subjected to a standing acoustic field. The project performs multi-scale molecular dynamics and finite element simulation, coupled with experimental validation, to investigate the dynamics of nanoparticles and emulsion droplets and delineate the effects of key process variables. Based on the fundamental studies, acoustically-modulated emulsion systems are designed and developed to manufacture a set of rationally designed metal oxide hierarchical nanostructures with structural, topological and compositional anisotropy in both nano- and micro- scales. Using titanium dioxide-based dye sensitized solar cell as a model device, the correlation of nano- and micro- scale structural and compositional anisotropy with the macroscale material properties and device performances are established.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Radiocarbon measurements (14-Carbon) will ensure accurate dating assessments. Thus, successful tree species will be selected to improve the 14-Carbon curve for the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting tree-ring series will be used to reconstruct past climate variability and regional to large--scale atmospheric dynamics for the last several centuries. The specific aims of the project are to improve understanding of: (1) the spatiotemporal variability of the South American summer monsoon (SASM); (2) long-term interactions between El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the SASM; and (3) the impact of volcanic forcing on past hydroclimate of the tropical Andes.<br/><br/>The research aims to provide significant advances in the science of tropical dendrochronology by<br/>developing a tree-ring network for the tropical Andes in Peru and Bolivia, a region with exceedingly scarce coverage of high-resolution terrestrial paleo-records. While tree rings have been extensively used in temperate climates, the tropics remain relatively unexplored due to the difficulty, in particular, of identifying consistent wood layers (tree rings) corresponding to seasonal or annual growing periods. The Central Andes are an ideal region for overcoming these difficulties, due to the pronounced precipitation seasonality and diverse forests.<br/><br/>The tropical Andes are a hotspot for biodiversity and its geographic position makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change. It also contains nearly all the tropical glaciers on the globe, and recent, widespread glacial retreat is causing a rapid decline in hydrological reserves.  This decline, in combination with increasing water demand due to population growth and economic expansion poses an enormous challenge for water availability, biodiversity and food security. The complex topography of the Andean Cordillera leads to a climate that is characterized by strong zonal and vertical precipitation gradients. Moisture influx from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon basin is modulated by the SASM and ENSO. The scientific understanding of this variability is challenged by the scarcity of long instrumental observations, which also limits the ability to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections over this region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the scene in an animal's eyes only makes sense if it knows its own body position and movements. While they are moving, animals can also predict how their senses will be affected by their own movements. For example, as a human walks, his eyes bounce up and down with his steps, but he does not see this motion because his brain predicts and ignores this self-generated visual information. Though much is known about how this process works in a single sense organ, less is known about how multiple senses work together to do this. In many animals, the inner ear monitors the position and movement of the body. However, the inner ear is inside the head and difficult to study and manipulate. This project will take advantage of animals with rotation sensors on the outside of their bodies to observe how these organs influence behavior.  In flies, specialized organs called halteres detect body movements and these structures are located outside the body near the wings.  This research will measure changes in fly behavior that occur when the sensory information coming from the haltere is changed and when it does not match information gathered through vision. This work will show how multiple senses are integrated with the animal's own behavior to guide movement. By examining how the brain combines multiple sensory inputs and anticipates the consequences of its own behaviors, this work will uncover mechanisms of the brain's function that can be applied to other species and that can be used to understand biological brains and engineer algorithms for moving machines. The project will also be incorporated into a series of workshops at an all-girls high school with the goal of improving quantitative and computer coding skills in female students. <br/><br/>Distinguishing between self-generated and externally generated body movements is a central challenge for the nervous system. Efference copy, a neural signal of opposite sign to expected sensory input, is a possible mechanism for this distinction. Efference copies have been observed in single sensory systems, but how might they function in a multi-sensory context? Using an animal with a well-understood visual system and an easily-accessible mechanosensory organ, these experiments will investigate how these two sensory modalities combine during voluntary and involuntary movements.  In flies, body rotations are detected by specialized mechanosensors called halteres. These are modified hindwings that perform a function similar to the mammalian vestibular system. This project will investigate the integration of haltere information, visual information, and motor commands through quantitative behavioral analysis of flying flies. Flies will fly under different conditions: flight with imposed body rotations (tethered to a motor), flight with free, self-generated rotations (tethered to pins suspended between magnets), and rigidly tethered flight (no body rotations) with imposed movements of the haltere. The fly's head movement behavior will be observed under these conditions, and the behavior of intact flies will be compared to flies with their mechanosensory halteres removed or manipulated. Finally, information theoretic analysis will be used to quantify the flow of information in the visual and mechanosensory systems and construct a theoretical framework that can be used to understand how information about body rotations is integrated with visual information to control posture and gaze. Taken together, these experiments and model will demonstrate how two sensory modalities are combined and integrated with motor feedback during flight.  Broader impacts include workshops to broaden experience for young women in quantitative and computer coding skills and presentation of the work to various non-scientific audiences. Work completed here has application to the field of robotics and the development of higher quality autonomous aerial robotics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

River input is the primary source of land-derived sediment to the marine environment. These particles have significant impacts on the health of coastal ecosystems and the geology and bathymetry of coastal oceans and shipping channels. They directly and indirectly affect fisheries and navigation. This research focuses on the movement of sediments carried into the Gulf of Mexico, via the Brazos River, during the unprecedented rainfall and flooding event that occurred during Hurricane Harvey. The Brazos River ranks as the second largest contributor of nutrients and organic matter to the Gulf of Mexico, after the Mississippi River.  Unlike the Mississippi, however, most sediment delivered to the Gulf of Mexico from the Brazos is carried during flooding events like that which accompanied Hurricane Harvey.  Little is known about the fate of this sediment.  It is not clear if it is retained in the coastal zone, where the nutrients and chemicals it carries affect the coastal environment, or is carried offshore and deposited in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Through intensive sampling of sediments just offshore the mouth of the Brazos River and further offshore in the Gulf of Mexico in what is known as the Texas Mud Blanket, this project will determine the principal repository of sediments delivered to the western Gulf of Mexico by a major Texas river.   <br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to investigate the hypothesis that flood-borne sediment from the Brazos River is initially deposited in the coastal zone and subsequently mobilized and carried offshore with a large fraction of it being deposited in the Texas Mud Blanket.  The work builds on the analysis of sea-bottom sediment samples collected in 2017 during flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey.  This new program will include two sampling cruises to augment already collected data. The first cruise will entail acquisition of ~25 cores that will indicate sediment deposition and transport in the near-shore region near the Brazos River mouth.  Preliminary work indicates that much of the initial deposition of Brazos River sediment occurred east of the original sampling region.   The second cruise in will collect additional Brazos region cores and expand sampling into the Texas Mud Blanket, with the goal of documenting changes in Brazos sediment deposition from the Hurricane Harvey flooding.  During both cruises, complementary hydrography data will be collected. This includes water column velocities and suspended sediment loads. Provenance of individual layers, within the sediment samples and box cores, will be determined by digital photos and x-radiographs of intact core slabs that show sediment fabric and structures.  To differentiate Gulf of Mexico from Brazos River sediments, sub-samples of collected cores will be geochemically analyzed and profiled for short-lived-radioisotope geochronology, water content, grainsize distribution, and mercury and carbonate content.  These indicators will help identify the origin of the sediments deposited in the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These issues have only grown more significant and complex because of conflicting understandings about the environmental and heritage value of rural lands as well as increased participation of non-profits and the public in land management practices. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, asks how land managers balance these myriad priorities to improve processes of public involvement in land management planning. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of navigating land management, improving policies and practices, and promoting environmental, cultural, and economic sustainability.<br/><br/>Doctoral student Julia Sizek, supervised by Dr. Daniel Fisher at the University of California-Berkeley, will explore what factors influence shifts in land management policies and practices on rural lands. Research conducted in Southeastern California's Mojave Desert, an area gaining increasing visibility as both a place of ecological value and a site of Native American, homesteading, and military history. This region is currently in the process of land management planning for two new national monuments (Mojave Trails National Monument and Castle Mountains National Monuments, established 2016), but also contains a contentious National Park Service unit: the Mojave National Preserve, established in 1994. By studying how members of environmental and Native American organizations participate in land management planning and understand the value of the desert, this research will reveal the cultural and ecological value of desert lands as understood today, and how this affects land management priorities. This research will also follow land managers on privately and publicly-held conservation lands, seeing how land management practices (e.g.  use regulations, fence-building, trail-building, reseeding, signage) are changing in the desert as understandings of desert ecology and the extent of historical and cultural research are becoming more accurate. Data about understandings of the desert and scientific advances will be collected through interviews with relevant experts, analysis of environmental events aimed at public participation in planning processes, and site visits to areas of ecological restoration and desert protection. The project will advance theoretical debates about land and governance under conditions of environmental uncertainty, and the effects of heterogeneity in land conservation practices. Research results will be relevant to landscape-scale environmental planning processes happening in the Mojave Desert and elsewhere, and will also show how perceptions of the environmental value of the desert are shifting and with what effects for land management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These interactions underlie many biological processes (e.g., DNA replication and enzyme catalysis) which, when artfully mimicked in man-made materials, can have important applications for biomedical, environmental, and renewable energy fields. However, factors that influence the strengths of hydrogen bonds (i.e., how ""sticky"" they are) in these complex systems remain largely convoluted, making ""copying nature"" in man-made materials difficult. In this project, Prof. Judy Wu and her students at the University of Houston are applying computational tools to study how hydrogen bonds work in concert in large complex organic molecules. Her research aims to establish new and useful ways of controlling hydrogen bonds, and to demonstrate their broader impacts for the discovery of advanced materials (e.g., gels, plastics, and electronics with novel properties). Integrated to this project are plans to develop a ""Numbers to Insights"" student workshop and web application to help facilitate the exchange of scientific ideas and findings across computational and experimental chemistry research groups.  <br/><br/>The proposed project aims to show that the marriage of two fundamental chemical concepts, aromaticity and hydrogen bonding, gives rise to surprising reciprocal effects with important consequences for supramolecular chemistry. Despite the recognition of hydrogen bonding and aromaticity as largely separate concepts in organic chemistry, research from the Wu group is showing that aromaticity can be used to control the strengths of intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions through a phenomena called aromaticity-modulated hydrogen bonding (AMHB). Computational quantum chemical tools are applied to test the AMHB relationship at the 1) ground and 2) excited states of hydrogen-bonded molecular recognition units, 3) to investigate how AMHB influences the self-assembly modes of hydrogen-bonded molecular building blocks, and 4) to elucidate the role of AMHB in some examples of enzyme catalysis. At the core of this CAREER project is the vision to bridge discoveries of novel chemical relationships to their probable impacts in supramolecular chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When paired with sensory functions, autonomous machines with even rudimentary intelligence are expected to revolutionize the world's economy. Today, the vision that most machines have is based on traditional intensity pictures of a scene, just as humans use. This vision modality has many limitations: it is impaired by fog and rain, and it offers no spectral information other than combinations of three fundamental colors. These issues greatly limit the practical use of autonomous machines due to their stringent safety and reliability requirements. As a result, expensive optical instruments are being used to assist conventional vision in accomplishing special tasks. The proposed project has the potential to overcome the fundamental issues of traditional imaging technologies. It is based on a new type of light-sensing pixels that can measure multimodal information of light, such as incident angle, wavelength, and phase. They could offer unprecedented scene awareness for pervasive use in future machines.<br/>Light-sensitive pixels used in today's camera can only detect the intensity of light. The intensity information is sufficient for conventional applications such as photography, its limitations become apparent in advanced vision tasks. This project will develop a new class of photodetectors to measure multimodal information of light waves. They are compact and can form high density arrays as imaging chips. Although multimodal information can be measured through conventional optical components, such as lenses, prisms, and gratings, these components are expensive to integrate. They also degrade spatial resolution and decrease operational speed. This project uses novel nanostructures to exploit unique optical interactions. Multi-modal pixels will be designed using full wave simulation and fabricated with photo-lithography. The multimodal pixels are completely compatible with existing semiconductor fabrication facilities and could potentially be mass-produced at the cost of consumer electronics. The project will also develop new machine learning algorithms to exploit multimodal information to perform vision tasks far beyond those possible with today's intensity-only approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Maker-based learning experiences are similar to traditional project-based learning experiences, but extend beyond the classroom through long-term project involvement and direct community connections. The MakerCETS project will provide scholarships for three cohorts of 12 low-income, academically talented students over the course of five years and will focus on connecting these 36 students to their peers and regional engineering technology communities.<br/><br/>The MakerCETS project will increase student access to STEM programs by providing financial assistance and academic support for Engineering Technology program students with the goals of increasing retention, graduation, and transfer rates and improving student workforce placement opportunities. This project will broaden participation in STEM through the development of student support and networking structures and the inclusion of maker-based work that has been shown to increase diversity and is especially attractive to women. Participants will engage in an MBL sequence, create individualized educational and career plans, build strong academic communities and workforce networks, have access to robust placement support services, and benefit from seamless transfer opportunities to BTC's new Baccalaureate of Applied Science in Engineering Technology and Western Washington University's College of Science & Engineering. Project staff will investigate the impact this maker-inspired, community building approach has on success rates and perceived self-efficacy for STEM students and use results to inform and disseminate the creation of an adaptable, replicable student engagement and support model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders.<br/><br/>The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater.  To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has recently become clear, however, that many marine species are subdivided into multiple populations that have evolved to thrive best under contrasting local environmental conditions. Nevertheless, we still know very little about the genomic mechanisms that enable divergent adaptations in the face of ongoing intermixing. This project focuses on the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), a small estuarine fish that exhibits a remarkable degree of local adaptation in growth rates and a suite of other traits tightly associated with a climatic gradient across latitudes. Decades of prior lab and field studies have made Atlantic silverside one of the marine species for which we have the best understanding of evolutionary tradeoffs among traits and drivers of selection causing adaptive divergence. Yet, the underlying genomic basis is so far completely unknown. The investigators will integrate whole genome sequencing data from wild fish sampled across the distribution range with breeding experiments in the laboratory to decipher these genomic underpinnings. This will provide one of the most comprehensive assessments of the genomic basis for local adaptation in the oceans to date, thereby generating insights that are urgently needed for better predictions about how species can respond to rapid environmental change. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for a postdoc as well as two graduate and several undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities. The findings will also be leveraged to develop engaging teaching and outreach materials (e.g. a video documentary and popular science articles) to promote a better understanding of ecology, evolution, and local adaptation among science students and the general public. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to characterize the genomic basis and architecture underlying local adaptation in M. menidia and examine how the adaptive divergence is shaped by varying levels of gene flow and maintained over ecological time scales. The project is organized into four interconnected components. Part 1 examines fine-scale spatial patterns of genomic differentiation along the adaptive cline to a) characterize the connectivity landscape, b) identify genomic regions under divergent selection, and c) deduce potential drivers and targets of selection by examining how allele frequencies vary in relation to environmental factors and biogeographic features. Part 2 maps key locally adapted traits to the genome to dissect their underlying genomic basis. Part 3 integrates patterns of variation in the wild (part 1) and the mapping of traits under controlled conditions (part 2) to a) examine how genomic architectures underlying local adaptation vary across gene flow regimes and b) elucidating the potential role of chromosomal rearrangements and other tight linkage among adaptive alleles in facilitating adaptation. Finally, part 4 examines dispersal - selection dynamics over seasonal time scales to a) infer how selection against migrants and their offspring maintains local adaptation despite homogenizing connectivity and b) validate candidate loci for local adaptation. Varying levels of gene flow across the species range create a natural experiment for testing general predictions about the genomic mechanisms that enable adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow. The findings will therefore have broad implications and will significantly advance our understanding of the role genomic architecture plays in modifying the gene flow - selection balance within coastal environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this multidisciplinary project, the investigators want to understand what triggered the recent extinction of all of Madagascar's large native vertebrates, including its chimpanzee- and gorilla-sized lemurs, enormous 'elephant birds,' and horned crocodiles. The discovery of extraordinary deposits of fossils and stalagmites in previously-unexplored flooded and dry caves at Tsimanampesotse National Park (TNP) in southwestern Madagascar has opened new opportunities for researchers to address this question. An international team of anthropologists, geologists and ecologists will work with cave divers to retrieve and study fossils and stalagmites from the flooded caves and nearby dry deposits. By taking small samples of rock from stalagmites and studying their chemistry, the team will be able to reconstruct with great precision changes in habitat and rainfall over the past 50,000 years. Team members will also document changes in the presence or absence of small animals that may be excellent indicators of habitat transformation. Through this work, they will identify specific turning points in the catastrophic decline and extinction of Madagascar's large vertebrates, which will have broad implications for how to avoid future extinctions on the island and elsewhere. The team will support public science outreach with creation of 3D maps of the flooded caves and fossil deposits, and multi-language, multi-media educational displays. The displays will focus on conservation, and how understanding the past can inform the future. Finally, this project will support the doctoral dissertations of three graduate students, and build future opportunities for international collaborative research.    <br/><br/>The investigators will utilize state-of-the-art techniques from anthropology, ecology, cave science and paleoclimatology to tease apart how environmental changes and human activities affect communities of plants and animals. This work is challenging, especially since natural aridification (through reduced rainfall) and human disturbance (through setting fires, cutting trees, raising cattle or other introduced domesticated animals, and planting crops) can have similar devastating effects on the distribution and abundance of wild plants and animals. However, stalagmites preserve precisely-datable records of changes in local rainfall and vegetation. Consequently, it is possible to know when rainfall and vegetation co-varied, and when vegetation changed independent of rainfall, implying that some other agent, such as humans, was responsible. Bones and teeth of animals can preserve datable evidence of the diets, activities, movements and habitats of species that have survived, and those that have not. Sometimes traces on the surfaces of fossils themselves preserve evidence of how individuals died - for example, by succumbing to a predatory bird, carnivore or human. This project will tease apart the relative importance of environmental change and human activities, and build a chronology of the survival and extinction of species. Advances in the science of the chemistry of rocks, bones, and teeth, coupled with the old-fashioned tools of paleontological analysis (identifying fossils and recording their associations) have made all of this possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent research indicates that these large-scale events have altered the hydrological and ecosystem balances over historical and geological timescales (decades to thousands of years). This project will assess how far north along the coast of southwestern North America these storms have occurred in the geologic past, and how far inland they controlled geomorphic change events through rain and erosion. The specific goal is to determine if previously documented periods when tropical cyclones dominated runoff and sediment deposition across large alluvial fan systems of the southern Baja California peninsula can be detected in central Baja California, the southern California deserts, and even as far north as the southern Arizona Sonoran Desert. Data will test whether dissipating cyclones were drivers of alluvial fan sedimentation over thousands of years, and if a temporal correlation can be established to a period of transition between a milder, humid paleoclimate to the current arid climate. For the first time, a tropical cyclone landfall chronology covering the last few millennia will be developed for the Pacific coast of southwestern North America. This research has the potential to inform large-storm prediction scenarios for southern California and northwestern Mexico, which is relevant to hazards management for communities in need of risk assessment of rare and extreme events. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of earth scientists using a tiered approach, with field-based collaboration of postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. This approach has been proven successful for inclusion of underrepresented minorities, enhanced also with planned research alongside Mexican collaborators and students. The project will provide unique broader educational experiences for grade-school students in Indiana and Arizona, through the use of technology to connect fieldwork and classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will compare a recently established alluvial fan chronology in southern Baja California, with newly-obtained alluvial fan and paleotempestological records. A Holocene paleotempestological record of overwash deposits in the Pacific coastal Vizcaino Desert will be developed for the first time. The inferred tropical storm activity will be compared with inland alluvial fan deposition in this area and in the northern Sonoran Desert, enabling discrimination of signals from different moisture sources, based on observed coastal and alluvial sedimentology, stratigraphy, and specific proxy records. Effects of different sources of moisture that drive sedimentation will be assessed by probing different time periods, and compared to independent paleoclimatic proxies. Bayesian analysis of luminescence, cosmogenic, and radiocarbon geochronology will improve age control precision. The coupled alluvial and coastal record at orbital timescales will help to understand linkages between Quaternary alluvial sedimentation and hydroclimatic variability in the region, and will increase our understanding of basic principles of alluvial fan aggradation in response to change in arid hydroclimates. The project will test effects of millennial- and orbital-scale shifts in tropical circulation on landscape evolution of the region, which are, in turn, critical to test models of occurrence and effects of hydrological extremes and associated landscape changing events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researcher will investigate how people develop new understandings of risk in very high risk/very high reward situations. The context in which this question will be investigated is clinical trials of new cancer immunotherapy drugs, which have the ability to achieve high cure rates for previously incurable and rapidly terminal disease. Because the possibility of a cure comes at the cost of serious side effects, the new immunotherapies introduce a level of uncertainty about treatment outcomes beyond what either  patients or clinicians have heretofore experienced.  This requires new methods of communicating about and navigating uncertainty for those who run and those who participate in clinical trials. This research will investigate the relationship between new clinical understanding of immunotherapies and how explanations of risk and efficacy are crafted, utilized, and contested in the unique cultural space of the clinical trial.<br/><br/>Dr. Marlaine Figueroa Gray (Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute) will conduct this preliminary study by documenting and analyzing conversations in which patients are consented into trials, focusing on how uncertainty is framed by the provider and the patient.  Figueroa Gray will use ethnographic methods to collect data by documenting the content of consent conversations in which providers explain benefit and risk of trial participation to patients, and will observe the clinical space in which such conversations take place.  The researcher will also conduct interviews with providers who run the trials and patients who participate in them at a cancer research facility in Seattle, Washington.  Findings from this research will connect biomedical and lay understandings of new immunological therapeutics to professional and lay conceptions of risk and management of uncertainty. Findings will contribute to new social science theory of how people form their understandings of extreme risk and appropriate courses of action.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cells and tissues that make up living organisms have material properties just like any other substance. When exposed to mechanical forces, such as pulling or pushing, they stretch and change shape. They can even generate these forces themselves.  The material properties of cells are controlled by the cytoskeleton, a collection of filamentous proteins. This network of filaments gives cells their shape, much like the skeleton defines the human shape. In cells, however, this network is dynamic and adaptive, reorganizing itself to help cells perform various functions or to resist outside mechanical stresses. The cytoskeleton thus represents a new class of material that doesn't obey the traditional models of engineering materials. It can modulate its material properties in both space and time.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will determine how the cell is able to spatially and temporally regulate its material properties and unearth novel design principles that can be used to develop new engineering materials and to understand how some diseases affect cell behavior. Sitting at the interface between physics, biology, and engineering, this multi-disciplinary work will inform research across a broad spectrum of fields. Most importantly, it will create opportunities for a diverse set of students and young researchers to develop innovative skills and perspectives, in particular learning to communicate novel methods and ideas across disciplines. <br/><br/>The cytoskeleton is a model system for developing insights into non-equilibrium mechanics and network dynamics, and is known to both generate and respond to mechanical signals. Despite the fact that the principal molecular biochemical interactions have been well detailed, we still lack an understanding of how macroscopic scale behaviors emerge from the collection of many molecular interactions. Septins are the least studied filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. They bind to both actin and the plasma membrane, and have been shown to localize specifically to regions of actin curvature and mechanical stress. This research project will test the hypothesis that septins help to regulate the material properties of the cytoskeleton by altering the local architecture. This work will measure the material properties of septin-actin networks in both living cells and purified protein networks, and test the response of these networks to mechanical perturbations such as micropatterning to control cell shape, traction force microscopy, and optogenetics to induce local contractions. In addition to potentially uncovering novel mechanisms to regulate cell shape, this work will also generate insight into how molecular interactions in a network are integrated into macroscopic behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will involve emerging agricultural technologies like transparent soil (a recent discovery which is a hydrogel that behaves like soil), a near-peer and college-focused mentoring model, and interaction with scientists. The youth will learn to build and code Raspberry Pis (small and affordable computers that students can use to learn programming) to share their data with agronomists and plant scientists. The outcome goal for this work is to prepare youth to enter a post-secondary institution with strong research skills through experience in conducting careful, rigorous scientific research. Throughout the three-year project, youth will be engaged in the same type of scientific research that is occurring at the university level. Specifically, youth will learn: (i) to build the tools (sensors connected to Raspberry Pi and sensors connected to the Internet of Things web infrastructure provided by IBM Watson software system) they will use to collect their data, (ii) to carry out a rigorous scientific investigation (identifying questions, as well as finding and minimizing experimental containments, and determining dependent vs. independent variables), and (iii) to develop models and potential explanations based on their data in collaboration with practicing scientists. The program will recruit low-income youth, and youth from populations underrepresented in science from high schools in Boston Public Schools and support them in learning core scientific research skills and engage them in building the tools they will use to conduct their more complex experiments. The program will not only build the capacity of the youth participants to make potential scientific discoveries, but through the mentoring program youth leaders and mentors will become role models to youth in their community.<br/><br/>There are four major aspects of the proposed work. First, youth will engage with cutting edge technologies being used in scientific research labs. Second, a diverse team of collaborators will be assembled consisting of STEM career development experts, Youth Mentoring experts, Scientists, and Science Educators to design the proposed work. Third, the program is a unique combination of three synergistic components: (1) a near-peer mentoring approach, (2) STEM learning, and (3) youth purpose and career development. Unlike other out-of-school STEM programs, this program will not only support the learning of STEM concepts, but it will do so by taking youth on a personal journey designed to help them discover the relevance of STEM skills for fulfilling future career aspirations, as well as preparing them for post-secondary education. Fourth, the data that youth will share with practicing scientists has the potential to help answer important questions in plant science regarding how plants, particularly their root structures, react to environmental stressors. The research approach provides an opportunity to examine how such constructs as purpose, critical consciousness, and work volition impact youths' intentions to pursue a STEM field. To date, these important constructs have not been seriously considered in STEM career development. Thus, the research on the impact of near-peer mentoring and youths' adaptability and intentionality to explore, pursue, and stay in STEM fields will provide the ITEST community with an evidence-based model integrating near-peer mentoring, scientific research, and STEM career development to elucidate how youth may successfully pursue a STEM field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current methods to achieve cellular resolution are invasive (e.g., blood test or tissue biopsy), and non-invasive imaging modalities do not achieve cellular resolution. The principal goal of this Expeditions project is to develop computational imaging systems for non-invasive bio-imaging, deep beneath the skin, and at cellular-level resolutions. This project has the potential to fundamentally impact healthcare and medicine, by enabling live views of cross sections of human anatomy, simply by pointing a camera at any part of the body. This would put individual users at the center of their healthcare experience and make them true partners in their healthcare delivery. The health imaging devices that result from this project will act as an important pillar in the personalized medicine revolution. This research expedition also holds the potential to launch new healthcare paradigms for chronic disease management, pediatrics, low-resource healthcare, and disaster medical care. Beyond healthcare, making progress on the problem of cellular-scale deep-tissue imaging using light will push the frontiers of the fundamental problem of inverse scattering, which impacts numerous areas of science and engineering. The order of magnitude advances made in inverse scattering and imaging through scattering media will have significant cross-cutting applications in diverse areas such as basic science, consumer imaging, automotive navigation, robotics, surveillance, atmospheric science, and material science. Finally, projects with a single, easy-to-appreciate, and high-impact goal have the potential to inspire the next generation of scientists, attract diverse set of students driven by humanitarian and social causes, and become a platform for inclusion and innovation.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate new computational imaging systems, to non-invasively image below the skin at tunable depths, in highly portable form-factors such as wearables or point-of-care devices. The main challenge is that light scatters as it travels through the human body, and in this process, the spatial information from different points within the body gets mixed up. A new concept, Computational Photo-Scatterography (CPS), is being applied in this project in order to computationally unravel the scattered photons in an imaging system, and allow creation of sharp images and accurate inferences. Recognizing that the brute-force complexity of unraveling scattered photons is prohibitively high, the project uses a computational co-design framework that leverages advances by team members from multiple domains: programmable illumination and optics, image sensors, machine learning, inverse graphics, and hybrid analog-digital computing.  The project will use machine learning (ML) instead of physics-based de-scattering to speed up the solution of the underlying inverse problem. A combination of physics-based inverse graphics algorithms, and ML algorithms combining deep learning and generative modeling will be used to estimate tissue scattering parameters -  motion due to blood flow induces time-variation in tissue parameters, which makes solving the inverse scattering problem more difficult. The project will use ML to create fast but approximate estimators, which will serve as accelerators for inverse scattering. The development of new sensors, able to capture the data necessary to reconstruct the structure of the tissue deep below the skin, constitutes the most important contribution of the project. These systems and algorithms will have the potential to break the current resolution limits of noninvasive bio-imaging by nearly two orders of magnitude, enabling cellular-level imaging at depths far beyond currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project will investigate how differences in early exposure to multiple caregivers influence a human infant's early communicative and cognitive development. The researchers hypothesize that AMC plays a significant role in shaping communicative and cognitive development by providing a rich and varied learning environment. Identifying how exposure to AMC may influence cognitive and communicative developmental trajectories will advance our understanding of why extensive AMC developed and was maintained in the human species. This project will support training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in STEM research, and a new partnership between the University of Arizona's School of Anthropology and the Frances McClelland Institute for Children, Youth, and Families. The outcomes of this research may also inform educational programs to support communicative and cognitive development. To share their findings with the public, the researchers will generate a website and visit local mothers' support groups.<br/><br/>AMC is known to supplement an infant's intense energy needs through nutritional provisioning, but previous research has not fully investigated whether allomaternal care benefits infants in other ways. This research enhances traditional perceptions of AMC by hypothesizing that children gain important communicative and cognitive benefits in addition to nutritional support when they receive frequent allomaternal care during early development. The research represents an interdisciplinary, holistic approach to exploring the potential effects of AMC on early brain development before the age of two. Using a novel combination of interdisciplinary methods, including questionnaires, daily diaries, interviews, laboratory tasks, and clinical cognitive measures, this project will examine how care impacts developmental outcomes in young children. Participants will include infants aged 13 to 18 months and their mothers. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether AMC improves early developmental outcomes, such that infants exposed to high levels of AMC develop a more extensive set of communicative and cognitive skills at a younger age than infants exposed to low levels of AMC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their unique colors, behaviors, and their ability to fly, birds in particular have been one of the most symbolically important types of animals throughout time. This is especially true in the prehistoric Americas, where the study of their remains from archaeological sites can help address questions concerning prehistoric ritual and religion. Katelyn Bishop, a PhD Candidate at the University of California, Los Angeles, will examine prehistoric Pueblo ritual and religion through an analysis of the use and ideological significance of birds in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico between AD 850-1150. Ethnographic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological research have demonstrated the centrality of birds in Pueblo ritual and cosmology; avifaunal remains, which are frequently under-studied, should therefore be considered strong indicators of ritual practice, the analysis of which can speak to ideological perceptions and belief. The reconstruction of ritual practices in Chaco Canyon, a major social and ceremonial center in what is now New Mexico, during the Pueblo II period (AD 900-1150), will contextualize these traditions in the long development of Pueblo ritual and religion, and within broader regional context in the greater Southwest. The results of this research may have relevance to modern descendent communities, and can enrich the experience of visitors to the Chaco Canyon National Historical Park through the creation of an interpretive exhibit on the past and present importance of birds in the Pueblo world, and online material for those who cannot access the remote location of the park. This project will bring together material from widely disbursed institutions, and demonstrate the importance of bringing to light old and unpublished collections from historic excavations.<br/><br/>Through the analysis of both avifaunal remains and the depiction of birds in art, Bishop seeks to address three major goals: (1) to understand the nature of ritual practice and ideologies that involved birds; (2) to understand how ritual was organized across the canyon, within and between multiple great houses and small sites; and (3) to examine change over time in the nature of ritual and its organization. In the process of achieving these goals, this project will synthesize all avifaunal remains and bird imagery from the nearly 130-year long history of excavation in the canyon. Bishop relies on the theoretical perspective of ritual as a form of social practice, where ritual is a dynamic activity that is both structured by and can restructure existing social and belief structures. This theoretical perspective makes it possible to understand what ritual practices may have looked like, and how they may have changed over time. She also employs ethnographically-based models to understand the organization of this ritual practice, with expectations derived from modern and historic organizational principles of ritual. Under the guidance of Dr. Gregson Schachner, Bishop's research will advance our understanding of Pueblo ritual and religion, the nature of the Chaco regional system, and the value of birds in prehistory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unaccompanied minors are an internationally protected class of humans, with rights guaranteed by the 1990 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and its ratification into law in 196 nations. However, in practice, there is disagreement about how the care and protection of minors, particularly unaccompanied minor immigrants, actually should happen and what it means. This ambiguity can produce major policy challenges for receiving countries. While the notions of ""integration"" and ""care"" are rarely challenged, the practices produced by these ideas may be ambiguous and even ineffective.  The researcher asks: How can governments carry out their responsibilities to both their own citizens and to arriving minors? How can the minors become self-sufficient while also conforming to what is asked of them as care recipients? This research is important because it will contribute to understanding the reality of responding to the growing numbers of older unaccompanied minors throughout the world.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out by Stanford University anthropology doctoral student, Torin Jones, under the supervision of Dr. Sylvia Yanagisako. The researcher has chosen to situate the project primarily in youth migrant centers in the Mediterranean city of Catania, a longstanding port of migrant disembarkation in Eastern Sicily. This is an appropriate site because Catania is generally regarded as a success story due to its elaborated migrant welcome services. In addition, the region has had multiple approaches to border securitizations. Therefore, understanding the situation in Catania may provide a model for other cities, including migrant receiving sites in the United States. The researcher will collect information through interviews, participant observation, and life history elecitation with bureaucrats, migrant center staff, and migrants themselves. He will also collect and analyze appropriate documents. These materials will allow the researcher to learn how a particular set of policies and programs is received by and affects youth migrants. Findings from the research will contribute to better theory of migrant governance and recipient response.

A particular area of interest is the rate of exchange of gases such as carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide, which play important roles in Earth's climate. Understanding and modeling air-sea exchange on a global scale requires understanding of how gas exchange rates vary in response to a number of factors such as temperature, wind speed, and the presence of surface chemical films (known as surfactants) in the ocean. Over the past 25 years, major advances have been made in understanding air-sea gas exchange in the open ocean, mainly due to improvements in methodologyand a number of successful process studies. However, some important questions remain, such as what happens near coastal areas (including inland seas), and how surfactants affect gas exchange. The Baltic Sea Gas Exchange Experiment (Baltic GasEx) is a collaboration between scientists from the US and Germany designed to address these questions. Participants in Baltic GasEx will measure the air-sea gas exchange rates with different techniques in the Baltic Sea before and after the spring bloom, when concentrations and compositions of surfactants will be different. The expeditions will be conducted on a German ship (Alkor), with the ultimate goal of quantifying the relationship between wind speed and gas exchange in an inland sea, and understanding the impact of surfactants on air-sea gas exchange. The project will involve significant international collaboration, public education and outreach through both participating U.S. institutions, and substantial student training in partnership with the international collaborators.<br/><br/>NSF funding will support helium-3 and sulfur hexafluoride measurements during Baltic GasEx to determine the gas exchange rate. German colleagues are independently funded to quantify surfactants with AC voltammetry, surface tension, and sum frequency generation; to determine chemical characteristics of the micro layer; and to estimate the gas exchange rate using eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2 and DMS. The proposed experiment is designed to address the question of whether open ocean wind speed/gas exchange parameterizations can be applied to inland seas like the Baltic. Also, the effect of surfactants on gas exchange has been studied extensively in the laboratory, but there is little direct field evidence for the effect of surfactants on gas exchange. The proposed experiment, with expeditions at times with both high and low surfactant concentrations, should shed new light on the effect of natural surfactants on gas exchange. Finally, some wind speed/gas exchange parameterizations proposed for the Baltic Sea appear to be higher than typical open ocean parameterizations. These are typically based on eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2. However, in open ocean experiments where both the helium-3/sulfur hexafluoride approach and eddy covariance of CO2 have been deployed, there seems to be a discrepancy between gas transfer velocities measured with the two techniques. This experiment should show whether a similar difference in gas transfer velocities measured via these two techniques also exists in the Baltic Sea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity.<br/><br/>The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, these species depend on a short-lived spring algal bloom for growth and the accumulation of lipid stores in order to complete an annual life cycle that includes a period of dormancy. The intellectual thrust of this project measures how the timing and magnitude of algal blooms affect preparation for dormancy using a combination of field and experimental observations. The Northern Gulf of Alaska - with four calanid species that experience dormancy, steep environmental gradients, well-described phytoplankton bloom dynamics, and a concurrent NSF-LTER program - provides an unusual opportunity to identify the factors that affect dormancy preparation. Education and outreach plans are integrated with the research. Educational efforts focus on interdisciplinary opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral trainees. The project will generate content for existing graduate and undergraduate courses. U. of Alaska Fairbanks and U. Hawaii at Manoa are Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, and students from these groups will be recruited to participate in the project.  Because fishing is a major industry in the Gulf of Alaska, outreach will communicate the role copepods play in marine ecosystems using the concept of a dynamic food web tied to production cycles.<br/><br/><br/>Diapause (dormancy) and the accompanying accumulation of lipids in copepods have been identified as key drivers in high latitude ecosystems that support economically important fisheries, including those of the Gulf of Alaska.  While the disappearance of lipid-rich copepods has been linked to severe declines in fish stocks, little is known about the environmental conditions that are required for the successful completion of the copepod's life cycle.  A physiological profiling approach that measures relative gene expression will be used to test two alternative hypotheses: the lipid accumulation window hypothesis, which holds that individuals enter diapause only after they have accumulated sufficient lipid stores, and the developmental program hypothesis, which holds that once the diapause program is activated, progression occurs independent of lipid accumulation.  The specific objectives are:  1) determine the effect of food levels during N. flemingeri copepodite stages on progression towards diapause using multiple physiological and developmental markers; 2) characterize the seasonal changes in the physiological profile of N. flemingeri across environmental gradients and across years; 3) compare physiological profiles across co-occurring calanid species (N. flemingeri, Neocalanus plumchrus, Neocalanus cristatus and Calanus marshallae); and 4) estimate the reproductive potential of the overwintering populations of N. flemingeri.  The broader scientific significance includes the acquisition of new genomic data and molecular resources that will be made publicly available through established data repositories, and the development of new tools for routinely obtaining physiological profiles of copepods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For artworks on paper, watermarks are a key element in dating and authentication. Classifying and distinguishing watermarks is a difficult, time-consuming task even for paper analysis experts. Recent research has shown that a computer-based decision tree can reduce dramatically the time expended in the task of watermark identification and the concomitant identification of sheets of paper made on the same mold, while at the same time increasing the confidence in the result. The application of digital image processing to this task is one example of the new field of computational art history, which has exploded over the past decade. Through this project, automation using digital image processing can scale up the task of watermark and moldmate identification to handle the universe of the hundreds of individual watermarks in the papers of prints and drawings of Rembrandt and his pupils and allow expansion of this identification beyond these artworks in major museums to the thousands in smaller museums and private collections. This is expected to energize the expansion of this valuable forensic to the thousands of watermarks in laid paper used in artworks on paper by other pre-1750 artists. Advances in computational art history stemming from this project will offer a path for the general population, which is growing quite comfortable with the expansion of computer usage in everyday life, to engage with art in a new and appealing way. Art history is one subfield within cultural heritage that has delayed the longest in joining the emergence of the digital science and humanities. The success of this project will be a major enabler for further trans-disciplinary activities between the humanities and the sciences, thereby decreasing the separation of their two cultures, which is vital as the digitization of all aspects of daily life gains dominance at a scorching pace.<br/><br/>This project continues the pioneering efforts in the new field of computational art history that is broadening acceptance of digital image processing as a vital tool in art history research as it tremendously expands the intellectual reach of art historians. As the first tools are developed in this nascent field and more scientists and engineers are drawn to the challenges of these problems, the specific needs of art historians will undoubtedly reveal new tasks requiring advances in the underlying science of digital image processing. This connection between computation and the visual humanities also offers a powerful link to combat the widening gulf in education at all levels between engineering science and the humanities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such advances will enable a better understanding of human interactions with nature and improve our ability to forecast how environmental change will affect services provided by natural and agricultural ecosystems in the future. To reach these goals, this project will synthesize three decades of the principle investigator's and his close colleagues' research into a predictive theory of the way ecosystems with many species are organized and how they change over time. The core of this theory is based on organisms' abilities to consume resources, grow, and be consumed by other organisms as well as the network architecture of these consumer-resource interactions among tens, hundreds and thousands of species. Elements of this general theory have been published in over one hundred papers, most of which are sole or co-authored by this project's principle investigator. How the ideas in all these papers fit together, including the theory, its foundations, and future directions have yet to be adequately synthesized and articulated. This project will describe that synthetic framework in the form of a book, a review article, visualizations and video animations that define the concepts, equations and computer simulations underlying the theory. This research will also increase the accessibility of ecological network theory to broader audiences, and advance the careers of researchers who are members of groups underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>This project will synthesize theory focused on the structure, dynamics, and evolution of food webs and their bipartite subsets including mutualistic and host-parasite/pathogen networks based on integrating consumer-resource theory with network theory and the metabolic theory of ecology. This involves describing the conceptual and computational theory of allometric trophic networks and its application to ecological, evolutionary and sustainability sciences including predictions of the quantitative consequences of species loss, fishing, and climate change. Further development aims to advance a systems biology of ecology that synthesizes ecology by integrating its subdisciplines, especially organismal, population, community and ecosystem ecology, as well as the interface between ecology and evolutionary, social, sustainability, and network sciences. Benefits to society include increasing our understanding of ecosystem management and eco-evolutionary and coupled natural-human dynamics.

Studies using historical records suggest a similar 'cost of reproduction' in human females, but are often confounded by unmeasured social and environmental factors that obscure causal relationships between reproduction and lifespan. This doctoral dissertation project will use a new measure of 'epigenetic age' to better understand these life history trade-offs in humans. By examining both reproduction and epigenetic age at several time points in a woman's life, social and environmental effects on aging can be accounted for, yielding a clearer picture of the costs of reproduction. Uncovering the molecular pathways responsible for costs of reproduction in women could inform new strategies for diagnosing and treating age-related diseases. This project will also support graduate student training and long-term research collaborations.<br/><br/>The investigators will analyze data for 195 women who are part of the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey to test whether those who have had more pregnancies show signs of more rapid biological aging during a 13-year period. The number of children, their sex, size, and birth spacing - as well as energy allocated to breastfeeding - will be calculated over the women's peak reproductive lives, and compared to the pace change in each woman's epigenetic age. Epigenetic age is calculated by counting chemical modifications made to DNA, and is a strong predictor of negative health outcomes and mortality across multiple populations. The researchers will also examine the relationship between reproduction and epigenetic age among 155 older women, for whom they will combine these data with a separate, comprehensive survey of age-related decline. This will be the first study to examine the effect of reproduction on epigenetic age in females, and will provide an important foundation for future studies aimed at clarifying the links between reproduction and late life outcomes in humans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is however challenging to maintain the optimal condition given various uncertainties involved in these systems. Advances in computing and sensing technologies can potentially enable a paradigm shift in the management of infrastructure systems by realistically capturing the uncertainties involved. The main challenge is still the high computational cost that would entail, mainly due to large size of infrastructure networks. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award aims to enable the next generation of fast uncertainty quantification (UQ) methodologies that can significantly reduce simulation time and are particularly tailored for large infrastructure networks. This award will analyze the case of interdependent transportation-energy systems that involves the integration of electric vehicles. The project will also establish an integrated education and outreach plan to prepare the next generation of civil engineers with improved programming and computational skills. This is done through development of a new graduate-level course, mentoring of undergraduate researchers, partnership with educational physiologists to enhance educational plans, and also outreach to the broader civil engineering student population, K-12 students, and decision makers. The new methods will promote progress of science in UQ and infrastructure modeling, and together with the educational and outreach activities can collectively lead to improved infrastructure operations and promote the economic competitiveness of our society. <br/><br/>This project will use stochastic simulations to realistically capture the complexities. The approaches will build upon and enrich current UQ machinery. These advanced UQ methods will aim to (1) intelligently identify the redundancies in the flow models of infrastructure systems, (2) use topology characteristics of these networks towards model reduction, (3) build an effective online training framework that use streaming sensor data, and (4) take advantage of the availability of flow models at various fidelity levels to produce multifidelity predictions. Specifically, the approaches include advanced compressive sampling methods in polynomial chaos expansion for effective removal of uncertainties related to network redundancies; a topology-based dimension reduction algorithm integrated with compressive sampling approach to exploit the topology information of infrastructure networks; a block-wise recursive least square approach to enable an effective online learning for polynomial surrogates with quantified modeling errors; and a multifidelity regression framework for building surrogates using results of simulations at various fidelity levels. If successful, these advances will collectively contribute to the transformation of infrastructure engineering where simulation-based data-intensive design suites that can assist decision makers will be increasingly used.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is achieved by chemically reacting accessible sites on a protein with specific chemical labels and subsequently using MS to discover which sites on the protein were labeled.  Prof. Lindert's ""MS-Fold"" software then infers the protein structure from this labeling information.  Given the importance of proteins in regulating the chemistry of life, better tools for probing protein structure supports better understanding of that chemistry in both healthy and diseased organisms.  To help convey these principles to a general audience, the Lindert group is also developing an MS-Fold version of the popular scientific video game Foldit.  This work aims to increase public scientific literacy, and to expand interest and engagement in STEM science and technology-related disciplines. The ultimate goal is to increase STEM participation, particularly of underrepresented groups, and to improve STEM education at the undergraduate and graduate level. <br/><br/>Sophisticated mass spectrometry (MS) techniques in conjunction with covalently-labeled protein residues can yield important information about protein structure. However, easy and reliable translation of this information into accurate structural models remains particularly challenging. The overall goal of research in the Lindert lab is to develop advanced computational tools that can convert MS-generated covalent labeling data into protein structural models in an automated fashion. Specifically, the research objective is to develop and validate a software tool, termed ""MS-Fold"", that will allow data generated from covalent labeling MS studies (e.g. solvent-exposed protein residues) to be effectively used to guide protein structure prediction algorithms. MS-Fold is intended to provide the analytical biochemistry community with a user-friendly computational tool with which covalent labeling MS data can be integrated into high-resolution analysis of protein structure and macromolecular interactions. This in turn will dramatically improve interpretability of MS data, constituting a significant advance in the field of structural MS and providing new opportunities for investigators to extract useful information from results of advanced MS experiments. The educational objectives entail novel approaches to interdisciplinary training for complex, joint computational-experimental chemical methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this multidisciplinary project, the investigators want to understand what triggered the recent extinction of all of Madagascar's large native vertebrates, including its chimpanzee- and gorilla-sized lemurs, enormous 'elephant birds,' and horned crocodiles. The discovery of extraordinary deposits of fossils and stalagmites in previously-unexplored flooded and dry caves at Tsimanampesotse National Park (TNP) in southwestern Madagascar has opened new opportunities for researchers to address this question. An international team of anthropologists, geologists and ecologists will work with cave divers to retrieve and study fossils and stalagmites from the flooded caves and nearby dry deposits. By taking small samples of rock from stalagmites and studying their chemistry, the team will be able to reconstruct with great precision changes in habitat and rainfall over the past 50,000 years. Team members will also document changes in the presence or absence of small animals that may be excellent indicators of habitat transformation. Through this work, they will identify specific turning points in the catastrophic decline and extinction of Madagascar's large vertebrates, which will have broad implications for how to avoid future extinctions on the island and elsewhere. The team will support public science outreach with creation of 3D maps of the flooded caves and fossil deposits, and multi-language, multi-media educational displays. The displays will focus on conservation, and how understanding the past can inform the future. Finally, this project will support the doctoral dissertations of three graduate students, and build future opportunities for international collaborative research.    <br/><br/>The investigators will utilize state-of-the-art techniques from anthropology, ecology, cave science and paleoclimatology to tease apart how environmental changes and human activities affect communities of plants and animals. This work is challenging, especially since natural aridification (through reduced rainfall) and human disturbance (through setting fires, cutting trees, raising cattle or other introduced domesticated animals, and planting crops) can have similar devastating effects on the distribution and abundance of wild plants and animals. However, stalagmites preserve precisely-datable records of changes in local rainfall and vegetation. Consequently, it is possible to know when rainfall and vegetation co-varied, and when vegetation changed independent of rainfall, implying that some other agent, such as humans, was responsible. Bones and teeth of animals can preserve datable evidence of the diets, activities, movements and habitats of species that have survived, and those that have not. Sometimes traces on the surfaces of fossils themselves preserve evidence of how individuals died - for example, by succumbing to a predatory bird, carnivore or human. This project will tease apart the relative importance of environmental change and human activities, and build a chronology of the survival and extinction of species. Advances in the science of the chemistry of rocks, bones, and teeth, coupled with the old-fashioned tools of paleontological analysis (identifying fossils and recording their associations) have made all of this possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has recently become clear, however, that many marine species are subdivided into multiple populations that have evolved to thrive best under contrasting local environmental conditions. Nevertheless, we still know very little about the genomic mechanisms that enable divergent adaptations in the face of ongoing intermixing. This project focuses on the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), a small estuarine fish that exhibits a remarkable degree of local adaptation in growth rates and a suite of other traits tightly associated with a climatic gradient across latitudes. Decades of prior lab and field studies have made Atlantic silverside one of the marine species for which we have the best understanding of evolutionary tradeoffs among traits and drivers of selection causing adaptive divergence. Yet, the underlying genomic basis is so far completely unknown. The investigators will integrate whole genome sequencing data from wild fish sampled across the distribution range with breeding experiments in the laboratory to decipher these genomic underpinnings. This will provide one of the most comprehensive assessments of the genomic basis for local adaptation in the oceans to date, thereby generating insights that are urgently needed for better predictions about how species can respond to rapid environmental change. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for a postdoc as well as two graduate and several undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities. The findings will also be leveraged to develop engaging teaching and outreach materials (e.g. a video documentary and popular science articles) to promote a better understanding of ecology, evolution, and local adaptation among science students and the general public. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to characterize the genomic basis and architecture underlying local adaptation in M. menidia and examine how the adaptive divergence is shaped by varying levels of gene flow and maintained over ecological time scales. The project is organized into four interconnected components. Part 1 examines fine-scale spatial patterns of genomic differentiation along the adaptive cline to a) characterize the connectivity landscape, b) identify genomic regions under divergent selection, and c) deduce potential drivers and targets of selection by examining how allele frequencies vary in relation to environmental factors and biogeographic features. Part 2 maps key locally adapted traits to the genome to dissect their underlying genomic basis. Part 3 integrates patterns of variation in the wild (part 1) and the mapping of traits under controlled conditions (part 2) to a) examine how genomic architectures underlying local adaptation vary across gene flow regimes and b) elucidating the potential role of chromosomal rearrangements and other tight linkage among adaptive alleles in facilitating adaptation. Finally, part 4 examines dispersal - selection dynamics over seasonal time scales to a) infer how selection against migrants and their offspring maintains local adaptation despite homogenizing connectivity and b) validate candidate loci for local adaptation. Varying levels of gene flow across the species range create a natural experiment for testing general predictions about the genomic mechanisms that enable adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow. The findings will therefore have broad implications and will significantly advance our understanding of the role genomic architecture plays in modifying the gene flow - selection balance within coastal environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This fundamental research has the potential to inform developing treatments for neurobehavioral disorders in humans, particularly given that the non-human primate model is likely to be more relevant than murine models for understanding social behavior. Funding for this project will support the research of a minority female graduate student who will also serve as an educator and mentor.

These mechanisms differ across species, and have resulted in sex differences in non-neurological traits (e.g. body size, hair color). Limited evidence suggests that sexual selection may also influence brain evolution and that these selective pressures may have been particularly strong on the brain during human evolution. The researchers will collect new neurobiological data in female and male primate brains to characterize species-specific sex differences in brain region volumes, sulcal morphology, and gene expression using phylogenetic comparative methods and differential expression analyses.

Recent research indicates that these large-scale events have altered the hydrological and ecosystem balances over historical and geological timescales (decades to thousands of years). This project will assess how far north along the coast of southwestern North America these storms have occurred in the geologic past, and how far inland they controlled geomorphic change events through rain and erosion. The specific goal is to determine if previously documented periods when tropical cyclones dominated runoff and sediment deposition across large alluvial fan systems of the southern Baja California peninsula can be detected in central Baja California, the southern California deserts, and even as far north as the southern Arizona Sonoran Desert. Data will test whether dissipating cyclones were drivers of alluvial fan sedimentation over thousands of years, and if a temporal correlation can be established to a period of transition between a milder, humid paleoclimate to the current arid climate. For the first time, a tropical cyclone landfall chronology covering the last few millennia will be developed for the Pacific coast of southwestern North America. This research has the potential to inform large-storm prediction scenarios for southern California and northwestern Mexico, which is relevant to hazards management for communities in need of risk assessment of rare and extreme events. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of earth scientists using a tiered approach, with field-based collaboration of postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. This approach has been proven successful for inclusion of underrepresented minorities, enhanced also with planned research alongside Mexican collaborators and students. The project will provide unique broader educational experiences for grade-school students in Indiana and Arizona, through the use of technology to connect fieldwork and classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will compare a recently established alluvial fan chronology in southern Baja California, with newly-obtained alluvial fan and paleotempestological records.

The inferred tropical storm activity will be compared with inland alluvial fan deposition in this area and in the northern Sonoran Desert, enabling discrimination of signals from different moisture sources, based on observed coastal and alluvial sedimentology, stratigraphy, and specific proxy records. Effects of different sources of moisture that drive sedimentation will be assessed by probing different time periods, and compared to independent paleoclimatic proxies. Bayesian analysis of luminescence, cosmogenic, and radiocarbon geochronology will improve age control precision. The coupled alluvial and coastal record at orbital timescales will help to understand linkages between Quaternary alluvial sedimentation and hydroclimatic variability in the region, and will increase our understanding of basic principles of alluvial fan aggradation in response to change in arid hydroclimates.

Diatoms float in the surface ocean as part of a group of organisms collectively called phytoplankton. There are thousands of different species of diatoms distributed across the global ocean.  A famous oceanographer Henry Bigelow once said ""All fish is diatoms"" reflecting the importance of diatoms as the base of the food chain that supports the world's largest fisheries. Despite their small size, diatom photosynthesis produces 20% of the oxygen on earth each year. That's more than all of the tropical rainforests on land. The major objective of the research is to understand how the metabolic differences among diatom species affects the amount of diatom organic carbon that is carried, or exported, from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. As diatoms are photosynthesizers like green plants, their biological carbon comes from converting carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater from the atmosphere into organic forms.  Diatoms also require a series of other nurtrients supplied by the ocean such as nitrogen and phosphorous and, uniquely for diatoms, the silicon used to construct their glass shells.  This research will investigate how genetic and physiological differences among diatoms influence how each species react to changes in nutrient levels in the ocean and how those shifts affect the export of diatom carbon to the deep sea. The link between diatoms' physiological response and their carbon export comes about because shifts in physiology affect diatom attributes like how fast they sink and how tasty they are to predators. So if we can relate the physiological condition of different diatoms to the food-web pathways followed by different species, we can ultimately use knowledge of diatom physiological status and food web structure to predict how much diatom carbon gets to the deep sea. The research involves investigators with expertise in the physiology and genomics of diatoms and in the ocean's chemistry. The work will initially take place in the subarctic North Pacific in conjunction with the NASA Export Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field program. The EXPORTS program is using a wide variety of methods to quantify the export and fate of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the upper ocean. The research supports the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research will also serve as the basis for activities aimed at K-12 and junior high school students. <br/><br/>The research will broadly impact our understanding of the biology of the biological pump (the transport of photosynthetically fixed organic carbon to the deep sea) by forming a mechanistic basis for predicting the export of diatom carbon. It is hypothesized that the type and degree of diatom physiological stress are vital aspects of ecosystem state that drive export. To test this hypothesis, the genetic composition, rates of nutrient use and growth response of diatom communities will be evaluated and supported with measurements of silicon and iron stress to evaluate stress as a predictor of the path of diatom carbon export. The subarctic N. Pacific ecosystem is characterized as high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) due to low iron (Fe) levels that are primary controllers constraining phytoplankton utilization of other nutrients. It has been a paradigm in low Fe, HNLC systems that diatoms grow at elevated Si:C and Si:N ratios and should be efficiently exported as particles significantly enriched in Si relative to C. However, Fe limitation also alters diatoms species composition and the high Si demand imposed by low Fe can drive HNLC regions to Si limitation or Si/Fe co-limitation. Thus, the degree of Si and/or Fe stress in HNLC waters can all alter diatom taxonomic composition, the elemental composition of diatom cells, and the path cells follow through the food web ultimately altering diatom carbon export.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Worked bone tools are considered among the important features characterizing modern human behavior. In Europe complex bone technologies are characteristics of the Upper Paleolithic which began about 40,000 years ago. Bone tools were made with techniques specifically adapted to bone materials such as scraping, grinding and polishing and a wide range of shapes and functions (split-base points, bone handles, spear-throwers, points, harpoons).  The bone technology of earlier ""pre-modern"" humans is said to be simpler and involving a lower degree of conceptualization than Upper Paleolithic tools. Limb bones used as hammers and scrapers for the manufacture of stone tools are known from European sites as old as 500, 000 years ago. Just a few pieces show evidence of shaping by flaking and fully shaped tools are even rarer. The goal of this research is to understand in greater detail the processes by which they were made. This research will not only further basic knowledge regarding the human past but also further international scientific collaboration. The research involves close collaboration by members of an international team.<br/><br/>Multiple tools made by flaking elephant long bones of symmetrical shape have been described in four sites in Latium (Italy) dated between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago. The manufacturing technique used was the same technique used in knapping stone artifacts. This transfer of techniques from stones to bone is taken as an indication that pre-modern humans were incapable of creative thinking. An important aspect of early bone technology is about the criteria used to correctly identify tools since various natural processes can produce mimics of man-made tools. This project will carry out a technological and taphonomic analysis of all the bone and stone tools from the assemblage of Castel di Guido dated to about 400,000 years ago. Many pieces classed as tools present only a limited amount of modification that is not distinctive enough to remove doubts about their intentionality. Analysis will be directed to the elimination of ambiguities in the identification of flaked bone artifacts by using features characteristic of stone artifacts. The fact that recent advances in dating suggest that the four sites in Latium are closer in time than expected invite a question: do these occurrences of flaked bone artifacts so common in the Latium region represent a genuine regional tradition, reflecting a set of socially transmitted habits between groups in the same region? This would run counter to the conventional idea that pre-modern culture was static and homogeneous over its large geographic extent and long periods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the research supported by this award, the researchers will address these important questions. They will do so through an ethnographic investigation of how a new drug for treatment of lung cancer has been developed away from the usual, high-cost centers of techno-scientific innovation. The research will train an American graduate student in scientific methods of data collection. Its findings will help to expand the options for pharmaceutical innovation, which remains essential for protecting and promoting a healthy population.  <br/><br/>The research will be carried out by Naomi Schoenfeld, a University of California, San Francisco, medical anthropology doctoral student, who is supervised by Dr. Ian Whitmarsh. Schoenfeld will focus on two sites for the research. The first is a research laboratory in Cuba, which has developed a unique system of lower-cost pharmaceutical innovation using a model different from that of major research and development centers, such as those in the United States. The second is a major American cancer center where a cancer vaccine developed by the Cuban laboratory is being tested in clinical trials. The researcher will collect data at both sites in research institutes, clinics, administrative offices, homes, and conference events. She will use a range of anthropological research methods including participant observation; interviews; textual analysis of scientific journals, regulatory and legal documents, and internet, print, and television media. Analysis of these data will address two overarching research questions: (1) How do local conditions of scientific innovation influence entry into global circulation? (2) What relations of scientific authority are generated by the counter-current movement of a new drug from marginalized spaces toward sites authorized as centers of research and development? Results of this study will generate new insights into how to develop and support the most cost-effective conditions for scientific innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the current understanding of the drivers of such changes is limited, making an investigation of overturning in the Sub-polar region a key ocean research priority. This field program explicitly addresses this gap. Furthermore, by engaging the larger international community studying the North Atlantic, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) is playing a key role in catalyzing scientific progress by promoting international collaborations, synthesis, and the sharing of resources and by training future generations. Key to the latter is a network of early career scientists whose professional growth will continue to be facilitated through targeted activities that have been tested and improved during OSNAP's initial phase. Graduate students and post-docs will be trained in seagoing operations and in the processing and analysis of observational data.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this field project, in conjunction with other measurements in the North Atlantic, is to establish determination of the linkage between intermediate and deep water formation and the overturning circulation--a connection that is present in climate models, but has yet to be observed. This project will also provide the first comprehensive view of spreading pathways for the deep waters in the Sub-polar basin. Starting in 2014, the US-led international project, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP), provides a continuous record of the full-water column, trans-basin fluxes of heat, mass and freshwater in the Sub-polar North Atlantic, in partnership with the UK, Netherlands, Canada, Germany and China. Data from the first 21 months of the full OSNAP observing system has been used to produce an initial time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes for the Sub-polar basin. These preliminary results reveal a highly variable overturning in the basin, interior pathways for overflow waters, surprisingly energetic boundary current systems on timescales from days to months, and a strong overflow plume in the Iceland Basin. The additional two years of OSNAP observations will cover a time frame sufficient to make comparisons with other overturning time series and optimize the OSNAP measurement system--all necessary tasks prior to a request for longer term measurements. This component of OSNAP (OSNAP East) is for the eastern array between Greenland and Scotland in coordination with the UK and the Netherlands. The US contribution includes the East Greenland inshore and offshore arrays, the Iceland Basin array, and the integration of all OSNAP measurements. The sub-goal for OSNAP East is to quantify the structure and transport of the boundary currents off the east coast of Greenland and within the Iceland Basin, as well as determine their variability and forcing mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project will study changes in DNA methylation (a chemical mark on DNA that influences gene expression levels) in different baboon species, to better understand how changes in DNA methylation affect gene expression, how DNA methylation has diverged between species, and the role of natural selection in this process. Differences in how particular genes are expressed are thought to be important in explaining many differences among primate species, including some traits that are unique to the human lineage. Novel data on gene regulation and expression can therefore help to advance knowledge about the development of our own species. The project will support student training and mentoring at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels, and the development and dissemination of interdisciplinary approaches using genomic methods that can be applied to a number of other fields of study.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of genetic ancestry on DNA methylation by leveraging genetic admixture in 150 adult baboons from a wild baboon population in Kenya. Admixed individuals (baboons with ancestry from two distinct but closely related taxa) provide the opportunity to test how genetic variation from different ancestries influences DNA methylation when placed in a common environment. Furthermore, because the study population has been affected by both recent and historical admixture events, it can be used to test hypotheses about the legacy of archaic hominin admixture with modern humans. Finally, this project will ask whether between-species differences in DNA methylation translate to changes in gene expression, testing an important assumption of models that link DNA methylation to trait variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People do not acquire all knowledge about a topic in a single experience. Instead, it is built up over experiences or lessons that are separated in time. The lessons also may come from different sources, such as books, lectures, videos, museum exhibits. A major challenge is to explain how individual, separate episodes of learning are integrated with one another, such that the knowledge base accumulates over time. This knowledge base extends beyond what we have learned explicitly, to include self-derived information, through logical processes such as induction and deduction. Prior research has found age-related increases in the ability to extend beyond explicit information to self-derive new knowledge through integration of separate episodes of learning. It also has found individual variability in the process, that relates to academic achievement. This new research will highlight the sources of these differences. These discoveries will inform interventions to promote these processes, thereby improving the depth and breadth of learning. In addition to its translational potential, the project also will benefit society by increasing the scientific literacy of undergraduate and graduate students, and by engaging children from diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>This project concerns the specific productive process of self-derivation of new factual knowledge through integration of separate yet related episodes of new learning. This occurs when learners integrate information newly acquired in one lesson (e.g., liquids expand with heat) with information newly acquired in another (thermometers contain liquid), and productively derive new factual knowledge (thermometers work because liquid expands as heat increases). There are age-related increases in self-derivation through integration across the school years. The major objective of the project is to test the source of the improvements. The research is situated in a broader literature on memory integration. It is distinguished by its focus on development, on process, and on producing factual knowledge. The guiding hypothesis is that age-related improvements are explained by developmental variability in the efficiency and efficacy of five component processes: encoding, reactivation, integration, selection, and self-derivation. The behavior of preschool to elementary-age children is consistent with a developmental progression in successful engagement of these processes. The project will directly test the suggested progression in 4- to 9-year-olds. Behavioral measures will be complemented by eye tracking. Tracking visual attention provides a window on cognitive effort, indicating engagement of component processes, and their relation to self-derivation of new knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This question is particularly important for tropical forests because they are home to most of the world's species and are essential for global carbon and nutrient cycles; they help control the atmosphere of the entire planet. In a sense, tropical plants are the ""lungs"" of the planet. Scientists are starting to think that drought is critically important in determining how well tropical forests ""breathe"".  However, the evidence for this is still unclear.  In this project, researchers will test how different tropical plant species respond to an ongoing, multi-year drought in Panama. Undergraduate and graduate students from the U.S. will participate in the project and receive training in how to conduct scientific research. <br/><br/>In the context of a large-scale, long-term competition experiment, the PI will examine the role of a multi-year drought to test two predictions: 1) The strength of plant-plant competition increases with drought and varies with species identity. 2) Plant species that capitalize on drought will share a suite of plant hydraulic functional traits. By testing these predictions, the PI can provide a functional-mechanistic explanation for how different species respond to drought, and determine whether plant-plant competition intensifies the effects of drought. By examining the responses of more than 100 plant species and by relating those responses to a suite of functional characteristics for each species, this project will identify the subset of species that will likely increase or decrease with future droughts, as well as the dual effects of drought and competition on tree species performance. Considering the importance of both drought and competition to tropical forest diversity and function, results will be fundamental to our understanding of tropical forest ecology and, more generally, ecosystem health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

UAVs will significantly impact our daily life by enabling new applications, and simplifying existing applications including transportation, traffic control, remote health monitoring, surveillance, border patrolling, habitat monitoring, and precision agriculture. An important drawback to commercialize UAV-based solutions in these domains is networking inefficiency. Current communication protocols are extremely inefficient in accommodating dynamic topologies of networks of UAVs. This project seeks to address this issue and develop predictive communication strategies by anticipating network topology changes. The research will thus develop cognizant communication protocols for fully autonomous UAV networks by facilitating high-throughput information exchange and eliminating the need for multiple ground control stations.  <br/><br/>This project aims to develop novel tools for predictive communication for networks of flying objects with heterogeneous maneuverability levels. The key idea is to take preventive actions via communication protocols before anticipated network partitions and/or failures. The proposed methodology relies on developing a universal model to predict motion trajectories of surrounding network nodes. To enable motion profiling, driving force of each object is modeled as a hierarchical generative model with a hidden layer shared among objects of the same type. The use of a novel merge-and-split method provides flexibility in accommodating new object classes with unseen maneuverability levels and repealing intruding objects. Novel methods based on cyclic monoids in category theory will be used to design optimal measurement patterns for network topology prediction. Finally, a predictive routing algorithm will be developed by incorporating the predicted network topology into decision making when looking for the optimal path. A concrete characterization of the tradeoff between the routing optimality and prediction uncertainties will be developed based on random matrix concentration inequalities to pave the road for practical implementation. Graph snappers and hybrid routing techniques will be studied to integrate conventional and predictive routing algorithms to accelerate the routing algorithm execution for large-scale networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As photosynthetic organisms, phytoplankton directly take up dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to synthesize their tissues using energy from the sun.  In addition to carbon (C), essential nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) are required by these primary producers.  While dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) is the preferred form of P because it is a small enough molecule that phytoplankton can directly absorb it, in the sunlit surface waters of the ocean the concentration of DIP can be drawn down to limiting levels.  In this situation, the larger dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) molecules can become available through enzyme hydrolysis reactions, which convert DOP to DIP.  There was mounting evidence that DOP can play a crucial role in supporting primary production in the ocean, yet very little is known about the nature of the DOP pool.  There are many analytical impediments to gaining information about the chemical structure and composition of DOP, and without knowledge of its composition there is no basis for evaluating the potential bioavailability of DOP to primary producers. The proposed work will employ a unique combination of methods to gain novel insight into the composition and bioavailability of DOP.  Field and laboratory (culture) nutrient addition incubation experiments will target the drivers of DOP variability, information crucial to resolving models of primary production in the ocean. Results of this work will be transformative for understanding DOP composition, DOP variability in space and time, and microbial control on the nature of the marine DOP pool.  <br/><br/>This proposal will support a postdoctoral scholar, two undergraduate students and two undergraduate students. Recruitment of undergraduate students will focus on entraining Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, through SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science)and related venues. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international meetings.  We also propose to conduct outreach to middle schools, including bringing The Artistic Oceanographer Program, an interactive inquiry-based program targeting middle school age science and art standards by integrating concepts in ocean science literacy with art, to local middle schools in New York and Hawaii.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed work will provide foundational information on the way DOP molecular characteristics translate into P-bioavailability to marine microorganisms, and in turn how microorganisms growing under different dissolved inorganic nitrogen: dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIN:DIP) impact the composition and bioavailability of DOP.  A newly developed sequential ultrafiltration (SUF) method will be applied to samples collected along a natural P-gradient in the western North Atlantic. The SUF method quantitatively segregates and concentrates DOP into 4 molecular weight size classes, which can be subjected to bioavailability assays using phosphohydrolytic enzymes, and to liquid chromotography-mass spectrometry to provide detailed compositional information.  Using these combined methods we will probe in situ DOP, the evolution of in situ DOP during shipboard incubations under different DIN:DIP, and the composition and bioavailability of DOP produced by organisms isolated from key stations along the natural phosphate gradient.  Contrast of in situ patterns to those developed in controlled culture experiments using field isolates will be achieved by identifying cellular shifts in organic phosphorus biosynthesis pathways, and tracing how such shifts impact DOP composition.  The combined methodological approach will provide unparalleled insight into DOP composition and bioavailability, addressing this major knowledge gap.  Results of this work will be transformative for understanding DOP composition, DOP variability in space and time, and microbial control on the nature of the marine DOP pool.  Such information is a prerequisite to building ecosystem models that capture the influence of P biogeochemistry on primary production and carbon cycling in aquatic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It was started more than 20 years ago to provide a forum for the brain-mapping scientific community to disseminate findings and enable interactions among scientists investigating the functional organization of the brain with emerging imaging methods. Since 1994, the OHBM has sponsored twenty-three highly successful meetings, where attendees are exposed to cutting-edge neuroimaging data acquisition methods, emerging approaches to large-scale neuroimaging data analysis, the visualization of results, and their applications in health and disease. This award will fund travel awards for deserving students and trainees to attend the 2018 Annual Meeting to be held in Singapore. Travel awards will be given to 30 students with high-ranking abstracts. Of these at least 15 travel awards will be awarded to the students with the top-ranked abstracts among 3 targeted groups (women, minorities, disabled). <br/><br/>The Annual Meeting provides a means for students of neuroimaging to attend educational courses, hear lectures from leading brain researchers, form new collaborations, and to present their original research. OHBM On Demand provides public access to educational resources year-round by publishing online past OHBM courses and talks. These openly available videos and slides include keynote lectures and educational courses on topics covering state-of-the-art methodologies and clinical applications of neuroimaging. Historically, female representation in the mathematical and computational sciences has been low. In contrast, in both neuroscience and psychology it has been relatively high. Hence, the conference's position in the cross-section of statistics, computer-science, psychology, and neuroscience promises to provide computational training to a diverse audience and help bridge the gender gaps in the STEM fields. In addition, improved understanding of the organization of the human brain is directly relevant to treating neurological and psychiatric disease, and the use of non-invasive imaging methods is increasingly important to translational investigation and training in clinical neuroscience. As neuroimaging is used in a wide-range of scientific disciplines, we would expect benefits for society in areas ranging from economic and social policies to medical, educational and psychological interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, BCI technology is a powerful control option for neuro-prosthetic limbs, as well as a potential communication option for people with severe motor disabilities or disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injury, who may have little or even no muscle control and therefore no means of communication with the external world.  The International Brain-Computer Interface (IBCI) meeting is the flagship conference for the field, the seventh of which will be held May 21-25, 2018, on the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove,, California.  Effective BCI research requires interdisciplinary interactions involving neuroscience, psychology, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and clinical rehabilitation, and the IBCI meeting serves as a critical catalyst for technology dissemination, new collaborations, and educational opportunities for students.  The primary source of funding for the meeting is the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This NSF funding will enable another 22 students, including undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend and participate in the conference.  The organizers are planning innovations to make the 2018 event the most valuable yet.  For the first time the conference will include a series of 12 one-hour masterclasses, six of which will meet in parallel on Wednesday evening, and the other six will meet in parallel on Thursday afternoon.  Each masterclass will have a senior researcher as the ""master"" along with two students each of whom will present his/her research for 10-15 minutes, after which the master will provide wise and constructive comments, with audience participation encouraged in an informal session intended to give students access to senior expertise and to get good tips for their research.  Another new event at this year's meeting with be the ""BCI Hackathon"" organized and sponsored by G.Tec Medical Engineering GmbH, during which participants will work in teams on a number of BCI applications and will then present their work to the hackathon community.  NSF funding will be used to support student travel, registration, and student-only event costs.  Student participation in previous IBCI meetings has been very fruitful; a large number of those students have now graduated and are prominent researchers in the BCI field.  The organizers are actively recruiting student attendees from traditionally underrepresented groups.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://bcisociety.org/meetings/bci-2018-welcome/.  <br/><br/>Because of the growth in the field of BCI research, 300 or more participants are expected to attend this meeting, including investigators from at least 100 BCI research groups. All attendees commit to the entire meeting, from the opening reception and dinner on the evening of Monday, May 21 through the final summary discussion at breakfast the morning of Friday, May 25.  A main objective of the conference is to give students a significant educational and professional experience in the BCI field, and to provide opportunities for them to gain depth in their specific interest areas. The conference will begin with a specialized student colloquium on the afternoon before the full conference starts, which will provide lectures from prominent experts in the BCI field. This will give the students a solid foundation for understanding the rest of the conference.  There will also be a student poster session and prizes for the best student research projects, as well as giving students access to research leaders for informal question-and-answer sessions at the end of each day. The students will participate fully in the main conference as well.  Exposure to prominent researchers in the BCI field will allow students to receive invaluable feedback on their work, and to make connections that may result in new research directions; it will also provide students with access to potential mentors, committee members, and experts to review their future work.  A full and detailed schedule of planned conference sessions and events, along with any updates, can be found on the conference website.

It is generally accepted that the triggers to both these large earthquakes and the melting of the subducted crust and overlying mantle somehow involve the release of fluids from the subducted sediments and crust via devolatilization reactions that cause the breakdown of minerals that contain water in their structure. However, the identity of the specific minerals and reactions responsible for the release of fluids has been elusive because none of the minerals that are believed to be common in subduction channels have the appropriate stabilities with respect to pressure and temperature based on thermodynamic calculations. This study will support the Ph.D. dissertation research of a graduate student from an underrepresented group in geosciences, and will involve two undergraduate students from Amherst College that is collaborating on some of the analytical activities.<br/>	<br/>This project is to test the alternative hypothesis that garnet-bearing reactions that produce fluids during the subduction process are significantly overstepped with respect to their nominal equilibrium location at a specific pressure and temperature. That is, the common minerals found in subduction zones may persist to significantly greater depths (the depths recorded by earthquakes) because the nucleation of the new phases necessary to initiate the reaction is suppressed. This hypothesis will be tested through application of a novel approach that utilizes Raman spectroscopy on inclusions of quartz inside of the mineral garnet to determine the pressure-temperature conditions at which the garnet nucleated and, thus, the conditions at which major devolatilization occurs. The results of this study should help resolve a long-standing paradox and will provide a much clearer understanding of the processes responsible for triggering earthquakes and mantle melting thus aiding in the ability to predict the occurrence of these hazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis.

This project explores how the representation of past violence is interpreted and responded to by those who regularly interact with it. Nationally, the results will provide the opportunity to determine the role and use of memorialization in promoting positive intergroup relations. The project advances the nation's prosperity and welfare by helping us to understand better how the practice of memorialization mediates how our nation grapples with the darkest moments of its past. <br/><br/>A two-wave longitudinal survey of the local city's residents will be used around the opening of a new memorial to capture a pre- and post- measure of social and political attitudes. The survey will be used to: (1) assess how the memorial affects the community and individuals socially, emotionally, and politically; (2) explore how the memorial's representation affects attitudes toward intergroup relations; (3) reveal how that individuals' social positions (i.e., race, class, gender, etc.) influence how they interpret and interact with the memorial; and, (4) explicitly measure social and geo-spatial effects of a physical representation of violence. Whether the results demonstrate a net positive or a net negative effect of the memorial, the research will highlight the impact on present identity representations and intergroup relations. Findings also will be useful to those involved in the opening and managing of such memorials, and those considering their construction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish any meaningful grid-wide optimization task, the distribution system operator will need to precisely know the power consumed or generated at every node, the line and transformer parameters, and the topology of the grid. However currently, limited instrumentation and their sheer size render power distribution grids unobservable in general. To complement the smart metering and grid sensing infrastructure, the novel technique of grid probing is introduced here. Grid probing can be accomplished by commanding smart inverters residing at a subset of nodes to intentionally yet instantaneously perturb their power injections. Actuating the networked physical system and subsequently sensing the incurred voltages at metered nodes can unveil non-metered loads and network topologies. The original and potentially transformative idea of engaging smart inverters outside their intended control functionality pioneers new grid data analytics. This program goes beyond probing and maps the observability limits by processing smart meter data too. Contemporary optimization schemes together with their real-time and decentralized variants will deal with streaming and spatially incomplete voltage and power injection data collected at large-scale unbalanced distribution networks.<br/><br/>On the broader impact, this program lies at the nexus of power systems, nonlinear system identification, and statistical learning; advances our understanding of unique patterns in grid data; and discovers novel uses for inverters in grid monitoring and control. Enhancing situational awareness in distribution grids benefits society by enabling the efficient and reliable integration of distributed renewable energy, electric vehicles, and customer participation. The expected benefits to industry are cutting-edge grid analytics solutions, advanced asset management, and value added for inverters and smart meters. The proposed activities bring about a potentially transformative paradigm for grid data processing, neatly integrated with educational and outreach objectives. The program reaches pre-college female students through hands-on learning activities and collaborative app-based games on electric grids. It also involves undergraduate research and continues our outreach to undergraduate students through visits to residential communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wave breaking is an important source of turbulence and mixing at the ocean surface, including the turbulent exchange of gasses and heat between the ocean and the atmosphere.  Wave breaking is also a hazard to navigation and safe passage for vessels at sea.  The key question is ""how much energy is lost when waves break?"".  This lost energy is both an important parameter for accurate wave forecasts and for prescribing ocean-atmosphere exchange.  Recent work has suggested that the quantity and size of bubbles generated during wave breaking are the key controls on the energy dissipation and thus the strength of breaking.  This project will use field observations and computer models to verify this dependence, with application to improve wave forecasting and ocean-atmosphere coupling. The proposed work will support a postdoctoral researcher and contribute to public outreach with specific contributions to the annual Discovery Days event at the University of Washington, that reaches 10,000 students from regional K-12 schools.<br/><br/>The technical approach of the project is to measure wave breaking in the open ocean with freely drifting buoys that are equipped with motion sensors, turbulence profilers, and cameras for bubble recording. The proposed work builds on recent results using the Surface Wave Instrument Float with Tracking (SWIFT) drifters to measure the turbulent dissipation rate beneath breaking waves and a VOF-based (volume of fluid) Eulerian-Eulerian polydisperse two-fluid model to simulate the two-phase bubbly flow. Previous results suggest that dissipation by bubbles may be an increasingly large fraction of the total wave breaking dissipation during high sea states. The measurements to be carried in this project will be analyzed to determine the time evolution of the bubbles, as well as the turbulence and motion associated with individual breaking waves. The data will be used to test a recent formulation that scales the total dissipation with the time integral of the bubble plume volume. Further, a related formulation that scales bubble plume depth with the area of foam patches visible at the ocean surface will be evaluated. Improvement of the latter formulation will allow estimates of plume volume and infer dissipation remotely. The formulation derived will be compared with other estimates for dissipation, which include: the Phillips breaking crest distribution, equilibrium wind input, and in situ measurements of turbulent dissipation. The proposed work will also examine the effects of intermittence and the consequences of sparsely sampled field observations. These measurements will be compared with the high resolution, two-fluid model simulations of the breaking process. This approach will enable a more complete investigation of breaking wave conditions and an assessment of the inherent sparseness of the observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, languages aren't merely passive vehicles for the transmission of information. Rather, our sentences carry along with them evidence of the fundamental concepts and categories that we use to understand the world and each other. At one level, this fact about language might seem obvious: a person on one side of an argument might choose to use words that a person on a different side might not, and attending to these different choices tells us something about the people speaking. Such observations about language and language users are studied in fields like sociolinguistics. Yet, our language also reveals more basic truths about us which are not as easily accessible to consciousness, and which are more tied to elements of our common experience. For example, people talk as if there are objects that can be counted (""four spoons"") and substances that cannot (e.g., ""four muds"" is odd), even if arranged in discrete piles. Investigating language at this deeper level can thus reveal basic structures of thought, informing theories of cognition and its development, as well as applications in artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>This project studies parallels in the conceptualization of the basic categories 'object' and 'event' as they are encoded in language and understood by both adults and 4 year olds. Previous research in linguistics and the philosophy of language has uncovered striking formal parallels in the encoding of these categories across nominal and verbal language. The project links this research to what is known about object representation in cognitive science, and uses this link to extend what is known about event representation. Specifically, the project (i) tests whether the observed linguistic parallels correspond to parallels in how adults and children conceptualize minimally-different static and dynamic scenes, (ii) investigates the extent to which representational biases for simple dynamic scenes predicts how adults and children understand quantificational language involving words like ""more"", and (iii) probes the hypothetical universality of the language-cognition linkages by teaching English-speaking adults and children attested, but non-English patterns of event encoding. The results of this project will demonstrate the fruitfulness of connecting formal semantics, philosophy of language, and cognitive science to illuminate the interface between linguistic and non-linguistic perception and cognition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These concepts are applicable to many long-standing open questions in diverse fields such as cryptography, topology, and verification. Even though we have a fair understanding of these by now, many fundamental questions still remain unresolved in areas such as efficient approximation algorithms, beyond-worst-case analysis, and the relations between the sub-classes and the problems therein. This project aims to explore these questions by bringing together tools from equilibrium computation, sum-of-squares analysis, robust analysis, and other areas. The project is expected to provide efficient and robust algorithms for a large class of such problems, as well as to develop tools to obtain connections among problems from disparate fields and thereby bring insights into their complexity. The former will have a positive practical impact due to numerous applications in areas such as social network analysis and resource allocation. The project will involve and train graduate and undergraduate students at various levels of the project, integrate the findings with teaching, and make lecture notes and other material freely available online. The project will also reach students from underrepresented groups through mentoring workshops and the opportunities provided by initiatives at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br/><br/>The three main research goals of this project are: (i) understand the recent exponential time hypothesis for the class PPAD through the complexity of constant-approximate Nash equilibria, (ii) understand the relative complexity of problems in the class CLS coming from topology, verification, cryptography, etc., and (iii) develop beyond-worst-case analysis to explain the existence of simple and empirically fast algorithms for computing equilibria. These problems will involve developing novel tools for approximation and for beyond-worst-case analysis. Furthermore, new reduction techniques will need to be developed to relate the open problems from diverse fields and/or to prove hardness of approximation. The project will approach these by building on recent work on equilibrium computation and complexity, using tools from the sum-of-squares method, recent smoothed analysis techniques, and advances in proving lower bounds. Tools developed in the process will contribute to the burgeoning literature in these domains and open up avenues for further exploration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This requires a workforce whose interdisciplinary academic and research training extends from materials design, to manufacturing, and to characterization. Such a global challenge necessitates workforce training beyond the rigid, traditional approaches of materials science and engineering educational programs, into truly creative spaces where innovation is allowed to occur. While many universities have enthusiastically adopted curricular improvements focused on innovation / entrepreneurship, the most fundamental and foundational elements of creativity, creative thinking and creative expression, have been bypassed. Given that the creative process is critical for an innovative workforce, it is important to consider how creativity is nurtured and promoted in not only classroom experiences, but also in research and mentoring experiences. This REU Site, centered on materials design and processing, is designed to address the urgent need for innovation in materials research in the U.S. by interweaving a proven creativity training program into the framework of the traditional research and professional development activities. The project will establish evidence-based creativity trainings that can be used in the engineering classroom and in research training experiences, the results of which will be disseminated widely. This REU Site will fill a critical gap in workforce development in materials design and manufacture, and address a national need for researchers who can solve complex, interconnected problems by training researchers to think creatively from an early stage. Lastly, while creativity is the foundation of innovation, diverse perspectives on problem solving are also necessary to efficiently and effectively addressing global challenges in materials research. This project will increase the number of underrepresented students participating in research and moving towards advanced degrees and research careers. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>The future of materials research demands achieving predictable material responses, from materials creation to application, at increasingly reduced length scales, requiring a workforce whose interdisciplinary academic and research training extends from materials design, to manufacturing, and to characterization. Moreover, such a workforce must also be trained to be innovators capable of thinking of creative approaches to materials design and processing. To address these needs, this REU Site program is centered on creative approaches to materials design and processing. This program is unique in that it includes proven, theatre-based creativity training interwoven into the framework of the research training and professional development activities. This REU Site will enable undergraduates to expand upon their traditional training to explore new avenues in 21st century materials innovation. Beyond creativity, innovation in materials design and processing requires a fundamental understanding of the interrelationships among structure, composition, processing, and properties. This is particularly critical for advanced functional materials, which are often micro- or nano-structured, and built through either self-assembly or complex fabrication processes, due to their unique and complex structure-function relationships, and their potential use in applications critical to human health and security. The REU Site focuses on understanding and predicting these relationships for micro- and nano-structured materials across a wide spectrum of applications, including sensors, batteries, reactors, and implantable devices. Students in this program will learn cutting-edge materials research approaches that include atomistic simulation, coarse-grain modeling, and a suite of materials design / fabrication / characterization techniques. This research will not only advance the science in each unique area, but will provide students with unique, measurable skills in computational modeling, materials science design, processing, characterization, and creative thinking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This vast ocean around Antarctica is the primary location where the waters that fill the deep ocean are brought to the surface where they interact with the atmosphere and with sea ice.  Because of this unique role in the global climate system, the physical and biological processes that occur in the Southern Ocean have a disproportionately large impact on the properties of the global ocean, including the amount of heat and carbon dioxide that is trapped in the deep ocean for hundreds to thousands of years.  Extremely sparse observations of both the Southern Ocean?s circulation structure and biological properties, such as nutrient and biomass concentrations, have presented a significant barrier to understanding the modification of near surface waters and their subsequent exchange with the deep ocean. In recent years, the SOCCOM (Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling) project has used innovative robotic technologies, namely autonomous profiling floats, to provide observations of biogeochemical properties in the Southern Ocean with unprecedented coverage in space and time.  This advance marks a step change in our ability to mechanistically understand the Southern Ocean?s role in the global carbon cycle but many of the physical and biological processes responsible for generating the observed biogeochemical distributions are not adequately captured by the floats because of their relatively coarse sampling interval (10 days).  In this project, two ocean gliders will be piloted to track individual floats in order to measure the oceanic circulation features that impact exchange between the surface and interior ocean.  Gliders sample the upper 1000 meters of the ocean once every 4 to 5 hours and are able to resolve variations in fluid motion on time scales of about a day. On these scales, the variability of vertical velocities are quite large and thus the circulation at these shorter temporal and smaller spatial scales significantly influences the vertical transport of ocean properties.  An improved characterization of motions at these scales, and their impact on heat and carbon transport, will lead to a better understanding of the role the Southern Ocean plays in the global carbon cycle.<br/><br/>Two autonomous ocean gliders will be deployed in the Indian sector of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, coincident with one or more semi-Lagrangian Argo floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors through the SOCCOM project. The gliders will be piloted to track the Argo float for a period of at least four months, resolving the mesoscale and submesoscale structure surrounding the float as well as variability occurring at periods shorter than the float?s 10-day sampling interval. Measurements of the upper ocean hydrographic and velocity fields will permit an analysis of hydrodynamical instabilities within the mixed layer and their impact on vertical transport and exchange across the base of the mixed layer.  The glider data will also be combined with the float observations and remote sensing products to derive vertical tracer fluxes, with the goal of quantifying the partitioning of export between sinking and advective pathways.  Ultimately, this project will provide observations of the physical processes that contribute to high-frequency spatial and temporal variability in Southern Ocean tracer distributions and will provide a significant step towards describing the mechanisms that influence physical and biogeochemical distributions and transport pathways in the Southern Ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diatoms float in the surface ocean as part of a group of organisms collectively called phytoplankton. There are thousands of different species of diatoms distributed across the global ocean.  A famous oceanographer Henry Bigelow once said ""All fish is diatoms"" reflecting the importance of diatoms as the base of the food chain that supports the world's largest fisheries. Despite their small size, diatom photosynthesis produces 20% of the oxygen on earth each year. That's more than all of the tropical rain forests on land. The major objective of the research is to understand how the metabolic differences among diatom species affects the amount of diatom organic carbon that is carried, or exported, from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. As diatoms are photo-synthesizers like green plants, their biological carbon comes from converting carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater from the atmosphere into organic forms.  Diatoms also require a series of other nurtrients supplied by the ocean such as nitrogen and phosphorous and, uniquely for diatoms, the silicon used to construct their glass shells.  This research will investigate how genetic and physiological differences among diatoms influence how each species react to changes in nutrient levels in the ocean and how those shifts affect the export of diatom carbon to the deep sea. The link between diatoms' physiological response and their carbon export comes about because shifts in physiology affect diatom attributes like how fast they sink and how tasty they are to predators. So if we can relate the physiological condition of different diatoms to the food-web pathways followed by different species, we can ultimately use knowledge of diatom physiological status and food web structure to predict how much diatom carbon gets to the deep sea. The research involves investigators with expertise in the physiology and genomics of diatoms and in the ocean's chemistry. The work will initially take place in the subarctic North Pacific in conjunction with the NASA Export Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field program. The EXPORTS program is using a wide variety of methods to quantify the export and fate of photo-synthetically fixed carbon in the upper ocean. The research supports the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research will also serve as the basis for activities aimed at K-12 and junior high school students. <br/><br/>The research will broadly impact our understanding of the biology of the biological pump (the transport of photo-synthetically fixed organic carbon to the deep sea) by forming a mechanistic basis for predicting the export of diatom carbon. It is hypothesized that the type and degree of diatom physiological stress are vital aspects of ecosystem state that drive export. To test this hypothesis, the genetic composition, rates of nutrient use and growth response of diatom communities will be evaluated and supported with measurements of silicon and iron stress to evaluate stress as a predictor of the path of diatom carbon export. The subarctic N. Pacific ecosystem is characterized as high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) due to low iron (Fe) levels that are primary controllers constraining phytoplankton utilization of other nutrients. It has been a paradigm in low Fe, HNLC systems that diatoms grow at elevated Si:C and Si:N ratios and should be efficiently exported as particles significantly enriched in Si relative to C. However, Fe limitation also alters diatoms species composition and the high Si demand imposed by low Fe can drive HNLC regions to Si limitation or Si/Fe co-limitation. Thus, the degree of Si and/or Fe stress in HNLC waters can all alter diatom taxonomic composition, the elemental composition of diatom cells, and the path cells follow through the food web ultimately altering diatom carbon export.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to understand how assessment practices may drive teacher effectiveness. This research study will include participation of 58 elementary, middle, and high school STEM teachers who previously participated in a Noyce-funded project and who have persisted in teaching in Boston or other nearby high-need districts. The project will compare differences in the assessment practices of these Noyce-program teachers to 29 other K-12 STEM teachers from the same area, but who participated in different training programs. The project aims to increase knowledge about STEM teacher effectiveness by how teacher effectiveness may relate to teachers measure their students' understanding. The project will examine changes in how STEM teachers measure student learning over several years, as the teachers gain more experience in the classroom. Outcomes from the research will help us understand how STEM teachers measure student learning and use that information to improve their teaching and to assign grades. <br/><br/>The goals of the research study are to: (a) Increase understanding of teachers' assessment practices, particularly for Noyce Scholars in comparison to other STEM teachers who also persist in teaching in high-need school districts; (b) Measure growth in the assessment practices of Noyce Scholars in comparison to other STEM teachers over time; and (c) Better understand the role of the conceptual, pedagogical, cultural and political challenges teachers face as their assessment practices change. The research employs both qualitative and quantitative methods, in an interaction analysis framework, to study four research questions about K-12 STEM teachers who have persisted in teaching in high-need districts: (1) What are the teachers' current assessment practices? (2) How have their assessment practices changed from when they began teaching in a high-need district? (3) How do salient retrospective conceptual, pedagogical, cultural, and political challenges negotiated by the teachers explain their current classroom formative assessment practices and changes over time in their assessment practices? and (4) For teachers who have persisted teaching in Boston Public Schools, how do assessment practices relate to student performance outcomes on classroom assessments and to district and State standardized mathematics and science exams? Across these questions, the research team will examine differences between Boston and other districts, as well as effects of other factors, including Noyce- vs. non-Noyce- prepared teachers, length of time teaching in high-need districts, and school-level influences such as school culture, accountability rating, stability of leadership, and professional development opportunities. The project will contribute to theory about teacher assessment practices and the degree to which interaction analysis is useful in studying these practices. The project will also contribute to educational policy implications for supporting teachers to navigate pedagogical perspectives, curricular expectations, administrative policies and procedures, and external pressures as they persist in STEM teaching careers in high-need districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include wireless communications,  computational photography, and the training of multilayer networks for classification tasks. In some cases, performance is fundamentally limited by the amount of data. In other cases, the main limitation is the computational complexity of processing algorithms. A major challenge for researchers is to understand these fundamental limits. This project explores these limits by studying probabilistic models that describe the statistical relationship between the data and the unknown quantities of interest (e.g., transmitted message or correct label). The research involves combining ideas from information theory and statistical physics to compute fundamental limits and using these results to design efficient methods with improved performance. The interdisciplinary nature of the research is mirrored in the education activities of this project, which focuses on making connections between engineering, statistical physics, and the information sciences, as well as improving undergraduate education through exploratory data analysis.<br/><br/>The key conceptual idea behind this research is that statistical dependencies induced through multiplication by dense random matrices can be understood through connections with simpler models involving additive Gaussian noise. In a recent breakthrough, the investigator showed how ideas from information theory could provide rigorous proofs for behaviors that had been conjectured using the heuristic replica method from statistical physics. Building upon this insight, the research is organized around three thrusts: i) Developing new theoretical methods to provide rigorous and interpretable characterization of fundamental limits; ii) Designing new algorithms for inference, learning, and compression; and iii) Analyzing bi-linear and multi-layer inference problems with applications to deep learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in spite of noteworthy success, today's CFD still remains limited to a small design space.  One of the grand challenge problems is the simulation of a full aircraft envelope.  Today's computing platforms are based on massive parallelism and heterogeneous processor designs to deliver petascale performance (10^15 floating point operations per second).  This research has the potential to effectively harness this level of performance and significantly address grand challenge problems through advances in numerical schemes, efficient parallel algorithms, and implementation strategies to enable underlying simulations that are currently infeasible.  It also aims at transforming CFD simulation capabilities to dramatically reduce the cost and time needed to solve complex multi-physics problems.  As such, this research fills a gap in the understanding that lies at the intersection of computational fluid dynamics and parallel computing.  This interdisciplinary research also shapes the next-generation of students and researchers with a multi-faceted skill set required to solve challenging problems at the boundary of domain sciences, applied mathematics, and computer science to promote the progress of science and advance national prosperity and welfare as stated by NSF's mission.<br/><br/>This research creates HiPer, a CFD solver for high-performance turbulent flow simulations on massively parallel machines.  HiPer solves the Navier-Stokes equations on multi-block structured grids for complex geometries by combining the following key components: (i) a novel time-delayed implicit time-marching scheme tailored for heterogeneous architectures;  (ii) parallelization strategies for shared- and distributed-memory systems aimed at reducing the synchronization and communication time; and  a hybrid multi-block structured grid enhanced by geometric multigrid to increase convergence as well as reduce the number of grid cells.  Applications that are drivers in the near- and long-term serve as benchmarks for continually measuring progress towards the grand challenge goals.  In particular, two application case studies serve as drivers for the near-term: (a) the simulation of the complex unsteady flow through multi-stage compressors and turbines, and (b) noise generation and propagation in a high-speed turbulent jet.  The intellectual merit of this work is the development of novel numerical techniques, parallelization strategies, and scalable software that enable turbulent-separated flow simulations that are computationally intractable today.  To engage and inspire young generations to this approach, this project strives to (i) organize hands-on workshops at relevant conferences, (ii) design and develop an educational kit targeted to teaching CFD and high-performance computing (HPC) concepts, (iii) design lab-based courses on HPC for computational scientists, including hands-on labs using HiPer on large-scale systems for on-site students, and (iv) release videos and guest lectures through University of California's Early Academic Outreach Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using both maternal (mitochondrial) and paternal (Y-chromosome) DNA for modern and ancient samples will provide information on the genetic diversity and structure before and after European colonization and identify effects that differed for males and females. This project will support graduate student training and mentoring, including experience as teaching assistants for the genomic lab portion of the SING (Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics) workshop where indigenous peoples learn how to use genomics as a tool and form a network of indigenous scientists. Using a community based approach, this project completes research in a collaborative way with indigenous communities, resulting in more accurate information and enhanced scholarship. <br/><br/>Researchers have speculated about the demographic effects of European colonization, the population genetic structure of Native Americans pre-contact, the amount of European admixture and the estimates of the number of indigenous Americans present pre-contact. It has been difficult to quantify these demographic changes because there are no published datasets with large numbers of ancient individuals and their descendants. In this project, mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA data will be combined with existing archaeological information and documented oral histories to infer the effects of European Colonization on males and females in the ancient Prince Rupert Harbour (PRH) population and modern descendants. The researchers hypothesize that the effects of European colonization will be greater for men than women because of differences in activity patterns and admixture.

Mass spectrometry is a tool for chemical analysis conventionally used to measure the mass and determine the structure of many types of molecules. Complex mixtures are a major target of research in industrial and biochemical applications as well as from the perspective of fundamental science. These mixtures can have properties that depend strongly on the relative amounts of their different constituents as well as how they are assembled. From synthetic chemicals to models of biological membranes, such systems can be extremely challenging to characterize using mass spectrometry or any other technique. Dr. Prell and his group are developing new approaches for these characterization challenges, ultimately seeking to facilitate precise control of physical and chemical properties. The project combines state-of-the-art mass spectrometry with advanced mathematical and signal processing tools. Publicly available, open-source software created as part of this project will be made available for researchers around the world to use in analyzing these types of samples. At the same time, Dr. Prell seeks to increase the participation of undergraduates from diverse backgrounds in STEM research through a research-based workshop course. Students in this course are learning and implementing strategies for communicating science research to audiences ranging from middle school through professional colleagues at regional and national STEM conferences.<br/><br/>Dr. Prell is establishing a vigorous, integrated program of research and education to simplify the analysis of nanoscale chemical assemblies using mass spectrometry, and to increase the retention and research participation of STEM undergraduates from underrepresented groups. There are three specific aims: 1) to establish Fourier Transform-based methodology for analyzing extremely congested electrospray mass spectra of mixed-subunit nanoassemblies, including copolymers and lipoprotein assemblies; 2) to introduce two-dimensional Fourier Transform-based measurement tools for signal isolation in extremely congested electrospray mass spectra of nanoassemblies for which prior ion mobility separation or ordinary Fourier Transform are insufficient; and 3) to increase undergraduate participation in and communication of scientific research. Measurement tools target characterization of subunit interactions, assembly shape and size, and assembly kinetics in a wide variety of applications related to the study of nanoassemblies. Software being developed is open-source and publicly available, allowing rapid implementation and adaptation by other research groups. Educational goals are being addressed by implementing a 1-credit workshop course for undergraduates at the University of Oregon using themes drawn from this research as prototypes. Students in the course develop ""elevator talks"" for delivery to a UO STEM bridge program; local middle- and high school outreach modules; and a research presentation abstract for submission to a regional or national scientific conference. These efforts build off of the PI's expertise in mass spectrometry and experience supporting URM student representation and inclusion in science as a faculty sponsor of UO's chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most of the organic material produced by phytoplankton in the sunlit surface waters of the oceans is eaten and recycled in the surface waters, a small amount sinks to the deep ocean in what is called the ""biological carbon pump."" The biological pump is particularly hard to study in high latitude regions, which can be difficult to get to and challenging to work in. It is also particularly important to understand the biological pump in these parts of the ocean, where much of the world's deep ocean waters are formed. The export of carbon to deep waters can be estimated by carefully measuring the amount of excess oxygen left behind in surface waters. Oxygen in seawater can be measured very precisely using sensors deployed on moorings, floats, and gliders. These sensors can be deployed for years at a time, but their measurements must be carefully calibrated. In this project, investigators would use carefully calibrated oxygen sensors on gliders to, in turn, calibrate the oxygen sensors on a set of moorings in the high latitude North Atlantic Ocean, to study the biological carbon pump over a period of two years. The project would train several undergraduate students and a graduate student, and result in the development of educational laboratory materials that incorporate glider and mooring data from the project.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to observationally constrain the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of the biological carbon pump (determined as annual net community production; ANCP) and its influence on air-sea carbon dioxide flux by using biogeochemical sensor measurements from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Irminger Sea Array. However, existing OOI oxygen sensor calibration suffers from both pre- and post-deployment drift, currently precluding the ability to calculate ANCP by oxygen mass balance. The investigators therefore propose to improve the accuracy and utility of OOI Irminger Sea oxygen measurements by deploying two gliders configured for air calibration of their oxygen sensors when surfacing between profiles. These air-calibrated gliders will be used to intercalibrate all 12 existing oxygen sensors on the Irminger Sea Array and produce a calibrated oxygen product incorporating data from all sensors, which will ensure sufficient accuracy to calculate ANCP. Both the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of ANCP, including upper ocean biological productivity and thermocline respiration, will be determined using an oxygen mass balance approach within a data- constrained 1D physical model. A suite of 1D model simulations including the inorganic carbon system, gas exchange, and ANCP determined from oxygen mass balance will be used, together with OOI carbon dioxide measurements, to diagnose influences of physical and biological drivers of air-sea carbon dioxide flux, improving both quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how the biological pump influences the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the other hand, modern data analysis is highly adaptive. Large parts of modern machine learning perform model selection as a function of the data by iteratively tuning hyper-parameters, and exploratory data analysis is conducted to suggest hypotheses, which are then validated on the same data sets used to discover them. This kind of adaptivity is often referred to as p-hacking, and blamed in part for the surprising prevalence of non-reproducible science in some empirical fields. This project aims to develop rigorous tools and methodologies to perform statistically valid data analysis in the adaptive setting, drawing on techniques from statistics, information theory, differential privacy, and stable algorithm design. <br/><br/>The technical goals of this project include coming up with: 1) information-theoretic measures that characterize the degree to which a worst-case data analysis can over-fit, given an interaction with a dataset; 2) models for data analysts that move beyond the worst-case setting, and; 3) empirical investigations that bridge the gap between theory and practice. The problem of adaptive data analysis (also called post-selection inference, or selective inference) has attracted attention in both computer science and statistics over the past several years, but from relatively disjoint communities. Part of the aim of this project is to integrate these two lines of work. The team of researchers on this project span departments of computer science, statistics, and biomedical data science. In addition to attempting to unify these two areas, the broader impacts of this research will be to make science more reliable, and reduce the prevalence of ""over-fitting"" and ""false discovery.""

Recent research indicates that these large-scale events have altered the hydrological and ecosystem balances over historical and geological timescales (decades to thousands of years). This project will assess how far north along the coast of southwestern North America these storms have occurred in the geologic past, and how far inland they controlled geomorphic change events through rain and erosion. The specific goal is to determine if previously documented periods when tropical cyclones dominated runoff and sediment deposition across large alluvial fan systems of the southern Baja California peninsula can be detected in central Baja California, the southern California deserts, and even as far north as the southern Arizona Sonoran Desert. Data will test whether dissipating cyclones were drivers of alluvial fan sedimentation over thousands of years, and if a temporal correlation can be established to a period of transition between a milder, humid paleoclimate to the current arid climate. For the first time, a tropical cyclone landfall chronology covering the last few millennia will be developed for the Pacific coast of southwestern North America. This research has the potential to inform large-storm prediction scenarios for southern California and northwestern Mexico, which is relevant to hazards management for communities in need of risk assessment of rare and extreme events. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of earth scientists using a tiered approach, with field-based collaboration of postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. This approach has been proven successful for inclusion of underrepresented minorities, enhanced also with planned research alongside Mexican collaborators and students. The project will provide unique broader educational experiences for grade-school students in Indiana and Arizona, through the use of technology to connect fieldwork and classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will compare a recently established alluvial fan chronology in southern Baja California, with newly-obtained alluvial fan and paleotempestological records. A Holocene paleotempestological record of overwash deposits in the Pacific coastal Vizcaino Desert will be developed for the first time. The inferred tropical storm activity will be compared with inland alluvial fan deposition in this area and in the northern Sonoran Desert, enabling discrimination of signals from different moisture sources, based on observed coastal and alluvial sedimentology, stratigraphy, and specific proxy records. Effects of different sources of moisture that drive sedimentation will be assessed by probing different time periods, and compared to independent paleoclimatic proxies. Bayesian analysis of luminescence, cosmogenic, and radiocarbon geochronology will improve age control precision. The coupled alluvial and coastal record at orbital timescales will help to understand linkages between Quaternary alluvial sedimentation and hydroclimatic variability in the region, and will increase our understanding of basic principles of alluvial fan aggradation in response to change in arid hydroclimates. The project will test effects of millennial- and orbital-scale shifts in tropical circulation on landscape evolution of the region, which are, in turn, critical to test models of occurrence and effects of hydrological extremes and associated landscape changing events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The event will take place in conjunction with (and on the first day of) the Tenth International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams (DIAGRAMS 2018), to be held June 18-22, 2018, at Edinburgh Napier University, UK, and which will be co-located with the 23rd International<br/>Conference on Conceptual Structures.  Diagrams are wide-ranging and open-ended representations that include sketches, drawings, charts, pictures, 2D and 3D geometric models, and maps. They are a vital tool in human communication in areas such as art and science, as well as commerce and industry. A better understanding of how effective diagrams can be generated and used has the potential to produce transformative advances in these areas. DIAGRAMS is the only conference series that provides a forum for all aspects of research on the theory and application of diagrams. It is a bi-annual, international and interdisciplinary event whose goals are to present and discuss (a) state-of-the-art research on computational, cognitive and socio-cultural theories, models and techniques of reasoning with diagrammatic representations, and (b) cutting-edge intelligent and interactive information technologies for using diagrammatic representations in supporting human reasoning. Research topics include understanding diagrammatic reasoning in humans, understanding the use of diagrammatic representation for communication, developing techniques for automated diagrammatic reasoning, and designing tools for use of diagrammatic representations. The conference series is overseen by the DIAGRAMS Steering Committee with a rotating membership; more information is available at the conference website http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2018/.  DIAGRAMS 2018 will significantly increase our understanding of diagrammatic reasoning in humans and machines, and will add momentum to the development of new information technologies for the use of diagrammatic representations in support of human reasoning. The conference will help develop human research capital by enabling interactions between senior and junior researchers and by catalyzing new collaborations. The Doctoral Consortium will increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas, and help train them by providing early input from senior researchers in the field in an interactive and constructive environment. The social network among this next generation of researchers, and the relationships with senior researchers, created by the workshop will play a critical role in their enculturation into the profession. Diversity of the selected students is a goal of the organizers, who will be proactive in an effort to ensure that both students and faculty are a diverse group across multiple dimensions including nationality, scientific discipline and gender. To further assure diversity, only one student will be selected from each educational institution, with preference given to students from underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the DIAGRAMS 2018 Doctoral Consortium is to increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas. The workshop will be a research-focused day-long meeting that affords participants an opportunity to present their work and get feedback from established researchers in the field, who will be present to comment on the young researchers' presentations in an informal and constructive environment. Each invited participant will have approximately half an hour for presentation of their research, that may include a short demonstration if appropriate, and which will be followed by discussion and critiquing. For some students, this may be their first opportunity to give a research talk outside their home institutions.  Therefore, each student will be assigned a mentor (selected from the Program Committee), who will preview the student's presentation and offer suggestions for improvement as well as provide sample questions that may arise during the discussion.  The Doctoral Consortium is open for attendance to all conference registrants, and summaries of the student presentations will be available on the conference website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It benefits from two previously successful Noyce Scholars' projects awarded to the University of Rochester, and involvement of a newly formed Consortium of involving the university and several school districts in upstate New York working together toward district-wide digital conversion.  Digital conversion includes providing each student with a tablet or laptop computer and using these computers to access digital curriculum resources that can enhance student learning.  This project's goals are to: 1) continue to increase the number of highly-qualified mathematics and science secondary teachers serving students in high-need school districts; 2) engage these Noyce Scholars in the effective use of technology in the classroom; 3) create a state-wide network of Noyce Scholars for support and sharing of resources; and 4) to better understand what it takes to prepare future teachers most effectively.  Achieving the fourth goal has the potential to affect STEM teacher preparation programs nationwide.  The teacher certification program for post-baccalaureate students involves 15 courses, including a teaching practicum, four courses specific to teaching science and mathematics, three courses that integrate digitally-rich technology in teaching and learning in mathematics and science, and five courses focused on teaching students from diverse backgrounds and differentiated needs, including students with disabilities and English Language Learners.<br/><br/>This project is directed by the University of Rochester (through its Warner School of Education and STEM departments), in partnership with East High School (a ""district within a district"" within the Rochester City School District, under New York City Educational Partnership Organization legislation), and East Irondequoit Central School District (a high-need suburban district that is a local pioneer in digital conversion).  It will prepare 26 mathematics and science teachers, who are post-baccalaureate (either recent graduates or career changers) STEM majors (geoscience, computer science, biology, physics, engineering, chemistry, or mathematics), for teaching in high-need schools.  In addition to obtaining teacher certification, these Noyce Scholars will also receive an Advanced Certificate in Digitally-Rich Teaching in K-12 Schools approved by the New York State Education Department.  A critical aspect of the project evaluation seeks to identify common challenges that novice, reform-minded STEM teachers encounter and ways to support them in constructively addressing these challenges.  Findings from this evaluative study have the potential to inform teacher education programs and practices nationwide.  This project intends to advance, apply, and disseminate knowledge about innovative strategies for the recruitment, preparation, induction, and retention of highly-qualified STEM teachers for high-need schools, with a focus on digital transformation efforts to increase student learning and engagement.  As more districts throughout the country move toward digital conversion, a clear need exists to prepare teachers who can thoughtfully integrate technology in the classroom to promote learning and student engagement, particularly in ways that can make mathematics and science more interesting and accessible.  This project is poised to contribute evidence about preparing teachers to incorporate high-quality, digitally-based curriculum and instruction in high-need schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.<br/><br/><br/>The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will also capitalize on reports that the Greater Houston area's current demographics reflect the future demographics of the United States. The project will develop, mentor, and retain STEM teacher leaders in high-need school districts in the Greater Houston area.  To this end, LEAD-STEM will emphasize incorporation of culturally responsive teaching (CRT) in secondary STEM curricula. The project activities will equip the LEAD-STEM MTFs with the knowledge and skills needed to: mentor secondary STEM preservice teachers in the teachHOUSTON Program; work collaboratively with in-service teachers throughout the district and state; and serve as change agents at the local, regional and national levels. Additionally, project activities will focus on: 1) the combined roles of technology, inquiry-based instruction, and CRT in supporting the development of STEM concepts in secondary, underrepresented students; 2) the refinement of MTFs' instructional practices specific to CRT; and 3) the development of teachers' leadership skills. <br/><br/>In partnership with the National Math and Science Initiative (NSMI) and the Greater Houston high-need school district (among the country's largest in population and area), this project will recruit and prepare 30 secondary science and mathematics teachers to serve as teacher-leaders on public school campuses with high enrollment of underrepresented students. LEAD-STEM MTFs will earn a Curriculum and Instruction master's degree with an emphasis in STEM Education. They will participate in summer professional development experiences and instructional coaching guided by project leaders. The experiences of designing and delivering professional development locally will help the MTFs transition to leadership at the national level, through the partnership and support of NMSI. The combination of grounding STEM instruction in culturally responsive pedagogies and using this knowledge to address equity and learning disparities in STEM education may produce a generalizable model of instruction. This project may also serve as a model for other teacher leader development efforts across the country.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, TC prediction models and global weather prediction models are expected to merge in a near future. Turbulent mixing in the ocean surface layer under TCs effectively couples the ocean and atmosphere through air-sea exchanges of heat and momentum. This air-sea coupling is modulated by ocean surface waves (sea states) that are particularly complex and varied under TC conditions. Surface waves affect both one-dimensional (vertical mixing/diffusion), and three-dimensional  (upwelling and horizontal advection) processes in the upper ocean. The focus of this study is to advance ocean turbulent mixing schemes that explicitly include the impact of surface waves. Although similar efforts are underway in modeling centers worldwide, few of such efforts include extreme (TC) conditions. Results from this study will inform on the leading order impacts from surface waves on upper ocean processes in high wind conditions, on the benefits of coupling wave and ocean models, and on optimal approaches to implementing wave-dependent parameterizations. The proposed effort is timely and will immediately benefit both the regional and global weather and climate modeling communities. The results of the research will be integrated into the Hurricanes: Science and Society website that is currently used by tens of thousands of educators and students as well as the general public. In addition to their technical training, the graduate students will receive training from education and outreach professionals on how to translate complex scientific concepts into non-expert language.<br/><br/>This collaborative study will be carried out by combining state-of-the-art modeling and observational data obtained in previous field programs. Specifically, upper ocean responses to several historical Tropical Cyclones will be simulated using a coupled ocean-wave model that includes sea-state dependent Langmuir turbulence parameterizations and other significant surface wave impacts (the Stokes advection, the Coriolis Stokes force, the Stokes shear force, and the air-sea momentum flux budget). First, the model results will be used to constrain the wind stress and the drag coefficient. Next, the model results, with and without the wave effects, will be compared with observational data, including mixed layer temperature, current, and turbulence data. This investigation will clarify whether the Langmuir turbulence and other surface wave effects make leading order impacts on upper ocean responses to Tropical Cyclones, and whether their accurate prediction requires a fully coupled ocean-wave model with sea-state dependent parameterizations. This study will be conducted in close collaboration with NOAA/Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory scientists and will contribute to the NOAA research and coupled atmosphere-ocean model development involving the role of upper ocean mixing on climate and weather prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On January 9, 2018, three large debris flows in the village of Montecito, Santa Barbara County, California, killed 21 people, destroyed or damaged over 390 homes and commercial buildings, and closed all local traffic for several weeks. The flows were caused by intense precipitation in the days following the Thomas Fire, the largest wildfire in California history. Research suggests the debris flow hazards posed by the Thomas fire may continue for 2 or more years in the wider area affected by the fire. The impact of the debris flows on the Montecito community was increased because both the public and local hazard management officials lacked a clear understanding of the physics of debris flows and the conditions that lead to them. Direct interactions with the public through library Town Hall meetings and articles in the local newspapers should help to educate residents as to the regional geologic setting, the use and understanding of specific terminology (""debris flow"" instead of the more benign-sounding ""flash flood"" or ""mudslide""), and to instill a realistic understanding of the danger of these rapidly moving boulder-laden slurries and the need for self-preservation through immediate attention to emergency management instructions. It should also refine those instructions to be unequivocal mandatory evacuation warnings rather than non-mandatory suggestions.<br/><br/>Current understanding of the physics of natural debris flows and flow-surface profiles is largely based on interpretation of remnant debris flow deposits.  However, understanding the physics of any single debris flow requires the collection of important flow data that are often erased from the geologic record within months to several years. Morell, Dunne and Keller will constrain critical aspects of physical debris flow processes associated with the Jan 9, 2018 Montecito event by collecting time-sensitive field data as to the height and flow direction of the peak flow, the volume of eroded and deposited source material, and the sedimentary character of debris flow deposits, key data needed to understand the source regions, peak velocity, rheology, and the runout, bulking, and scouring of large debris flows. By constructing detailed maps and cross-sections of the debris flow deposits along the three affected drainages, the project will delineate the extent and nature of the event deposit, the surface flow physics that caused the debris flow and the widespread destruction, in preparation for potential near-future events from this same area.

The objective of this project is to enable exploration of the inherent insecurity of the IoT paradigm by exploring innovative data analytics as applied to raw cyber security data.  Insights gained will allow detection, characterization and attribution of Internet-scale compromised IoT devices, coupled with their malicious activities, in near real-time.  Several technical challenges impede addressing IoT security at large, including, the excessive diversity of IoT devices in addition to their Internet-wide deployment, the lack of IoT-relevant data and the shortage of IoT-specific actionable attack signatures.  In this context, this project serves NSF's mission to promote the progress of science by aiming to generate a first-of-a-kind, large-scale analysis of the magnitude of compromised IoT devices.  The project also promotes cyber security research and training for minorities, given that it will be executed within the boundaries of a designated Hispanic-serving institution.  Moreover, the project will contribute to operational cyber security by developing a real-time capability for storing and sharing IoT-relevant threat information.<br/><br/>The project will draw-upon macroscopic, large-scale passive measurement data collected in real-time from a network telescope to highlight the severity of the insecurity of the IoT paradigm.  Network telescopes, most commonly known as darknets, constitute a set of routable, allocated yet unused IP addresses.  The project will design and develop real-time algorithms that are capable of inferring Internet-scale exploited IoT devices by exploring darknet data.  Furthermore, the project will investigate formal correlation approaches rooted in stochastic data structures between IoT-relevant passive measurements and malware samples to aid in the attribution and thus the remediation objective.  The project will further explore the orchestration behavior of seemingly independent IoT activities, which operate within well-coordinated IoT botnets.  To this end, the project will innovate time series analytics based upon trigonometric interpolation techniques, recursive optimal stochastic estimators, and bitmap matching algorithms to infer such IoT botnets by employing passive measurements.The project will also (1) develop a unique cyberinfrastructure for IoT cyber threat indexing by automating the proposed algorithms, techniques and methods, (2) generate IoT-specific signatures by employing piecewise hashing techniques, and (3) create access methods based on an API mechanism and a front-end service facilitated by Elasticsearch to allow the sharing of IoT-centric empirical data, threat intelligence and signatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumption of organic material produced by the algae in deeper waters or in sediments consumes oxygen, leading to low-oxygen ""dead zones"" in many places like the northern Gulf of Mexico. This process of nutrient input, algal growth, and loss of oxygen is called eutrophication. Consumption of the organic matter also releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the water, and contributes directly and indirectly to ocean acidification. In order to understand and predict this impact on acidification, it is important to understand how much of the organic matter degradation occurs in the water column versus in the sediments, how variable it is between seasons and years, and how it is affected by processes such as storms that disturb the bottom sediments. In this project, investigators from three institutions along with their graduate and undergraduate students will conduct a combination of field observations and computer modeling to address these questions in the northern Gulf of Mexico. They will share their results with the public through local outreach activities, and with secondary school students in Louisiana through partnerships and curriculum development with local teachers.<br/><br/>The proposed research will use a combined observational and numerical modeling approach to better understand the role of shelf sediment in driving bottom water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH dynamics and acidification at seasonal scales. Past and current studies have not addressed this mechanism. This current lack of knowledge makes it difficult to construct a comprehensive carbon budget for this region. The proposed research will (i) quantify the role of benthic fluxes in DIC production leading to acidification in the bottom water; (ii) determine the importance of the seasonally changing benthic DIC flux in acidifying the bottom water; and (iii) explore the importance of episodic resuspension events in modulating benthic fluxes of DIC. Seasonal sampling will be carried out in Louisiana shelf using state of the art benthic lander platform to record in situ sediment and bottom water oxygen consumption rates, organic matter remineralization rates, sediment oxygen penetration depths, benthic fluxes of DIC and accompanying pH drop.

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collaboration with South American colleagues is planned as is extensive student involvement.<br/><br/>This project aims to employ classical dendrochronological techniques to generate new tropical tree-ring chronologies that are annually resolved and absolutely dated. Radiocarbon measurements (14-Carbon) will ensure accurate dating assessments. Thus, successful tree species will be selected to improve the 14-Carbon curve for the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting tree-ring series will be used to reconstruct past climate variability and regional to large--scale atmospheric dynamics for the last several centuries. The specific aims of the project are to improve understanding of: (1) the spatiotemporal variability of the South American summer monsoon (SASM); (2) long-term interactions between El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the SASM; and (3) the impact of volcanic forcing on past hydroclimate of the tropical Andes.<br/><br/>The research aims to provide significant advances in the science of tropical dendrochronology by<br/>developing a tree-ring network for the tropical Andes in Peru and Bolivia, a region with exceedingly scarce coverage of high-resolution terrestrial paleo-records. While tree rings have been extensively used in temperate climates, the tropics remain relatively unexplored due to the difficulty, in particular, of identifying consistent wood layers (tree rings) corresponding to seasonal or annual growing periods. The Central Andes are an ideal region for overcoming these difficulties, due to the pronounced precipitation seasonality and diverse forests.<br/><br/>The tropical Andes are a hotspot for biodiversity and its geographic position makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change. It also contains nearly all the tropical glaciers on the globe, and recent, widespread glacial retreat is causing a rapid decline in hydrological reserves.  This decline, in combination with increasing water demand due to population growth and economic expansion poses an enormous challenge for water availability, biodiversity and food security. The complex topography of the Andean Cordillera leads to a climate that is characterized by strong zonal and vertical precipitation gradients. Moisture influx from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon basin is modulated by the SASM and ENSO. The scientific understanding of this variability is challenged by the scarcity of long instrumental observations, which also limits the ability to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections over this region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, modern global estimates of this process (commonly called carbon export) differ by over 100%. These estimates are often derived from regional relationships between ocean measurements and satellite observations that are then applied globally. Persistent differences between the satellite and field-based estimates of carbon export have been found throughout the ocean, suggesting that improvements are needed. This project will determine whether profiling floats equipped with chemical sensors can be used to estimate the export of carbon in the ocean. Floats will be deployed at Ocean Station Papa, but the approach is scalable in nature and could be used to validate and improve the satellite algorithms used for global carbon export determinations. The project will support a female, early career scientist and a postdoc, as well as facilitate international collaboration with Canadian scientists. Additionally, the results may assist the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) EXPORTS campaign as well as other satellite carbon export development efforts. <br/><br/><br/>Modern global estimates of the biological pump differ by over 100% (~5 to >12 Pg C yr-1) making it challenging to determine the role of marine biogeochemical (BGC) cycling in modern climate and climate variability. Global carbon export estimates are often derived from regional empirical relationships between field and satellite observations that are then applied globally. Persistent discrepancies between unique satellite algorithms and unique geochemical approaches suggest that accurately quantifying the biological pump remains a fundamental research goal. This project will assess the capability of using BGC profiling floats to estimate the export of distinct biogenic carbon pools (dissolved and particulate organic carbon, and particulate inorganic carbon). By using BGC floats to close multiple upper ocean tracer budgets this project will address two known issues common to other geochemical approaches: assumptions about (1) dissolved organic carbon cycling and (2) the integration depth used for annual carbon export assessments. The method will be tested at Ocean Station Papa, but is scalable in nature and could be used to develop a carbon export database suitable for the validation and training of satellite algorithms required for global carbon export determinations. Results from the floats will be compared to satellite carbon export algorithm estimates over the 5-year float lifetimes. Ten years of existing BGC data from profiling floats and a mooring in the region will also be used to provide further context about interannual variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such willingness may translate into immediate desire to help (e.g., donate money) as well as the long-term propensity to support policies contributing to disaster mitigation and adaptation (at a possible cost to tax-payers). Willingness to help, however, may be a product of complex interaction between individual socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, psychological attributes, political ideology, and beliefs about the issue of climate change. Moreover, the rally effect may be short-term for some but long-term for others. Understanding the complexity of this relationship may increase efficiency of social mobilization to help victims of natural disasters and contribute to greater environmental awareness and support for natural disaster preparedness in general. The investigator proposes to conduct a two-wave survey of public opinion on a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States. The goal of the survey is to examine respondents' reactions to hurricanes (specifically, Hurricane Harvey) and analyze how individual attitudes and willingness to help change over time.<br/><br/>Previously, scholars suggested investigating the time course of reactions to natural disasters but the temporal dimension of public opinion in the context of hurricanes and other such disasters remains largely unexplored. The proposed survey design examines possible deterioration of empathetic concern for victims of the disaster in the context of individual ideological preferences (e.g., liberal or conservative), partisan/political identification, psychological traits (e.g., perspective taking, social desirability bias), behavioral propensities (e.g., risk preferences, future discounting), and social environment (e.g., existence of tangible social support). An important goal of the project is to establish under which conditions helping behavior is most stable and under which it is most fragile and short-lived. Previous research has shown that willingness to help increases if responsibility for disasters could be attributed to human actions (e.g., government), not natural phenomena (which traditionally included hurricanes).

One strategy to help wound healing is to implant a hydrogel containing isolated hMSCs directly into the wound site.  The hydrogel provides structural integrity to the surrounding tissue.  However, during wound healing, hMSCs remodel and degrade the hydrogel over time.  These processes must be better understood to design hydrogels with the optimal properties for wound healing. This CAREER project will apply a combination of new and existing methods to characterize the region around cells during cell remodeling and degradation of the synthetic hydrogel material. The goal of the combined research and education effort is to: (1) use a novel interdisciplinary approach to provide new techniques to answer a critical problem in biomaterials and cell biology, (2) recruit and train a diverse work force and (3) educate a broad audience in biomaterials, materials characterization, and wound healing. The research will have a major impact on biomaterials design. These new materials have the potential to increase the rate of wound healing and prevent development of chronic wounds. In addition, the principle investigator will recruit, train and educate a broad audience. This will be done by: (i) outreach to the public at the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown, PA, (ii) mentoring of middle and high school students and (iii) mentoring and training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this work is to characterize the spatial and temporal rheological evolution of a synthetic hydrogel during cell-mediated degradation to determine viability as an implantable wound healing scaffold. The physical microenvironment is hypothesized to control hMSC degradation strategies during cell migration to efficiently deliver hMSCs to the wound and control material degradation. To test this, the research includes a) characterizing hMSC degradation strategies in homogenous hydrogels that mimic the stiffness of native tissues, b) determining the change in response to an interface in stiffness, and c) determining how gradients in scaffold stiffness change hMSC-mediated degradation and direct motility to increase cell delivery and material integrity. hMSCs will be encapsulated in 3D in a well-established photopolymerizable poly(ethylene glycol)-peptide hydrogel. The peptide cross-linker in this material is degraded by cell-secreted enzymes. Dynamic scaffold properties will be measured with bulk rheology and microrheology. Multiple particle tracking microrheology (MPT) will measure the spatio-temporal degradation profile created in the scaffold by encapsulated hMSCs. These measurements will determine the unique degradation strategies hMSCs use in response to changes in their microenvironment. Bulk rheology will quantify the change in material integrity as hMSCs permanently degrade the synthetic scaffold. Using this knowledge, the viability of these materials as implantable wound healing scaffolds and the microenvironments that most efficiently deliver hMSCs to an injury while providing structure to the surrounding tissue will be determined. The research outcomes will be: i) identification of the microenvironment cells engineer during motility in response to homogeneous and heterogeneous environments in the scaffold and ii) determination of microenvironments that increase cell delivery and material integrity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase.

These are called internal waves and they have been largely studied in deep ocean basins and mid-to-outer continental shelf regions. However, steep internal waves are common in the inner shelf and can modify turbulent mixing, exchange of materials across the continental shelf, and biological productivity of coastal waters. This research will conduct an intensive field campaign and numerical modeling aiming at resolving the transformation of internal waves across the shelf including breaking and dissipation. Historically, internal waves are detected using observations of subsurface ocean temperature that are made at fixed locations using moorings or vertical profiles of temperature, each with their own limitations in resolution. This research uses a fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system, a new method that provides measurement over large areas over the shelf (kilometers), with high spatial (<1 meter) and temporal resolutions. These measurements will be combined with more traditional point measurements for hydrographic and turbulence variables. Results from this work will yield insights into benthic ecology, cross-shelf exchange of nutrients and pollutants, turbulent mixing, larval connectivity, coastal hypoxia, and ocean acidification. The educational component of this CAREER project is based on the idea that one of the best ways to help students succeed in the sciences, and to shape the innovators of the next generation is to inspire passion for science. This is achieved through the integration of research and teaching and activities that relate curricular concepts to societal issues that excite the students, and by demonstrating how perseverance is an important part for success. At the university level, courses will be re-designed to include: (i) socio-scientific issues related to ongoing research, and (ii) active learning techniques that encourage risk-taking and perseverance as a constructive path to scientific discovery. At primary and secondary education levels, the investigator will develop a mentor-toolkit to help professionals in STEM careers, who desire to serve as a role model but lack training in elementary education, to most effectively communicate their path to science and the struggles that they faced and overcame along the way.<br/><br/>The inner shelf is, in effect, a ""swash zone"" for nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) and their intermittency and small spatiotemporal scales pose challenges to observation. Consequently, there are few comprehensive field measurements of NLIWs on the inner shelf to test dynamical theories derived from numerous laboratory and numerical studies. This project will use high resolution DTS measurements, coupled with a dense array of hydrographic instruments and turbulence measurements, to capture a continuous view of the cross-shelf evolution of NLIWs. Results from a pilot study in the South China Sea demonstrate that DTS measurements can provide a unique perspective on NLIWs - allowing for detection of internal wave characteristics (form and path), variable propagation speed, reflection, wave-wave interactions, and ""internal tidepools"" (cool water left behind after the wave has run back down the slope). Furthermore, as opposed to boat-based measurements, which must physically follow a wave across the shelf, the proposed measurements are capable of capturing a cross-shelf view of many waves and will be useful for understanding variability in internal wave ""weather"" on the shelf. The observations will be performed at two locations, representing different shelf geometries and characteristic internal wave fields, and the data will be analyzed to advance our knowledge on NLIW transformation over the inner shelf, the fate of internal wave energy, and the effects of NLIWs on mass flux and turbulent mixing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond providing new, relevant animal models for understanding human health, this multi-species research will provide fundamental knowledge about primate-microbiome relationships relative to host ecology and evolution, and will inform husbandry practices for improving the management of endangered species. The results of this study will be shared with the scientific community via publication in peer-reviewed journals, specific conservation organizations, such as the IUCN Primate Specialist Group, and the Duke Lemur Center, and with the general public via commitment to educational science outreach. The project will also provide training for undergraduate students in field and laboratory methods, bioinformatics and statistical analysis, and data dissemination.  <br/><br/>For leaf-eating primates, one critical role of the gut microbiome is to convert ingested plant fiber into essential nutrients. Indeed, upwards of 57% of daily energy demands in folivorous primates are met by microbially-synthesized compounds. Yet, our understanding of the influence of host ecology and evolution on the primate gut microbiome remains limited, as there is a paucity of available comparative data. To boost comparative power, the co-PI's dissertation research is focused on the structure and function of the gut microbiome in multiple lemur species that vary in relatedness, the proportion of foliage in their diets, the type of forest they inhabit, and their endangerment. The investigators will explore gut microbiomes in two wild populations of Coquerel's sifakas living in northwest Madagascar, and the captive population housed at the Duke Lemur Center in NC. Combining two methods of powerful genetic sequencing, that respectively determine microbial membership and metabolic function, this project address three specific aims: (1) a phylogenetic comparison across several wild primate species, (2) determination of normative gut microbiome variation across populations of a host species, and (3) investigation of the effects of captivity on sifaka gut microbiome. Ultimately, this study will improve understanding of the fragility of the folivore gut microbiome and offer insight into primate nutrition, with potential applications to primate husbandry and human healthcare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CO2 is an undervalued and underutilized chemical raw material. This project is focusing on reactions of CO2 to prepare important chemicals useful for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. Professor Popp's research is using both experimental and computational methods to better understand how these reactions work and how to improve them. Professor Popp is pursuing educational activities aimed at increasing the quality and quantity of U.S. scientists, especially from underrepresented groups served by WVU. This is being accomplished by enhancing the academic experience both in the classroom and the laboratory. Specific activities are aimed at enhancing the university experience for student Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces at WVU interested in pursuing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) careers.<br/><br/>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an attractive renewable resource for the production of chemicals; however, it is traditionally undervalued by the chemical industry because of its stability. Nevertheless, its broader utilization as a C1 feedstock could help shepherd a more sustainable carbon economy in the future. Catalytic olefin reductive carboxylation with CO2 is a potentially powerful way to create new carbon-carbon bonds while generating minimal waste. Professor Popp is focusing on two underdeveloped olefin reductive functionalization strategies: hetero(element)carboxylation and transfer hydrometallation/carboxylation. The former strategy employs element-boron reagents (where ""element"" includes boron, silicon, and tin) and copper catalysts to enable olefin difunctionalization using CO2 under mild conditions. Building upon insights gained from extensive kinetic study of iron-catalyzed hydromagnesiation, the latter strategy investigates new systems that achieve hydrozincation/carboxylation in a single catalytic reaction. Rational method optimization is accomplished in parallel with studies of catalytic reaction mechanisms using a combination of operando spectroscopic techniques, studies of stoichiometric reactions and preparation of plausible intermediates, as well as computational methods. In support of the broader impacts of the project, Professor Popp is organizing new training and career mentorship opportunities for STEM-interested student Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces at WVU, collaborating with a primarily undergraduate institution in the Appalachian region on catalysis research relevant to this project, and developing a new multimedia tool for organic chemistry education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

River input is the primary source of land-derived sediment to the marine environment. These particles have significant impacts on the health of coastal ecosystems and the geology and bathymetry of coastal oceans and shipping channels. They directly and indirectly affect fisheries and navigation. This research focuses on the movement of sediments carried into the Gulf of Mexico, via the Brazos River, during the unprecedented rainfall and flooding event that occurred during Hurricane Harvey. The Brazos River ranks as the second largest contributor of nutrients and organic matter to the Gulf of Mexico, after the Mississippi River.  Unlike the Mississippi, however, most sediment delivered to the Gulf of Mexico from the Brazos is carried during flooding events like that which accompanied Hurricane Harvey.  Little is known about the fate of this sediment.  It is not clear if it is retained in the coastal zone, where the nutrients and chemicals it carries affect the coastal environment, or is carried offshore and deposited in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Through intensive sampling of sediments just offshore the mouth of the Brazos River and further offshore in the Gulf of Mexico in what is known as the Texas Mud Blanket, this project will determine the principal repository of sediments delivered to the western Gulf of Mexico by a major Texas river.   <br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to investigate the hypothesis that flood-borne sediment from the Brazos River is initially deposited in the coastal zone and subsequently mobilized and carried offshore with a large fraction of it being deposited in the Texas Mud Blanket.  The work builds on the analysis of sea-bottom sediment samples collected in 2017 during flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey.  This new program will include two sampling cruises to augment already collected data. The first cruise will entail acquisition of ~25 cores that will indicate sediment deposition and transport in the near-shore region near the Brazos River mouth.  Preliminary work indicates that much of the initial deposition of Brazos River sediment occurred east of the original sampling region.   The second cruise in will collect additional Brazos region cores and expand sampling into the Texas Mud Blanket, with the goal of documenting changes in Brazos sediment deposition from the Hurricane Harvey flooding.  During both cruises, complementary hydrography data will be collected. This includes water column velocities and suspended sediment loads. Provenance of individual layers, within the sediment samples and box cores, will be determined by digital photos and x-radiographs of intact core slabs that show sediment fabric and structures.  To differentiate Gulf of Mexico from Brazos River sediments, sub-samples of collected cores will be geochemically analyzed and profiled for short-lived-radioisotope geochronology, water content, grainsize distribution, and mercury and carbonate content.  These indicators will help identify the origin of the sediments deposited in the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most current treatments for cardiovascular diseases are based on rough estimates of outcomes from the results of clinical trials, which might not apply to individual patients due to patient-specific variations. Computational models of the cardiovascular system, developed from patient-specific clinical data, can help refine the diagnosis and personalize the treatment, significantly improving patient care and reducing mortality. The current patient-specific methods for cardiovascular diseases have been demonstrated mainly in simple, isolated examples. For widespread adoption of personalized medicine, a flexible and easy-to-use framework for integrating patient data and simulating cardiac biomechanics needs to be developed. This project focuses on creating an integrative framework with simulation, analysis, and visualization tools that will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in personalized medicine, ultimately improving patient care and treatment outcomes. Results from this research will benefit the U.S. healthcare system, society, and economy, while supporting the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and advance the national health. The tools developed as a part of this research involves several disciplines including computer science, bioengineering, and mechanical engineering. The multidisciplinary components of the project is being integrated into a larger educational effort that offers the students a solid foundation in developing computational tools and algorithms, while also broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in research.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this research is the advancement of the state-of-the-art in translational medicine with the help of computational modeling and interactive analysis tools to improve the basic understanding of the cardiac muscle and personalize treatment of cardiovascular diseases in patients. The research focuses on creating a novel computational framework to automate biomechanics finite-element simulation and analysis of patient-specific cardiac systems. Further, it aims to advance the knowledge of disease and therapeutic mechanisms by developing advanced multiscale methods to model muscle contraction and growth. Some of the key computational tools and methods proposed as part of this framework include: (1) a geometric mesh generation tool for systematic generation of patient-specific finite element meshes from clinical data; (2) an algorithm for accelerating high-order finite-element simulations using the graphics processing unit (GPU) for fast tuning of model parameters to match the patients' baseline cardiac function; (3) new methods for multiphysics simulations of cardiac systems to model multi-scale muscle mechanics and tissue growth; and (4) new visualization and virtual reality tools to enable animated volume rendering and visual analytics of the results of the cardiac simulations. Successful development of these open-source tools will enable faster adoption of patient-specific computational models by the research community to understand therapeutic mechanisms. This framework can significantly advance the state-of-the-art in personalized medicine, ultimately improving patient care and treatment outcomes. The multidisciplinary components of the project is being integrated into a larger educational effort to offer students a solid foundation in combining biomedical engineering with scientific computing.

In particular, the project seeks to understand and emulate the way in which swarms of bats use echolocation, which is a type of active sensing. In active sensing, for example sonar or lidar, an agent uses the reflection of an emitted signal to learn about its surroundings. Passive sensing, in contrast, relies on the reflection or emission of signals originating elsewhere, such as vision systems that rely on ambient light, or thermal imaging systems that detect heat. In large bat swarms it has been observed that some members seem to navigate by ""eavesdropping"" on signals emitted by other bats, instead of generating their own. This observation raises many possibilities, including questions of whether eavesdropping changes the behaviors that the swarm can achieve. This project will address these questions through studies on wild bat swarms, then will employ the results in experiments on multiple mobile robots. Of interest will be the ways that simple rules for active sensing by the collective may give rise to complex emergent behavior. The results of this project will benefit national prosperity and welfare by enabling new capabilities in multi-agent networks of mobile robots, for applications such as search and rescue, surveillance and environmental monitoring, package delivery, and construction. This work will also provide insight into the native behavior of bats, many species of which are critically imperiled due to disease and habitat loss. The project includes engagement with K-12 students across Virginia, and supports the development of educational modules that will be disseminated to classrooms throughout the state. <br/><br/>The role of sensing in the collective behavior of multi-agent systems -- and particularly the impact that active and passive sensing may have on emergent phenomena -- is currently unexplored. Robotic systems are increasingly turning to distributed approaches, therefore understanding how to leverage their interaction over sensing channels could represent a paradigm shift in the control of such systems. This project seeks to provide a new vision for the dynamics and control of multi-agent systems by coupling sensing and communication. This project is motivated by the intercepted sensing observed in bat swarms. The research team will collect quantitative data from field experiments with wild gray bats, perform model-free analyses to determine how collective sensing and behavior manifests in bats, use this insight to inform and validate a model of group behavior with active sensing, and create numerical and robotic testbeds for hypothesis-based exploration of these novel collective dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Speaking one's native language does not usually feel like a particularly difficult or demanding task: in most situations adults do this without experiencing any noticeable difficulty. Despite this, much research into language production has shown that it is a highly complex cognitive task, and that there are many mental processes involved in translating an abstract idea to a linguistic message that we can communicate with our mouths or hands. Understanding the nature of these mental processes is important both for understanding how to develop better treatments for language disorders, as well as for developing more sophisticated natural language technology. The present project contributes to a better understanding of how language production proceeds by investigating speech errors in Hindi. Speech errors provide one of the most important sources of insight into natural language production. However, the majority of research into speech errors during language production is focused on English, potentially limiting the scope of this research. The present project fills a gap in our knowledge by investigating speech errors in Hindi, a language that has very different grammatical properties than English. In addition, the present project increases the visibility of Hindi for psycholinguistic research. Hindi remains highly understudied in psycholinguistic research on language production and comprehension, despite its many unique grammatical properties and the fact that it is the third most spoken language in the world, with over half a billion speakers worldwide and over half a million in the United States alone.<br/><br/>Previous research on European languages has shown that speakers will sometimes produce verb agreement errors in certain grammatical contexts. For example, in the sentence 'the key to the cabinets is rusty', English speakers will sometimes produce the incorrect plural form 'are' instead of the correct is due to interference from the plural noun 'cabinets'. Research has shown that this interference is highly sensitive to the structural properties of the 'distractor' noun--'cabinets'. However, the precise structural properties that make a linguistic expression prominent and likely to create interference during language production are not well understood. Hindi can help shed light on this. Unlike other studied languages, Hindi has a 'mixed' agreement system: in some contexts, the verb agrees with the subject (as in English), and in others it agrees with the object. Here, the researchers will use structured experiments utilizing two methodologies--the spoken production paradigm and the binary choice agreement paradigm--to identify the circumstances under which Hindi speakers produce errors in verb agreement in both subject agreement configurations and object agreement configurations.

Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are bicycles with a small battery-powered electric motor to assist the rider. Over 150 million e-bikes have been sold in Europe and Asia in the past ten years--in China's case, resulting in truly transformative transportation. This is the world's largest adoption of an alternative fuel vehicle. E-bikes are becoming more important in North America. However, there is little empirical evidence on the behavior of e-bike users and environmental sustainability impacts. The investigator team will refine and deploy a research study, using a combination of emerging hardware and software capabilities, to collect behavioral data from e-bike riders. The collected data will then be used to evaluate how large shifts in e-bike use will affect sustainability. The research in this GOALI project is enabled by an industry partner (Bosch). <br/><br/>The first objective of this research is to refine an instrumentation system (physical hardware and a mobile device application) tailored for e-bike users. This system includes a mix of onboard hardware and smartphone software to collect a host of data on energy and other vehicle telematics. The data collected by the instrumentation and mobile application will be sent to a platform with little to no input required by the user. Using that data, the second objective is to assess the riding behavior of e-bike users and the performance of e-bikes in meeting travel needs. The research team will conduct an empirical study, starting with at least 150-200 participants for one year. This collaboration with industry partners will collect vehicle telematics and rider behavior metrics with an aim toward modeling net travel changes between modes (mode shift and vehicle kilometers traveled). This objective will identify how e-bike use behaviors differ from relatively well known incumbent modes. The third objective is to investigate the life-cycle environmental impacts of e-bike ownership and use, relying on the Department of Energy's GREET LCA model. Coupling the behavioral models with LCA models will provide a methodologically novel assessment of the impact of this new mode. This study will inform local and state policy and planning efforts related to the growth of e-bikes and their influence on environmental policy goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This vast ocean around Antarctica is the primary location where the waters that fill the deep ocean are brought to the surface where they interact with the atmosphere and with sea ice.  Because of this unique role in the global climate system, the physical and biological processes that occur in the Southern Ocean have a disproportionately large impact on the properties of the global ocean, including the amount of heat and carbon dioxide that is trapped in the deep ocean for hundreds to thousands of years.  Extremely sparse observations of both the Southern Ocean?s circulation structure and biological properties, such as nutrient and biomass concentrations, have presented a significant barrier to understanding the modification of near surface waters and their subsequent exchange with the deep ocean. In recent years, the SOCCOM (Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling) project has used innovative robotic technologies, namely autonomous profiling floats, to provide observations of biogeochemical properties in the Southern Ocean with unprecedented coverage in space and time.  This advance marks a step change in our ability to mechanistically understand the Southern Ocean?s role in the global carbon cycle but many of the physical and biological processes responsible for generating the observed biogeochemical distributions are not adequately captured by the floats because of their relatively coarse sampling interval (10 days).  In this project, two ocean gliders will be piloted to track individual floats in order to measure the oceanic circulation features that impact exchange between the surface and interior ocean.  Gliders sample the upper 1000 meters of the ocean once every 4 to 5 hours and are able to resolve variations in fluid motion on time scales of about a day. On these scales, the variability of vertical velocities are quite large and thus the circulation at these shorter temporal and smaller spatial scales significantly influences the vertical transport of ocean properties.  An improved characterization of motions at these scales, and their impact on heat and carbon transport, will lead to a better understanding of the role the Southern Ocean plays in the global carbon cycle.<br/><br/>Two autonomous ocean gliders will be deployed in the Indian sector of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, coincident with one or more semi-Lagrangian Argo floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors through the SOCCOM project. The gliders will be piloted to track the Argo float for a period of at least four months, resolving the mesoscale and submesoscale structure surrounding the float as well as variability occurring at periods shorter than the float?s 10-day sampling interval. Measurements of the upper ocean hydrographic and velocity fields will permit an analysis of hydrodynamical instabilities within the mixed layer and their impact on vertical transport and exchange across the base of the mixed layer.  The glider data will also be combined with the float observations and remote sensing products to derive vertical tracer fluxes, with the goal of quantifying the partitioning of export between sinking and advective pathways.  Ultimately, this project will provide observations of the physical processes that contribute to high-frequency spatial and temporal variability in Southern Ocean tracer distributions and will provide a significant step towards describing the mechanisms that influence physical and biogeochemical distributions and transport pathways in the Southern Ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their obvious environmental advantages, large-scale integration of renewable energy faces a number of technical difficulties.  These challenges are linked to the fact that the availability of renewable energy, i.e., wind and sunlight, depends on nature rather than the controllable process of burning a fuel.  This project develops innovative software tools that enable the deployment of flexible transmission, which is a cost-effective solution to address these challenges.  As a result of these developments, system operators will be able to benefit from a new resource that was not available to them before.  Particularly, this project aims to employ flexible transmission in order to alleviate the uncertainty and intermittency of renewable energy resources, and facilitate higher levels of renewable energy production.  With the help of efficient mathematical modeling and high-performance computing, the models developed in this project are fast and appropriate for real-time operation.  As renewable energy is economical and emission-free, this project will have a significant positive impact on the national health, prosperity, and welfare.  Additionally, this project will integrate computational methods and algorithm development in power engineering education to fill a much-needed gap in power engineering curriculum.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to enable frequent utilization of flexible transmission for one of the largest and most complex cyber-physical system that exists today: the North American power grid.  Co-optimization of flexible transmission and generation dispatch is not possible yet due to the computational burden of the underlying mathematical problem.  Specifically, transmission flexibility, in the form of controllable impedance, introduces non-convexities to power system operation that are challenging to handle within the limited available computational time.  This project substantially reduces such computational burden through a novel and fast optimization technique, which exploits the mathematical structure of power flows.  Consequently, utilization of flexible transmission can become possible which can help reduce the operation cost and improve the system reliability.  This project also aims to mitigate the intermittencies and uncertainties associated with renewable generation by utilizing transmission flexibility. It employs stochastic optimization as the mathematical framework to model renewable energy uncertainties, and optimizes flexible transmission and controllable generation as the decision variables.  Algorithm decomposition and high-performance computing are employed to reduce the solution time required for stochastic optimization in order to ensure fast and efficient computation.  This is an essential component of the project as the computational time available for real-time operation is less than five minutes. The education component of this project enriches the power engineering curriculum, by developing educational modules, on computational methods, algorithm design, and high-performance computing for power engineering students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as genetic datasets rapidly grow in size due to technological advances, a number of hurdles arise when trying to estimate such relationships. Though many methods have been developed to address these challenges, one source of error that is not accounted for by available methods is non-random mating in ancient populations. Because individuals generally do not mate randomly, and because population and species relationships are used to answer diverse research questions from basic science to epidemiology, addressing this source of error is critical. The primary goal of this project is to design statistical methods for estimating population and species relationships that account for non-random mating in ancient populations, thereby increasing the accuracy of estimation. Moreover, it is of high priority that both the scientific community and the public are engaged in the advances of this project. To this end, the researchers will make all approaches developed during this project freely available for use by the wider scientific community. Also, the researchers will work with K-12 students in hands-on activities for learning why and how to build population and species relationships through the Penn State Science-U program. Finally, the researchers will engage indigenous peoples as part of the Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics (SING) Workshop which examines the use of genomic data in science and society.<br/><br/>Ancestral structure, which has been uncovered in many diverse species, can skew gene tree frequencies, thereby hindering the performance of methods for estimating species trees. This research seeks to develop novel likelihood methods that can infer phylogenies under such scenarios, and apply these methods to test evolutionary hypotheses about ancestral structure and gene flow in several model and non-model organisms. The model organisms considered will be mouse, yeast, and mosquito, for which previous studies have observed skewed gene tree frequencies that were attributed to gene flow through hybridization, but may instead be the result of ancestral structure. The researchers will also apply these methods to a non-model coral system, which is of particular interest because morphological and fossil data provide evidence of hybridization, suggesting that this system may exhibit skewed gene tree frequencies. Application to these systems will serve to elucidate and refine knowledge of the events shaping the evolution of these lineages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout education, images are used to clearly convey complex ideas and to stimulate curiosity and interest.  Likewise, investigations in the biological sciences and in medicine invariably require clear pictures of cells, tissues, and organs to discover mechanisms of life and to detect and understand the complex pathological processes of disease. Therefore, imaging is the centerpiece for this REU Site, serving as a bridge between education, engineering, the biological sciences, and medicine. Students gain an advanced skillset in state-of-the-art imaging technologies and interdisciplinary research that they can carry with them to graduate school. They are exposed to the breadth of imaging techniques and medical applications while simultaneously focusing on a specific project at the forefront of biology and medical science. This program applies literature-supported mentorship and training strategies to directly address pipeline leaks for the transition of under-represented groups to graduate degree programs in engineering or related programs. The program also provides enrichment of technical skills, professionalism, and career-readiness. The program is assessed and refined in real-time to continually improve the student experience and value. <br/><br/>This REU Site is dedicated to inspiring and training undergraduates in STEM fields through a summer experience in biomedical imaging research. The goal is to create a coherent interdisciplinary program centered on the visualization of biology and human tissues at all scales, and for students to develop a network of role models, mentors, and peers to support and encourage their transition to graduate school. Undergraduate sophomores and juniors in a variety of STEM disciplines will be recruited with special efforts directed toward females and under-represented minorities at minority-serving institutions and small colleges with limited research opportunities. Students begin this 10-week summer program with a 3-day ""Bioimaging Bootcamp"" to provide foundational knowledge in biology, imaging, and microscopy through lectures, demonstrations, lab activities, and tours, together with social introductions. Students then engage in intensive research projects in imaging and biological visualization, closely mentored by a faculty member and graduate student. All research projects, ranging from imaging single molecules using fluorescence microscopy to MRI-based imaging of the brain in living mammals, have three essential elements: (1) imaging and/or microscopy, (2) a hypothesis-driven analysis of biological samples, and (3) an analytical or computational component. Students also have unique clinical medical imaging immersion experiences, share experiences with their cohort through biweekly social activities, attend research seminars and professional development sessions, and interact with participants in other REUs on campus to expand their network. Summer achievements culminate in poster and oral presentations at a campus undergraduate research symposium that draws undergraduate researchers from throughout the Midwest, as well as the submission of an abstract to the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Annual Meeting, where they reconvene in the Fall for continued education, networking, and career-enriching opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Targeted drug delivery is one of the most promising approaches which relies on nanoparticles (NPs) that carry and release drugs.  The therapeutic efficacy of NP-based drug carriers is determined by the proper concentration of drug molecules at the lesion site.  NPs need to be delivered directly to the diseased tissues while minimizing their uptake by other tissues, thereby reducing the potential harm to healthy tissue.  Therefore, the design of these NPs and hence the efficacy of the targeted drug delivery could be significantly improved by understanding how the drugs carried by NPs are transported and dispersed in human body.  This project proposes a set of computational tools to model and investigate the transport and dispersion of NPs in human vasculature.  This, in turn, can provide better imaging sensitivity, therapeutic efficacy and lower toxicity of NP-based drug carriers.  The multidisciplinary nature of the project also brings together concepts from biology, engineering and computer science to educate the next generation of computational biologists, scientists and engineers. This research, thus, aligns with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare. <br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to create a hybrid finite element and molecular dynamics computational approach for modeling NP transport and adhesion in human vasculature.  The realistic geometry of vascular network and fluid dynamics of blood flow are accurately captured through the finite element model.  The microscopic interactions between NPs and red blood cells within blood flow and adhesion of NPs to vessel wall are resolved through the molecular dynamics simulation.  A robust and efficient coupling interface is built to couple the finite element and molecular dynamics solvers.  Specifically, this project aims to 1) create a multiscale and multiphysics computational model for predicting the vascular dynamics of NPs under the influence of realistic geometrical and physiochemical features of human vasculature; 2) craft an interface coupling technique that enhances computational accuracy and predictability by coupling the finite element and molecular dynamics solvers; 3) build testsuits for multiscale and multiphysics simulations for coupled solution error and convergence analysis; and 4) advance the current cyberinfrastructure to accelerate the material design process and enrich the cyber-enabled materials design community.  Such a computational method can be used to explore how the vascular dynamics of NPs will be affected by their size, shape, surface and stiffness properties, as well as complex geometry of human vasculature.  The simulation results can further guide experimentalists to design NP-mediated drug delivery platforms that optimally accumulate within diseased tissue to provide better imaging sensitivity, therapeutic efficacy and lower toxicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How does influence propagate in social networks? How do the utilization of transportation options and the cost of ridership in a city change during the day and throughout the week? How does knowledge evolve? Formulating these questions as programs is currently beyond the skills of most data scientists. Executing such programs poses tremendous efficiency challenges, especially for graphs with billions of edges, and with non-trivial evolution rates.  Much research and engineering effort today goes into developing sophisticated graph analytics and their efficient implementations, both stand-alone and in scope of data processing platforms. Yet, systematic support for querying and analysis of evolving graphs is still lacking. This support is urgently needed, due both to the scalability challenges inherent in evolving graph analysis, and to considerations of usability and ease of dissemination. This project will fill this gap by establishing the fundamental principles of effective modeling and efficient analysis of evolving graphs, and by making results available to the community of use in an open-source platform called Portal.<br/><br/>This project will build on the state of the art in temporal data management, making the principles and techniques that were developed over decades of research and practice in that domain available to evolving graph applications. The project will develop: (1) a data model for evolving graphs and an expressive compositional algebra; (2) an efficient implementation of the data structures and of the algebraic operations, together with any necessary algebraic primitives and physical representations / access methods, in scope of a distributed data-parallel framework; (3) a declarative query language that supports concise specification of sophisticated graph analysis tasks, and a query optimizer that generates efficient query execution plans; (4) a principled evaluation methodology of usability and efficiency, based on real and synthetic datasets and analysis tasks.  This project will impact research and practice in data management, by contributing novel representation, analysis and benchmarking methods for evolving graph data.  Results of this project will help incorporate sophisticated evolving graph analysis into larger applications, and will enable scaling up to modern volumes. The Portal framework will support computational and data scientists who work with evolving graphs in social network analysis, knowledge management and network traffic analysis.

Organic molecule-based semiconductors have many potential applications, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and light harvesting photovoltaics (solar panels).  How the molecules come together to form materials is not well understood, in part because existing measurement tools are too slow to capture the fast formation events.  Professor Wong overcomes this problem by using a specialized laser system that is capable of rapid measurement. The measurement of properties that directly impact the function of a material will provide feedback for rational materials design, and possibly more efficient and economical LEDs and photovoltaics.  The graduate student researchers engaged in this project are gaining experience in a variety of disciplines, including physical chemistry, laser and optical instrument design, and computer simulations.   The concepts of instrument design are also being shared with UO undergraduate students and local community college students via a virtual instrument simulation program.<br/><br/>This project is focusing on the dynamics of exciton formation, singlet fission, and charge transfer processes in organic semiconducting materials.  Of particular interest are the photo-physical processes that occur during molecular aggregate formation. An in situ transient absorption spectrometer is constructed by using a tilted pump pulse to spatially encode its arrival time at the sample. A second laser pulse probes these excited regions simultaneously, thus measuring absorption at a range pump-probe time delays in parallel. The spectrometer is incorporated into a solution deposition apparatus for optical interrogation during thin-film formation.  A model of how molecular aggregation affects the rates of singlet fission and charge transfer processes is being developed. The production of molecular aggregates with designer properties is demonstrated by judiciously changing the environmental conditions during the aggregation process, informed by insights from the aggregation model. The scientific broader impacts of this work will be the extended application of transient absorption to non-equilibrium chemical systems. This is a valuable real-time diagnostic tool for understanding the physical phenomena that underpin chemical and materials synthesis, tightening the feedback loop and accelerating progress towards designer electronic materials. The measurements yield a deeper understanding of how molecular interactions impact singlet fission and charge transfer rates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Animal intelligence is composed largely of specialized abilities that respond to specific pressures in the environment. However, many recent discoveries suggest that non-specific, general intelligence, similar to IQ in humans, also evolves. Most hypotheses about the evolution of intelligence suggest that general intelligence evolves as a side effect of selection for more specialized cognitive abilities. In contrast, the Cognitive Buffer hypothesis suggests that general intelligence is directly favored by natural selection when animals are coping with novel environments. Urban environments are evolutionarily novel to most animals today, and present them with many new cognitive challenges. This work tests predictions of the Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis by presenting wild spotted hyenas living in rural, urban, and transitional habitats in Africa with a battery of simple tests, much like IQ testing in humans. Performance on each specific task in the test battery will be compared among hyenas in the three habitat types, but a general intelligence measure will also be calculated from the individual test scores, and related to the strength of natural selection acting in each habitat. This work will permit determination of whether or not the strength of selection on general intelligence varies among ancestral, historically urban and rapidly-urbanizing environments. Broader impacts include international training of students, working closely with film crews to create television documentaries, and production of a children's book on hyena research.<br/><br/>The evolution of intelligence represents one of the greatest challenges in biology. Animal intelligence is composed largely of specialized abilities evolving in response to specific selection pressures, but recent work suggests that domain-general processes also evolve. The Cognitive Buffer hypothesis posits that general intelligence is favored directly by natural selection to help animals cope with novel environments. Urban environments are evolutionarily novel to most animals, presenting them with many new cognitive challenges. Here, predictions of the Cognitive Buffer hypothesis will be tested in the context of urbanization by presenting a test battery, focusing on seven elementary cognitive abilities, to 175 wild spotted hyenas occupying rural, urban, and transitional habitats in Africa. Performance on each specific task will be compared among the 3 habitat types, but a psychometric factor-analytical approach will also permit statistical derivation of a general intelligence measure, g, for individuals within each habitat type, and elucidation of the structure of hyena intelligence. Because data are available in each habitat on survival and reproduction, the strength of selection on g can be compared among the three different environments. Comparing selection gradients on g among habitat types permits assessment of the strength of directional selection acting on general intelligence in each environment. This work permits determination of whether the strength of selection on g varies among ancestral, historically urban and rapidly-urbanizing environments. Broader impacts include international training of students, working closely with film crews to create television documentaries, and production of a children's book on hyena research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These anatomical features are thought to have helped the earliest primates to navigate thin terminal branches of trees. However, the lack of claws may also have led to different locomotor (movement) behaviors for navigating large trees that could not be grasped. This doctoral dissertation project will study different primate and non-primate mammalian species to better understand locomotor changes with age, and in response to changing environments. These findings can help elucidate broader patterns of interaction between locomotor evolution and life history in the primate lineage. This project will support student training and mentoring at the K-12 through graduate levels. Data generated by this project will be used in an outreach lesson plan demonstrating how animal motion can be understood as simple machines for a STEM education program for elementary to middle school age girls in Durham, NC through Duke University, and for all ages attending annual public outreach days at the Duke Lemur Center.  <br/>  <br/>The goal of this project is to understand primate locomotor tradeoffs between selection for or maintenance of morphological specialization for movement in specific places (e.g. thin branches), while still needing to move through and between more general (e.g. trees, the ground) environments. Through comparative analysis of descending locomotion and mechanics in eight primate species, and three non-primate mammals, this project examines behavioral shifts in response to changing environmental conditions by experimentally modifying support orientation and size. Animals are filmed crossing increasingly steep and thick supports, and it is predicted that primates will abandon headfirst walking in favor of alternative behaviors, such as leaping, sliding, and rear-first descending in response to the biomechanical challenges of these supports, while non-primate mammals will continue to move headfirst with the aid of their claws. The comparative sample features species from a wide range of body sizes (0.06 to 3.5 kg), limb proportions, and behavioral specializations. Within each species, individuals of different ages are compared to assess how aging affects arboreal locomotion, which would have been a key challenge incurred during the evolution of increasingly long lifespans in the primate lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will address the national demand for qualified STEM teachers in Arizona. This shortage is a result of two primary factors: the lack of qualified candidates entering the profession and the retention of qualified candidates who become teachers and leave the profession within two years. This Track 1 Noyce project will address this shortage by implementing a mentorship program to guide the development of new teachers at Title I schools in two high-need districts in the Phoenix, AZ region. Arizona State University will support this project through: (1) preparing 24 new highly qualified teachers (with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field) to become a certified K - 8 teacher while earning a Master's degree; (2) retaining middle school mathematics and science teachers through a three-year induction program; and (3) training teachers in teaching practices that are known to support STEM career paths for underrepresented groups (minorities and women). As part of the project, Noyce Scholars will be prepared to use curriculum materials that incorporate state-of-the-art engineering practices.  Scholars will use these materials in engineering summer camps for middle school students and their families.<br/><br/>Developing Resilient STEM Teachers for High-Need Middle Schools will provide one-year Noyce stipends to two cohorts of 12 students. The project will produce 24 highly qualified mathematics and science middle school teachers who can positively impact students in high-need schools. As a form of teacher development, Noyce scholars will teach in an on-campus engineering summer camp. Additionally, the project will include a teacher induction mentorship program focused on improving teacher quality through professional development. Through placement of expert teachers in high-need districts, the project has the potential to positively affect more than 3,600 students each year after the grant concludes. Middle school students will benefit by receiving a quality education from teachers who are trained to be leaders in STEM. With a quality classroom experience, students will be more likely to pursue STEM courses as they progress into high school and to acquire the knowledge needed to thrive in STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The broader impact of this project is to create a pipeline of such students. By interfacing the REU students with TUteach mentors (pre-service STEM teacher candidates) and summer high school students (who will also be at Temple University during the summer), the project will instill a culture where students at any level can help and inspire other students, and learn how to explain complex topics/problems at a more easily understood level. The students participating in this project will be working on problems that are of fundamental scientific and technological interest, and will advance the state of knowledge in areas such as energy storage and conversion, plasmonics and nanomaterials. Faculty mentors have been selected based on their significant contribution to these fields, as partially measured by their citation impact. <br/><br/>Technical Description: The objectives of the project are to immerse 10 undergraduate students each summer in an exciting and broad range of materials research in areas that will have enormous societal and environmental impacts. The project will interest the students in pursuing careers in areas such as energy storage, nanomaterials and catalysis. The students targeted for recruitment are those from two year undergraduate institutions who will eventually pursue 4 year degrees, but who will otherwise be at a big disadvantage compared with their peers at research universities. The project will aim to show the students that research or teaching in STEM fields is an interesting and rewarding career path for them, and that they can contribute to developing a future with a cleaner environment, and one that minimizes energy consumption. The project will be interdisciplinary, combining faculty from the Departments of Chemistry, Physics and Engineering. In addition, the project will form cohorts (along with other undergraduate summer students at Temple) of students who will work together on interdisciplinary project that integrate experimental and theory/modeling research. This will not only necessitate the development of communication skills, but is also the way in which many complex problems must be investigated. The activities for the students are designed to (i) give broad overviews of selected topics, e.g. 'Why must batteries be improved?', 'What is an oxygen evolution catalyst?', 'What are molecular simulations?' (via brown bag lunches); (ii) introduce students to the ethics and language of science, i.e. how to write papers and give presentations (via a weekly structured course); (iii) show what information from state-of-the-art instruments can provide (via Temple Materials Institute workshop); (iv) give the students practice and confidence in presenting their own research and also in asking questions to each other and faculty members (via presentations of their research).

Scientists also see the same actions in the Sun, the other smaller and larger planets in our Solar System, as well as in other stars and planets found orbiting other stars.  Rotation clearly affects the spread of heat, chemical compositions, and physical processes.  It can drive circulation on the large scales we see from planets to stars.  The ""Rotating Convection: from the Lab to the Stars"" meeting will bring together an international group of people who study different aspects of rotating convection to review the current state of this field, and plan future studies.  The conference will last five days and have talks and posters mixed with group discussions.  This conference will serve the national interest by promoting the progress of science when plans are made to coordinate future scientific studies of rotating convection to be most productive.  Funding will support the travel of early-career participants from the United States.<br/><br/>Rotation directly influences convection by affecting the transport rates of heat, chemical species, and angular momentum.  It can therefore drive large-scale circulations, and large-scale inhomogeneities. The interaction of rotation and convection is complex and takes different forms depending on the parameter regime considered (e.g. high momentum/heat transfer oceanic convection compared to intermediate atmospheric and planetary convection, to low stellar convection).  Understanding the complexity of fluid motions that derive from this interaction is a longstanding problem that can only be studied through a combination of experimental, numerical, mathematical and observational research.  The principal goal of this workshop is to identify fundamental questions to be addressed in rotating convection research, and develop a research agenda for the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this multidisciplinary project, the investigators want to understand what triggered the recent extinction of all of Madagascar's large native vertebrates, including its chimpanzee- and gorilla-sized lemurs, enormous 'elephant birds,' and horned crocodiles. The discovery of extraordinary deposits of fossils and stalagmites in previously-unexplored flooded and dry caves at Tsimanampesotse National Park (TNP) in southwestern Madagascar has opened new opportunities for researchers to address this question. An international team of anthropologists, geologists and ecologists will work with cave divers to retrieve and study fossils and stalagmites from the flooded caves and nearby dry deposits. By taking small samples of rock from stalagmites and studying their chemistry, the team will be able to reconstruct with great precision changes in habitat and rainfall over the past 50,000 years. Team members will also document changes in the presence or absence of small animals that may be excellent indicators of habitat transformation. Through this work, they will identify specific turning points in the catastrophic decline and extinction of Madagascar's large vertebrates, which will have broad implications for how to avoid future extinctions on the island and elsewhere. The team will support public science outreach with creation of 3D maps of the flooded caves and fossil deposits, and multi-language, multi-media educational displays. The displays will focus on conservation, and how understanding the past can inform the future. Finally, this project will support the doctoral dissertations of three graduate students, and build future opportunities for international collaborative research.    <br/><br/>The investigators will utilize state-of-the-art techniques from anthropology, ecology, cave science and paleoclimatology to tease apart how environmental changes and human activities affect communities of plants and animals. This work is challenging, especially since natural aridification (through reduced rainfall) and human disturbance (through setting fires, cutting trees, raising cattle or other introduced domesticated animals, and planting crops) can have similar devastating effects on the distribution and abundance of wild plants and animals. However, stalagmites preserve precisely-datable records of changes in local rainfall and vegetation. Consequently, it is possible to know when rainfall and vegetation co-varied, and when vegetation changed independent of rainfall, implying that some other agent, such as humans, was responsible. Bones and teeth of animals can preserve datable evidence of the diets, activities, movements and habitats of species that have survived, and those that have not. Sometimes traces on the surfaces of fossils themselves preserve evidence of how individuals died - for example, by succumbing to a predatory bird, carnivore or human. This project will tease apart the relative importance of environmental change and human activities, and build a chronology of the survival and extinction of species. Advances in the science of the chemistry of rocks, bones, and teeth, coupled with the old-fashioned tools of paleontological analysis (identifying fossils and recording their associations) have made all of this possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is focused on understanding processes that control where microbes live and how they respond to changes in local conditions. A tree exists in a given location if it can survive both the environmental conditions and interactions with its neighbors at that location, and its seedlings may disperse to new locations with new environmental conditions. Unlike trees, microbes frequently migrate as whole communities and in tandem with their environment, often merging with other microbial communities along with their respective environments. For instance, wind movement of soil particles across the landscape or human handshakes result in novel contact of previously separated microbial communities. This process is termed community coalescence. The confluence of two water bodies is a clear example of community coalescence, resulting in a new, united environment with novel interactions among the previously separate microbial communities. This research will experimentally identify how aquatic microbial communities interact and respond to the merger under different environmental conditions. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand how microbial communities from distinct habitats interact under community coalescence, with the following specific objectives: (1) Characterize the membership of microbial communities in the field and their activity at three distinct aquatic environments where coalescence occurs. (2) In the laboratory, track microbial community membership and activity in response to experimentally-imposed coalescence. (3) Analyze experimental data in the context of the patterns observed in the field. Unraveling mechanisms that determine community membership following a coalescence event is difficult, since the abiotic and biotic factors are intertwined. In order to understand the true community ecology of microbes, it is necessary to separate the environmental and biological factors that ultimately determine which organisms persist and which do not. To address these fundamental ecological questions, the research team developed a new approach to directly measure the effects of environmental factors and biotic interactions, independently and in combination, on coalesced communities. This project addresses fundamental concepts in community ecology, dispersal of a massive number of microorganisms in the context of aquatic systems, and directly disentangles biotic and abiotic factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advances in genetics have led to the identification of DNA methylation markers that change with age and could be used in new methods of age prediction, but generally using tissue types that are not always available in archaeological and forensic contexts. In this doctoral dissertation project, samples of human bone across a range of known ages will be analyzed to determine regions of the genome that change most reliably with age. These data will be used to develop a method of predicting an individual's age from their bones, which may show different patterns of methylation compared with other tissue types. The protocol and algorithms used in this project will be made freely available online, and the project will support graduate and undergraduate training and research in a STEM discipline.<br/><br/>While age-associated changes in DNA methylation are well known in the field of epigenetics, most research conducted so far has been in blood and saliva tissues that can be easily obtained from living individuals. DNA methylation patterns are known to differ significantly between tissue types, and epigenetic age prediction models developed for a particular tissue type cannot be automatically applied to another. Therefore, in order to extend the applicability of DNA methylation-based age prediction to forensic contexts, more research on specific forensically relevant tissues is necessary. In this project, the researchers will first generate a genome-wide DNA methylation dataset from human bone collected through a body donation program. DNA will be extracted from these bone samples and their DNA methylation levels will be measured at over 850,000 sites across the genome using a commercially available array. This dataset will be analyzed statistically to identify specific regions of the genome that vary in a strong, predictable manner with age. The DNA methylation patterns at these regions will be used to develop a statistical model that can accurately estimate chronological age. Finally, a protocol to target and measure methylation levels at only these highly age-associated genomic regions will be developed, which will allow the age estimation method to be applied at a much lower cost<br/><br/>This grant is jointly supported by NSF and the National Institute of Justice, Office of Investigative and Forensic Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses specifically on challenges that elementary teachers in rural high-need schools face in providing rich learning opportunities in STEM subjects.  The program aims to increase the Master Teaching Fellows? depth of content knowledge in the various STEM disciplines, and to enhance their instructional practices and pedagogical skills.  As a result, it is expected that they will be better able to lay the foundation for the students? future academic success. NebraskaSTEM will create a 14-month Master of Arts degree program in elementary education with a specialization in STEM Education. It will also work with the Master Teaching Fellows to develop and implement STEM initiatives (school/community-based STEM projects) in the rural schools in which they teach. The integration of STEM content areas will also be a powerful feature of NebraskaSTEM, enabling teachers to teach STEM in more integrated ways, thus enhancing integrated STEM learning for K-6 students in rural Nebraska schools.  The degree program and findings related to how a Noyce project can enhance rural elementary STEM teacher leadership will have potential value for other elementary teacher programs.  <br/><br/>Fifteen experienced, exemplary elementary teachers will be recruited from high-need rural elementary schools to receive professional growth experiences (including graduate coursework), mentoring as teacher leaders, and salary supplements of $10,000/year.   During the first project-year, they will take graduate coursework.  NebraskaSTEM coursework will lead to a master's degree for those without one; Master Teaching Fellows with master's degrees will take one less course and will not write a thesis.  Coursework will include four STEM content courses, a pedagogy course, a culture course focused on rural schools, and multiple leadership courses.  Master Teaching Fellows without prior coursework in education research will take courses to develop research skills.  Ongoing mentorship and professional development during years two through five will provide MTFs with opportunities to apply and share their knowledge and skills as they implement high-quality STEM instruction in their classrooms and serve as STEM leaders in their local schools and communities.  Developing elementary STEM leadership capacity in rural Nebraska schools is intended to positively affect the schools, districts, and regions in which the Master Teaching Fellows serve.  NebraskaSTEM Master Teaching Fellows and the project team will establish and maintain a website for outreach and dissemination of the project activities and results, and develop videos during years 2-5 to document and share information about the NebraskaSTEM master's degree program and Master Teaching Fellows STEM initiatives.

Wave breaking is an important source of turbulence and mixing at the ocean surface, including the turbulent exchange of gasses and heat between the ocean and the atmosphere.  Wave breaking is also a hazard to navigation and safe passage for vessels at sea.  The key question is ""how much energy is lost when waves break?"".  This lost energy is both an important parameter for accurate wave forecasts and for prescribing ocean-atmosphere exchange.  Recent work has suggested that the quantity and size of bubbles generated during wave breaking are the key controls on the energy dissipation and thus the strength of breaking.  This project will use field observations and computer models to verify this dependence, with application to improve wave forecasting and ocean-atmosphere coupling. The proposed work will support a postdoctoral researcher and contribute to public outreach with specific contributions to the annual Discovery Days event at the University of Washington, that reaches 10,000 students from regional K-12 schools.<br/><br/>The technical approach of the project is to measure wave breaking in the open ocean with freely drifting buoys that are equipped with motion sensors, turbulence profilers, and cameras for bubble recording. The proposed work builds on recent results using the Surface Wave Instrument Float with Tracking (SWIFT) drifters to measure the turbulent dissipation rate beneath breaking waves and a VOF-based (volume of fluid) Eulerian-Eulerian polydisperse two-fluid model to simulate the two-phase bubbly flow. Previous results suggest that dissipation by bubbles may be an increasingly large fraction of the total wave breaking dissipation during high sea states. The measurements to be carried in this project will be analyzed to determine the time evolution of the bubbles, as well as the turbulence and motion associated with individual breaking waves. The data will be used to test a recent formulation that scales the total dissipation with the time integral of the bubble plume volume. Further, a related formulation that scales bubble plume depth with the area of foam patches visible at the ocean surface will be evaluated. Improvement of the latter formulation will allow estimates of plume volume and infer dissipation remotely. The formulation derived will be compared with other estimates for dissipation, which include: the Phillips breaking crest distribution, equilibrium wind input, and in situ measurements of turbulent dissipation. The proposed work will also examine the effects of intermittence and the consequences of sparsely sampled field observations. These measurements will be compared with the high resolution, two-fluid model simulations of the breaking process. This approach will enable a more complete investigation of breaking wave conditions and an assessment of the inherent sparseness of the observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference is co-organized by faculty from the University of Kansas (KU), the University of Missouri (MU), and the University of Nebraska (NU). Nearly all physical phenomena are governed by fundamental laws and design principles that directly relate rates of change of one quantity to that of some other quantity. This powerful idea leads naturally to differential equations, which are widely used as models in mathematical physics and have potential applications to many fields including Bose-Einstein condensates, fluid dynamics, pattern formation, gas dynamics, and fiber optical communication. This conference will bring together researchers from the geographic area close to Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska to exchange ideas and report new results in differential equations and applications. Building on the success of the three prior conferences in this conference series, the conference will provide a venue for regional junior and senior researchers, as well as graduate students, to discuss recent advances and challenges in their respective fields. Additionally, young researchers will be given the opportunity to present their work and to gain insight into this important subject through interactions with senior experts in the field. The conference website can be foundathttp://dept.ku.edu/~math/conferences/2018/KUMUNUPDE/<br/><br/>Complex nonlinear systems abound in science and engineering, and their behavior is often modeled by systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE). Any progress towards understanding the behavior of their solutions is of paramount importance for a variety of practical applications, including fluid flow, flame front propagation and fiber optical communication. Many PDE can be conveniently described as infinite dimensional dynamical systems, allowing for the use of tools and methodologies from dynamical systems theory to make qualitative and quantitative predictions about the solutions of these systems. Objects like invariant manifolds have been a great aid in understanding the behavior of finite-dimensional dynamical systems, but the connections between nonlinear PDE and dynamical systems is still an area of active current research. In the last few decades, collaborations between researchers in these fields, as well as with those working in their applications, have provided tremendous progress in our understanding of the dynamical behavior, stability and robustness of coherent structures in such nonlinear PDE. The themes of this conference include (i) fluiddynamics, water waves and dispersive PDE, (ii) existence, dynamics and stability of nonlinear waves in dissipative systems, and (iii) dynamical systems, invariant manifolds and attractors.

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Growing evidence for the persistence of agriculture through periods of population collapse and environmental change suggests that the transition to food production is a tipping point from which human populations cannot return, but at least one case study provides evidence to the contrary. The Fremont in the Basin-Plateau region of Western North America farmed maize for nearly a millennium, from about 1550-650 years ago (AD 450-1350), then abandoned agriculture and their farming villages a few centuries prior to European contact. Farming ceased earlier in some regions of the Fremont landscape than in others but by AD 1350 most of the characteristics of settlement pattern that identified the Fremont as an archaeological complex were no longer present.  At European contact groups living in the eastern Great Basin and on the northern Colorado Plateau had returned to mobile hunting and gathering. Reasons for both the origin and demise of Fremont farming have been hotly debated, but a consensus is lacking. This project will generate extensive data on diet, climate and demography in order to address the rise, spatiotemporal variation in reliance on maize and fall of the Fremont complex, which will serve as a model system to explore the dynamics that lead to agricultural collapse. <br/><br/><br/>Several approaches will be used to reconstruct the variables that likely determined the investment of Fremont populations in maize agriculture and their decision to return to foraging. Demography - the size and distribution of human populations - is one critical factor.  Summed radiocarbon dates from Fremont contexts will be used as a proxy for prehistoric population densities. Research has shown population growth puts pressure on wild resources and can be a driver of reliance on domesticates. Thus, variation in the size and structure of local Fremont populations may address variation in reliance on maize. Modeling agricultural suitability will further inform this work. Key climatic variables that affect maize productivity such as precipitation, growing degree days, soil moisture and soil chemistry are critical to the success of maize farming. Modern data will be temporally adjusted with tree-ring chronologies to reconstruct paleo-climate across the Fremont region. Finally the bone chemistry of a large collection of Fremont individuals will be analyzed to determine spatiotemporal variation in the dietary importance of maize.  Once all the data are assembled the relative influence of each factor will be evaluated. The resulting analyses will examine how an individual's reliance on maize agriculture varied as a function of each explanatory variable while holding time, space and other confounds constant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, these species depend on a short-lived spring algal bloom for growth and the accumulation of lipid stores in order to complete an annual life cycle that includes a period of dormancy. The intellectual thrust of this project measures how the timing and magnitude of algal blooms affect preparation for dormancy using a combination of field and experimental observations. The Northern Gulf of Alaska - with four calanid species that experience dormancy, steep environmental gradients, well-described phytoplankton bloom dynamics, and a concurrent NSF-LTER program - provides an unusual opportunity to identify the factors that affect dormancy preparation. Education and outreach plans are integrated with the research. Educational efforts focus on interdisciplinary opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral trainees. The project will generate content for existing graduate and undergraduate courses. U. of Alaska Fairbanks and U. Hawaii at Manoa are Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, and students from these groups will be recruited to participate in the project.  Because fishing is a major industry in the Gulf of Alaska, outreach will communicate the role copepods play in marine ecosystems using the concept of a dynamic food web tied to production cycles.<br/><br/><br/>Diapause (dormancy) and the accompanying accumulation of lipids in copepods have been identified as key drivers in high latitude ecosystems that support economically important fisheries, including those of the Gulf of Alaska.  While the disappearance of lipid-rich copepods has been linked to severe declines in fish stocks, little is known about the environmental conditions that are required for the successful completion of the copepod's life cycle.  A physiological profiling approach that measures relative gene expression will be used to test two alternative hypotheses: the lipid accumulation window hypothesis, which holds that individuals enter diapause only after they have accumulated sufficient lipid stores, and the developmental program hypothesis, which holds that once the diapause program is activated, progression occurs independent of lipid accumulation.  The specific objectives are:  1) determine the effect of food levels during N. flemingeri copepodite stages on progression towards diapause using multiple physiological and developmental markers; 2) characterize the seasonal changes in the physiological profile of N. flemingeri across environmental gradients and across years; 3) compare physiological profiles across co-occurring calanid species (N. flemingeri, Neocalanus plumchrus, Neocalanus cristatus and Calanus marshallae); and 4) estimate the reproductive potential of the overwintering populations of N. flemingeri.  The broader scientific significance includes the acquisition of new genomic data and molecular resources that will be made publicly available through established data repositories, and the development of new tools for routinely obtaining physiological profiles of copepods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past studies have shown sub-ice shelf ecosystems to change in response to altered oceanographic processes resulting from ice-shelve retreat. However, information on community changes and ecosystem structure under ice shelves are limited because sub-ice-shelf ecosystems have either been sampled many years after ice-shelf breakout, or have been sampled through small boreholes, yielding extremely limited spatial information. The recent breakout of the A-68 iceberg from the Larsen C ice shelf in the western Weddell Sea provides an opportunity to use a ship-based study to evaluate benthic communities and water column characteristics in an area recently vacated by a large overlying ice shelf.  The opportunity will allow spatial assessments at the time of transition from an under ice-shelf environment to one initially exposed to conditions more typical of a coastal Antarctic marine setting.   <br/> <br/>This RAPID project will help determine the state of a coastal Antarctic ecosystem newly exposed from ice-shelf cover and will aid in understanding of rates of community change during transition.  The project will conduct a 10-day field program, allowing contrasts to be made of phytoplankton and seafloor megafaunal communities in areas recently exposed by ice-shelf loss to areas exposed for many decades.  The project will be undertaken in a collaborative manner with the South Korean Antarctic Agency, KOPRI, by participating in a cruise in March/May 2018.  Combining new information in the area of Larsen C with existing observations after the Larsen A and B ice shelf breakups further to the north, the project is expected to generate a dataset that can elucidate fundamental processes of planktonic and benthic community development in transition from food-poor to food-rich ecosystems. The project will provide field experience to two graduate students, a post-doctoral associate and an undergraduate student.

These crowds are composed of regular citizens. The potential of crowdsourcing has been proven in fields such as environmental sciences, transportation systems, and social sciences. Well-known examples include the mobile applications for the community-based traffic and navigation, which help drivers take the most efficient routes based on information provided by other drivers. Some other crowdsourced applications are the periodic measurement of environmental variables, monitoring of roads, traffic, and civil infrastructure. A crowdsourced system may be a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), which includes incentive mechanisms to encourage user participation in a given task. The typical elements of such a system are the data buyers, contributors and a platform for data storage and processing. The contributors may take the form of people who use their smartphones for data collection or autonomous vehicles with the attached sensors. These contributors have natural patterns of daily movement, which covers only specific paths in the target area at specific times. However, a sensing task may require data from all parts of the target area in different times to ensure representative sampling. Therefore, coverage in terms of both space and time may be critical for crowdsourced applications. This proposal addresses the problem of spatial and temporal coverage for sampling in a target area, in particular the coverage of isolated sub-regions where participants' density is very low. This problem is tackled by an incentive mechanism that dynamically assigns compensation for data collection in the sub-regions of the target area based on the density of the contributors in that sub-region. To achieve this goal, a sensing market is modeled using a game-theoretic approach. In the sensing market, a data buyer announces a task per sub-region and the corresponding compensation. Then, the interested participants who decide to visit that region, submit their current locations and final destinations as well as the amount of time they are willing to spend on the sensing task. Similar to any other market, the members of a CS market want to maximize their utilities. The contributors maximize their utility by strategizing their trajectories while data buyers maximize their utility by predicting the contributors' behavior and setting the optimal rewards per sub-region. <br/><br/>The resulting information of the proposed incentive mechanism may be leveraged by people and other rational participants such as autonomous vehicles to better plan their daily activities. For example, individuals can avoid environmental conditions that represent a risk for their health or change their daily commute to produce the lowest stress level. Other potential applications include autonomous vehicle scheduling and navigation, smart robots navigation and smart utilization of transportation resources. The proposed project will facilitate and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration among the disciplines of computer science, transportation engineering and environmental science. Specifically, interdisciplinary courses and laboratories will be developed while employing peer-to-peer Web technology, such as Wiki pages, to facilitate instant and direct access to ideas and data related to the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This eight-week summer research program is open to college juniors and seniors who are interested in learning quantitative methods and carrying out research on intriguing applications of math to their day-to-day lives. It encourages students from minority institutions and/or students from underrepresented groups who come from economically disadvantaged families as well as from local community colleges to apply. The summer program begins with four weeks of concentrated coursework on topics specific to mathematical and computational statistics, and theoretical biology at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level. The daily coursework is paired with coordinated computer labs and collaborative study sessions with graduate student teaching assistants and faculty present. Students are trained in leading computer software such as MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, Netlogo, and R. During the second half of the program the students are asked to take what they have learned and apply it to group research projects of their choice with help from mentors. These projects are written as technical reports and students give a research presentation on their work/results at ASU during the final week of the program. The students also create posters of their projects that they present first at ASU and then again at the national SACNAS Conference and the Joint Mathematics Meetings. In summary, the exciting MTBI environment generates innovative research projects, leads to the achievement of significant scientific results within a summer, and motivates undergraduate students to pursue higher studies.<br/>  <br/>The objectives of the MTBI Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates program are to encourage and facilitate the access to the successful completion of graduate studies by mostly underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate students at the interface of mathematics and life and social sciences. The MTBI summer program at ASU exposes undergraduates to scientific research by introducing them to methods in applied mathematics, training them on well-known modeling software and letting them address relevant questions in theoretical biology. The program faculty is composed of first-rate minority, non-minority and international researchers, both  male and female to teach, advise, and mentor MTBI students. All have active research programs. MTBI not only supports an environment in which high quality undergraduate research is recognized and expected but also provides opportunities for students to collaborate on their research with excellent researchers from around the country and world. The program expands the visibility of the research carried out at MTBI by minorities via presentations of student research at national conferences. Success is measured directly by the quality of the student reports, and by the acceptance to and completion of graduate school by our participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fortunately, with minimal human intervention, good data cleaning heuristics produce mostly reliable, usually actionable information from big, messy data.  For instance, analysts might automate their curation workflows by using classifiers to predict missing attribute values, or by using an entity-resolver to find and merge duplicate records.  Unfortunately, heuristics are also dangerous, as the result of heuristic curation is often taken as fact.  Serious mistakes like people being denied a loan due to someone else's bad credit, 12-year olds being identified as terrorists, or billion dollar investment errors, often result when low-confidence, or uncertain heuristic inferences are treated as truth.  Many principled tools like probabilistic databases already exist for automatically tracking potential errors in unreliable data, but these tools are not easy to use.  As a result, analysts more often resort to simply documenting potential errors and hoping that anyone using the data will realize the implications.  This proposal will enable data management systems that can query and organize uncertain data, without being hard to use.<br/> <br/>The specific aim of this proposal is to decouple the process of asking questions about uncertain data from mechanical concerns like why the data is uncertain, how the user wants to view uncertainty in query results, or which algorithms should be used.  To enable this sort of ""declarative uncertainty management,"" the project team will build on a system called Mimir that virtualizes uncertainty by augmenting data curation workflows (e.g., ETL pipelines) with a form of provenance capture through which heuristics can register alternative outputs (e.g., a schema matcher may register multiple potential matches).  This provenance can then be used to synthesize a wide range of different physical and visual representations of uncertainty in data and in query results.  To enable declarative uncertainty management, this proposal will address specific problems that fall into two general categories: (1) selecting and efficiently constructing qualitative summaries of uncertainty in query results, and (2) enhancing database query compilers and optimizers to support practical, efficient query processing over uncertain data.

The studies proposed here aim to test longstanding questions in psycholinguistics: (1) what is the nature of memory representation; and (2) what information is retrieved from memory during active sentence processing?<br/><br/>By employing eye-tracking experiments, this project investigates the retrieval process in Noun Phrase Ellipsis, which we find includes detailed structural and morphological information. Pairing ellipsis constructions with agreement attraction should illuminate the process, distinguishing the observed effect from other syntactic structures. In addition, it also seeks to determine at which stage that information influences the processing of ellipsis constructions, compared to other kinds of noun anaphora. This project will enable us to identify potential sources that interfere with resolving different types of dependencies with respect to memory retrieval mechanisms. This will in turn enhance our understanding of the difficulties experienced by second language learners and those with specific language impairments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fertilizer plant waste carries microorganisms that grow well in high-N conditions; thus, the concurrent addition of N and unique microbes could enhance microbiological N removal activity within the river, and will advance understanding of the connections between microbial community composition and riverine nitrogen cycling. This is a significant frontier in ecosystem science with high potential to improve mechanistic understanding of future changes in ecosystem structure and function. To accomplish these goals, the research uses two approaches. First, the relationship between changes in river water quality and changes in river water microbial communities will be measured over time and compared to unaffected sections of the river. Second, in order to directly test whether different microbial populations have different effects on water quality, lab experiments will compare N removal in waters inoculated with microorganisms from either the river or fertilizer waste ponds. This project focuses on a uniquely well-defined release of water with distinct chemistry and microbial composition, which enables clear tracking of the effect of altered N input and microbial community composition on river water quality. This research will teach us whether knowing water microbial community composition helps predict water quality in a large river. This project supports direct engagement between research scientists and their local municipality and watershed organization to learn about controls on water quality. It also gives graduate and undergraduate students hands-on experience collecting, synthesizing and interpreting data on river chemistry and microbiology.<br/> <br/>To reach project goals, the researchers will deploy a suite of sensors (nitrate and dissolved oxygen) and automated water samplers, and collect grab samples to characterize downstream changes in river biogeochemistry and microbial community composition. Also, the researchers will filter live microbial cells from river and fertilizer waste water and use these cells to inoculate replicated lab incubation chambers that contain different N concentrations. Response variables measured in both field and lab activities include: water chemistry, nitrification and denitrification rate potentials, total bacterial and archaeal community composition, nitrification and denitrification functional gene abundance. This work offers a unique opportunity to better understand how large rivers transport and transform nutrients in the face of altered nutrient inputs and microbial loads, a key gap in our understanding of lotic nutrient cycling. Also, because nitrification and denitrification rates are limited by different environmental factors, the work will provide insight on biological versus geochemical controls over two key processes supporting total N removal from aquatic ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings.<br/><br/><br/>This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also offers solutions to pressing problems on energy, environmental sustainability, and resources that shape our society.  This research program is designed to boost the chemistry community's capacity to address these challenges by transforming the process that creates underlying innovation. The research promotes a shift away from trial-and-error searches and towards rational design.  These combine traditional chemical research with modern data science by introducing tools such as machine learning into the chemical context.  This project enables and advances this emerging field by building a cyberinfrastructure that makes data-driven research a viable and widely accessible proposition for the chemistry community, and thereby an integral part of the chemical enterprise.  Tools and methods developed in this research provide the means for the large-scale exploration of chemical space and for a better understanding of the hidden mechanisms that determine the behavior of complex chemical systems.  These insights can potentially accelerate, streamline, and ultimately transform the chemical development process.  The project also tackles the concomitant need to adapt education to this new research landscape in order to adequately equip the next generation of scientists and engineers, to build a competent and skilled workforce for the cutting-edge R&D of the future, and to ensure the competitiveness of US students in the international job market.  By promoting minority participation in this promising field, it contributes to a sustained push towards equal opportunity in our society.  This project thus promotes the progress of science and advances prosperity and welfare as stated by NSF's mission.<br/><br/>While there is growing agreement on the value of data-driven discovery and rational design, this approach is still far from being a mainstay of everyday research in the chemistry community.  This work addresses three key obstacles: (i) data-driven research is beyond the scope and reach of most chemists due to a lack of available and accessible tools, (ii) many fundamental and practical questions on how to make data science work for chemical research remain unresolved, and (iii) data science is not part of the formal training of chemists, and much of the community thus lacks the necessary experience and expertise to utilize it.  This research centers around the creation of an open, general-purpose software ecosystem that fuses in silico modeling, virtual high-throughput screening, and big data analytics (i.e., the use of machine learning, informatics, and database technology for the validation, mining, and modeling of resulting data sets) into an integrated research infrastructure.  A key consideration is to make this ecosystem as comprehensive, robust, and user-friendly as possible, so that it can readily be employed by interested researchers without the need for extensive expert knowledge.  It also serves as a development platform and testbed for innovation in the underlying methods, algorithms, and protocols, i.e., it allows the community to systematically and efficiently evaluate the utility and performance of different techniques, including new ones that are being introduced as part of this project.  A meta machine learning approach is being developed to establish guidelines and best practices that provide added value to the cyberinfrastructure.  The work is driven by concrete molecular design problems, which serve to demonstrate the efficacy of the overall approach.  The educational challenges that arise from the qualitative novelty of data-driven research and its inherent interdisciplinarity are addressesed by leveraging a new graduate program in Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering for cross-cutting course and curricular developments, the creation of interactive teaching materials, and a skill-building hackathon initiative.  This award is jointly made with the Division of Chemistry's, Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the other hand, modern data analysis is highly adaptive. Large parts of modern machine learning perform model selection as a function of the data by iteratively tuning hyper-parameters, and exploratory data analysis is conducted to suggest hypotheses, which are then validated on the same data sets used to discover them. This kind of adaptivity is often referred to as p-hacking, and blamed in part for the surprising prevalence of non-reproducible science in some empirical fields. This project aims to develop rigorous tools and methodologies to perform statistically valid data analysis in the adaptive setting, drawing on techniques from statistics, information theory, differential privacy, and stable algorithm design. <br/><br/>The technical goals of this project include coming up with: 1) information-theoretic measures that characterize the degree to which a worst-case data analysis can over-fit, given an interaction with a dataset; 2) models for data analysts that move beyond the worst-case setting, and; 3) empirical investigations that bridge the gap between theory and practice. The problem of adaptive data analysis (also called post-selection inference, or selective inference) has attracted attention in both computer science and statistics over the past several years, but from relatively disjoint communities. Part of the aim of this project is to integrate these two lines of work. The team of researchers on this project span departments of computer science, statistics, and biomedical data science. In addition to attempting to unify these two areas, the broader impacts of this research will be to make science more reliable, and reduce the prevalence of ""over-fitting"" and ""false discovery.""

However, the current understanding of the drivers of such changes is limited, making an investigation of overturning in the Sub-polar region a key ocean research priority. This field program explicitly addresses this gap. Furthermore, by engaging the larger international community studying the North Atlantic, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) is playing a key role in catalyzing scientific progress by promoting international collaborations, synthesis, and the sharing of resources and by training future generations. Key to the latter is a network of early career scientists whose professional growth will continue to be facilitated through targeted activities that have been tested and improved during OSNAP's initial phase. Graduate students and post-docs will be trained in seagoing operations and in the processing and analysis of observational data.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this field project, in conjunction with other measurements in the North Atlantic, is to establish determination of the linkage between intermediate and deep water formation and the overturning circulation--a connection that is present in climate models, but has yet to be observed. This project will also provide the first comprehensive view of spreading pathways for the deep waters in the Sub-polar basin. Starting in 2014, the US-led international project, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP), provides a continuous record of the full-water column, trans-basin fluxes of heat, mass and freshwater in the Sub-polar North Atlantic, in partnership with the UK, Netherlands, Canada, Germany and China. Data from the first 21 months of the full OSNAP observing system has been used to produce an initial time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes for the Sub-polar basin. These preliminary results reveal a highly variable overturning in the basin, interior pathways for overflow waters, surprisingly energetic boundary current systems on timescales from days to months, and a strong overflow plume in the Iceland Basin. The additional two years of OSNAP observations will cover a time frame sufficient to make comparisons with other overturning time series and optimize the OSNAP measurement system--all necessary tasks prior to a request for longer term measurements. This component of OSNAP (OSNAP East) is for the eastern array between Greenland and Scotland in coordination with the UK and the Netherlands. The US contribution includes the East Greenland inshore and offshore arrays, the Iceland Basin array, and the integration of all OSNAP measurements. The sub-goal for OSNAP East is to quantify the structure and transport of the boundary currents off the east coast of Greenland and within the Iceland Basin, as well as determine their variability and forcing mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diatoms float in the surface ocean as part of a group of organisms collectively called phytoplankton. There are thousands of different species of diatoms distributed across the global ocean.  A famous oceanographer Henry Bigelow once said ""All fish is diatoms"" reflecting the importance of diatoms as the base of the food chain that supports the world's largest fisheries. Despite their small size, diatom photosynthesis produces 20% of the oxygen on earth each year. That's more than all of the tropical rainforests on land. The major objective of the research is to understand how the metabolic differences among diatom species affects the amount of diatom organic carbon that is carried, or exported, from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. As diatoms are photosynthesizers like green plants, their biological carbon comes from converting carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater from the atmosphere into organic forms.  Diatoms also require a series of other nurtrients supplied by the ocean such as nitrogen and phosphorous and, uniquely for diatoms, the silicon used to construct their glass shells.  This research will investigate how genetic and physiological differences among diatoms influence how each species react to changes in nutrient levels in the ocean and how those shifts affect the export of diatom carbon to the deep sea. The link between diatoms' physiological response and their carbon export comes about because shifts in physiology affect diatom attributes like how fast they sink and how tasty they are to predators. So if we can relate the physiological condition of different diatoms to the food-web pathways followed by different species, we can ultimately use knowledge of diatom physiological status and food web structure to predict how much diatom carbon gets to the deep sea. The research involves investigators with expertise in the physiology and genomics of diatoms and in the ocean's chemistry. The work will initially take place in the subarctic North Pacific in conjunction with the NASA Export Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field program. The EXPORTS program is using a wide variety of methods to quantify the export and fate of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the upper ocean. The research supports the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research will also serve as the basis for activities aimed at K-12 and junior high school students. <br/><br/>The research will broadly impact our understanding of the biology of the biological pump (the transport of photosynthetically fixed organic carbon to the deep sea) by forming a mechanistic basis for predicting the export of diatom carbon. It is hypothesized that the type and degree of diatom physiological stress are vital aspects of ecosystem state that drive export. To test this hypothesis, the genetic composition, rates of nutrient use and growth response of diatom communities will be evaluated and supported with measurements of silicon and iron stress to evaluate stress as a predictor of the path of diatom carbon export. The subarctic N. Pacific ecosystem is characterized as high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) due to low iron (Fe) levels that are primary controllers constraining phytoplankton utilization of other nutrients. It has been a paradigm in low Fe, HNLC systems that diatoms grow at elevated Si:C and Si:N ratios and should be efficiently exported as particles significantly enriched in Si relative to C. However, Fe limitation also alters diatoms species composition and the high Si demand imposed by low Fe can drive HNLC regions to Si limitation or Si/Fe co-limitation. Thus, the degree of Si and/or Fe stress in HNLC waters can all alter diatom taxonomic composition, the elemental composition of diatom cells, and the path cells follow through the food web ultimately altering diatom carbon export.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Auction methods are widely used by governments and private firms. For example, web-based electronic reverse auctions are increasing used as a procurement method by Federal agencies. At the same time, agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of the Treasury use auctions to sell everything from Treasury bills to oil and gas leases. This project will use game theory to find auction rules that will perform well in a wide range of situations. It seeks to develop rules that will work well when bidders place the same value on the auctioned good but have different information about the exact value. The project advances the basic science of auction theory, and will lead to better procedures for public procurement and better methods for generating public funds from the sale of natural resources such as timber, oil, and gas. The methodological component of the project could lead to the development of more efficient online trading platforms. The project therefore benefits the U.S. economy.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is to characterize revenue maximizing auctions when bidders have a common valuation for the good being sold. This research will develop new theories of optimal robust auctions that provide favorable revenue guarantees across different models of bidder beliefs and across different kinds of equilibrium behavior. Existing theories identify optimal auction designs that are highly sensitive to modeling assumptions. This project will develop auction designs that are less sensitive to model misspecification. Besides advancing the theory of optimal auctions, the project will also develop and demonstrate methods for designing mechanisms in models with rich information or potentially complex equilibrium strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Machine-to-machine communications, Internet of Things applications, satellite communications, radar-based sensing, and tactical military communications are just a few of the areas that will benefit from the results of this work. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for use in 802.11ac/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications. 5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity. Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands, where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage, increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta prototypes of two MRA array modules containing the hardware and control algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with WLAN and 5G small-cell modems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flexibility of these rhythmic networks is essential for organisms to alter their behavioral output to meet changing demands. An important aspect of network flexibility is that neurons can rapidly switch their participation between networks. Modulatory inputs that project to rhythmic networks can induce neuronal switching through the release of chemical messengers. These chemical messengers alter network activity through their modulatory actions on the properties of neurons and on the synaptic connections between neurons. Determining how individual modulatory actions combine to elicit switching is a major challenge in the field of neuroscience. Small well-defined networks are instrumental in bridging the gap between cellular-level actions and whole network output. In particular, the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) provides access to all network components as well as modulatory inputs to networks, and enables manipulation of individual neuronal properties and synaptic connections. This proposal uses the STNS to identify fundamental cellular mechanisms by which modulatory inputs switch neuronal participation between rhythmic networks. This includes the use of hybrid biological-computational networks to dissect the contributions of individual modulatory actions. This project also advances scientific discovery and learning for graduate and undergraduate students through training in the research lab of the principal investigator and in advanced lab-based courses. Underrepresented groups continue to be incorporated into the lab's research through partnerships with university and elementary school level STEM minority participation programs.<br/> <br/>Interestingly, neuronal switching can include neurons that switch between single and dual network activity. This switching can result in a single neuron expressing two activity patterns at two different frequencies. There is some evidence that modulatory inputs can elicit switching through their actions on synapses and neuronal properties. However, the complex interplay of electrical coupling, chemical synapses, and neuronal membrane properties has limited research at the network level. An identified modulatory input in the STNS causes a neuron to partially decouple from its electrically coupled partners in one network and simultaneously participate in a second network. The objectives of this proposal are to determine how modulatory actions, individually and collectively, regulate switching between a single and a dual network state. These objectives are achieved using a combination of electrophysiological and computational approaches, including hybrid networks in which biological and model neurons are coupled with the dynamic clamp technique. This project aims to identify novel mechanisms by which modulatory actions enable a neuron to become an active contributor to: 1) rhythm generation for two rhythms simultaneously, despite their occurrence at different frequencies, and 2) coordination among different network neurons. Determining these mechanisms will provide new insights into how electrical and chemical synapses can interact with neuronal membrane properties to regulate participation between networks. Increased understanding of how electrical coupling interacts with other network properties also provides a framework for future biological and computational studies in other rhythmic neural networks including those in larger, less accessible systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This information will help contextualize the observable skeletal variation in apes and inform our inferences about locomotion in fossil apes and humans. The project will involve interdisciplinary and international collaborations, broaden the participation of under-represented groups in STEM, and provide research mentorship to undergraduate students.

While more fossils, and more species, have been added to the hominin family tree, there is still limited knowledge about how closely related species and populations may have differed in terms of habitats and locomotion. Data on the locomotion of living ape populations can advance our understanding of the form-function relationships between locomotor behavior and skeletal features, allowing more informed inferences from the ape and human fossil record. The researchers will investigate how the locomotor behavior of two populations of mountain gorillas differs, in terms of the frequency of key locomotor behaviors and limb and joint motions. The study will use traditional observational methods to quantify the relative frequency of different postural and locomotor behaviors, and place into context the frequency of locomotor behaviors (e.g., vertical climbing and below-branch suspension) in comparison to other great apes. The video-based motion analysis (kinematics) will implement new field-based methods for capturing motion data, providing some of the first 3D kinematic data on apes in their natural environment. Kinematic analysis will quantify the joint postures and movements used during locomotion, offering new quantitative data for interpreting the functional role of skeletal features often used to infer locomotor capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumption of organic material produced by the algae in deeper waters or in sediments consumes oxygen, leading to low-oxygen ""dead zones"" in many places like the northern Gulf of Mexico. This process of nutrient input, algal growth, and loss of oxygen is called eutrophication. Consumption of the organic matter also releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the water, and contributes directly and indirectly to ocean acidification. In order to understand and predict this impact on acidification, it is important to understand how much of the organic matter degradation occurs in the water column versus in the sediments, how variable it is between seasons and years, and how it is affected by processes such as storms that disturb the bottom sediments. In this project, investigators from three institutions along with their graduate and undergraduate students will conduct a combination of field observations and computer modeling to address these questions in the northern Gulf of Mexico. They will share their results with the public through local outreach activities, and with secondary school students in Louisiana through partnerships and curriculum development with local teachers.<br/><br/>The proposed research will use a combined observational and numerical modeling approach to better understand the role of shelf sediment in driving bottom water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH dynamics and acidification at seasonal scales. Past and current studies have not addressed this mechanism. This current lack of knowledge makes it difficult to construct a comprehensive carbon budget for this region. The proposed research will (i) quantify the role of benthic fluxes in DIC production leading to acidification in the bottom water; (ii) determine the importance of the seasonally changing benthic DIC flux in acidifying the bottom water; and (iii) explore the importance of episodic resuspension events in modulating benthic fluxes of DIC. Seasonal sampling will be carried out in Louisiana shelf using state of the art benthic lander platform to record in situ sediment and bottom water oxygen consumption rates, organic matter remineralization rates, sediment oxygen penetration depths, benthic fluxes of DIC and accompanying pH drop. Bottom current velocities and turbidity will also be recorded in conjunction with sediment porewater and water column sampling.

Collaboration with South American colleagues is planned as is extensive student involvement.<br/><br/>This project aims to employ classical dendrochronological techniques to generate new tropical tree-ring chronologies that are annually resolved and absolutely dated. Radiocarbon measurements (14-Carbon) will ensure accurate dating assessments. Thus, successful tree species will be selected to improve the 14-Carbon curve for the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting tree-ring series will be used to reconstruct past climate variability and regional to large--scale atmospheric dynamics for the last several centuries. The specific aims of the project are to improve understanding of: (1) the spatiotemporal variability of the South American summer monsoon (SASM); (2) long-term interactions between El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the SASM; and (3) the impact of volcanic forcing on past hydroclimate of the tropical Andes.<br/><br/>The research aims to provide significant advances in the science of tropical dendrochronology by developing a tree-ring network for the tropical Andes in Peru and Bolivia, a region with exceedingly scarce coverage of high-resolution terrestrial paleo-records. While tree rings have been extensively used in temperate climates, the tropics remain relatively unexplored due to the difficulty, in particular, of identifying consistent wood layers (tree rings) corresponding to seasonal or annual growing periods. The Central Andes are an ideal region for overcoming these difficulties, due to the pronounced precipitation seasonality and diverse forests.<br/><br/>The tropical Andes are a hotspot for biodiversity and its geographic position makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change. It also contains nearly all the tropical glaciers on the globe, and recent, widespread glacial retreat is causing a rapid decline in hydrological reserves.  This decline, in combination with increasing water demand due to population growth and economic expansion poses an enormous challenge for water availability, biodiversity and food security. The complex topography of the Andean Cordillera leads to a climate that is characterized by strong zonal and vertical precipitation gradients. Moisture influx from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon basin is modulated by the SASM and ENSO. The scientific understanding of this variability is challenged by the scarcity of long instrumental observations, which also limits the ability to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections over this region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The purpose of the meeting is to gather mathematicians whose research focuses on the Brauer Group and related areas. The conference will include talks given by both senior and junior researchers as well as time and space for collaboration. The organizers will do their best to ensure that the conference participants represent a diverse spectrum from across the mathematics community. Funds for this meeting will be used to pay for conference facilities and travel for junior participants.<br/><br/>The Brauer Group is a ""group"" in the mathematical sense and researchers from many areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry and topology have related interests in understanding the objects that this group parametrizes.  Low dimensional geometers study the existence of Brauer classes on components of so-called character varieties and their ramification patterns to discern attributes of knot complements. Classical algebraists study the Brauer group in its role as a directory of division algebras over a field. There are many open and difficult questions in this classic view of the Brauer Group; are all division algebras of prime degree cyclic? Do there exist non-crossed product division algebras of prime exponent? Is the n-torsion subgroup generated by the classes of cyclic algebras of degree dividing n? Algebraic geometers study the Brauer group as an important invariant of a scheme arising from tale cohomology. This point of view goes back to the 1960's and Grothendieck, who suggested problems that are still actively being investigated. The primary goal of the 13th Brauer Group Meeting is to bring these perspectives together so that colleagues may share insights on problems of interest involving the Brauer group in its many forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study will investigate the relationships between resource availability and the egg size of bivalve molluscs in modern coastal ecosystems. The PI will compare modern populations with historical populations to determine the rates at which populations have responded to changes in resource availability. In addition, this study aims to increase the diversity of students participating in Earth and ocean sciences through the development of a pipeline for underrepresented minority undergraduates at Franklin and Marshall College that involves early engagement in field and laboratory research and an interdisciplinary outreach program involving junior high school students and teachers in the Gulf Coast.<br/><br/>This study will involve successive years of sampling contemporary and historical bivalve populations along a primary production gradient in the northern Gulf of Mexico with teams of undergraduate students. Isotopic analyses of mollusk shells from contemporary populations in coastal Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida will be used to calibrate the relationships between present-day primary production, sea surface temperature, and larval traits. Contemporary relationships between environmental conditions and life history will be used to investigate environmental correlates of life history variation in the northern Gulf of Mexico over past millennia. This study also will work with existing museum collections to examine the associations between life history traits and environmental gradients over broader spatial scales. This study will include an integrated outreach program in coastal Alabama and Louisiana that engages junior high school students and teachers in reconstructing human-environmental history through the visual arts and the historical lens provided by shells radiocarbon-dated as a part of the planned research activities.

Opioids enable physicians to provide compassionate care to patients suffering from acute or chronic disease and trauma. The need for opioid analgesics is even more salient for surgeons anticipating the post-operative recovery of their patients and planning for end-of-life care. However, opioids are highly addictive medicines, a property that has been exploited for commercial gain by certain players in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of this project will be to deliver a technology that transforms the existing supply chain for opioids by removing the need to grow opium poppy as a drug crop. Instead of sourcing poppy materials from poppy-growing countries, this new technology will allow for complete production of opioids in a secure industrial facility located in the United States where federal agencies can provide oversight and regulation. Additionally, investment in this technology will enable the development of many more existing and experimental medicines derived from plants, including greatly improved opioids with improved efficacy and safety, and cardiovascular and chemotherapeutic therapies that will extend and enhance human lives.   <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will develop a bioprocess for opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To date, the only commercially-competitive method for manufacturing opioids and related alkaloids is to extract these molecules from plants. However, Baker's yeast was recently engineered to biosynthesize opioids, which is a technological advance that could enable opioid production by fermentation. However, many technical hurdles remain in developing a reliable and cost-effective, commercially-viable production system based on existing strains. The objective of this Phase II project is to provide a complete demonstration and pilot-scale operation of an API bioprocess that is ready for industrial scale up. The research employs four approaches: 1) Further development of the engineered yeast strains, 2) scale up of fermentation from laboratory scale to pilot scale, 3) optimization of downstream recovery and purification, and 4) evaluation of the resulting products to establish their validity as drop-in-replacements for existing opioid APIs. The outcome will be a process validated at pilot scale and ready for technology transfer to a secure industrial facility that will make and sell into the opioids API market. This research will replace opium poppies with a modern bioprocess that resembles established, standardized pharmaceutical industry methods for antibiotic and biologic APIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vigorous growth of such clouds is fueled by the convective available potential energy (CAPE) of the atmosphere. Formally CAPE is the amount of work that would be done by the buoyancy force on a saturated plume of air rising through the portion of the atmosphere in which it is lighter than the surrounding air, assuming that no ambient air mixes into the rising plume.  Weather forecasters routinely calculate CAPE from atmospheric temperature soundings and use it to predict the likelihood of severe convective storms.<br/><br/>Computer simulations of greenhouse-gas induced climate change commonly show large increases of CAPE with global mean temperature, a result which has raised concerns that thunderstorms may become more common or intense as a consequence of climate change.  But the reasons why CAPE should increase with global temperature are not clear, and the lack of a theory for the dependence of CAPE on temperature limits confidence in model results.<br/><br/>Under previous funding the PI's group developed a simple model which explains the dependence of CAPE on temperature.  But the theory assumes that the atmosphere is in a state of radiative-convective equilibrium, a state which approximates the condition of the atmosphere over warm tropical oceans.  The theory is compelling as a starting point but cannot be directly applied to understand CAPE change over land or at higher latitudes.  Work under this award thus seeks a more general understanding of the relationship between CAPE and global climate, including the effects of large-scale atmospheric circulation.  <br/><br/>The research is conducted through examination of climate model simulations produced for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, combined with experiments using a cloud resolving model on a limited domain to test hypotheses.  The role of atmospheric circulation is assessed through calculation and analysis of moist mean available potential energy (MAPE), the maximum amount of kinetic energy that can be reversibly produced from the mean state of the atmosphere by transforming to a lower energy reference state. The MAPE analysis seeks to relate the mean state of the atmosphere in middle and high latitudes to its potential to generate CAPE through large-scale circulations.  The impact of land surface conditions on CAPE is another focus of the research, as the strong diurnal cycle of temperature and moisture plays a key role in the development of convection over land. Further work considers the impact of changes in CAPE on the Walker circulation, a large-scale overturning circulation between the western and eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>The work has societal as well as scientific value given the damaging effects of convective storms, including hail, lightning, tornados, and flash floods, along with indications that their intensity or frequency of occurrence may increase due to climate change. Results with practical implications are shared with interested parties through workshops and other venues, and research results are incorporated into classroom teaching and other educational activities.  In addition, the project provides support and training to a graduate student, thereby providing for the future work force in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past studies have shown sub-ice shelf ecosystems to change in response to altered oceanographic processes resulting from ice-shelve retreat. However, information on community changes and ecosystem structure under ice shelves are limited because sub-ice-shelf ecosystems have either been sampled many years after ice-shelf breakout, or have been sampled through small boreholes, yielding extremely limited spatial information. The recent breakout of the A-68 iceberg from the Larsen C ice shelf in the western Weddell Sea provides an opportunity to use a ship-based study to evaluate benthic communities and water column characteristics in an area recently vacated by a large overlying ice shelf. The opportunity will allow spatial assessments at the time of transition from an under ice-shelf environment to one initially exposed to conditions more typical of a coastal Antarctic marine setting. <br/><br/>This RAPID project will help determine the state of a coastal Antarctic ecosystem newly exposed from ice-shelf cover and will aid in understanding of rates of community change during transition. The project will conduct a 10-day field program, allowing contrasts to be made of phytoplankton and seafloor megafaunal communities in areas recently exposed by ice-shelf loss to areas exposed for many decades. The project will be undertaken in a collaborative manner with the South Korean Antarctic Agency, KOPRI, by participating in a cruise in March/May 2018. Combining new information in the area of Larsen C with existing observations after the Larsen A and B ice shelf breakups further to the north, the project is expected to generate a dataset that can elucidate fundamental processes of planktonic and benthic community development in transition from food-poor to food-rich ecosystems. The project will provide field experience to two graduate students, a post-doctoral associate and an undergraduate student. Material from the project will be incorporated into graduate courses and the project will communicate daily work and unfolding events through social media and blogs while they explore this area of the world that is largely underexplored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the program is to provide students with research opportunities that investigate evolutionary change using prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral models. The REU program takes a holistic approach towards training undergraduates and the co-curricular program integrates three modules: Working like a Scientist, Science Communication, and Career Exploration. Working like a Scientist asks the participants to take ownership of their project by formulating hypotheses, planning experiments, analyzing data, and reading primary literature. The Science Communication module provides the participants with the opportunity to speak at group meetings, receive mentoring on preparing an abstract, and present at the Summer Research Symposium. The Career Exploration module consists of presentations by REU mentors on possible career trajectories, and the participants initiating Individual Development Plans.  Participants will use an online IDP program to reflect upon and identify milestones required to achieve potential careers. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that a total of 30 students will be trained over the 3 year period. Students from underrepresented groups, first generation to attend college, and those from colleges with limited research opportunities are encouraged to apply. An underlying goal is for participants to gain the required technical, communication, and goal setting skills that allow them to transition from trainee to apprentice scientist.  Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Applications are accepted online.<br/><br/>A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

For instance, when someone smiles at us or when we learn new information about someone, how does our perception of that person change? Given the everyday relevance of reacting to people, we need a clear understanding of how our brains generate emotional reactions towards others and how these emotions change our perceptions of others. In the past, knowledge of emotional processing in the human brain has largely been derived from behavioral, neuroimaging, and other methods. Though these tools have taught us much, we still do not have precise information about how quickly specific neuronal populations in the brain are activated and coordinated in response to emotion. Indeed, we do not yet fully understand how the human brain responds to emotional versus neutral stimuli. <br/><br/>The researchers, Drs. Parvizi and Gross, will use behavioral, psychophysiological, intracranial EEG (iEEG), and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) in conscious human subjects to test the effects of emotion on brain activity, especially in areas of the brain that selectively respond to emotion and to faces. Along with brain activity, they will also collect cardiac and pupillary activity, and then use DCS of the amygdala to reversibly alter this emotion-generative process. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying emotion generation, and the effects of these affective processes on the human visual perceptual system. Knowledge gained will set the stage for future research to investigate how clinical disorders and circuit-level abnormalities influence emotional processing in the human brain. This collaborative research will also offer unique training opportunities for students and fellows to learn multimodal approaches involving psychophysiology, iEEG, and DCS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced annually around the world.  Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe, renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations, such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide, wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

TBI also represents a critical global health issue with high personal, societal, and economic costs to patients, caregivers, and communities as a whole. Although global health officials have recognized TBI as ""silent epidemic,"" public health approaches have seldom paid attention to the specific cultural and socioeconomic circumstances of this injury. In particular, understandings of life after trauma may vary across cultural contexts, with potentially powerful implications for TBI care within and outside clinical settings. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, asks how TBI patients and their families engage popular and medical framings about injury, and how societal and medical understandings of brain injury are differentially affected by constraints of public care and new perspectives on mind and brain. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations and institutions invested in ameliorating the social and medical costs associated with traumatic brain injury.<br/><br/>In the research supported by this award, doctoral student Livia Garofalo, under the supervision and guidance of Dr. Rebecca Seligman, will investigate how Traumatic Brain Injury is cared for and experienced in a context of high TBI incidence, healthcare shortage, and increased attention towards neurological conditions. Through ethnographic research in public hospitals in the greater Buenos Aires area, the researcher will collect data through participant observation in clinical spaces and semi-structured interviews with patients, caregivers, and medical professionals, and conduct archival and media research. Triangulating this data will provide an assessment of the socioeconomic and political circumstances in which brain injury occurs, as well as the repercussions of neurotrauma at a broader societal level in the Argentine context. Buenos Aires, in particular, provides an apt site to investigate these issues as a large metropolitan area with a high influx of patients, thus providing a model for other dense and highly unequal urban contexts in the United States. Twelve months of ethnographic research will be conducted at two different hospitals with trauma centers, and their surrounding communities. Data will be collected through participant observation, interviews, and case studies and clinical histories, with medical professionals, TBI caregivers and their families, and TBI patients, with appropriate stratification based on age, gender, class, education, and hospital affiliation. Contributing to interdisciplinary conversations between cultural anthropology, science and technology studies, and global health, findings from this research will offer a multi-level anthropological perspective on how TBI incidence is stratified along socioeconomic lines, how emerging notions of ""brain health"" affect the attention towards brain injury, and how access to care is crucial for marginalized individuals and families to rebuild lives after trauma.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Society of Ethnobiology promotes the understanding of past and present relationships between humans and their biological worlds. The theme of the 2018 conference will be Food Security, Sovereignty, & Traditional Knowledge. Bringing these two groups together around this theme will permit the exchange of information and opportunities for resolution of differences that may exist between Western scientific and indigenous knowledge perspectives and create new interdisciplinary collaborations for future research. This  effort is important because having access to indigenous knowledge is critical for ensuring the development of future sustainable foods, pharmaceuticals, and other resources that will benefit all Americans. <br/> <br/>To ensure future food and plant security, researchers from universities, governmental, and non-governmental organizations are working to conserve seeds of crops in germplasm banks. At the same time, indigenous nations are working to protect their food, water, and seeds. Inadequate communication between these two groups risks creating unnecessary barriers and the loss of important information. The conference will provide the opportunity for scholars, practitioners, and advocates to share their understandings of issues that are critical to the wellbeing and survival of people around the world. Conference outcomes will also further social science theories of how different cognitive understanding of the natural world lead to critical differences in human behavior in relation to nature.

It was found in SBIR Phase I that students using the tool improved their test scores both absolutely and relative to their peers. Spanish-speaking students learned more effectively when given native-language educational tools in multiple subjects. Competing educational tools are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. Consequently, more than 40% of non-native speakers drop out. If successful, this project will bring to a wider market an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation?s mission. Moreover, because schools face significant financial pressure to improve student achievement and because the product is competitively priced, it will be shown to be commercially viable, and a plan will be developed to expand the market for the tool outside of the state of California where it was initially studied.<br/><br/><br/>An expanding body of research has shown that language learners perform better on standardized tests when they can transfer their ability in another language (Spanish) to the acquisition of English. However, existing tools have not yet met this market need and focus instead on English-only instruction optimized for students who already speak natively. This project proposes to fully develop and market an existing language-acquisition platform found to be effective during pilot research in a large California school. SBIR Phase II research will address outstanding hypotheses suggested by Phase I results, and determine whether the tool can be easily adopted by stakeholders. Specifically, the impact of assignments chosen by teachers will be disambiguated from the use of the tool more generally, and the impact of English-only versus bilingual scaffolding will be studied in more detail to tailor the product to individual use cases. During Phase II, the product will also be integrated with existing academic systems and analytical software, and competitive per-seat pricing will be developed such that it can be marketed first within California and then nationwide by a network of resellers. A successful product will be measured by its effectiveness in closing the gap between native and non-native English speakers, at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current methods to achieve cellular resolution are invasive (e.g., blood test or tissue biopsy), and non-invasive imaging modalities do not achieve cellular resolution. The principal goal of this Expeditions project is to develop computational imaging systems for non-invasive bio-imaging, deep beneath the skin, and at cellular-level resolutions. This project has the potential to fundamentally impact healthcare and medicine, by enabling live views of cross sections of human anatomy, simply by pointing a camera at any part of the body. This would put individual users at the center of their healthcare experience and make them true partners in their healthcare delivery. The health imaging devices that result from this project will act as an important pillar in the personalized medicine revolution. This research expedition also holds the potential to launch new healthcare paradigms for chronic disease management, pediatrics, low-resource healthcare, and disaster medical care. Beyond healthcare, making progress on the problem of cellular-scale deep-tissue imaging using light will push the frontiers of the fundamental problem of inverse scattering, which impacts numerous areas of science and engineering. The order of magnitude advances made in inverse scattering and imaging through scattering media will have significant cross-cutting applications in diverse areas such as basic science, consumer imaging, automotive navigation, robotics, surveillance, atmospheric science, and material science. Finally, projects with a single, easy-to-appreciate, and high-impact goal have the potential to inspire the next generation of scientists, attract diverse set of students driven by humanitarian and social causes, and become a platform for inclusion and innovation.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate new computational imaging systems, to non-invasively image below the skin at tunable depths, in highly portable form-factors such as wearables or point-of-care devices. The main challenge is that light scatters as it travels through the human body, and in this process, the spatial information from different points within the body gets mixed up. A new concept, Computational Photo-Scatterography (CPS), is being applied in this project in order to computationally unravel the scattered photons in an imaging system, and allow creation of sharp images and accurate inferences. Recognizing that the brute-force complexity of unraveling scattered photons is prohibitively high, the project uses a computational co-design framework that leverages advances by team members from multiple domains: programmable illumination and optics, image sensors, machine learning, inverse graphics, and hybrid analog-digital computing.  The project will use machine learning (ML) instead of physics-based de-scattering to speed up the solution of the underlying inverse problem. A combination of physics-based inverse graphics algorithms, and ML algorithms combining deep learning and generative modeling will be used to estimate tissue scattering parameters -  motion due to blood flow induces time-variation in tissue parameters, which makes solving the inverse scattering problem more difficult. The project will use ML to create fast but approximate estimators, which will serve as accelerators for inverse scattering. The development of new sensors, able to capture the data necessary to reconstruct the structure of the tissue deep below the skin, constitutes the most important contribution of the project. These systems and algorithms will have the potential to break the current resolution limits of noninvasive bio-imaging by nearly two orders of magnitude, enabling cellular-level imaging at depths far beyond currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumption of organic material produced by the algae in deeper waters or in sediments consumes oxygen, leading to low-oxygen ""dead zones"" in many places like the northern Gulf of Mexico. This process of nutrient input, algal growth, and loss of oxygen is called eutrophication. Consumption of the organic matter also releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the water, and contributes directly and indirectly to ocean acidification. In order to understand and predict this impact on acidification, it is important to understand how much of the organic matter degradation occurs in the water column versus in the sediments, how variable it is between seasons and years, and how it is affected by processes such as storms that disturb the bottom sediments. In this project, investigators from three institutions along with their graduate and undergraduate students will conduct a combination of field observations and computer modeling to address these questions in the northern Gulf of Mexico. They will share their results with the public through local outreach activities, and with secondary school students in Louisiana through partnerships and curriculum development with local teachers.<br/><br/>The proposed research will use a combined observational and numerical modeling approach to better understand the role of shelf sediment in driving bottom water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH dynamics and acidification at seasonal scales. Past and current studies have not addressed this mechanism. This current lack of knowledge makes it difficult to construct a comprehensive carbon budget for this region. The proposed research will (i) quantify the role of benthic fluxes in DIC production leading to acidification in the bottom water; (ii) determine the importance of the seasonally changing benthic DIC flux in acidifying the bottom water; and (iii) explore the importance of episodic resuspension events in modulating benthic fluxes of DIC. Seasonal sampling will be carried out in Louisiana shelf using state of the art benthic lander platform to record in situ sediment and bottom water oxygen consumption rates, organic matter remineralization rates, sediment oxygen penetration depths, benthic fluxes of DIC and accompanying pH drop. Bottom current velocities and turbidity will also be recorded in conjunction with sediment porewater and water column sampling. Complementing these detailed near-bed and seabed observations, we will utilize a recently developed coupled hydrodynamics, sediment transport and biogeochemistry model (HydroBioSed) to scale up observed estimates of benthic fluxes to an annual scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current methods to achieve cellular resolution are invasive (e.g., blood test or tissue biopsy), and non-invasive imaging modalities do not achieve cellular resolution. The principal goal of this Expeditions project is to develop computational imaging systems for non-invasive bio-imaging, deep beneath the skin, and at cellular-level resolutions. This project has the potential to fundamentally impact healthcare and medicine, by enabling live views of cross sections of human anatomy, simply by pointing a camera at any part of the body. This would put individual users at the center of their healthcare experience and make them true partners in their healthcare delivery. The health imaging devices that result from this project will act as an important pillar in the personalized medicine revolution. This research expedition also holds the potential to launch new healthcare paradigms for chronic disease management, pediatrics, low-resource healthcare, and disaster medical care. Beyond healthcare, making progress on the problem of cellular-scale deep-tissue imaging using light will push the frontiers of the fundamental problem of inverse scattering, which impacts numerous areas of science and engineering. The order of magnitude advances made in inverse scattering and imaging through scattering media will have significant cross-cutting applications in diverse areas such as basic science, consumer imaging, automotive navigation, robotics, surveillance, atmospheric science, and material science. Finally, projects with a single, easy-to-appreciate, and high-impact goal have the potential to inspire the next generation of scientists, attract diverse set of students driven by humanitarian and social causes, and become a platform for inclusion and innovation.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate new computational imaging systems, to non-invasively image below the skin at tunable depths, in highly portable form-factors such as wearables or point-of-care devices. The main challenge is that light scatters as it travels through the human body, and in this process, the spatial information from different points within the body gets mixed up. A new concept, Computational Photo-Scatterography (CPS), is being applied in this project in order to computationally unravel the scattered photons in an imaging system, and allow creation of sharp images and accurate inferences. Recognizing that the brute-force complexity of unraveling scattered photons is prohibitively high, the project uses a computational co-design framework that leverages advances by team members from multiple domains: programmable illumination and optics, image sensors, machine learning, inverse graphics, and hybrid analog-digital computing.  The project will use machine learning (ML) instead of physics-based de-scattering to speed up the solution of the underlying inverse problem. A combination of physics-based inverse graphics algorithms, and ML algorithms combining deep learning and generative modeling will be used to estimate tissue scattering parameters -  motion due to blood flow induces time-variation in tissue parameters, which makes solving the inverse scattering problem more difficult. The project will use ML to create fast but approximate estimators, which will serve as accelerators for inverse scattering. The development of new sensors, able to capture the data necessary to reconstruct the structure of the tissue deep below the skin, constitutes the most important contribution of the project. These systems and algorithms will have the potential to break the current resolution limits of noninvasive bio-imaging by nearly two orders of magnitude, enabling cellular-level imaging at depths far beyond currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With a growing EV market, the mass penetration of EVs into the utility grid will result in detrimental effects due to coincidence between utility peak power loading and EV charging. This impact will include increased peak loading and voltage drops that will call for over-investments in the network resulting in an overall high cost for the society. Therefore, advanced and practical interaction methods between vehicles, charging stations, and the utility grid need to be developed. Internet-inspired EV charge control offers a new paradigm-shift for EV charge control studies. This  project aims to build a new  autonomous and fair EV charge control technique that can penetrate into practice at large scales. The significance of the proposed idea lies in the effort to bring together a cyber-physical system that utilizes the prior art in end-to-end internet network congestion control with decentralized autonomous EV charging. The effort is inter-disciplinary and brings together ideas from computer science as well as power engineering to support mass integration of EVs into the conventional electric energy system. The proposed idea can impact the way all grid-connected power electronics systems are controlled. The algorithms developed in this work can be used to accelerate the integration of low-carbon energy sources such as solar photovoltaic systems.     <br/><br/>The proposed research develops a new family of EV charging algorithms by adopting some of the well-deployed end-to-end congestion control techniques in the Internet.

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As photosynthetic organisms, phytoplankton directly take up dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to synthesize their tissues using energy from the sun.  In addition to carbon (C), essential nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) are required by these primary producers.  While dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) is the preferred form of P because it is a small enough molecule that phytoplankton can directly absorb it, in the sunlit surface waters of the ocean the concentration of DIP can be drawn down to limiting levels.  In this situation, the larger dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) molecules can become available through enzyme hydrolysis reactions, which convert DOP to DIP.  There was mounting evidence that DOP can play a crucial role in supporting primary production in the ocean, yet very little is known about the nature of the DOP pool.  There are many analytical impediments to gaining information about the chemical structure and composition of DOP, and without knowledge of its composition there is no basis for evaluating the potential bioavailability of DOP to primary producers. The proposed work will employ a unique combination of methods to gain novel insight into the composition and bioavailability of DOP.  Field and laboratory (culture) nutrient addition incubation experiments will target the drivers of DOP variability, information crucial to resolving models of primary production in the ocean. Results of this work will be transformative for understanding DOP composition, DOP variability in space and time, and microbial control on the nature of the marine DOP pool.  <br/><br/>This proposal will support a postdoctoral scholar, two undergraduate students and two undergraduate students. Recruitment of undergraduate students will focus on entraining Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, through SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science)and related venues. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international meetings.  We also propose to conduct outreach to middle schools, including bringing The Artistic Oceanographer Program, an interactive inquiry-based program targeting middle school age science and art standards by integrating concepts in ocean science literacy with art, to local middle schools in New York and Hawaii.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed work will provide foundational information on the way DOP molecular characteristics translate into P-bioavailability to marine microorganisms, and in turn how microorganisms growing under different dissolved inorganic nitrogen: dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIN:DIP) impact the composition and bioavailability of DOP.  A newly developed sequential ultrafiltration (SUF) method will be applied to samples collected along a natural P-gradient in the western North Atlantic. The SUF method quantitatively segregates and concentrates DOP into 4 molecular weight size classes, which can be subjected to bioavailability assays using phosphohydrolytic enzymes, and to liquid chromotography-mass spectrometry to provide detailed compositional information.  Using these combined methods we will probe in situ DOP, the evolution of in situ DOP during shipboard incubations under different DIN:DIP, and the composition and bioavailability of DOP produced by organisms isolated from key stations along the natural phosphate gradient.  Contrast of in situ patterns to those developed in controlled culture experiments using field isolates will be achieved by identifying cellular shifts in organic phosphorus biosynthesis pathways, and tracing how such shifts impact DOP composition.  The combined methodological approach will provide unparalleled insight into DOP composition and bioavailability, addressing this major knowledge gap.  Results of this work will be transformative for understanding DOP composition, DOP variability in space and time, and microbial control on the nature of the marine DOP pool.  Such information is a prerequisite to building ecosystem models that capture the influence of P biogeochemistry on primary production and carbon cycling in aquatic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be the first time the iConference is held in England, and only the second time in Europe.  Since 2005, the iConferences have provided a forum where information scholars, researchers and professionals from around the world gather to share insights on critical information issues in contemporary society.  An openness to new ideas and research fields in information science is a primary characteristics of these events, which have been successful in bringing together people who otherwise might rarely interact with one another, thereby helping to promote interdisciplinary research.  Recent iConferences have drawn approximately 500 attendees, a testament to participants' appreciation for the inspiring sense of community, high quality research presentations, and myriad opportunities for engagement. The iConferences are presented by the iCaucus, now a consortium of 78 Information Schools in the United States and abroad (along with 8 associate members) dedicated to advancing the information field and preparing students to meet the information challenges of the 21st Century.  This year's theme is ""Transforming Digital Worlds""; more information may be found online at http://ischools.org/the-iconference.  The iConference doctoral colloquia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers focused on the interplay of information and technology in a social context, allowing them to develop a network both among themselves and with senior researchers. Participation is encouraged from a broad range of relevant disciplines, thereby expanding attendees' perspectives on their topics of study and promoting advancement of the field.  Due to timing constraints, the student participants in the 2018 event have already been selected.  The organizers worked proactively to maximize diversity along such key dimensions as institution type, research topic, methodological approach, disciplinary tradition, gender, ethnicity, and national or cultural background, so that the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.  Of the 18 students accepted in total, 7 are women; 6 are studying in the UK, 5 in the US, 3 in Canada and 1 each in Germany, Israel, Nigeria and South Africa (2 of the UK-based students are originally from African countries).<br/><br/>The 2018 Doctoral Colloquium will be tightly integrated into the conference experience, starting with an orientation event highlighting specific content during the technical program, and culminating in a full day focused on peer-research critique and career development which will overlap with and immediately follow the closing session of the conference technical program on March 28.  The primary objective of the Doctoral Colloquium is to help train the next generation of information science researchers. To this end, it will provide the student participants with an environment in which they can share and discuss their goals, methods and results in order to gain feedback on their work both from the mentors and from other students, which should allow them to enhance their research.  The student participants will come away with a better understanding of the various research communities engaged in the study of information science, and learn how to position their work within the field.  In addition, the colloquium will provide students with opportunities such as poster sessions to make new professional connections beyond their own disciplines and institutions, and it will also help them successfully launch their careers whether in industry or academia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particular area of interest is the rate of exchange of gases such as carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide, which play important roles in Earth's climate. Understanding and modeling air-sea exchange on a global scale requires understanding of how gas exchange rates vary in response to a number of factors such as temperature, wind speed, and the presence of surface chemical films (known as surfactants) in the ocean. Over the past 25 years, major advances have been made in understanding air-sea gas exchange in the open ocean, mainly due to improvements in methodologyand a number of successful process studies. However, some important questions remain, such as what happens near coastal areas (including inland seas), and how surfactants affect gas exchange. The Baltic Sea Gas Exchange Experiment (Baltic GasEx) is a collaboration between scientists from the US and Germany designed to address these questions. Participants in Baltic GasEx will measure the air-sea gas exchange rates with different techniques in the Baltic Sea before and after the spring bloom, when concentrations and compositions of surfactants will be different. The expeditions will be conducted on a German ship (Alkor), with the ultimate goal of quantifying the relationship between wind speed and gas exchange in an inland sea, and understanding the impact of surfactants on air-sea gas exchange. The project will involve significant international collaboration, public education and outreach through both participating U.S. institutions, and substantial student training in partnership with the international collaborators.<br/><br/>NSF funding will support helium-3 and sulfur hexafluoride measurements during Baltic GasEx to determine the gas exchange rate. German colleagues are independently funded to quantify surfactants with AC voltammetry, surface tension, and sum frequency generation; to determine chemical characteristics of the micro layer; and to estimate the gas exchange rate using eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2 and DMS. The proposed experiment is designed to address the question of whether open ocean wind speed/gas exchange parameterizations can be applied to inland seas like the Baltic. Also, the effect of surfactants on gas exchange has been studied extensively in the laboratory, but there is little direct field evidence for the effect of surfactants on gas exchange. The proposed experiment, with expeditions at times with both high and low surfactant concentrations, should shed new light on the effect of natural surfactants on gas exchange. Finally, some wind speed/gas exchange parameterizations proposed for the Baltic Sea appear to be higher than typical open ocean parameterizations. These are typically based on eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2. However, in open ocean experiments where both the helium-3/sulfur hexafluoride approach and eddy covariance of CO2 have been deployed, there seems to be a discrepancy between gas transfer velocities measured with the two techniques. This experiment should show whether a similar difference in gas transfer velocities measured via these two techniques also exists in the Baltic Sea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the origins of these cooperative abilities are a puzzle. Other species do not seem to engage in similar behaviors--indeed, humans have been characterized as a hyper-cooperative primate. One way to address why humans show these cooperative patterns is to examine how young children acquire these skills. Are young children initially selfish, and must be taught to become altruistic? Or do humans have a biological predisposition for altruism that even children exhibit? How do children learn to share a common resource and acquire ideas about fairness? With support of a NSF CAREER award, Dr. Felix Warneken (Harvard University) will conduct a comprehensive developmental study of children's cooperative behaviors. <br/><br/>This research aims to investigate the fundamental psychological processes that enable young children to cooperate with others. How do children detect that another person is in need? Under what circumstances are they motivated to help? By using experimental studies of young children, this research can address important questions about the interplay of biological predispositions found early in development and the socialization practices that influence the further development of these behaviors. In particular, the research will investigate when social expectations and norms that characterize cooperative behaviors in adults begin to play a role in child development. For example, adults often expect others to reciprocate favors and have norms about what constitutes a fair share of a valuable resource. Therefore, this research is to determine when during development children begin to attend to these norms when they cooperate with others. By integrating insights from evolutionary theory, social psychology, and child development, this project provides a comprehensive study of the skill-set for cooperation that children acquire across development. In addition, this research program will provide a wide range of training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in developmental psychology, including active participation of students in research, and a summer internship program with stipends for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. It will also educate the broader public about psychological research through freely available educational material about the research projects for classroom instructors and the greater public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Composites are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity, increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy. Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites. This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing equally fast, if not faster. <br/><br/>This project will solve a problem that has plagued the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production. In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike ""regular matter"", Dark Energy seems to act against gravity and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. This is very confusing, and to explain it, we may have to re-write particle physics or perhaps even the laws of gravity. The best way to answer the question ""What is Dark Energy?"" is to measure the expansion of the Universe farther back in time. <br/><br/>Recently astronomers realized that radio telescopes have the potential to make this measurement better than any other type of telescope. This has never been attempted before, and we are now building telescopes to achieve this goal. However, to be successful we need to understand the telescope ""beam"" (like a beam of light, a telescope points at one place and focuses there, and we must know what that beam looks like on the sky). For this CAREER grant, the PI is building radio sources to put on quadcopter drones to fly above the telescope. Using the radio telescope data, the location of the drone (with special position sensors), and some new analysis techniques, we will make a map of our telescope beam. The end result will be an important measurement that helps us understand Dark Energy better. <br/><br/>The accelerated expansion of the Universe was discovered from supernova measurements in 1998 and no fundamental theories for this acceleration have yet been experimentally verified. As a result, cosmologists inserted a new component (""Dark Energy"") into our cosmological models, but the underlying theories to explain the accelerated expansion involve either (i) a modification to General Relativity or (ii) a new particle which would predict a unique time dependence of the expansion rate. Either would revolutionize our current models of fundamental theories of physics. To answer these questions we must measure the expansion history of the Universe across the past 11 billion years and pin down the influence of Dark Energy on the expansion. The most promising path for this comes from measurements of galaxies (measuring > 100, 000 galaxies across a wide swath of the sky). Unfortunately, current and next-generation optical galaxy surveys are restricted in how far back in time they can see due to limitations in detector technology. <br/><br/>Radio telescopes do not have these limitations, and offer a promising solution to make radio surveys of galaxies across most of cosmic time. This measurement has never been attempted before and we are now building radio telescopes designed to achieve this goal. However, we already know that to be successful we must understand our telescope characteristics extremely well, in particular the telescope ""beam"" (like a beam of light, a telescope points at one place and focuses there, and we must know what that beam looks like on the sky). For this CAREER grant, the PI is developing a beam mapper using a quadcopter drone. The PI's team will fly a radio source on the drone above the telescopes and use the radio data and drone position to make a map of the beam. This requires developing a stabilized noise source to be flown on the drone, improved sensors for better drone position accuracy, and new analysis techniques - particularly a mathematical transformation to use measurements made near the dish and infer what they look like on the sky. The end result will be an important measurement for cosmology radio telescopes and a beam mapping technique that is demonstrated to work at the high precision required for Dark Energy science goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, TC prediction models and global weather prediction models are expected to merge in a near future. Turbulent mixing in the ocean surface layer under TCs effectively couples the ocean and atmosphere through air-sea exchanges of heat and momentum. This air-sea coupling is modulated by ocean surface waves (sea states) that are particularly complex and varied under TC conditions. Surface waves affect both one-dimensional (vertical mixing/diffusion), and three-dimensional  (upwelling and horizontal advection) processes in the upper ocean. The focus of this study is to advance ocean turbulent mixing schemes that explicitly include the impact of surface waves. Although similar efforts are underway in modeling centers worldwide, few of such efforts include extreme (TC) conditions. Results from this study will inform on the leading order impacts from surface waves on upper ocean processes in high wind conditions, on the benefits of coupling wave and ocean models, and on optimal approaches to implementing wave-dependent parameterizations. The proposed effort is timely and will immediately benefit both the regional and global weather and climate modeling communities. The results of the research will be integrated into the Hurricanes: Science and Society website that is currently used by tens of thousands of educators and students as well as the general public. In addition to their technical training, the graduate students will receive training from education and outreach professionals on how to translate complex scientific concepts into non-expert language.<br/><br/>This collaborative study will be carried out by combining state-of-the-art modeling and observational data obtained in previous field programs. Specifically, upper ocean responses to several historical Tropical Cyclones will be simulated using a coupled ocean-wave model that includes sea-state dependent Langmuir turbulence parameterizations and other significant surface wave impacts (the Stokes advection, the Coriolis Stokes force, the Stokes shear force, and the air-sea momentum flux budget). First, the model results will be used to constrain the wind stress and the drag coefficient. Next, the model results, with and without the wave effects, will be compared with observational data, including mixed layer temperature, current, and turbulence data. This investigation will clarify whether the Langmuir turbulence and other surface wave effects make leading order impacts on upper ocean responses to Tropical Cyclones, and whether their accurate prediction requires a fully coupled ocean-wave model with sea-state dependent parameterizations. This study will be conducted in close collaboration with NOAA/Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory scientists and will contribute to the NOAA research and coupled atmosphere-ocean model development involving the role of upper ocean mixing on climate and weather prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, epithelial cells generate ""inside"" and ""outside"" barriers and embryonic cell polarity is required for cells to make important decisions on what they are going to give rise to in adult forms.  Recent work has shown that many of the same molecules are used in both epithelial and embryonic cell polarity.  This grant uses both comparative and functional genomics in animals with simple body plans to discover how these molecules are deployed to give rise to normal functioning tissues.  By inhibiting their normal molecular interactions these findings will have important implications for how normal adult organs function (e.g. gut, heart, lung) and how disruptions/mutations in these processes give rise to birth defects.  The research plan has other broader impacts such as demonstrating that many different kinds of animals and techniques are useful for understanding how life ""works"" and that local community members, including over 5,000 K-12 STEM students per year, will be exposed to the value of the maintaining coastal marine environments surrounding the Whitney Lab for Marine Bioscience that provide homes for the animals utilized for this research.<br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that fundamental changes in the spatial deployment and interactions of molecules underlying both cellular and tissue polarity were essential for animal organ and body plan evolution. Recent discoveries showing crucial differences in the deployment of Par, cWnt, and PCP Wnt signaling pathways in embryos of the cnidarian Nematostellla vectensis relative to bilaterian species suggest that the site of gastrulation (endomesoderm formation), changed from the animal pole in ctenophores and cnidarians (i.e. ""prebilaterians"") to the vegetal pole in bilaterians.  Furthermore, changes in the gene regulatory network that give rise to the trifunctional endomesoderm in cnidarians were responsible for the formation of distinct endodermal and mesodermal tissue types.  Comparative and forward functional genomic approaches (including transgenesis, mRNA misexpression and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing) utilizing embryos of the acoel flatworm Hofstenia miamia (a member of the earliest branching clade of triploblastic bilaterians), and the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (a metazoan clade predating the origin of cnidarians + bilaterians), both available year round at the Whitney Marine Lab, will be used to determine the sequence of molecular changes responsible for bilaterian evolutionary innovations. These studies will determine the integration between cell signaling, the cytoskeleton, and cell adhesion systems in the regulation of cell polarity during the developmental process of these two species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early language development in turn depends on linguistic interactions with adults. Increasingly, researchers are using daylong audio recordings to study child language development and child-caregiver interactions. Compared to short language samples, daylong recordings capture the full range of experiences a child has over the course of a day. Daylong audio recordings are also being used in applied settings. For example, studies show that by the time they enter First Grade, children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds hear tens of millions more words than children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, perpetuating social inequalities. Multiple large-scale intervention projects targeting low socioeconomic households, including the Thirty Million Words Initiative in Chicago and the Providence Talks program, are using daylong audio recordings to provide automated, personalized feedback to parents on when and how often their child hears adult words and experiences conversational turns. The features of daylong recordings that are advantageous for researchers and practitioners also pose unique challenges. For one, their long durations are ideal for studying the temporal dynamics of child-adult interaction, but taking advantage of the long durations requires the enlistment of automated speech recognition technology. Current automatic speech recognition systems have difficulties with child speech and are challenged by the noisy and varied acoustic environments represented in the recordings. Another challenge is that the recordings capture private moments that require long hours of human listening to remove. This makes it difficult for researchers to share the recordings publicly, so that the potential value of the recordings collected by individual research labs is not fully realized.<br/><br/>This project will create a new resource, called HomeBank, that will have three key components: (1) a public dataset containing daylong audio recordings that have had private information removed by human listeners, (2) a larger dataset containing about ten to one hundred times as many hours of recording that have not had private information removed and will be free but restricted to those who have demonstrated training in human research ethics, and (3) an open-source repository of computer programs to automatically analyze the daylong audio recordings. HomeBank will take advantage of an existing cyberinfrastructure for sharing linguistic data called TalkBank. The daylong audio recordings included in the datasets will represent both typically developing and clinical groups, a range of ages from newborn infants to school age children, and a range of language and socioeconomic backgrounds. We expect the primary users to be basic and applied child development researchers as well as engineers developing automatic speech recognition technologies. The free-to-access database and the open source computer programs will ultimately improve both the data on which early interventions are based and the tools available for providing parents with feedback on the linguistic input they provide their children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop is named in honor of Carl-Gustaf Rossby, an early pioneer of atmospheric science and department chair at the University of Chicago.<br/><br/>Advances in computing technology have enabled development of comprehensive climate models which use high resolution and include sophisticated representations of a large number of climate processes.  Such models can achieve a high degree of realism but only at the expense of great complexity, which limits their use for understanding climate system behaviors. Simple models are of course easier to understand, but such models can fundamentally misrepresent the system if they are simplified in ways that remove or disable key processes.  The task of choosing or developing models at the right level of complexity, or at appropriately varying levels of complexity, is thus a key challenge in climate research.  Climate scientists grapple with this challenge on a daily basis, yet it is not systematically addressed in the standard graduate school curriculum. <br/><br/>This workshop gives students an opportunity to learn modeling strategies involving simple and intermediate complexity models, choosing configurations appropriate for specific problems and applications.  The workshop is conducted through a combination of classroom lectures showcasing classical models and configurations that have led to important insights into the climate system, and hands-on research in a small group setting.  The workshop has intellectual merit as it addresses the important question of how one uses a model to arrive at understanding.

These sites reflect not only a record of subsistence, but contain valuable information about the past environment and how people interacted with it and each other. Due to the difficulty in excavating and transporting large amounts of shell, invertebrates are typically not included in zooarchaeological analysis which results in a lack of comparative data on the composition of vertebrates and invertebrates in shell matrix sites. This interdisciplinary research combines zooarchaeology and stable isotope geochemistry to understand the role of shellfish in the processes and practices that led to the formation of shell ring sites on the coastal southeastern US. As a prominent component of shell rings, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) will be the focus of a season of capture study that uses modern environmental data as a proxy for past environmental conditions. Further, understanding use patterns of oysters in the past has important implications for the management and conservation of the species today. Given the decline in oyster populations world-wide, archaeology is uniquely situated to provide a long-term, historical perspective on the human impact on the coast and the health and sustainability of its important resources. Results of this research will be shared globally, including a web-based guide outlining preparation techniques for geochemical analysis of oysters, implications of the findings for estuarine health, and value for archaeological research. Undergraduate student participants in the project will gain laboratory experience and training in zooarchaeological methods and stable isotope analysis.<br/><br/>Shell rings are a class of shell-matrix site in which form and function have been variously theorized as the products of either habitation, ceremonial practice or a combination of the two. Central to these theories is seasonality, wherein ceremonial sites would likely demonstrate seasonal use when compared to year-round habitation sites. Faunal remains are typically used to address the seasonal nature of these sites, however invertebrate remains are rarely included in analysis, limiting our understanding of combined vertebrate and invertebrate faunal use patterns. Under the direction of Dr. Susan deFrance, Co-PI Nicole Cannarozzi will investigate the differential formation and use of two Late Archaic Period Shell rings located on St. Catherines Island, Georgia by comparing the stable isotopic composition of the carbonate in modern and archaeological oysters from these sites. Over a two-year period, the Co-PI collected oysters and water samples from St. Catherines Island and measured water temperature and salinity. These data will be coupled with a comprehensive zooarchaeological analysis of vertebrates and invertebrates from column samples taken from various contexts within the two sites to understand faunal use, settlement patterns and depositional practices. This study highlights the value of interdisciplinary research in archaeology and will clarify our understanding of the timing of formation of shell matrix sites, faunal resource use and seasonal settlement and mobility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerical models of tsunami generation and propagations are used in support of warning systems and for the creation of inundation maps for hazard assessment. Tsunamis can be attributed to seismic (i.e., earthquakes and submarine landslides) or non-seismic sources (i.e., volcanic eruptions). The latter are prevalent in some areas around the world (e.g., Aleutian arc for US West Coast).  Our understanding of tsunami generation from mechanisms such as earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic collapse, has largely resulted from devastating events (e.g., Papua New Guinea, 1998; Indian Ocean, 2004; Japan, 2011), which combined have caused over 300,000 fatalities and US $30B of damage.  Due to lack of a major recent event, eruption generated tsunamis (the focus of this study) remain largely under-studied. In this multi-disciplinary study, the US/UK team will perform collaborative field and modeling research, to improve our understanding of tsunamis generated by volcanic eruptions, especially those from large-volume, caldera-forming events close to the sea, which are among the most devastating geohazards. Work will focus on the 1883 Krakatau eruption-generated tsunami, which caused over 33,000 fatalities in Indonesia. Although this eruption was well studied, there is still controversy over the tsunami generation mechanism and, since 1883, apart from a surge of interest during its 100-year anniversary, there has been little new data, which would be a basis for a major project on the event. The new understanding/modeling resulting from this project will improve tsunami hazard assessment and warning from such sources, and could improve operational tsunami hazard assessment and inundation mapping work as tsunami warning systems for non-seismic sources with significant implication in population safety. Project results will be disseminated to the scientific and broader communities at professional conferences, in peer-reviewed journals, by building an extensive website (with project metadata, news, podcasts/videos, and auxiliary information), and through the visualization of scientific data (targeting a K-12 audience). A workshop will be organized in Indonesia at the outset to engage local people and scientists (support from Newton funds is being sought). There will be active collaboration with colleagues at Greek/Caribbean/Mediterranean-based institutions/organizations, facing similar eruption-tsunami risks.<br/><br/>As a large-volume, caldera-forming event Krakatau is representative of similar other well studied historical events (e.g., 3500BP Santorini and 7500BP Kikai), and includes diverse tsunami generating mechanisms: pyroclastic density current (PDC) discharges into the sea, caldera collapse, and explosions. It also has an exceptional eruption and tsunami record from observations at the time. The objectives of the study are to: 1) apply improved numerical models of tsunamis from volcanic eruption mechanisms (including seafloor deposits), mainly PDC and caldera collapse; 2) perform new field surveys of on land tsunami sediment deposits, to discriminate individual tsunami events and their impact; 3) perform new PDC field surveys, complementing a pilot offshore seismic database showing that individual PDC flows can be identified and mapped, and their runouts and volumes estimated; 4) use these estimates to understand physical properties of PDCs as they enter the sea; and 5) use the new data (sediment, PDC) as a basis for applying the new numerical tsunami models. Tsunami simulations will be carried out iteratively by comparing model outputs (inundation limits, runups; PDC deposits/runouts) with historical documentation of impacted areas along the coasts of Sumatra and Java, and both old and newly acquired PDC and sediment deposit field survey data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are bicycles with a small battery-powered electric motor to assist the rider. Over 150 million e-bikes have been sold in Europe and Asia in the past ten years--in China's case, truly transformative transportation. This is the world's largest adoption of an alternative fuel vehicle. E-bikes are becoming more important in North America. However, there is little empirical evidence on the behavior of e-bike users and environmental sustainability impacts. The investigator team will refine and deploy a research study, using a combination of emerging hardware and software capabilities, to collect behavioral data from e-bike riders. The collected data will then be used to evaluate how large shifts in e-bike use will affect sustainability. The research in this GOALI project is enabled by an industry partner (Bosch). <br/><br/>The first objective of this research is to refine an instrumentation system (physical hardware and a mobile device application) tailored for e-bike users. This system includes a mix of onboard hardware and smartphone software to collect a host of data on energy and other vehicle telematics. The data collected by the instrumentation and mobile application will be sent to a platform with little to no input required by the user. Using that data, the second objective is to assess the riding behavior of e-bike users and the performance of e-bikes in meeting travel needs. The research team will conduct an empirical study, starting with at least 150-200 participants for one year. This collaboration with industry partners will collect vehicle telematics and rider behavior metrics with an aim toward modeling net travel changes between modes (mode shift and vehicle kilometers traveled). This objective will identify how e-bike use behaviors differ from relatively well known incumbent modes. The third objective is to investigate the life-cycle environmental impacts of e-bike ownership and use, relying on the Department of Energy's GREET LCA model. Coupling the behavioral models with LCA models will provide a methodologically novel assessment of the impact of this new mode. This study will inform local and state policy and planning efforts related to the growth of e-bikes and their influence on environmental policy goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs are on the rise: the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that occupations in these sectors will grow by 8.9 % from 2014 to 2024. Yet the U.S. currently faces a critical shortage of workers and students who are proficient in math and science subjects. In part, this shortage is due to a lack of interest in STEM-related fields by minorities and women. Engaging, relevant and hands on experiences are needed to encourage interest amongst these populations. This project fulfills the requests of the federal government and leading-edge STEM educators that both secondary and post-secondary institutions teach science in a way that engages students with real-world problems. The expectation is that this project will make big data accessible, while providing rewarding and appealing hands-on learning opportunities that will increase data literacy; increase scientific collaboration in education across geographic and interdisciplinary lines; and increase scientific literacy and interest across demographics, thus increasing the likelihood that students will continue to pursue scientific careers.<br/><br/>The proposed technology will be the first collaborative educational IoT STEM platform to be developed, and is innovative in the field of Educational Technology, which has yet to adopt web-connected sensors that generate big data on a global scale. At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data/curriculum.

Recent advances in multimodal learning analytics are creating novel opportunities for expanding the range and richness of measures of visitor engagement in free-choice settings. In particular, multimodal learning analytics offer significant potential for integrating multiple data sources to devise a composite picture of visitors' cognitive, affective, and behavioral engagement. The project will center on providing a rich empirical account of meaningful visitor engagement with interactive tabletop science exhibits among individual visitors and small groups, as well as uncovering broader tidal patterns in visitor engagement that unfold across exhibit spaces. A key objective of the project is creating models and practitioner-focused learning analytic tools that will inform the best practices of exhibit designers and museum educators. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program.  As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, AISL funds research and innovative approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings.<br/><br/>The research team will conduct data-rich investigations of visitors' learning experiences with multimodal learning analytics that fuse the rich multichannel data streams produced by fully-instrumented exhibit spaces with the data-driven modeling functionalities afforded by recent advances in machine learning and educational data mining. The research team will conduct a series of visitor studies of naturalistic engagement in solo, dyad, and group interactions as visitors explore interactive tabletop science exhibits. The studies will utilize eye trackers to capture visitors' moment-to-moment attention, facial expression analysis and quantitative field observations to track visitors' emotional states, trace logs generated by exhibit software, as well as motion-tracking sensors and coded video recordings to capture visitors' behavioral interactions. The studies will also use conversation recordings and pre-post assessment measures to capture visitors' science understanding and inquiry processes. With these multimodal data streams as training data, the research team will use probabilistic and neural machine learning techniques to devise learning analytic models of visitor engagement. <br/><br/>The project will be conducted by a partnership between North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. The research team will 1) design a data-rich multimodal visitor study methodology, 2) create the Visitor Informatics Platform, a suite of open source software tools for multimodal visitor analytics, and 3) launch the Multimodal Visitor Data Warehouse, a curated visitor experience data archive. Together, the multimodal visitor study methodology, the Visitor Informatics Platform, and the Multimodal Visitor Data Warehouse will enable researchers and practitioners in the informal science education community to utilize multimodal learning analytics in their own informal learning environments. It is anticipated that the project will advance the field of informal STEM learning by extending and enriching measures of meaningful visitor engagement, expanding the evidence base for visitor experience design principles, and providing learning analytic tools to support museum educators. By enhancing understanding of the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dynamics underlying visitor experiences in science museums, informal science educators will be well-positioned to design learning experiences that are more effective and engaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past three decades, the basic building blocks of computer chips have shrunk to nanometer dimensions, or about 1000 times smaller than a human hair. In this size range, nanostructures exhibit new properties and behaviors that are not observed in their bulk counterparts.  The appearance of new nanomaterials that change their shape when exposed to light have the potential to impact many different technologies. However, watching a single particle change its shape in the laboratory presents unique challenges, since the time needed to switch from one form to the other is exceedingly short and cannot be captured by the fastest camera. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Renske M. Van der Veen at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is building a microscope that uses very short bursts of electrons (less than a millionth of a millionth of a second) to watch as a single nanostructure change its shape in response to light.  Professor Van der Veen and her students are using this microscope to gain fundamental insight into the cascade of switching events that occur in metal-organic nanomaterials after light excitation. The results from this work could impact technologies ranging from data storage to optical switches in telecommunication, and thus could have significant benefit to society. As part of this CARRER project, Professor Van der Veen is developing new educational activities that will train the next generation of scientists in this emerging experimental methodology.<br/><br/>Room temperature photoswitching is highly desired for realistic applications in functional devices. This project is advancing our understanding of first-order thermal phase transitions with cooperative hysteresis phenomena that occur around room temperature.

The project's focus is on iron- and iron-cobalt spin-crossover coordination polymers of different dimensionality, which undergo a rearrangement of electrons in their lowest d-orbitals upon light excitation. Transient absorption spectroscopy, ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy at synchrotron facilities, and a newly developed ultrafast electron microscope are used to investigate the interplay between structural and electronic degrees of freedom after photoexcitation. The project is also studying the mechanisms, time scales and efficiencies pertinent to cooperative photoswitching.

The December 9-21, 2018 school in Kampala, Uganda on ""Materials for Sustainable Energy"" will enable participants to explore shared scientific challenges and to help co-generate new knowledge and innovative solutions with colleagues who bring different national, cultural and institutional perspectives. World-renowned experts drawn from the United States, Africa and Europe will teach courses and provide opportunities for hands-on learning. The Institute promises to strengthen the capacity of the African Materials Science community by providing short-term graduate level training of African students and researchers by some of the world's top scientists during a two-week school. It benefits U.S. participants because it immerses them in a rich, transcontinental network of collaborators from Africa and Europe.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: Motivated by the need to develop and sustain positive international scientific relationships between the United States and African scientific communities, JUAMI employs a unique format to address four primary concerns: the creation of new knowledge and innovative solutions through cross-cultural collaborations, the need for U.S. graduate students and faculty to be engaged in international research collaborations and networks, the value to the United States of remaining a desired collaboration partner for African counterparts, and the need for graduate level training in materials science in Africa. This two-week school, which follows on earlier such schools, focuses on ""Materials for Sustainable Energy"", a topic at the frontier of materials research, with lectures offered by world-renowned experts recruited both internationally and locally. The curriculum includes directed hands-on activities, lectures, and the preparation/presentation of group proposals that give rise to ongoing cross-cultural collaborative research projects. Experts from the Searle Center for Advancing Learning and Teaching at Northwestern University provide ongoing assessment to quantify educational outcomes and improve pedagogy and program structure. The 2018 school takes advantage of JUAMI's existing clearing house, a virtual gathering place, to connect researchers and resources across international boundaries. The institute's unique format, essentially a hybrid between a state-of-the-art conference offering advanced seminars and a school with hands-on learning opportunities, is key to achieving mutual benefit for the United States and Africa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like many elements taken up by marine life, its concentrations in seawater are very low; however, Cu has a distribution in the water column that is different from other biologically essential elements.  This difference may be attributed to the presence of a residual fraction in seawater that is virtually inert.  This project seeks to understand what this material is, why it is so unreactive, and how it can eventually be <br/>'cracked"" and re-enter the biological cycle.  A scientist from the University of Southern California (USC) will characterize the Cu chemistry during the US GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect (PMT) cruise.  This cruise is a north-south transect from Alaska to Tahiti that spans a wide range of water depths, temperatures, biology, and chemistry.   The Cu measurements will be made alongside many other trace elements that have different chemistries. By comparing their behavior, coupled with the knowledge of each element?s chemical properties, the scientist will further our knowledge of what controls the behavior of Cu in the ocean.  Training of graduate students and outstanding undergraduates in the speciation techniques is planned. The graduate students will also mentor high school students from inner city schools through the USC Young Investigators Program.  The cruise and its findings will be incorporated into outreach activities and courses taught at USC, including a general education class for non-science majors.<br/><br/>A scientist from USC hypothesizes that non-labile complexes will predominate in high-scavenging regimes and that labile forms will accumulate in older deep waters above a non-labile background pool. To quantify the distribution and chemical properties, two different speciation techniques will be used based on competitive ligand exchange. The first, adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry, was used on previous GEOTRACES sections. The second is based on a ligand exchange, liquid/liquid partition methodology developed by the researcher. Partitioning leads to physical separation of fractions that are reactive or not with the competitive ligand allowing the exchangeability of strongly complexed copper by using Cu-65 as a tracer. The tracer enables much slower reactions to be studied experimentally. Samples will be analyzed using isotope dilution by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Samples will also be prepared for natural Cu isotope analysis of non-labile Cu by a colleague at USC (Seth John) to test the hypothesis that non-labile or semi-labile complexes contribute to the heavy isotope signature of dissolved Cu in seawater.

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project will investigate whether maternal nutrition and breastfeeding duration are associated with the amount and distribution of fat that infants have between birth and four months of age, in a population with high and rising rates of infant, child, and adult obesity. Certain fat distributions are thought to be related to the risk of obesity, and this fundamental research will be important in characterizing variation in infant growth and development and for comparisons with data from other populations. The research will contribute to our broader understanding of human biological variation and adaptations, and the evolution of modern human life history, and could inform public health research on the global obesity epidemic. The project will provide research training and scientific education in a STEM field to graduate and undergraduate students from the U.S., and build both research capacity and collaborations at the research site.<br/><br/>The investigator will use a longitudinal design to collect data on infant size and fatness in Samoan infants, as they grow from birth to four months of age, using the ""gold standard"" dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) technique. The use of DEXA will allow for measurement of both total body fat and body fat distribution. She will test whether maternal nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding duration are associated with how much fat infants have at birth and four months, as well as the body regions where fat is distributed. Greater fat stored around the organs and less fat directly stored under the skin is thought to increase the risk for cardiovascular disease in adults. The data generated in this project may inform the design of future interventions that target the prevention of obesity at the earliest point. In addition, findings from this project will contribute to the understanding of how fat growth in early life varies by population history and the current environmental stresses a population faces (e.g., highly pathogenic environments and highly caloric, low nutritional environments), and will be relevant to all human populations."

As a result, CAM plants are increasingly being recognized as among the world's most important crops for food, fodder, fiber, and fuel, as well as being key drivers of ecosystem function in dry regions. CAM photosynthesis also stands out as an example of complex trait evolution, with over 60 independent evolutionary origins, and occurrence in more than 33 families of vascular plants. Exploiting the productive potential of CAM for human enterprise while protecting CAM plants in naturally occurring environments requires the integration of a broad range of biological disciplines. To promote this integration, this conference will bring together a diverse group of scientists to discuss the evolution, ecology, functional biology, genomics and engineering of CAM traits and species. The outcomes of the conference will be highly relevant for ongoing efforts to select traits in succulent CAM species used for food crops and biofuels, and for conservation and management of highly threatened arid, semi-arid, or tropical ecosystems in the face of rapid environmental change. Discoveries from the conference will be translated into outreach and broad dissemination to the public, policy makers, land managers, and the scientific community.<br/><br/>CAM photosynthesis was a leading topic in plant biology research in the two decades after its discovery in the 1960s. However, once the biochemical details of carbon flow in CAM photosynthetic pathways had been established, further progress in CAM research was dependent on application of molecular-genetic and phylogenetic, and isotopic approaches to investigate these metabolic adaptations.  In recent years, significant advances in molecular phylogenetics, high throughput sequencing, and isotopic physiology have reinvigorated CAM research and contributed to major new initiatives in CAM evolution, the development of novel C3 photosynthesis and CAM bioenergy crops, and the engineering of CAM pathways in non-CAM crop species for improved climate resiliency. These initiatives are now producing exciting results, and due to the overlapping nature of disciplines in the modern era of biology, they need to be presented in a forum where experts and students from across the research spectrum can consider their significance. This conference aims to accelerate this momentum by providing a forum for face-to-face interactions among a wide range of plant biologists. In doing so, the conference will accelerate the pace of discovery and promote synergistic interactions that will maximize the potential for highly novel, transformative discoveries with immediate significance towards commercial application and the conservation of natural ecosystems."

Similar to the first workshop (Konza Prairie - 2016), a solid grounding in scientific research in ecophysiology will be achieved on-hands training, collegiality and interactive data collection. A key need exists for broad training in ecophysiology, as many graduate students have limited exposure to diverse ecophysiology equipment, techniques, and data interpretation. Phys-Fest 2 will fill this need through mentored research, close interaction with faculty instructors, and evening activities designed to teach effective science communication skills. Phys-Fest 2 will be hosted by the Holden Arboretum, a species-diverse, mature deciduous forest near Cleveland, OH. Holden Arboretum contains a suspended canopy walk and an emergent tower, both of which provide an 'in-canopy experience' to workshop participants. Scheduling this workshop at Holden provides a unique scientific opportunity, insight into non-academic careers for students, and opportunities for public engagement with day visitors at the arboretum. <br/>	<br/>This workshop (Phys-Fest 2) will focus on plant ecophysiology and deviate from the typical conference format of short presentations and posters.  Here, participants will collaborate using replicate pieces of equipment to measure leaf-level and whole-plant physiology in four broad categories: plant hydraulics, gas exchange, fluorescence, and thermal/hyperspectral imaging. Measurements will be taken at multiple canopy heights on replicated trees in conjunction with a distributed instrument array including NDVI, PRI, leaf wetness, canopy temperature, and microclimate sensors. This strategy will facilitate in-canopy physiological measurements, such as monitoring the response of forest tree canopies to diurnal variations. These measurements will demonstrate fundamental ecophysiological canopy processes, provide direct linkages to gradients in canopy microclimate, and will be useful for scaling processes at sub-canopy dynamics in deciduous forests. The organization of Phys-Fest 2 is specifically designed to promote networking and meaningful interactions among participants. Two types of training in science communication in the evenings of day 2 and 3 will be held. Holden Arboretum staff will provide short workshops on engaging public audiences and in science outreach and policy. Using the information learned during this training, student participants will interact with Holden visitors during the day with the goal of engaging a public audience, and disseminating ecophysiology principles in forest canopy research. Finally, course accomplishments will be disseminated through four media outlets at the Holden Arboretum: social media, print, video, and on-site interpretative materials."

Centralized dynamic decision-making problems have a long history in engineering, economics and mathematics literature. Many modern systems, however, involve networks of agents making decisions in an uncertain and dynamic environment. Such decentralized systems arise in diverse application domains: infrastructure systems like power, transportation and communication networks, sensing and surveillance systems like teams of autonomous vehicles or robots, as well as networks of inter-connected devices such as the internet of things. Such systems are characterized by presence of multiple agents/decision-makers that have incomplete information about their environment, limited abilities to communicate with each other and that still have to make decisions that may affect the overall system. These systems have to contend with two key aspects of decentralization: (i) Decentralization of information, and (ii) Decentralization of decision-making. The decentralization of information and decision-making creates the need for communication. This communication may be limited, unreliable and imperfect. Decision-makers need to adapt to their communication environment. On the other hand, communication itself may require decision-making such as deciding when and with whom to communicate and what information to communicate. Thus, communication and decision-making are intimately coupled in decentralized systems. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to investigate this interplay of communication and control/decision-making that arises in decentralized systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. The technological and societal impacts of the proposed research will come through the development of new theoretical tools for communication and control in decentralized systems that will impact many applications and industries including: sensing and surveillance systems, robotics, smart grid, communication networks, urban infrastructure maintenance, and cyber-physical security. The educational impact of the project will come through the training of graduate students and engagement with local high-school students through school visits and/or on-campus events.<br/><br/>The focus of the proposed research will be on strategic decision-making which requires identification of decision strategies for agents that allow them to respond to real-time information about unfolding events in their environment in order to optimize the performance of a decentralized dynamic system. The proposed work will address fundamental questions regarding control and decision-making in decentralized systems operating in uncertain and dynamic environments. In particular, it will explore characterization and computation of decision strategies in the following domains: decentralized stochastic control with unreliable and imperfect communication among controllers, minimax decision and control problems in decentralized systems, joint optimization of real-time coding, communication scheduling and control strategies for decentralized control. The fruits of this research will potentially constitute an important step in the further understanding of the interplay of information, communication and decision-making in dynamic decentralized systems."

In the United States, the largest bilingual population consists of individuals from Hispanic backgrounds who speak both English and Spanish. The educational outcomes of Hispanic children lag behind those of their non-Hispanic peers. This achievement gap starts as early as the age of 3 years and persists well into the middle-school years. One of the most significant predictors of academic outcomes is vocabulary knowledge, yet we know very little about the process by which children actually learn words. Monolingual and bilingual children tend to come from distinctive learning environments, both socially and linguistically, and it is possible that they rely on different strategies when learning words. Hence, it is crucial to investigate how learning occurs in children who do not share the same learning environment. This research will help develop successful educational strategies and intervention techniques designed for young bilingual children, with the potential of narrowing the achievement gap. Furthermore, the findings will be useful to parents, teachers, and clinicians in suggesting how best to enable learning in all children. Theoretically, the project will enhance the understanding of language learning mechanisms and how they might be shaped by experience.<br/><br/>Research suggests that infants and children exploit social-pragmatic cues during language learning. However, prior work has primarily tested English-speaking monolingual children. Yet, because bilingual and monolingual children occupy distinct socio-linguistic environments, they may exploit such cues differently. In two experiments, the investigators will examine the use of verbal and non-verbal social-pragmatic cues in novel word learning in 4-5 year old English-speaking monolingual children and Spanish-English bilingual children. In all experiments, a visual world eye-tracking paradigm will be employed in a laboratory setting to assess learning. In Experiment 1, the investigators will examine the impact of eye-gaze (a social-pragmatic non-verbal cue) and speaker reliability (a social-pragmatic verbal cue) on word learning in bilingual and monolingual children. This will allow researchers to identify whether monolingual and bilingual children are differentially sensitive to verbal and non-verbal social cues during word- learning. The research project will also investigate the impact of multiple cues on word-learning. In natural learning environments, children are typically presented with more than one cue to help them learn words. For instance, along with social-pragmatic cues, children also readily use linguistic cues to support their word learning. While some studies in monolingual children have specifically investigated the interplay between social and linguistic cues, it remains unclear how the presence of multiple cues influences word learning in bilingual children. Thus, in Experiment 2, the researchers will examine the combined impact of mutual exclusivity (a linguistic cue) and eye-gaze on word-learning in monolingual and bilingual children. The findings will shed light on how linguistic and non-linguistic cues are utilized together by children during word-learning, and whether these cues are weighed differently by monolingual and bilingual children."

It is a central component of genetic material and cellular membranes and is integral to energy production and regulating enzyme activity. In the marine environment, P occurs as inorganic (Pi) and dissolved organic (DOP) forms; the availability and concentration of these different forms of P is an important control on marine phytoplankton growth. Marine phytoplankton are single-celled photosynthetic organisms and can be both prokaryotic bacteria and eukaryotic plants. While Pi is the preferred form of P for marine phytoplankton, in large regions of the oceans it is at such low levels that it restricts phytoplankton growth. In these regions, DOP is the most important P source. The composition of the DOP pool can generally be divided into two major groups: P esters and phosphonates. All marine phytoplankton are capable of using P esters to support growth; in contrast, phosphonates have only been shown to be an important source of P in the nutrition of bacteria to date. This project will determine the ability of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton to use phosphonates as a source of P for growth. Genomic analyses will determine the metabolic response of eukaryotic phytoplankton species to growth on phosphonates as well as the relevance of phosphonate use by natural populations. It is critical to understand the metabolic capabilities of phytoplankton which control marine nutrient cycling. In addition, the project is of great value in understanding the potential impacts of a changing ocean on phytoplankton growth. The project supports reseach opportunities for undergraduates from a local community college as well as hands-on enrichment programs for an afterschool program that serves a diverse student population. <br/><br/>Comprising up to 10% of the marine DOP pool, phosphonates have been shown to be a dynamic P pool both being assimilated and produced by marine photosynthetic bacteria. The ability of eukaryotic phytoplankton to supplement their growth with phosphonates remains vastly unexplored. Several eukaryotic phytoplankton species have been shown to use glyphosate, a chemically synthesized herbicidal phosphonate, as a P source; it remains unknown if open ocean eukaryotic phytoplankton can utilize phosphonates found naturally in the marine environment. Preliminary experiments suggest at least some eukaryotic phytoplankton are able to directly utilize extracellular phosphonates. This project characterizes the pervasiveness of phosphonate utilization within eukaryotic phytoplankton lineages and identifies the cellular underpinnings that support the acquisition of and growth on naturally occuring phosphonates. The project uses whole-cell transcriptomics and functional gene complementation assays, in addition to phylogenetic analyses, to understand the bioavailability of phosphonates and relevance of phosphonate utilization by natural eukaryotic phytoplankton populations. It is critical to understand the metabolic capabilities of phytoplankton which control marine biogeochemical cycles. This is especially important given the prediction that future oceans may become more stratified which could increase the importance of DOP, including phosphonates, in supporting phytoplankton growth."

Society has become increasingly reliant on such algorithms for commerce, transportation, healthcare, emergency response, and national security. Despite their critical role in society, algorithms are typically designed and tuned using insight from experts, extensive numerical simulations, and other heuristics. This research develops a more principled understanding and approach to algorithm design that automatically accounts for sensitivity to parameter choice, robustness to noise, and other sources of uncertainty. This approach enables algorithms to be engineered in a way that guarantees performance and safety, which is similar to how airplanes, skyscrapers, and computer hardware are built.<br/><br/>Iterative algorithms may be viewed as dynamical systems with feedback. In gradient-based descent methods, for example, gradients are evaluated at each step and used to compute subsequent iterates. By treating algorithms as control systems, this research leverages tools from robust control (specifically: integral quadratic constraints, graphical methods, and semidefinite representation) to analyze and ultimately synthesize a variety of algorithms under different assumptions in an efficient, scalable, and systematic manner. This research also involves collaborative efforts in the areas of graph structure learning of gene regulatory networks and interactive machine learning, which serve to test and validate new algorithm designs."

These products from the workshop will be disseminated to a wide variety of stakeholders, so as to inform public policy and enhance national security.<br/><br/>The proposed interdisciplinary workshop addresses the human aspect of cybersecurity in organizational settings, focusing both on employees with cybersecurity-relevant jobs (e.g., analysts working in Security Operations Centers) and the end-users of technology (i.e., essentially all employees in the organization). Workshop attendees will include organizational science researchers and practitioners who study topics relevant to cybersecurity at the micro (e.g., individual employee or end-user), meso (e.g., team or multiteam system), and macro (e.g., organization or country) levels of analysis, along with cybersecurity researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The absence of direct communication between the organizational sciences and cybersecurity has arguably harmed both fields, and so the workshop will focus on cross-pollination, identification of roadblocks, and the joint development of a future agenda.

Evidence is rapidly mounting indicating that these co-occurring periods of precipitation deficit and warm temperatures are likely to increase over the next century and pose a serious threat to biodiversity and the critical services these ecosystems provide society. While the impacts of a warmer and drier future on these and similar ecosystems are expected to be severe, some species and ecological communities may be more vulnerable to these changes than others.  Understanding the factors that drive differences in vulnerability is one of the preeminent scientific and societal challenges of our time as this knowledge is essential for prioritizing conservation efforts and for identifying practical adaptation strategies that can conserve or enhance critical services these ecosystems provide society under changing environmental conditions.  To address this need, this project develops linked infrastructure at the UC Sierra Foothill Research and Extension Center (SFREC) that will allow researchers to (1) measure how exposure to drought and elevated air temperatures varies over time and across the topographically complex landscapes and (2) experimentally apply different levels of drought and air temperature to key plant communities and species that are critical drivers of services these ecosystems provide society. The infrastructure developed here not only allows multiple lines of new research around drought and warming impacts to be pursued but does so while greatly reducing start-up costs for researchers, thus overcoming a major barrier to greater participation in climate change research by students and scientists from underrepresented institutions.  This project also adds key capacity to expand K-12 STEM education and science content training for educators to diverse and rural agricultural communities in northern California having markedly less access to STEM and science education training opportunities than most areas in the state.<br/><br/>While the need to deploy an integrated framework for assessing species vulnerability to climate change is widely acknowledged, globally we have minimal field infrastructure that allows us to simultaneously assess impacts due to climate change exposure and impacts due to climate change sensitivity. To address this need, this project establishes linked research infrastructure distributed across the University of California Sierra Foothill Research and Extension Center (SFREC, http://sfrec.ucanr.edu/) that supports continuous measurements on local exposure to climate change and experimental assessment of multiple factors that drive variation in species sensitivity to these changes.  Specifically, this research infrastructure includes (1) a distributed wireless network of meteorological and hydrological sensors to measure and model how regional climate exposure is modified by topographic complexity and (2) a distributed field system for experimental manipulations of precipitation and warming that will provide researchers extensive ability to develop mechanistic understanding of factors (e.g. ecophysiological traits, genetic diversity, plasticity) and interactions (competition, biological invasions, soil microbial community) that ultimately drive variation in species and population sensitivity to climate change.  The wireless mesh system will be constructed using commercially available wireless technology and environmental sensors. This system also will allow future researchers the ability to add project specific sensors. For experimental manipulations of field conditions, experimental warming will be achieved using large (7 x 7 m) passive warming structures designed to minimizes airflow disruption and provide sufficient space for multiple experiments to be run simultaneously in a cost-effective manner.  Precipitation manipulations will be achieved using a polycarbonate roof system coupled to an automated precipitation redistribution system that will allow researchers to increase or decrease precipitation inputs relative to ambient inputs on an hourly basis. This infrastructure extends our current global research capacity by providing researchers an experimental framework to establish mechanistic and causal linkages between regional climate change and local changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function. This research infrastructure also provides an unparalleled ability to test and model conservation benefits of various biodiversity management tools and strategies. Ultimately this infrastructure should support major positive steps for biodiversity conservation in these and similar Mediterranean systems across the globe."

The technology for electronic devices has been on a rapidly rising trajectory since the 1960s with the ability to fabricate ever smaller silicon transistors (`Moore's Law'), with today's device sizes in the nanometer range. With the rise of nanotechnology, atom-by-atom quantum simulations of emerging materials are becoming increasingly important to reliably supplement the current experimental investigations. Modeling and simulations of atomic systems are essential to assist the everyday work of numerous engineers and scientists and can universally impact a wide range of disciplines (engineering, physics, chemistry, and biology) spanning the technological fields of computing, sensing and energy. This project will accelerate the development of quantum technologies and their impacts in the global economy. A new software will be produced to help capture many fundamental quantum effects which are increasingly important in nanotechnology for exploring and prototyping new revolutionary electronic materials and devices.<br/><br/>This project aims at developing and offering a new open source software, NESSIE, that can address the modern challenges encountered in material and device nano-engineering applications.  NESSIE will use the most cost-effective method to perform excited states calculations, the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), in conjunction with a novel combination of numerical algorithms and physical and mathematical modeling techniques.  NESSIE will be capable of performing excited-state TDDFT calculations using full-potential (all-electron) in real-space (using finite element) and real-time. A new hierarchical parallelization strategy will allow NESSIE to tackle unprecedented atomistic finite size systems at this level of theory. The outcome of this project will open new perspectives for addressing the numerical challenges in real-time TDDFT excited-states calculations to operate the full range of electronic spectroscopy, and study the nanoscopic many-body effects in arbitrary complex molecules and very large-scale finite-size nanostructures. It is expected that the NESSIE software and associated numerical components will become a new valuable new tool for the scientific community, that could be applied to investigate the fundamental electronic properties of numerous nanostructured materials.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

This is a particularly important region to study the impacts of wildfire, as changes to soils and hydrology will likely affect the fate of the large reactive sulfur (S) loads applied to vineyards each year for powdery mildew control. Widespread S use may have consequences for adjacent ecosystems similar to those of inadvertent atmospheric S deposition (i.e., 'acid rain'), such as stimulating production of methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Given that wildfire may accelerate mobilization of S and other materials to adjacent aquatic ecosystems, the need to pursue this research has now become urgent. The study will address the immediate effects of wildfire on hydrological flow paths and mobilization of S from vineyards to streams. The project team will instrument a burned and unburned vineyard catchment with subsurface soil water and surface water (runoff and stream) collectors. They will conduct field observations of hydrologic flows during the first large rain events of the wet season to quantify mobilized S, C, and sediment, perform a laboratory experiment to determine chemical losses from burned and unburned soils over time, and develop methods to trace S in the environment. This study will provide a dataset critical for proceeding with longer-term efforts to develop field studies, experiments, and models to elucidate the ultimate fates and consequences of agricultural S use at the basin scale - a new area of research to understand human manipulation of the S cycle. This one-year project will be led by a female assistant professor, train a female graduate student, and provide data that will be important for farmers and other stakeholders. The research group will communicate their findings broadly in multiple workshops within the study region.<br/><br/>The goal of this one-year field- and laboratory-based study is to provide an important dataset detailing the effects of recent, widespread wildfire on mobilization of agricultural sulfur (S) from vineyards to streams in the North Coast California winegrowing region. These data are a critical baseline to capture prior to initiating a new wave of research: determining the unintended consequences of high S applications in regional agricultural systems. The biogeochemical and ecological effects of high S use may be similar to those of inadvertent atmospheric S deposition (i.e., ""acid rain""), but they have not yet been studied in vineyards or other crop systems. In particular, agriculturally-derived S may stimulate production of methylmercury in aquatic ecosystems downgradient of source areas, threatening the health of humans and wildlife. This study will make the first measurements of S, carbon (C), and sediment mobilized from burned vineyards to streams during the onset of the rainy season, and develop new geochemical and isotopic methods for tracing agriculturally-derived S species in the environment. To this end, the project team will instrument a burned and an unburned vineyard catchment with runoff collectors, ISCO stream samplers, soil water samplers, and soil moisture sensors to quantify hydrological flow paths and assess their chemical composition. They will also conduct burned and unburned soil core leaching experiments to determine the evolution of chemical losses over the course of a simulated wet season. These activities will test two hypotheses: (1) If the heat input from fire has dramatically changed surface soil properties relative to unburned vineyards, moderate-to-high intensity rain events will cause surface runoff that rapidly (minutes to hours) transports S, C, and sediment from burned vineyards to streams, and (2) If surface runoff dominates the hydrologic response in burned vineyards, then mobilized S species will have a light isotopic value, reflecting minimal interaction with the soil matrix."

This research project collects time-critical, ephemeral data consisting of observations of erosion, sediment redistribution, and coral reef structure damage at Cane Bay on St Croix in the US Virgin Islands. This location was picked because it was at or near the center of both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria when they were at their maximum strength. It is also the location of another major hurricane strike (i.e., Hurricane Hugo) in 1989.  Data like that collected for the present project were also collected for Hurricane Hugo, allowing comparisons to be made and comprehensive modeling of the impact major storms have on carbonate production, bioerosion, and sediment export in a modern reef system.  Land and marine photographic images, as well as other data will be collected to provide high quality measurements of sediment removal by each storm.  These data, as well as historical data from Hurricane Hugo, will be used to model storm related sediment transport in the area over the past century. Broader impacts of the work include partnership with researchers at the US Geological Survey, production of an educational video based on overcoming reef-building misconceptions, and improving knowledge of the impacts of major storms on coral reefs which will help inform and improve reef management.<br/><br/>Carbonate production and carbonate cycling in modern reefs is due to a balance between the secretion of calcite by corals and coralline algae and the breakdown and removal of the physical structure of the reef by biological and physical means. While the biologically related components of this equation have been intensively studied, a missing part of the equation is sediment export, a parameter that is presently poorly understood and quantified.  A key set of data documenting sediment export in a reef system was collected in Cane Bay at St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands just after Hurricane Hugo. Additional data was collected during fair weather conditions on the island for comparison. This new project collects similar data to that collected after Hurricane Hugo. It will allow a quantitative comparison between the various storms and an assessment of sediment export. Goals will be to characterize sediment removal from the northwestern insular shelf of St. Croix. Modeling, to be carried out by a collaborator from the US Geological Survey, will be focused on determining the relative roles of bottom shear versus storm surge during major storms in exporting sediment from coral reefs in tropical carbonate systems."

However, about 2% of the general population have deficits in face perception. What makes some people good at recognizing faces and others bad at it? Scientists have identified brain regions involved in perceiving faces. Additionally, behavioral research has shown that face perception is ""holistic"". That is, perception of the whole face, all at once, is better than that of individual facial features. However, it is unknown what neural computations underlie this holistic perception of faces. Because holistic face processing requires spatial integration across face parts, the goal of the research is to examine whether such processing relies on spatial integration by neurons in face-selective brain. Additionally, the research will determine if individual differences in neuronal spatial integration predict individual differences in face recognition ability. This project is expected to impact society in several ways. Understanding the neural mechanisms of face recognition could improve measurement, enhance diagnosis, and ultimately improve the wellbeing of individuals with deficits in face recognition. The project will also develop research infrastructure by making publicly available the new methods and computational tools for measurement and modeling of brain responses. The project intends to advance the participation and education of women in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The research program addresses important gaps in knowledge by leveraging cutting-edge neuroimaging and computational approaches, including population receptive field (pRF) modeling and hierarchical convolution neural networks, together with behavioral measurements of face perception. In particular, the pRF approach offers a unique opportunity to operationalize and measure spatial processing and attentional effects on face perception in a computational framework. Thus, the research (i) will advance understanding of the neural mechanisms of face perception by quantifying spatial aspects of face processing and attention, (ii) will uncover how spatial integration of different face stimuli, under differing attentional demands explains individual differences in face perception abilities, and (iii) will generate an up-to-date and neurally accurate computational model of human face perception."

However when it comes to physical problems in the real world, personal technology lags far behind: typical users often have minimal to no interaction with robots in daily life.  The research in this project aims to address unmet needs, creating the technology necessary to make robotics as ubiquitous as computing is today; by democratizing access to robot creation reducing barriers to entry we can advance technology in developing fields, bring opportunities for technical advancement to under-served communities, and excite and encourage students to further their education throughout the country and the world.  The project will result in creation of user-friendly tools that allow anyone with any background or expertise to design custom, personalized robots. The research will include development of new fabrication processes that enable the on-demand fabrication of the designed robots. Also, new algorithms and frameworks will be investigated for expanding autonomous control of distributed networks of these devices.  The  goal of the project is for everyone to eventually be able to say, for any personal physical task that needs to be solved, ""there's a robot for that.""<br/><br/>The proposed research plan will address theory and systems issues under the three parallel thrusts of design, fabrication, and control for pervasive personal robots.  Ubiquitous cyber-physical systems must deliver uniquely specified functionality, and so this program will investigate design automation algorithms that generate manufacturable specifications from high-level task descriptions provided by inexpert users, feeding back verification and validation results into user-in-the-loop and automated optimization.  These designs must then be realized into integrated electromechanical machines at a personal scale, for which this research will explore rapid manufacturing tools and processes that use robust mechanical materials and integrated electromechanical metamaterials for subtractive manufacturing and develop discrete microfabricated active elements for additive manufacturing.  Finally, these robots must be controlled; this program will investigate universal communications and control subtasks at an integrated system level, using the intended ubiquity of personal robots to develop algorithms and protocols for distributed localization, communication-aware motion planning, and mobility-enhanced networking."

The reservoir consists of previously unknown iron superoxides which could suddenly release its excessive oxygen.  In the present project, the team will further explore the different types of iron superoxides, the conditions for the explosive oxygen release, and the consequences of oxygen eruptions.  The sporadic eruptions provide a new, unified mechanism for answering questions on a list of seemingly unrelated past events that occurred during Earth's 4.6 billion years history and shaped the present living planet.  Where did the oxygen in the air come from?  What caused the mass extinctions that killed the dinosaurs and ushered in the mammals?  What was the driving force that pushed all continents to merge into a single supercontinent, and later pulled the supercontinent apart to form individual continents?   From understanding the Earth's Past and Present, we may gain insights into the Earth's Future.<br/><br/>The investigator's recent discovery of high P-T iron superoxides, FeO2 and FeO2Hx with the pyrite-type Pa3 structure has suggested potential paradigm changes in mineral physics and geodynamics of the deep lower mantle.  The team proposes to further investigate the high P-T mineral physics properties of the superoxides, including the incorporation of other major components such as MgO2, AlO2 and SiO2 into the Pa3 iron superoxide, its interactions with silicate bridgmanite and post-perovskite, its electronic and magnetic spin states, and its valence states of iron and oxygen. The team will search for other stable structural types in addition to Pa3 for firon-based superoxides with the apparent Fe oxidation state >3+, and determine their elastic wave velocities for comparison for comparison with seismic observations in the deep Earth.  The team's previous research suggested the existence of a massive amount of oxygen-rich patches at the core-mantle boundary. This research will investigate the metastability of such giant oxygen reservoirs, and the consequences when the stored oxygen is released, particularly the resulting geodynamics of the super plate tectonics that may explain the origin of merging and rifting of supercontinents."

The Yale Ciencia Initiative, in collaboration with Ciencia Puerto Rico, working with the Department of Education of Puerto Rico will develop culturally relevant project-based science lesson plans that incorporate the disaster context that can be implemented both inside and outside of the traditional classroom. The project will allow displaced students to continue learning under the guidance of teachers, parents or social workers.  The project will train educators in the use of disaster-related problem-based lessons and assess project implementation and the impact of the lessons. The final outcome of this aim will be a lesson plan template and implementation guidelines for other jurisdictions faced by natural disasters.

Results will be compared to matched control groups that receive either the standard curriculum, which are not contextualized to the disaster and that does not include PBL, or a PBL lesson plan that does not incorporate the disaster or the cultural context. At least 30 educators and 200 7th grade students will be exposed during the project period to the contextualized PBL lesson plan. The resulting feasibility analysis will inform other jurisdictions preparing their educational systems for natural disasters and provide evidence for the use of contextualized lesson plans that incorporate PBL in disaster recovery settings.

Beginning in 2010, PECI is the oldest annual, student-run IEEE international conference about power and energy technology. PECI is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) approved conference and technically co-sponsored by PES, PELS, and IAS professional societies of IEEE. The conference is organized by the IEEE PES/PELS/IAS Joint Graduate Student Chapter at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is advised by faculty in the Power and Energy area of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. PECI has become a perfect place in the Midwest for industry and academic researchers to discuss future power and energy topics such as renewable energy, machines for electric transportation, smart grid reliability, security of cyber-physical systems, and power electronics for emerging technologies. Thus, the intellectual merit of PECI are the student focused nature of the conference, from the student led steering committee to all technical and presentations, and the high quality publications and posters from student attendees.<br/><br/>PECI was founded for three key reasons: 1) to provide students in the Midwest an opportunity to participate in a research conference, 2) to provide a forum for students in the Midwest to present their research progress and outcomes for feedback to a technical audience of peers, industry professional, and 3) to inspire both undergraduate and graduate students to pursue careers in power and energy STEM fields. While PECI impact has expanded over the last eight years to include participants from around the world, we have retained our Midwest roots and mission statement by encouraging participation from Midwest universities, especially undergraduate students for the poster session. By attending PECI students benefit from closer interactions with experts, professors, and industry professionals and<br/>potentially receive advice or mentorship for their future career. In addition to student technical presentations and posters, students also learn about the mega-trends in power and energy and cutting edge research from three industry leaders and experts, who deliver keynote presentations and tours of a local microgrid research facility and new ECE building. Moreover, the importance of pursuing a career in power and energy is highlighted by a special careers session involving industry presentations about research demands for power and energy companies and a panel discussion regarding what a career in industry, a national laboratory, academia, or government would entail. With support from NSF, PECI seeks to reach a wider audience with this impact by encouraging participation from a larger number of<br/>Midwest and US schools, especially schools that do not offer a Ph.D. degree."

These systems are interrelated: The semantic memory system allows one to construct representations of the features and details making up an experience, and the episodic memory system binds these semantic representations to a unique spatiotemporal context. Despite the critical importance of these systems, there are major gaps in our knowledge regarding the nature of the neural and cognitive mechanisms that allow us to flexibly access, manipulate, and retrieve episodic and semantic memories.  With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Sean Polyn of Vanderbilt University is developing the Control of Semantic and Episodic Memory (CSEM) model, a novel theory designed to explain the how the brain mediates episodic and semantic memory search and retrieval.  This project will involve undergraduate students, graduate students, and research staff at every level: data analysis, theory development, and presentation of results to the broader scientific community.  The project's objectives will make key contributions to infrastructure for research and education, as the simulation software and the database of anonymized behavioral and neural data will be distributed to the broader scientific and academic community via the internet, along with a repository of behavioral and neural analysis tools.<br/><br/>The CSEM model is a computational model of human memory designed to test hypotheses regarding the specific mechanisms carried out by particular brain regions in the storage, retrieval, and flexible use of semantic and episodic memories.  The research team will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity as participants perform semantic and episodic memory tasks.  Multivariate pattern analysis, representational similarity analysis, and advanced statistical techniques will be used to characterize the representational structure and dynamics of neural activity, supporting the development of functional, mechanistic computational models of the cognitive system of participants as they perform the memory tasks.  The first study examines neural signals for evidence of an integrative contextual representation that allows information about recent experiences to persist in neural activity patterns.  The second study examines how the neural system constructs a retrieval cue that can be used to target particular sets of memories.  The third study examines how memories interfere with one another during retrieval, and the mechanisms used by the neural system to resolve this interference.  Data from these experiments will support the development of a unified theoretical framework to understand how general-purpose executive processes control the semantic and episodic memory systems to give rise to flexible, goal-directed behavior."

In addition, the next generation of transportation systems will include connected vehicles, connected infrastructure, and increased automation, and these advances must coexist with legacy technology into the foreseeable future. Accommodating these rapidly developing advancements requires smarter and more efficient use of existing infrastructure with guarantees of performance, safety, and interoperability.  The goal of this project is to develop fundamental theory and domain-driven techniques for controlling traffic flow in large-scale transportation networks. Recent advances in inexpensive sensors, wireless technology, and the Internet of Things (IoT) enable real-time connectivity of vehicles and infrastructure that offers abundant data and unprecedented opportunities for efficient and   optimized transportation systems.  The main technical goal is to develop techniques and algorithms that are correct-by-design, ensuring that these transportation systems satisfy required operating specifications. In pursuit of this goal, the project will first develop models of traffic flow from rich data streams and then will leverage these models to enable scalable control approaches. In addition, this project will integrate an ambitious education plan that includes a redesigned introductory course in control theory for undergraduates. The course will be restructured to focus on modern challenges in control, culminating in a Control Grand Challenge design competition in which students will design a controller for an autonomous, scale-model car and then compete with their design. <br/><br/>To achieve systems that satisfy the rich design specifications demanded of traffic networks, the project will especially focus on bringing powerful techniques from formal methods for verification and synthesis to large-scale physical networks. These formal methods were originally developed for specifying and verifying the correct behavior of software and hardware systems, and an important research objective now is to ensure these approaches are scalable, adaptable, and reliable when applied to physical control systems. The project will focus on the following objectives: i) Develop theory and models for the dynamic behavior of traffic networks that captures domain-specific phenomena such as congestion propagation, ii) Determine how traffic flow dynamics will change as vehicles are increasingly equipped with autonomous capabilities, iii) Identify and exploit intrinsic structure in traffic flow networks to enable scalable formal methods for verification and synthesis, and iv) Use data available through industry collaborations to develop probabilistically correct control of traffic flow networks. These objectives address a growing need for systematic guarantees of performance in traffic networks as the increasing complexity and interdependence of transportation systems renders ad hoc approaches insufficient. The research activities of this project will use real traffic data available through ongoing collaborations with industry. An expected outcome of this project is a suite of scalable algorithms that will be tested on a pilot traffic network available through this collaboration. In addition, the project will establish foundational theory applicable outside the traffic domain."

Participants work in teams of four under the supervision of the PIs. An experienced research mentor and a junior faculty member lead each team. The REU site at LU aims to increase research opportunities for students at institutions where undergraduate research opportunities are limited or nonexistent. By recruiting underrepresented minorities, veterans and community college students, students are empowered to pursue degrees in STEM and to transition to advanced study or careers in STEM. The benefits of participating in a structured research program extend beyond the technical knowledge that students gain. Students increase writing and oral communication skills and are exposed to professional development opportunities in attending conferences to present their work. Furthermore, the faculty advisors continue to serve as mentors for the students beyond the ten weeks of the program. Each year, many students transfer to LU after having completed two-year degrees at local community colleges. The REU site at LU creates an opportunity for participants from local community colleges to meet other STEM students who successfully made the transition to a four-year university. Finally, pairing experienced research mentors with less experienced co-mentors on each research project gives the co-mentors the tools necessary to establish or expand undergraduate research programs.<br/> <br/>The intellectual focus of this program is on interdisciplinary research at the crossroads of mathematics, statistics and computer science. In many applications, dimension reduction is imperative for efficient manipulation of massive quantities of high-dimensional data. Dimension reduction using matrix factorizations and graph theory can be used to ascertain the underlying structure of the data and to find correlations among the data attributes. Interest is increasing in the study of graph theory, singular value decomposition (SVD) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) due to applications in various research areas of mathematics and computer science. SVD and NMF are both unsupervised learning tools currently used in big data analytics.  REU participants will gain exposure to the challenges and opportunities associated with big data. Students are introduced to the three Vs of big data: Volume, Variety, Velocity. Volume refers to the sheer quantity of the data, Variety refers to the different types of data, and Velocity refers to the speed of processing the data.  Students are allotted the opportunity to participate in (1) theoretical research, with students investigating properties of graph theory, SVD and NMF to generate conjectures, prove theorems, and investigate existing algorithms; and (2) programming related research, with students performing experiments on matrix factorizations and graph theory and writing algorithms to process large data sets."

The evolving complexity of wireless communications demands fundamental changes to existing electromagnetic wave analysis and modeling methodologies. Often at times, there is no precise knowledge of the wave system, the radiating noise source, and the propagation environment. Furthermore, in the short-wavelength regime, the electromagnetic wave scattering process can be very sensitive to details. It results in a very high variability of wave distributions, and makes the deterministic solution relevant only to the specific configuration. This project proposes new physics-oriented statistical electromagnetic wave models to resolve environmental uncertainties. The proposed research opens up new pathways to exploit the complexity of propagation environments when designing wireless devices and antennas. The outcomes will establish a configurable virtual testbed for communications in complex environments not confined by the laboratory measurements. The research advancements will be integrated with the education to develop unconventional educational tools. The project will create a virtual reality electromagnetic laboratory at University of New Mexico (UNM), which offers a multifaceted teaching and learning environment through innovative data visualization and interactive simulation. Other educational components include developing online courses and advanced cross-disciplinary courses, mentoring high school students through UNMTemps Youth Summer program, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups by working with UNM's state-funded Multicultural Engineering Program and the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to investigate fundamental mathematical models and computational algorithms for the statistical wave analysis in complex electromagnetic environments. The project will study an innovative theoretical solution to Maxwell's Equations in the wave-chaotic media (domains exhibiting ray-chaotic dynamics). The fundamental solution (stochastic Green's function) rigorously integrates the coherent and incoherent propagations within a compact form. A new stochastic integral equation method is proposed for the statistical wave propagation through the chaotic environment. It quantitatively interprets the universal statistical properties of wave chaos through the random matrix theory. Since real-world electromagnetic systems often exhibit mixed chaotic and regular wave dynamics, the second part of the work investigates the first-principles theoretical framework of combing the integrable (regular) and non-integrable (chaotic) wave dynamics. By incorporating the component-, site-, and system-specific information with the universal chaotic dynamics, the work accomplishes a comprehensive framework for the statistical analysis and uncertainty quantification of complex wave systems. The advancements will establish an imperative simulation-driven, design-under-chaos capability, which is expected to have a big impact in the engineering discipline. Knowledge from this project will bring forth a new generation of computer-aided design (CAD) tools that will revolutionize electromagnetic simulation, prediction, design and optimization in complex environments. While the proposed research primarily focuses on electrodynamics, the methodology can be applied to other fields including acoustics and vibrations, quantum mesoscopic transport, and nuclear physics."

Shannon's influential ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication"" established such a theory for one-way communications. Coding theory has subsequently produced computationally efficient methods for reliable data transmissions over unreliable channels. While error correcting codes have transformed communication technologies over the decades, modern communication settings often go beyond one-way transmissions and instead require many interleaved rounds of interactive communication. The development of interactive equivalents of good error correcting codes for such modern systems is a much harder task, which has attracted attention recently and witnessed encouraging initial successes. This project will further advance the fundamental questions underlying possibilities, limitations, and theoretical underpinnings of reliable interactive communication in the presence of noise, and thus contribute to a solid mathematical and computational theory of reliable interactive communication. The project also has a strong educational component which supports several initiatives to stimulate undergraduates, graduate students, the scientific community, and the general public through education and outreach.<br/><br/>The project attacks a diverse set of ""classical"" questions, such as determining the fundamental communication rate limits for error correction in interactive communications, and explicit constructions of tree codes, a powerful but elusive type of online code.

Over the past twenty years, we have witness a dramatic rise of information in which the analysis of such systems invariably present challenging big data complexity issues.  For example, in transferring resources and information, a key requirement is the ability to adapt and reconfigure in response to structural and dynamic changes while avoiding disruption of service. To this end, we propose to develop fundamental relationships between network functionality and certain topological and geometric properties of the corresponding graph. The thematic vision for this program is based on the recently discovered fact that the geometric notion of curvature (or how objects deviate from being flat) is positively correlated with a systems functional robustness or its ability to adapt to dynamic changes.  While the developed theory and tools will be applicable to a broad set of dynamical systems, we will focus on cancer biology and man-made distributed malware. The accomplishments of this research will be disseminated through raising engineering awareness of the proposed research through K-12 outreach, publications, tutorials in the form of open-source software, and developed workshops. Specifically, given the rise of data (network) science, there is an increasing demand for engineers especially in national security areas where U.S. Veterans may serve an integral role.  As such, we will work to directly engage veterans to engage in aspects of the proposed research while also providing vet dependent mentoring for better university preparation.<br/><br/>This said, to accomplish these goals, the proposed research program aims to study the intimate connections between discrete geometry, optimal mass transport, entropy, and control to formulate new approaches to quantify and predict dynamical properties of complex networks at varying scales.  System properties include, but not limited to, robustness, heterogeneity, and congestion. As such, this research fills a need by investigating network functionality through the confluent study of geometry and control that relies upon several observations with far reaching physical (statistical mechanics) and information theoretic significance. Specifically, by placing a probability structure on a graph, the advantage over existing methods is that the space of probabilities on graphs has much nicer properties than the underlying discrete space alone. The associated probability measures can then be endowed with a Riemannian structure whereby geodesic (shortest distance) paths ensue and convexity properties of the entropy along paths reflect on geometric qualities of the graph.  Given this foundation, we can then begin to develop powerful geometric network tools rooted in optimal and stochastic control.  Altogether, as geometry and control of networks is still in its infancy, this program addresses the increasing need to develop such areas as a further tool to understanding complex systems."

The management team includes members with expertise in the science at AO, in maintenance and operations, and in education and public outreach.<br/><br/>Under UCF management, AO will allow researchers to make innovative use of the facility, and maintain its central role in science and education into the future. For example, the role of AO in the detection and characterization of Gravitational Waves is an exciting new opportunity.  The management team will search for other collaborators and funders interested in using the unique capabilities of AO (for example, its reflector sensitivity and location). The PIs will implement a New Business Development Team focused on developing other funding sources including donations, tourism and commercial clients. <br/><br/>UCF balances science with the maintenance that assures the viability of AO for the long term. The management team plans to grow the diversity of science and maintain observations without trading off the condition of the facilities/equipment or a reduction in workforce. The goal is to maintain the total funding at the 2017/2018 level through government and non-government funding sources.  <br/><br/>AO continues to be a source of intellectual inspiration to the next generation of scientist, particularly those located in Puerto Rico. Under UCF management, AO will enable research by student scientists in Puerto Rico that will result in the next generation of Astronomers and Atmospheric Scientists.

Some jobs have relationships with people at the core of their work where these relationships require an emotional connection between workers and their charges.  Teachers, therapists, primary care physicians, even prison guards each depend on relationships in service to a larger goal: children learning, patients healing, prisons secure. Connective labor captures the relational work between practitioner and recipient, using their emotional connection to produce an outcome.  Existing research documents the importance of work involving relationships for valuable outcomes in arenas from schools to hospitals; these proven impacts of connective labor make its scarcity, uneven distribution or unreliable performance a social problem. Yet its emotional nature resists efforts to make it more systematic or automated. This research will provide new information to policymakers and the public about connective labor: its variation, its value, and the costs and benefits of making it more systematic, scaling it up, or delivering it by non-human agents. The project will also contribute to ongoing public debates and policy deliberations about automation and work involving relationships, by providing a new visibility for connective labor and the kind of standards and technology that support its excellence. <br/><br/>The goals of the project are: to distill the common practices and principles that comprise connective labor, for practitioners as well as the program administrators and artificial intelligence (AI) engineers who would systematize their work; investigate how workers experience different kinds of systematization, from checklists to robotics; and evaluate how such systematization affects connective labor. Research includes 95 in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations with connective laborers in fields focused on security and/or control, e.g. police; with low-wage workers in home health care; and with what might be called systematizers, e.g., administrators. The results of the study will document characteristics of different kinds of connective labor, outline the risks and rewards of the various ways these are systematized, and explain differing stances towards this work."

Among the effects of continental drift are the formation of mountain belts and volcanoes, the spread and extinction of biodiversity, and changes in climate at the local and global scales. Continents on Earth may move via one of two fundamentally different processes. The more familiar mechanism, known as plate tectonics, involves the differential motion of continents relative to each other. The second, less well-understood process is known as true polar wander (TPW), wherein the entire Earth rotates as a single unit such that the location of the present pole is transferred to a lower latitude. Theoretical studies show that TPW should have strong effects on the global environment, including regional sea-level changes of >100 m and drift of land surface across multiple, contrasting climate zones. However, the cause, rate, and even the existence of large-scale TPW events in Earth history have been controversial. Here we will measure the magnetism of rocks from the Late Jurassic (~165-150 million years before present) and pursue theoretical geodynamical computations to characterize the motion of the Earth during this most recent proposed episode of TPW. The results will have important implications for understanding the drivers of observed sea-level and climate changes throughout geologic time and for elucidating a fundamental process by which the global geography of the Earth evolves.<br/><br/>This project is divided into two closely coupled parts that use complementary techniques to understand Jurassic TPW. First, the investigators will collect paleomagnetic rock samples from the La Negra Formation of Northern Chile and the Chon Aike province of Patagonian Argentina to quantify the position of continents during the 165-150 million year ago (Ma) interval, which has been identified by previous studies as the most recent time interval of potentially large amplitude (about 30 degrees) TPW. These rock units represent the most continuous deposits of igneous rocks from the candidate TPW interval, which implies the highest likelihood of recovering high precision paleogeographical information using paleomagnetic techniques. As part of this experimental component of this project, the team will collect samples for geochronological analysis using Ar-Ar and U-Pb in zircon techniques, which would provide more reliable rates of motion during this time span. Second, they will simulate the polar wander of the Earth using existing geodynamical code that accounts for the motion of mass anomalies in the mantle and lateral variations in the lithospheric strength of the Earth. A second, coupled geodynamical code will compute the expected changes in regional sea-level caused by the TPW motion. Combined with experimental data, these models will narrow the range of possible drivers of Late Jurassic TPW and evaluate its potential effect on records of climate and sea-level."

Imagine using genomic data and clinical traits to accurately predict  risk for preterm birth early in gestation, or a college student's risk for future heart attacks, and tailoring preventative measures to the specific risk mechanisms. This research addresses a core theme of machine learning methods applied to scientific data: how to robustly and efficiently build predictive models using complex hidden structure in high dimensional data with limited numbers of samples, as is common in genomic and biomedical data. This proposal addresses a number of fundamental questions: How to use correlation among features to share strength across limited numbers of samples? How to test for causality of an observation in a cell on disease? How to encode biological structure in nonlinear functions? These fundamental questions in applied machine learning and statistical genetics will be addressed through the creation of hierarchical models and methods for computationally tractable analyses. These projects will enable recovery of genomic signals with predictive ability essential for personalized medicine.  The PI also plans active engagement with underrepresented minorities in computer science and making publicly available software.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop computationally tractable structured hierarchical models to find complex signals in genomic data that are hidden to current methods that will be used to build predictive models using existing genomic study data, and to use these predictive variants to precisely quantify disease risk for each patient. Success of these goals impacts personalized medicine, enabling a complete understanding of the genetic regulators of disease and making individual-specific disease risk prediction and treatment a reality. Although linear models have been used to analyze scientific data for 125 years, these methods assume unlimited availability of samples and simple linear structure, and fail to recover variants with more complex associations. In genomic data, predictive signal is often compositional, including linear, sparse, low-rank, or nonlinear structure. This proposed research will drastically shift current scientific data analysis by developing efficient methods that recover predictive genetic variants with complex effects. This research is organized around three integrated projects. 1) High-dimensional correlations. Current methods for correlation do not exploit multiple, correlated traits to improve power to find relationships between two high-dimensional sets of observations. The PI will develop computationally tractable models and robust inference methods for structured latent variable models in the presence of substantial observation noise. 2) Sparse, nonlinear regression for prediction by exploiting nonaddictive effects. Standard predictive models for genomics assume that associations are sparse and additive across predictors; nonlinear terms are not regularized appropriately. The PI will develop a predictive model that robustly recovers variants with additive and nonadditive effects. 3) Causal inference to study the mechanism of genetic regulation of disease. Current models of causal inference in genomics make unrealistic assumptions and fail to exploit modern machine learning approaches to nonlinearity, regularization, and approximate inference. The PI will develop a hierarchical model for causal analysis to pinpoint the cellular mechanisms of disease."

A quick eyebrow frown from a student will inform the teacher of possible confusion. A tilt of the head may show doubt during negotiation. A patient's smile dynamics can even predict their future recovery. This project will build innovative technologies to allow computers to understand subtle nonverbal behaviors of human users. The main novelty of this project will be in its capacity to learn the inherent variability between individuals on how nonverbal behaviors are expressed. The same emotion can be expressed very differently by different people. A nonverbal signature is how a specific person gestures visually when talking with other people. By recognizing these nonverbal communicative behaviors such as facial expressions, head gestures and eye contact, computers and mobile devices will be able to better understand the user's emotions and affective states. In mental health treatment, the developed technologies have the potential to change how doctors assess disorders with new behavioral objective measures and possibily to predict eventual relapse for the patient. For researchers and animators of virtual characters (e.g., movie studies), the nonverbal signatures will enable an ""a la carte"" selection of the virtual human nonverbal signature that best aligns with the character's profile and personality. In education and online learning, the student's nonverbal signature will help to assess engagement and perceive affective states related to success in learning.   <br/><br/>This project will advocate a novel paradigm for learning visual representations of human nonverbal behaviors: a major focus on intra-personal variability followed by analysis of group structures and eventual learning of visual representations generalizable across the population. The research methodology will be motivated by well-studied concepts of idiosyncrasy in nonverbal behavior expressions. The project will introduce the concept of nonverbal signatures which are low-dimensional computational representations of an individual's nonverbal behaviors contextualized by the verbal content and affective context. This project will address four fundamental research challenges: (1) personalized nonverbal embedding -- learning computational representations that summarize the individual variations in nonverbal appearance, (2) learning nonverbal signatures -- contextualizing the nonverbal behaviors with verbal and affective cues to learn more effective representations, (3) signature portfolio analysis -- discovering structure, prototypes and idiosyncrasy from a collection of nonverbal signatures, and (4) generalized nonverbal representations -- learning generalizable nonverbal representations able to adapt to new individuals. These four research aims will be complemented by a comprehensive evaluation plan to include four intermediate evaluations and a continuous overarching evaluation. This research effort will open the door to new sources of human-centric data where accurate interpretation of nonverbal behaviors is essential."

The recent proliferation of ESM promises to create better opportunities for generative collaborations, yet organizations struggle to establish fully active systems and reap the promised benefits.  Following the paradigm of persuasive system design, this project aims to build and evaluate a feedback system, the Cyberinfrastructure for Smart Innovation (CSI). The CSI extracts near real-time data from groups inside the ESM, visualizes their social dynamics and activities, and suggests actions beneficial to their generativity. Research will be carried out in three phases: Phase 1: Create a fundamental understanding and predictive models of distinct forms of generative collaborations and their effectiveness through the algorithmic curation and statistical analysis of six years of ESM archival data from the partner organization, Steelcase Inc.; Phase 2: Develop a suite of design guidelines for the CSI using formative and summative user-centered research methods; Phase 3: Evaluate the causal impact of the CSI on generative collaborations, through quasi-experiments within real-world innovation teams at Steelcase and self-reported evaluations with a sample of its client organizations. <br/><br/>Enterprise Social Media represent an essential research context given the innumerable anecdotal claims about the merits of ESM for generativity, but there is a pronounced lack of scientific research validating such claims and explaining when and how these merits occur. This research project aims to make five major intellectual contributions: (1) Improved understanding of the multilevel antecedents of generative collaborations in ESM; (2) Expansion of existing organization science literatures by providing unobtrusive, mixed-method, and sociotechnical insights into processes of generative collaborations; (3) Extension of extant ESM research on the actual impact of these systems; (4) Production of the proposed persuasive feedback system (CSI) intended to foster improved ESM-based generative collaborations; (5) Rigorous empirical testing of the causal effect of the CSI on generativity in real-world groups. An integrated education and research program will include a new research seminar where students will work to adapt the CSI for improving the effectiveness of group work in problem-based learning settings, thereby creating a second, non-industry testbed for the CSI and enabling the discovery of fundamental theoretical principles that abstract from generative collaboration to learning contexts."

Interpretability helps human experts ascertain whether machine learning systems, trained on technical objective functions, have sensible outputs despite unmodeled unknowns. For example, a clinical decision support system will never know all of a patient's history, nor may it know which of many side effects a specific patient is willing to tolerate. An important challenge, then, is how to design machine learning systems that both predict well and provide explanation.  Within this broad challenge, this work develops techniques for domain-targeted interpretability, finding summaries of high-dimensional data that are relevant for making decisions.  The proposed work focuses on healthcare applications, where interpretable models are essential to safety.  However, the project aims to produce foundational learning algorithms applicable to a range of scientific and social domains.  The developed methods will be tested on real problems in personalizing treatment recommendations and prognoses for sepsis, depression, and autism spectrum disorder. Thus, the successful completion of the work will impact both interpretable machine learning and clinical science.  All software developed in the course of the project will be freely shared.  The educational component of the proposed work will educate early elementary students about the impact of statistics in medicine and educate policy-makers and legal scholars on how a right to explanation might be regulated in the context of machine learning, such as clinical decision support systems. PI Doshi-Velez also engages high school students, undergraduates, women, and researchers from underserved areas in her lab.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed work addresses a specific challenge common in scientific settings: domain-targeted interpretability. In many scientific domains, unsupervised generative models are used by domain experts to understand patterns in the data, but as the dimensionality of data grow, the most salient patterns in the data may not be relevant for the specific investigation. For example, a psychiatrist may find the strongest signals in the data from his patient cohort come from diabetes and heart disease, which may not be relevant for choosing therapies for depression.  The proposed work leverages synergies in explaining domain-relevant patterns in the data and performing well on domain-relevant tasks to achieve domain-targeted interpretability. It defines a task-constrained approach to domain-targeted interpretability and develops essential inference techniques, develops extensions to sequential decision making, and defines extensions to improve downstream task performance while retaining interpretabilty.  While there is a large body of work on making unsupervised learning models also useful for downstream tasks, none of these approaches truly manage the trade-offs between providing an interpretation of data and task performance. The proposed work addresses these shortcomings to make domain-targeted interpretability and task performance synergistic goals, and proposes a number of innovations to solve the proposed objective. Innovations include combining an existing rich literature on inference traditional unsupervised models with modern inference techniques and directly searching for dimensions or patterns relevant to the downstream task."

The TCUs in Montana have been offering Native American language courses to encourage the sustainability of Native languages. This collaborative project between the University of Montana (UM) and one of the TCUs, Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC), aims to support the efforts of Montana TCUs by enriching language instructors' and activists' experience through an exchange of ideas and knowledge with instructors and training partners from UM, CDKC and the American Indian Language Institute (AILDI) of the University of Arizona. The proposed activities foster a positive relationship across institutions and will help identify current issues that may become the focus of future training workshops. The project's broader impacts include building the capacity of language documentation programs at Montana TCUs, enhancing STEM education through technology utilized in language documentation and education, and serving underrepresented populations who often have difficulty accessing training due to the remoteness of their locations. <br/><br/>This collaborative project seeks to cultivate common ground for communication across institutional boundaries. It aims to promote the idea that an increased knowledge of linguistics, as a science, can benefit TCU programs related to indigenous language sustainability as well as the idea that linguistics can benefit from community input. The indigenous languages spoken in Montana are from four different families: Algonquian, Salishan, Siouan, and Kootenai, an isolate. Because of this, the proposed project will advance our knowledge of the linguistics of these languages. The project is also innovative in applying collaboration among linguists and community language researchers, a method known as Community Based Research (CBR) in a way that fosters and enhances our understanding of these languages' phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax and semantics through the lens of traditional environmental knowledge and ethnosciences. A collaborative team, consisting of four language activists from indigenous communities and four non-indigenous linguists, will travel to TCUs in Montana to learn about the current efforts and future goals of their language activities. The collaborative team will then host meetings with selected participants from the Montana TCUs for further discussions. Results will be compiled from these activities feed into future documentation research and indigenous language education through workshops that will circulate the information back to indigenous communities. These project outcomes have the potential to implement indigenous ways of knowing into language documentation projects."

The field of marine silicon isotope biogeochemistry is about 20 years old having been pioneered by the lead investigator in the early 1990s. The UC Santa Barbara facility remains the only capability for such measurements in the U.S., although the field has grown to where over 18 laboratories from 8 countries are now measuring silicon isotopes in marine systems. Silicon isotopes are a powerful tool for understanding the marine silica cycle and the contribution of plankton with silica shells to marine biogeochemistry. Variations in isotopes of silicon in biogenic silica and in dissolved silicic acid are used to constrain net silica production rates in the modern ocean. Measurement of the isotopic composition of diatom frustules and of sponge spicules recovered from marine sediments are used to reconstruct the history of diatom productivity in surface waters and changes in deep water silicic acid content over geologic time. <br/><br/>For this second-generation silicon isotope system, the investigator is partnering with Nu Instruments, Ltd. to create a commercially available instrument based on the Nu Perspective isotope ratio mass spectrometer, with a custom inlet system resulting from modifying the Nu Carb and/or the Eurovector pyrolysis inlet system(s). The two main goals for the new instrument are 1) to increase sample throughput by a factor of four and 2) to lower sample size by an order of magnitude. To meet these goals both acid and thermal decomposition of silicon fluorides to generate the analyte SiF4 gas will be explored. The second generation system should be faster, as or more precise, and much easier to use for the novice compared to the original prototype and compared to alternatives like MC-ICP-MS. Success in this development will restore routine measurements of isotopes of silicon from marine systems in the United States. By partnering with Nu Instruments, a commercial instrument will be produced that will be available to all at relatively low cost compared to competing technologies like MC-ICP-MS, contributing to national and international capacity building in this field. Finally, achieving higher sample throughput would both lower costs and facilitate the ability to make the proposed instrument available to others, further accelerating progress in the field."

Consequently, lack of iron in large regions of the global ocean limits phytoplankton growth and commercial fisheries. Ocean acidification (OA) is the ongoing decrease in seawater pH due to the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. OA is predicted to affect seawater chemistry by reducing the concentration of carbonate ions. Carbonate ions are required for  phytoplankton to take up iron from their environment, which suggests that OA might inhibit iron nutrition. Further complicating the scenario, pH changes affect iron chemistry in seawater, such that OA is predicted to shift the relative abundance of various forms of iron. But despite these expectations, little is known about how the changes in ocean chemistry due to OA will impact the availability of iron to phytoplankton. Changes in phytoplankton iron uptake and associated growth rates would likely have large effects on how the ocean captures atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This has important consequences for ecosystem productivity and for global cycles of critical chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their chemistry. This project aims to help us understand how shifts in seawater pH and the chemistry of dissolved inorganic carbon will affect both iron uptake rates and iron acquisition strategies in the laboratory and in natural communities. This project also includes development of educational outreach activities which target primary school students in the areas of microbiology, biogeochemical cycles and current global change topics. These science outreach activities  benefit from collaborations with the following San Diego-based organizations: the League of Extraordinary Scientists and Engineers (LXS), The Birch Aquarium at Scripps (BAS), and The Ocean Discovery Institute (ODI).<br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the differential sensitivity of diatom iron acquisition strategies to changes in seawater pH and carbonate chemistry. Ultimately a more thorough and detailed mechanistic understanding of diatom iron uptake pathways will facilitate a much-improved ability to forecast the impact of anticipated changes in ocean pH and inorganic carbon chemistry on rates of iron uptake by diatoms. This critical biogeochemical issue is addressed through trace metal clean manipulation experiments incorporating state-of-the-art analytical methodology to probe phytoplankton cellular physiology and biogeochemistry in laboratory cultures and natural communities. In the first year, laboratory experiments with a model pennate diatom leverage a collection of targeted knockout transgenic lines to evaluate the substrate specificity and relative importance of distinct iron assimilation pathways under a range of pCO2 and iron availability conditions. Additionally, quantitation of mRNA and proteins for key diatom iron assimilation pathways in natural communities in the Southern California Current further clarify the relative importance and sensitivity of distinct iron assimilation pathways in relation to pCO2 and iron availability. In year two a Lagrangian study of iron uptake rates and associated mRNA and protein abundance is performed on upwelled high pCO2 water over the course of offshore advection. Additionally, the investigators are conducting mesocosm experiments using naturally elevated high pCO2 seawater as well as laboratory experiments on multiplex knockout lines.  Year three is dedicated to data analyses and overall project synthesis. Overall aims of the research activities include, 1) development and validation of a refined conceptual model of iron uptake in key marine phytoplankton and subsequent utilization of the model to characterize the sensitivity of distinct iron uptake pathways to the effects of ocean acidification, and 2) determination of the effects of acidification on iron uptake, and quantification of the relative contribution of distinct iron acquisition pathways in high pCO2 phytoplankton communities."

Does a dominant individual lead the group, or can multiple individuals contribute to decision-making?  This doctoral dissertation project will investigate group decision-making in wild spider monkeys, who frequently split into smaller groups and re-form the larger group (fission-fusion) when feeding. The investigator hypothesizes that fission-fusion social grouping is driven by the energetic needs of multiple individuals and promotes egalitarian social organization (equal power among individuals). How groups decide when and where to move in their habitat and who exerts the most influence is vital to identifying the costs and benefits of group living, and this research will provide insight into the emergence of egalitarian social dynamics in human societies. This project will support academic training and mentorship for students under-represented in STEM fields, thereby fostering interest in the sciences at the K-12 level and providing field research opportunities for undergraduate students. Additionally, this project will promote international collaborations, hands-on workshops, and public science seminars.<br/><br/>A key challenge to studying how group decisions are made is determining the motivations driving individuals' decisions, and thus the link between individual needs and collective action. Some evidence suggests that fission-fusion social organization may promote egalitarian social norms by allowing individuals to split away from despotic group members when decisions about what to do or where to go do not align with their individual needs. Using wild black-handed spider monkeys as a model system, this study combines well-established observational field methods of behavior, foraging theory models, and laboratory techniques for quantifying energy balance, to provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the collective decision-making process in fission-fusion societies. The investigator will collect observational data on leadership and decision-making and analytical data on individual energetic state as indicated by C-peptide analysis of non-invasively collected urine samples. The project will address three main hypotheses: 1) spider monkeys engage in shared decision-making, 2) groups tend to fission when conflicts between individuals are high, and 3) individuals lead according to their physiological need as opposed to dominance or social power."

Discovering how infants develop the ability to categorize is important for advancing scientific knowledge about early cognitive development. This project will analyze the rapid development of categorization that occurs in mid- to late-infancy. Multiple measures will be used to determine: (1) the effects of attention on categorization in early development, and (2) areas of the brain involved in categorization in infancy. This research will illuminate how attention influences infant categorization and will use neuroimaging to identify areas of the brain involved in categorization at different ages in infancy. This project will have broader impacts by providing insight into long-standing debates about the basic nature of categorization throughout the life-span and by providing many important training opportunities. Several graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in developmental cognitive neuroscience, which will increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Additionally, the research team will actively engage in community outreach to increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science.  <br/><br/>This project has three major aims that will be addressed in two experiments on 6-, 9-, and 12-month-old infants. Aim 1 is to determine the effects of attention on infant categorization of faces and objects, using simultaneous measures of heart rate changes associated with attention and electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of attention and categorization. Aim 2 is to determine how learning conditions affect infant attention and categorization, by varying the learning conditions infants experience prior to EEG testing. Aim 3 is to determine which areas of the brain are involved in categorization in infancy, using computational modeling of EEG data.  Infants are expected to show enhanced brain activity involved in categorization during attention, and areas of prefrontal cortex are expected to be involved in categorization only in older infants with more advanced categorization skills."

This impacts almost every field of modern human life, such as health care, military applications, smart cities, transportation, networks, etc. To quickly analyse and organise such huge amounts of data, one needs to develop space and time efficient algorithms, that accelerate the search for information while minimising memory requirements. This project aims to develop space-efficient similarity filters, which quickly filter out queries that have very little similarity from the records existing in the database. This has applications in security, databases, machine learning, file systems, vision, pattern recognition, compression and networks. Apart from the targeted impact of these applications to society, this project also aims at producing the next generation of researchers and promoting under-represented groups in science and technology. Minority undergraduate and high school students will be involved in this project. Queens College, CUNY is a diverse institution, representing a wide range of ethnic minorities and has 28% Hispanic students. In an effort to engage more undergraduate students and women in research (Queens College has roughly 56% female students), the PI plans to offer a new course that develops an understanding of approximate membership and similarity search data structures in the setting of big data.<br/><br/><br/>Similarity searching is a fundamental problem in this context, where a massive data of records needs to be organised so as to answer quickly queries of the form: given a record, is it similar to some record in the data? Similarity search, modeled as near(est) neighbor search (NNS) is an important and well-studied problem with numerous applications: Given a set P of n points lying in some d-dimensional metric space, the goal is to preprocess P so as to return for a given query point q the point p in P that is closest to q. Exact versions of this problem are hard to solve, and all solutions to the approximate version of the problem require superlinear (more than nd) space. This space usage is prohibitive for many big data settings, where not just n, but d could be huge (e.g., the number of pixels in an image). This project is aimed at developing the theory and applications of Similarity Filters, which are decision (yes/no) based data structures. Given a query q, a (c, r)-similarity filter always returns yes if q is within a distance r of some input point, and returns no with a small error probability (thus some false positives are allowed) if all input points are at least cr away from the query. Recent results from the researcher shows that such filters can be built with sublinear (asymptotically less than nd) space. The project takes on two tasks: 1) to understand the approximation factor-space-query tradeoff for similarity filters, developing tight upper and lower bounds, especially in the sublinear space regime, and 2) to develop I/O efficient Similarity Filters and nearest neighbor data structures, akin to quotient or cascade filters for the approximate membership problem (where the in-RAM Bloom Filter is the standard data structure, used in many networking applications). The overarching goal is to use similarity filters on RAM in conjunction with a disk-based data structure: faraway queries will be filtered quickly, and nearby queries will have their neighbor(s) returned following a slower but cache friendly search. The availability of such a two-layered space-and-time-efficient data structure will greatly boost the scope of applications when the amount of data is massive, especially in databases, networks, security and machine learning."

It fills a research gap by focusing on extreme heat in rural and agricultural communities. Extreme heat events are a risk to public health, livestock, crops, and economies. This study will examine two different approaches to rural adaptation to extreme heat. While rural communities in each place face similar climate-related challenges, there are crucial differences in the roles that rural landowners take within environmental and climate change governance. This study will compare the extreme heat adaptation measures that are taking shape in two places to understand how national and state-level policies interact with local cultures and values to create distinctive approaches. The study will lead to recommendations and best practice examples that will be of interest to emergency planners, policy makers, local governments, and rural residents. <br/><br/>The research uses an interpretative and comparative case study approach, focusing on two regions.  Data will be gathered to answer the following research questions: 1) What factors are shaping the extreme heat adaptation policies in each region? 2) How do local knowledge and social orders shape the implementation of climate adaptation programs that are developed on the regional/national scale? 3) What role do and could local actors play in shaping the response strategies to environmental hazards, such as heat, and their implementation ? and how can their stronger involvement as community leaders strengthen these solutions? Data collection will involve participant observation of public meetings and hearings, an analysis of public records and publicly available materials/data, and interviews. Interviews will be conducted with three different categories of participants: regulators and policymakers (such as policy analysts, adaptation program coordinators, public officials), scientists and agricultural professionals, and rural residents (such as local community leaders, advocates, participants in public meetings). The results of this investigation will make a novel contribution by revealing how the problem of extreme heat is being addressed in rural communities that have locally-specific challenges and priorities."

Advanced lithium batteries for vehicles and energy storage could improve domestic energy security, but their use is mainly limited by undesirable chemical side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface.  This project seeks to fundamentally understand the reactions at this interface during battery operation.   This fundamental understanding will help resolve the issues of battery stability and overall battery performance. The education and outreach activities associated with this project are to (i) provide hands-on experience to high school students and middle school students, (ii) engage undergraduate students in cutting-edge research activities with strong emphasis on the involvement of underrepresented students in STEM and (iii) provide innovation and entrepreneurship exposure to graduate students.<br/><br/>While Li-S batteries have been extensively explored, many aspects of the mechanisms of polysulfide redox reactions at solid/liquid electrolyte interfaces remain unclear. In the absence of detailed mechanistic understanding, rational design of electrode architectures has been difficult. The technical objective of this project is to map the temporal and spatial evolution of polysulfide speciation during the charge/discharge process in a Li-S battery through use of in-situ scanning electrochemical microscopy methods coupled with Raman spectroscopy (SECM-Raman). The research program is underpinned by two guiding hypotheses; (1) measuring interfacial properties will allow for mechanistic elucidation of (electro)chemical reaction pathways and provide information on kinetics of polysulfide dissolution-disproportionation-precipitation and (2) elucidating the reaction mechanism will control the electrochemical interface and thereby polysulfide-shuttle with an appropriate material design. The successful completion of the project is expected to (i) enhance fundamental understanding of interactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface at the nanoscale level with high spatiotemporal resolution using a new analytical tool, (ii) map the interaction of polysulfides with the electrode surface and with electrolyte solvents under transient conditions with a high temporal resolution,  and (iii) define the role of catalysts and the rate-limiting step in the overall polysulfide redox process to assess superior performance of materials for Li-S batteries. The resulting mechanistic elucidation of sulfur (electro)chemical reactions occurring at the interfaces will provide new insight into Li-S redox chemistry and will allow for detailed mapping of the spatial and temporal evolution of the polysulfide shuttle; a core issue in the Li-S system."

That is, given that the phonetic motivations for a sound change may be present in multiple phonological environments (the adjacent sounds), why is the change observed in one environment and not the others? This project will address this question through an examination of /s/-retraction, an ongoing sound change in American English in which /s/ is pronounced as /sh/ in /str/ words (such that 'street' is pronounced as 'shtreet') but rarely in /spr/ and /skr/ words ('scream' is not pronounced as 'shcream' and 'spree' is not pronounced as 'shpree'). The results of this project will most directly influence the scientific understanding of /s/-retraction narrowly and sound change and its initiation and propagation more broadly, but can potentially contribute to developments in related fields and industries. By examining individual variation, these findings may offer insights into first and/or second language acquisition and may aid in the development of speech recognition systems that are faster and more accurate for a greater number of users, especially those with non-standard accents.<br/><br/>This project will examine participants' production and perception of /s/ in these environments in order to better understand the observed asymmetries in /s/-retraction. For this project, participants will listen to auditory prompts containing /s/ in different phonological environments corresponding to visually presented images, and in turn give oral instructions for the computer to select the correct image. This design has two important components: firstly, it is a lexical decision task, meaning that the participant has to select the best meaning (represented by the images) given the possibly ambiguous or unexpected acoustic signal (auditory instructions). Secondly, the task encourages phonetic accommodation, the process by which a speaker begins to sound more like their interlocutor (the model talker giving instructions), which can provide insight into how sound changes propagate across a speech community. Throughout the experiment, three simultaneous measurements will be collected: audio recording, ultrasound imaging of the tongue, and eye gaze tracking. Ultrasound imaging will elucidate the varying articulations of /s/ in different phonological environments and will also provide novel evidence for the articulatory reality of phonetic accommodation. Eye gaze measurements will provide information about listeners' use of /s/ variation in real time. These measurements will be collected simultaneously in order to examine the relationship between participants' production and perception of /s/ in these environments."

Grotesque visuals are frequently used in persuasive messages to depict dire need and influence concern for the welfare of others. Yet, little is known about the potential for disgust to motivate prosocial behavior. Increasing reliance on the goodwill of private citizens to mitigate social ills, and the important role persuasive messages play in motivating such behavior, heightens the need for inquiries into the effects and potential consequences of persuasive strategies employing visceral emotion. In addition to informing our understanding of the persuasive potential of disgust, this research contributes to basic knowledge about how moral action is motivated within individuals by exploring the interaction of emotive and cognitive factors.<br/><br/>Emotion research has often connected disgust to anti-social judgments and rejection behavior. Disgust inductions in these studies are, however, usually incidental or irrelevant to the decision task. In contrast, integral emotion inductions, such as the depiction of disease in a persuasive appeal, are triggered by the decision situation and are relevant to the decision task. Therefore, integral disgust may have different effects on message processing and behavioral outcomes. This research explores processes by which disgust may trigger prosocial responses. A key features of these controlled experiments include the use of the classic ""dictator game"" to measure behavior and social judgment tasks to explore potential unintended consequences of disgust in the context of prosocial persuasion. <br/>A first experiment tests the assumption that disgust is insensitive to context by examining information processing effects when disgust cues are used in a prosocial persuasive message (integral emotion) compared to when disgust cues are not connected to the decision-making context (incidental emotion). A subsequent experiment compares the differential effects of grotesque versus clean portrayals of need and tests for a sleeper effect of disgust. Whereas, study 1 addresses the question of whether persuasive arguments may alter emotional appraisals, study 2 examines whether these responses change over time."

Previous studies on the extratropical impact on the tropics have remained largely qualitative in nature and from the fully coupled ocean-atmosphere perspective. As such, the impact of extratropical climate on tropical climate has remained largely unexplored. The goal of this project is to investigate the extratropical impact on tropical climate with the focus on quantifying extratropical influences of tropical climate and its variability. The project will use a novel modeling approach called Regional Coupled Data Assimilation (RCDA) approach, which combines coupled data assimilation with coupled climate dynamics, to assess and understand the extratropical climate impact on tropical climate for the real world. In RCDA, observations in the extratropics are assimilated in climate models while the tropical ocean-atmosphere processes remain fully coupled. This allows the quantitative assessment and understanding of the extratropical impacts on both tropical climatology and tropical climate variability, such as ENSO. The research team will also explore the extratropical impact on the tropical bias in coupled general circulation models. <br/><br/>The funded research represents a systematic study of the extratropical impact on tropical climate and tropical climate variability that combines coupled data assimilation with coupled climate dynamics. This work will develop a new modeling strategy to assess and understand the impact of extratropical climate variability on tropical climatology and climate variability. This understanding will help further improve climate models for climate predictions, future climate projections, and, in turn, their societal impacts. This project will train two graduate students."

Using a panarchy model of resilience, which recognizes the ongoing tensions between stability and change, this project seeks to understand how events of varied temporal and spatial and speeds can reciprocally influence produce unpredictable outcomes. The project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating findings to organizations engaged in modeling socio-ecological resilience and mitigating the impacts of environmental change. <br/><br/>Emily Hite, under the supervision of Dr. Jerry Jacka of the University of Colorado at Boulder, will explore the processes by which a diversity of perspectives at multiple scales inform the development and implementation of policy, and the ways in which policy implementation relates to social-ecological resiliency and the production of space and place through time. The research will be conducted in Costa Rica, an ideal site for asking these questions because it is an international leader in renewable energy production and sustainable development, and a policy commitment to becoming one of the world's first carbon neutral countries. This plan relies on completing the Diqus Hydroelectric Project in southwestern Puntarenas Province. However, the Trraba indigenous peoples living in the area have conflicting perspectives regarding the project's potential social, environmental, and economic transformations on their culture, livelihoods, and landscape. The researchers will conduct anthropological research in Trraba and the capital, San Jos, to better understand the diversity of perspectives of and responses to climate policy, how they are formed, and how they inform policy development. The research team will collect social, ecological, and ethnographic data using participant observation, interviews, household surveys, focus groups, and surveys of plant and animal species used by Trraba peoples. The diversity of qualitative and quantitative data will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how local people are impacted by universal climate policy mechanisms and attempts at the nation-state level to implement those mechanisms."

Total organic carbon and pyrogenic carbon (i.e. derived from burned biomass) will be measured in these samples and compared with quantities of these components in water of these streams prior to the fire, and in streams of adjoining watersheds not affected by the fire. The objective of these measurements is to determine the influence of fire on the supply and composition of dissolved organic matter to the ocean. In particular, the investigator wishes to know whether dissolved pyrogenic carbon will be exported to the ocean as this is a controversial scientific subject. If dissolved pyrogenic C is as abundant and mobile as recent studies suggest, it may have a strong impact on marine chemistry, long-term C cycling and associated climate changes and pollutant transport. On the other hand, if pyrogenic C is not detected in the creeks draining these burned watershed in amounts greater than that of the unburned watersheds, biogeochemists will have to question the methods currently used as markers for fire-produced organic matter. Another important impact of the project will be to provide the opportunity for a graduate student to add a field component to his dissertation research on dissolved pyrogenic carbon.<br/><br/>While knowledge of the properties of pyrogenic solids has increased in recent years, there has been relatively little study of the properties and cycling of pyrogenic dissolved organic matter. The method most commonly used for pyrogenic dissolved organic carbon (pyDOC) analysis involves the oxidation of condensed aromatic constituents into smaller, quantifiable monomers (i.e., benzenepolycarboxylic acids or BPCAs).  Using this method, it has been suggested that pyDOC represents a constant proportion of riverine DOC globally (~10% pyDOC/DOC). This conclusion is problematic since one would expect this ratio to vary with regional climate and burning regimes. It may be that all these previous measurements were made in fairly large rivers, i.e. large watersheds, so the effects of fire have been hidden by other variations in biomass growth, precipitation etc. Also, pyC may be continually released from charcoals made during past fires. The Thomas fire of December 2017 provides an ideal scenario for detecting and characterizing pyC export from terrestrial to marine systems. There are several short-run creeks draining coastal catchments along the Santa Barbara Channel that have small watershed completely within the burned area, and similar creeks in several adjoining watershed that saw no fire for the past 60 years due to fire suppression. The investigator also has access to water samples that have been in storage from these creeks taken prior to the Thomas fire. There is probably no better scenario for detecting indisputable evidence for, or against, the claim of significant export of pyrogenic C to the ocean, as well as quantifying that export flux if it exists."

Among the effects of continental drift are the formation of mountain belts and volcanoes, the spread and extinction of biodiversity, and changes in climate at the local and global scales. Continents on Earth may move via one of two fundamentally different processes. The more familiar mechanism, known as plate tectonics, involves the differential motion of continents relative to each other. The second, less well-understood process is known as true polar wander (TPW), wherein the entire Earth rotates as a single unit such that the location of the present pole is transferred to a lower latitude. Theoretical studies show that TPW should have strong effects on the global environment, including regional sea-level changes of >100 m and drift of land surface across multiple, contrasting climate zones. However, the cause, rate, and even the existence of large-scale TPW events in Earth history have been controversial. Here we will measure the magnetism of rocks from the Late Jurassic (~165-150 million years before present) and pursue theoretical geodynamical computations to characterize the motion of the Earth during this most recent proposed episode of TPW. The results will have important implications for understanding the drivers of observed sea-level and climate changes throughout geologic time and for elucidating a fundamental process by which the global geography of the Earth evolves.<br/><br/>This project is divided into two closely coupled parts that use complementary techniques to understand Jurassic TPW. First, the investigators will collect paleomagnetic rock samples from the La Negra Formation of Northern Chile and the Chon Aike province of Patagonian Argentina to quantify the position of continents during the 165-150 million year ago (Ma) interval, which has been identified by previous studies as the most recent time interval of potentially large amplitude (about 30 degrees) TPW. These rock units represent the most continuous deposits of igneous rocks from the candidate TPW interval, which implies the highest likelihood of recovering high precision paleogeographical information using paleomagnetic techniques. As part of this experimental component of this project, the team will collect samples for geochronological analysis using Ar-Ar and U-Pb in zircon techniques, which would provide more reliable rates of motion during this time span. Second, they will simulate the polar wander of the Earth using existing geodynamical code that accounts for the motion of mass anomalies in the mantle and lateral variations in the lithospheric strength of the Earth. A second, coupled geodynamical code will compute the expected changes in regional sea-level caused by the TPW motion. Combined with experimental data, these models will narrow the range of possible drivers of Late Jurassic TPW and evaluate its potential effect on records of climate and sea-level."

Consequently, lack of iron in large regions of the global ocean limits phytoplankton growth and commercial fisheries. Ocean acidification (OA) is the ongoing decrease in seawater pH due to the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. OA is predicted to affect seawater chemistry by reducing the concentration of carbonate ions. Carbonate ions are required for  phytoplankton to take up iron from their environment, which suggests that OA might inhibit iron nutrition. Further complicating the scenario, pH changes affect iron chemistry in seawater, such that OA is predicted to shift the relative abundance of various forms of iron. But despite these expectations, little is known about how the changes in ocean chemistry due to OA will impact the availability of iron to phytoplankton. Changes in phytoplankton iron uptake and associated growth rates would likely have large effects on how the ocean captures atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This has important consequences for ecosystem productivity and for global cycles of critical chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their chemistry. This project aims to help us understand how shifts in seawater pH and the chemistry of dissolved inorganic carbon will affect both iron uptake rates and iron acquisition strategies in the laboratory and in natural communities. This project also includes development of educational outreach activities which target primary school students in the areas of microbiology, biogeochemical cycles and current global change topics. These science outreach activities  benefit from collaborations with the following San Diego-based organizations: the League of Extraordinary Scientists and Engineers (LXS), The Birch Aquarium at Scripps (BAS), and The Ocean Discovery Institute (ODI).<br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the differential sensitivity of diatom iron acquisition strategies to changes in seawater pH and carbonate chemistry. Ultimately a more thorough and detailed mechanistic understanding of diatom iron uptake pathways will facilitate a much-improved ability to forecast the impact of anticipated changes in ocean pH and inorganic carbon chemistry on rates of iron uptake by diatoms. This critical biogeochemical issue is addressed through trace metal clean manipulation experiments incorporating state-of-the-art analytical methodology to probe phytoplankton cellular physiology and biogeochemistry in laboratory cultures and natural communities. In the first year, laboratory experiments with a model pennate diatom leverage a collection of targeted knockout transgenic lines to evaluate the substrate specificity and relative importance of distinct iron assimilation pathways under a range of pCO2 and iron availability conditions. Additionally, quantitation of mRNA and proteins for key diatom iron assimilation pathways in natural communities in the Southern California Current further clarify the relative importance and sensitivity of distinct iron assimilation pathways in relation to pCO2 and iron availability. In year two a Lagrangian study of iron uptake rates and associated mRNA and protein abundance is performed on upwelled high pCO2 water over the course of offshore advection. Additionally, the investigators are conducting mesocosm experiments using naturally elevated high pCO2 seawater as well as laboratory experiments on multiplex knockout lines.  Year three is dedicated to data analyses and overall project synthesis. Overall aims of the research activities include, 1) development and validation of a refined conceptual model of iron uptake in key marine phytoplankton and subsequent utilization of the model to characterize the sensitivity of distinct iron uptake pathways to the effects of ocean acidification, and 2) determination of the effects of acidification on iron uptake, and quantification of the relative contribution of distinct iron acquisition pathways in high pCO2 phytoplankton communities."

Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies."

Einstein's general relativity, which is currently our best description of gravity, is fundamentally incompatible with quantum mechanics.  It is therefore imperative that we subject gravity to the most stringent tests available. Lunar laser ranging (LLR), in which short laser pulses launched from a telescope are bounced off reflectors placed on the moon by U.S. astronauts and Soviet landers, has for decades produced some of the leading tests of gravity by mapping the shape of the lunar orbit to high precision. Since 2006, an experiment called APOLLO (the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation) has been collecting the best LLR data in the world, in terms of both data volume and precision. In 2016, an upgrade allowed APOLLO to guarantee accuracy at the millimeter level - the first time this capability has existed anywhere.  This project will capitalize on this new capability.  Besides its fundamental impact to all areas of cosmology, this project has a strong footprint in training students and in communicating the excitement of science to the public.<br/><br/>This effort seeks to collect the first-ever set of millimeter-accurate LLR data using APOLLO.  Besides continuing to collect the most accurate LLR data ever obtained, this involves developing techniques to calibrate APOLLO range data against the newly-installed absolute calibration system and to characterize APOLLO performance and systematic errors.  Additionally, site geodetic measurements will be collected by an on-site superconducting gravimeter and a nearby global positioning system station, incorporating these data into the LLR analysis in order to constrain motion of the ground."

ENSO has a dramatic impact on the climate of the Galapagos Islands, and this impact is preserved in paleoclimate records from the archipelago. But published paleoclimate records from the Galapagos yield disagreeing versions of the islands' recent climate history, including the magnitude of recent warming and the range and timing of ENSO variability. <br/><br/>To resolve these disagreements, this project will develop reconstructions of regional sea surface temperature using the isotope geochemistry of long-lived, annually banded corals. With these records, which directly track ocean conditions, important questions about recent climate variability and change in this iconic region can be addressed. For example, is the Galapagos warming as fast as the rest of the world? What is the history of El Nio variability in the region? Do changes in this region coincide with periods of higher-latitude climate variability such as cooler (""Little Ice Age"") conditions between 1500-1850? Understanding the full range of ENSO variability and ongoing trends is important locally, for improving conservation planning and climate adaptation efforts in the Galapagos National Park and Marine Protected Area.

Their close integration with high-performance multi-core CPU architectures is also allowing very efficient heterogeneous computing. Going forward, it is imperative that such GPU-based systems scale both in terms of performance and energy efficiency to meet the exascale (and beyond) computing demands of the future. However, sustained scaling of these systems is challenging primarily because a) fabricating a single large die provides very low yield, making it prohibitively expensive, b) memory hierarchy remains a critical performance and energy efficiency bottleneck, and c) programmability and application scalability is hindered by inefficiencies in the shared virtual memory and multi-application support.<br/><br/>This project seeks to address these scalability challenges by rethinking the design of future large-scale GPU-based systems. In particular, this research project revolves around three major components: a) design space exploration of cores (including their organization) and the entire memory hierarchy, b) development of data movement optimization techniques by identifying and then exploiting cache locality via novel synergistic caching and scheduling techniques, and c) improving resource utilization of large-scale system resources by enhancing shared virtual memory and multi-application execution support. All three research components will be evaluated on a newly-developed comprehensive evaluation infrastructure. The findings of this research will be incorporated into new and existing undergraduate and graduate courses. It is expected that the insights resulting from this research would have a long-term positive impact on GPU-based computing, thereby making our daily lives more productive."

These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.<br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment."

Does the extent of destruction matter? Does a totally destroyed community rebuild in the same way and as successfully as a less extensively damaged one? The research supported by this award addresses these questions through an ethnographic study of post-disaster community rebuilding. The researcher takes up the questions by looking at the what it means to reconstitute a place, not just as a physical location but as site where people can once again feel at home. In the wake of multiple disasters that have torn people from their homes and damaged communities throughout the United States, people are asking if they can return, if they should return, if indeed there is a community to return to. It is critical that policy makers and social scientists better understand what it will take to put people's lives back together, not just as households but also as communities. <br/><br/>The research will be carried out by University of Kentucky anthropology doctoral student, Pathmanesan Sanmugeswaran, who is supervised by Dr. Mark Whitaker. The research takes a comparative design approach.  The researcher has identified two post-disaster communities in Sri Lanka. One community was totally destroyed and the inhabitants are returning to rebuild after 26 years, and the other was physically damaged and social disrupted but nonetheless remained intact. This contrast in an otherwise similar socio-cultural and geographic environmental context provides a scientifically useful and rare experimental opportunity that would not be available in the United States, although the results will be generalizable to many other contexts. Data will be gathered through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and cultural mapping. Sampling will be structured to represent the full range of socio-cultural variation, including caste, gender, and age. Particular attention will be paid to how traditional notions of community, which centered around combined ideas of community and religion, are remade in the two contrasting post-disaster situations."

Nevertheless, the emergent big-data era poses key conceptual challenges: several existing graph-based methods used in practice exhibit unreasonably high running time; several other methods operate in the absence of correctness guarantees. These challenges severely imperil the safety and reliability of higher-level decision-making systems of which they are a part. This research introduces an innovative new computational framework for graph learning and inference that addresses these challenges. Specific applications studied in this project include: better approaches for monitoring roadway congestion and identify traffic incidents in a timely manner; root-cause analysis of complex events in social networks; and design of better personalized learning systems, lowering educational costs and increasing quality nationwide. Activities include integrated programs to increase participation of women and under-represented minorities in the computational sciences. <br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the investigator pursues three research themes: (i) designing scalable non-convex algorithms for learning the edges (and weights) of an unknown graph given a sequence of independent static and/or time-varying local measurements; (ii) designing new approximation algorithms for utilizing the structure of a given graph to enable scalable post-hoc decision making in complex systems; (iii) developing provable algorithms for training special families of artificial neural networks, and filling gaps between rigorous theory and practice of neural network learning. Progress in each of the above themes will be extensively evaluated using real-world data from engineering applications including social network data, highway monitoring data, and fluid-flow simulation data. Collaborations with domain experts in each of these application areas will ensure that the new theory, tools, and software emerging from this project will lead to meaningful societal benefits."

This five-day meeting and the associated Research Seminar brings together researchers to present results and engage in discussions on the cell and circuit properties of thalamocortical interactions, and build on these to explore their roles in cognition and behavior and how their dysfunction manifests in disease. This conference represents a rare opportunity for neuroscientists interested in thalamocortical interactions to exchange new results, hypotheses, and ideas at many levels, from cellular through systems to cognitive and clinical. With respect to broader impacts, this meeting will benefit the larger community in multiple ways. First, it will help train and inspire the next generation of scientists by exposing students and postdoctoral fellows to exciting science and scientists. Second, special emphasis will be given to junior faculty. Finally, a concerted effort will be made to recruit scientists from under-represented groups and targeted mentoring sessions will help the junior scientists in their career paths.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this meeting derives from its small size, which promotes interactions between participants, and the assembly of many top scientists whose research spans thalamocortical interactions across multiple sensory modalities, emphasizing the commonalities. This combination leads to fruitful comparative analyses, raises new questions about underlying mechanisms and often leads to new collaborations. By maximizing both formal discussion and informal interactions, the Gordon Conference and Research Seminar will highlight exciting new developments that have implications both for a basic understanding of the emergent properties of neural circuits as well as pathologies that involve thalamocortical disruptions. This is especially timely because this field has been expanding significantly with the recent appreciation that the thalamus plays an ongoing and critical role in cortical functioning."

The primary focus of these areas is the study of high-dimensionality; the consideration often focuses around geometric objects such as convex bodies and hypersurfaces, convex and concave functions, as well as random vectors with certain geometric characteristics. Our experience in low dimensions seems to suggest that when the dimension becomes very large, the geometric properties of objects become more and more complicated and difficult to study. However, many nice, and sometimes surprising, properties arise in high dimensions. Such properties are informally called ``high-dimensional phenomenon''. The study of this phenomenon has been crucial for many applications in computer science, in particular in questions regarding the speed of certain algorithms, as well as in data science. The educational component of this project focuses on supporting junior researchers, with the particular emphasis placed on encouraging female mathematicians. The principal investigator will organize two workshops for junior researchers, featuring research discussions during allocated time, and short lecture courses by leading experts in the field. These workshops are designed to help junior mathematicians to develop new interests and create new collaborations. In addition, a seminar for women in mathematics in Northern Georgia is run by the principal investigator jointly with Yulia Babenko from Kennesaw State University.<br/><br/>The principal investigator has been working on several aspects of the geometry in high dimensions. An important direction of this project concerns the study of the inequalities of Brunn-Minkowski type.

The techniques involved in studying such questions involve ideas from Harmonic Analysis and Convex Geometry. In addition, the principal investigator shall continue to study small-ball inequalities and their applications to Information theory. One of the important objects studied by the principal investigator in the past is the noise sensitivity of distributions with respect to convex sets, and the principal investigator shall continue to study this quantity and its relations to the central problems in the field. Finally, a different aspect of the project concerns combinatorial properties of convex sets, such as the illumination number. The principal investigator has studied this number in the past, and is working on improving current known estimates on this quantity."

Internationally, there is broad recognition that far too narrow a segment of the population is deeply engaged with and knowledgeable about STEM. This narrow engagement negatively affects the prospects of individuals across the globe. Diversifying the pool of children and young adults deeply engaged with STEM, and providing them with well-supported opportunities for deeper learning in STEM, will promote the progress of STEM by positively impacting research and development. Diversity of thought, perspective, experience and quality of preparation improve innovation and the quality of STEM research. The workshop and its products will advance STEM education by enhancing scholars' knowledge of relevant research on diversifying and deepening engagement and learning, and by creating stronger ties among researchers with common interests in and commitment to these issues. STEM education efforts sparked by this workshop will advance national health, prosperity, and welfare by improving individuals' quality of life and enabling broader public participation in democratic processes that are informed by STEM. <br/><br/>The workshop involves a select group of influential scholars from the U.S. and Netherlands whose work contributes to innovative research and development on STEM education both within and beyond schools. The workshop's theme refers to the key goal of diversifying the pool of young people deeply engaged with STEM, including groups historically underrepresented globally and in each nation, while also fostering deeper STEM learning. Throughout the workshop, participants will examine two questions: (1) What are the key social, cultural, and systemic contexts that facilitate and impede broadening STEM participation and learning? (2) How might researchers better understand them, and educators better address them? Comparative work across the U.S. and Netherlands national contexts will allow for bidirectional illumination of issues that might otherwise appear to be merely given or inevitable when examined from a single national standpoint. Gathered scholars will explore the challenges and opportunities for supporting and sustaining interest in, identification with, and deep learning of STEM among young people, through informal and formal learning opportunities. A key outcome of the workshop will be a white paper made freely and widely available to the STEM education community and the general public. The white paper will summarize existing literature and the discussion, framings, and suggestions for further research. The process of constructing and finalizing the white paper will focus the attention of participants in the workshop, and result in greater clarity about the body of theory and research that can inform educational action and future research. In addition, interest groups that form during the workshop will consider pursuing additional products that can inform the STEM education community, such as a journal special issue, an edited volume, research and practice briefs, or other collaborations."

Such acuity cannot be obtained by either telescope alone.  This challenging technique can resolve stars outside our solar system, despite their very great distances.  Such a feat is impossible with any single telescope, for which even the closest stars are still seen as unresolved points of light.  Ordinary interferometry combines the amplitudes of optical telescope signals to form an image.  This project utilizes another kind of interferometry that makes use of the quantum nature of light (photons).  This quantum approach was first demonstrated in the 1950?s.  Kieda and collaborators update this approach by using large, well-separated optical light collectors and fast, modern electronics.  They will form images of 35 bright stars over the course of a one-year observing campaign. They will use the VERITAS Observatory and their own dedicated detectors, electronics and data connectivity.  This project will serve as a technology pathfinder that may lead to a new regime in ultra-high resolution optical astronomy.<br/><br/>This project will image stars in the UV/Optical bandpass using the method of Hanbury Brown Twiss (HBT) interferometry.  This method utilizes the correlation between intensity fluctuations, also called photon bunching, that occurs when different detectors observe the same source.  In this method, the intensity correlation time series is the interferometric quantity upon which images are derived.  The main advantage of this method is that it is robust to atmospheric turbulence; however, its low inherent sensitivity demands large-area light collectors.  It also requires fast time resolution and long integration times.   Astronomical observations using HBT were done in the 1960?s and 1970?s during which time the angular diameters of more than 30 stars were measured with a resolution of 1 mas.   This method was recently demonstrated on several bright stars with modern detectors and electronics operating in the photon-counting regime.   Kieda and collaborators will use the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory telescopes to demonstrate imaging with intensity interferometry.  They have validated key technologies for measuring spatial and temporal bunching of blackbody radiation.   They have demonstrated the ability to reconstruct images using synthetic data.  Their method requires sub-nanosecond synchronization of the data acquisition from multiple detectors spaced at ~100+ meter baselines. This project has the potential to demonstrate a scalable technology and open a wide, unexplored frontier for astronomical, optical imaging with ultra-high resolution."

This will make it possible to know the concentration of several heavy metals at any given time so that treatment chemicals used to remove those metals can be metered precisely.  Current treatment methods typically rely on infrequent sampling of wastewater streams and time-delayed, labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Without the ability to measure continuously, wastewater treatment is adjusted based on periodic averages and estimated peak discharges.  To reduce the risk of regulatory violation, most wastewater treatment systems use twice the volume of treatment chemicals than might otherwise be needed.  With the ability to measure metal concentrations continuously and automatically, wastewater treatment can be controlled in real time, cutting treatment chemical costs, solid waste costs and measurement labor costs by more than 50%.  Continuous measurement also reduces the risk of regulatory violations by > 90%, in turn reducing the potential costs of remediation and compliance as well as improving environmental conditions for the general public.     <br/><br/>The key outcome of Phase I research was the successful development of 15 new chemosensors permanently bound to a substrate, each with a unique response to zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel and tin. In Phase II, responses from an array of chemosensors will be fully characterized with a prototype instrument developed for commercial use in different industrial environments.  With that instrument, a mathematical model will be constructed to accurately convert sensor responses into scientific units of measure for multiple dissolved metals. The lower limit of detection for existing sensors ranges from 5 ppb to 50 ppb.  In parallel with analytical modeling work, chemosensor synthesis work continues to lower the limit of detection to 1 ppb, extend sensor life beyond 6 months, and broaden the portfolio of sensors to improve metal selectivity.  In the future, this new class of bonded chemosensors may be extended to determine the concentration of phosphates and many other species that are currently sampled occasionally and measured with lab instruments.  For applications where continuous measurement is important, this unique family of chemosensors offers great potential for real-time process control in a variety of industrial applications."

EXERCISE is an interdisciplinary project that explores emerging paradigms in parallel computing with data and compute intensive applications in science and engineering. The goal of the project is to offer student participants, particularly from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), a valuable research experience in parallel computing. The project will promote ""parallel thinking"", an important computational thinking skill guiding current generation students into the twenty-first century computing era. The site will prioritize recruiting under-represented students and females, and attract students from local historically black college and universities (HBCUs), PUIs, and community colleges on Maryland's Eastern Shore into computational science and engineering majors and the general Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The Principal Investigator, together with faculty mentors, will supervise a 10-week REU program that gives a diverse cohort of students a taste of computational thinking in the domain of parallel computing and also an understanding of the graduate school experience. The host institution SU will collaborate with the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, an HBCU, and the University of Maryland College Park for multi-disciplinary faculty expertise and diverse summer activities including field trips, social activities, high school outreach, and graduate school application information sessions.<br/><br/>Processing complex information and large data in conventional von Neumann computer architectures is becoming increasingly difficult. Computers are undertaking a fundamental turn toward concurrency architectures such as hyperthreading, multi-core, and many-core architectures. Emerging parallel and distributed computing paradigms adapted to these concurrent architectures have begun to demonstrate the power of solving problems with large datasets and high computational complexity in a wide range of applications. However, there are fundamental difficulties in program semantics related to process interleaving: a parallel program can yield inconsistent answers, or even crash, due to unpredictable interactions between simultaneous tasks. Secondly, communication, memory access, and I/O overhead may result in run-time delays. Finally, it is difficult to ensure that programs consume resources in a manner that simultaneously achieves efficiency and meets performance goals. The REU Site will focus on four aspects of parallel computing, namely: algorithms, software, architecture and applications to address these parallel computing challenges. Students will work with faculty mentors in completing cutting-edge research projects to tackle data and compute intensive applications that emphasize the above four aspects. By the end of program, students will acquire valuable skills, gain a broader and deeper understanding of research, and develop greater confidence in their abilities. In particular, they will be exposed to emerging paradigms in parallel computing such as Map-Reduce and Graphical Processing Unit computing, and will have opportunities to explore concurrent software and multiprocessor architectures, and design efficient parallel algorithms, and to tackle data and compute intensive problems in computer and social networks, image and natural language processing, pattern recognition and machine learning."

For social scientists interested in how social media are affecting our society, these claims raise a number of important questions. How does the social media record differ from a traditional archive? How do the ""selves"" that people produce digitally compare to those they inhabit in ordinary interpersonal contexts?  The research supported by this award, which trains an American graduate student in methods of conducting empirically-grounded scientific research, will address these questions. The research is important because we need to understand all aspects of how social media affect our society and our institutions. <br/><br/>The research will be carried out by Rice University anthropology doctoral student, Baird Campbell, with the guidance of Dr. A. Cymene Howe. The researcher has chosen Santiago, Chile, as his research site. This is an appropriate site because Chile went through a marked political transition in the late 1990s. This created a unique boundary and clear contrast between past and present, and led to the rise numerous groups trying to re-write history and change their own public images through social media. The researcher will take advantage of this contrast and activism to compare traditional and official written accounts with contemporary digital archives. He also will conduct participant observation in activist groups; interview a stratified sample of group members, comparing their in-person narratives with their digital ones; conduct focus groups, stratified by age, to account for generation differences; and collect data thorough an on-line survey. Findings from this research will contribute to social science theories of the relationship between social media, social memory, and history. It will also help policy makers who must regularly evaluate the role of social media in the society at large."

For example, regulations in the water sector to preserve freshwater may restrict water usage in the power sector, likely causing reduced available generation capacities and hence jeopardizing the reliability of power systems. On the other hand, environmental policies only focused on the power sector, such as those encouraging retrofitting or installing carbon dioxide capture and sequestration capabilities to existing and new coal plants would further constrain the water system as coal plants with carbon sequestration are among the heaviest users of water. Thus, there is a clear need to better understand and manage the interdependence of critical infrastructure systems to promote sustainability across all systems, while not undermining economic and reliability considerations. This proposed work aims to address this need through the theory, modeling and computation of large-scale, interdependent complex systems by way of distributed, highly scalable computing. The results will be widely disseminated through publications and seminars. Further, the project team will leverage established institutional outreach programs to the general public, especially to high-school students and teachers, such as through the Engineering Projects In Community Service program and Purdue?s Energy Academy. <br/><br/>The grand vision of this project is to promote sustainability across interdependent systems, as well as to achieve economic efficiency and to maintain reliability through decentralized yet coordinated management of individual systems by establishing a complete modeling, analytical, and computational framework based upon the general class of augmented Lagrangian methods originating from convex optimization. While the augmented Lagrangian method is not a new algorithm, the current implementation of such algorithms has not taken advantage of its distributed feature, which would be particularly suitable to deal with large-scale, interlinked systems. One of the major goals of this work is to establish the theoretical foundations of distributed Lagrangian methods and to implement the algorithms on supercomputer clusters to demonstrate the benefits of distributed computing. This research aims to pave the way for cloud computing such that the algorithms can be used by decision-makers even without access to supercomputers. Another contribution is that the augmented Lagrangian method algorithms will be extended to incorporate stochastic data, both in terms of theoretical issues such as algorithm convergence as well as practical implementation. The computational methods will be tested and validated through real-world models of interdependent power and water systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experiments will be carried out to determine how changes in skull development alter one of the most useful biomechanical abilities to ever evolve: Jaw protrusion. One third of living vertebrates belong to two fish lineages that independently evolved the ability to project their upper jaws forward from the face during feeding. These two lineages have remarkably similar protrusion mechanisms and in both cases small changes in upper jaw shape dramatically alter protrusion distance. Fishes with extensive protrusion occupy different ecological niches than those that have limited protrusion due to specialization on different food types. Jaw protrusion does not appear until late development, usually after a pronounced metamorphosis. Thyroid hormone signaling is a major regulator of both metamorphosis and bone formation. Preliminary data demonstrate that changes in thyroid hormone levels can have pronounced effects on the development of protrusion ability. Very little is known about the controls of cranial formation during late development, yet it is during this period that most organisms begin to remodel their bodies in ways that allow them to occupy their adult ecological niches. This project has the potential to illuminate a developmental period of extreme evolutionary significance that has not yet received much investigative attention. This research is being performed in collaboration with a high-school biology teacher-scientist. Aspects of the work are being incorporated in to all units of their biology course and students are performing a study of fish skull development in the classroom<br/><br/>Fish jaw protrusion during feeding is linked to extraordinary evolutionary success. This study will further integrate the fields of evolutionary functional morphology and developmental biology by investigating the late-developmental controls of skull morphogenesis. A great deal is known about the evolution of skull mechanics, but most studies have examined adult specimens. There is also a large literature on skull development, but most studies have examined early life stages. Adult cranial mechanics arise during juvenile to adult transitions in late development, so understanding the developmental factors that have shaped skull evolution requires study of this time period.  Preliminary data indicate that juvenile diet and thyroid hormone signaling are important determinants of protrusion ability via their affects on the formation of the premaxillary bone. Premaxilla shape determines maximum protrusion ability. This project will investigate the developmental determinants of premaxilla shape variation in order to better understand the evolvability of jaw protrusion. Research will examine the developmental controls of jaw protrusion in the zebrafish and two closely related species with different protrusion abilities. This project has the following aims: 1) to determine if thyroid hormone production affects the development of zebrafish jaw protrusion; 2) to determine if feeding on biomechanically different diets affects protrusion development in the zebrafish and two closely related species; 3) to determine if altered thyroid hormone production affects mRNA expression levels in developing zebrafish jaws; and 4) to identify genetic loci associated with jaw protrusion ability."

Recent advances in analytical methods now provides the ability to analyze these elements at relatively high precision at very low (e.g., nanogram per gram) concentration levels. This team aims to use the concentrations of nominally chalcophile elements (specifically Cu, Ga, Ge, As, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, W, Tl, Pb, and Bi) to address three fundamental questions in Earth science: a) how has the continental crust formed and evolved over time?, b) how much oxygen was in the atmosphere following the ""Great Oxidation Event"" (GOE) that occurred at 2.3-2.4 billion years ago?, and c) what is Earth's volatile element inventory?<br/><br/>Researchers will investigate these questions through three complementary projects. The first seeks to understand why molybdenum is systematically depleted in granites relative to rare earth elements by analyzing its concentrations in rocks (eclogites) that represent the residues of ancient subducted oceanic crust, and by determining the behavior of Mo during magmatic differentiation that produces granites. Through these studies, they will evaluate whether the upper crustal Mo depletion is due to its retention in subducted slabs, its retention in lower continental crustal cumulates, or its partitioning into a magmatic vapor phase and precipitation in molybdenum sulfide (molybdenite) in hydrothermal veins. The results will shed light on the main processes responsible for generation of the upper continental crust (UCC) and will place constraints on total amount of molybdenite in the UCC, allowing for more robust calculation of pO2 in the ancient atmosphere. The second project seeks to determine the cause of the change in the molybdenum isotope composition of the upper continental crust over geologic history, as observed in glacial deposits (diamictites). The team will analyze Mo isotopes in several modern weathering profiles to determine whether the onset of weathering in the presence of oxygen can explain the diamictite data. If they find that Mo isotopes fractionate during weathering in today's oxygenated atmosphere, it may allow them to use the diamictite data to place constraints on the amount of atmospheric oxygen that was present in the past. Finally, they will determine the distribution of the full suite of chalcophile elements within rocks of the upper mantle that are now exposed in the Pyrenees Mountains. Unlike similar rocks that are rapidly transported to Earth's surface in magmas, these mantle outcrops have retained sulfides, and thus will allow researchers to determine how these elements behave during mantle melting, and also allow for an independent estimate of Earth's abundance of moderately to highly volatile chalcophile elements such as As, Cd, Ga, In, Sn and Tl. Determining the volatile element abundances of Earth provides insights into how our planet formed."

Chemistry at solid surfaces and interfaces is the foundation of a wide range of technologies ranging from heterogeneous catalysis, gas storage, and chemical sensing, to nanoelectronics, nanolithography, and solar cells. It also governs natural phenomena, such as corrosion and oxidation processes, e.g., the rusting of iron and the weathering of rocks. Even interstellar formation of molecules occurs on the surfaces of dust particles. In all the above examples, the fundamental interactions that govern the processes are gas-surface interactions. Each complex surface process is comprised of a series of elementary steps, such as the scattering, adsorption, diffusion, desorption, and reactions of gaseous atoms and molecules on solid surfaces. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the gas-surface interface is essential to explain such diverse surface processes. The Roy group investigates fundamental gas-surface interactions underlying different surface and interface phenomena, with focus on phenomena that involve strong coupling between nuclear motion and electronic motion. This coupling can have important and unexpected consequences on the rates and pathways of chemical processes at surfaces. Dr. Roy's research is integrated with a multi-component education plan that includes the development of courses on computational chemistry, surface chemistry, and high-performance computing in the context of scientific computing. In addition, Dr. Roy plans to organize a symposium on chemical reactions and dynamics at surfaces in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.<br/><br/>Theoretical and computational research in surface and interface chemistry often involves studies of chemical dynamics in which the motion of atoms and molecules on surfaces is simulated using classical mechanics. This concept of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been very successful in describing gas-surface interactions, and has provided valuable qualitative insight into complicated surface processes. Conventional MD relies on the ubiquitous Born-Oppenheimer or adiabatic approximation, which assumes that nuclear motion is uncoupled from electronic motion. However, there are several fundamentally and industrially important gas-surface systems in which this approximation breaks down. Therefore, it is critical to develop accurate and efficient dynamics methods that can be applied to understand interfacial chemical processes where the adiabatic approximation is weak or invalid. Dr. Roy aims to further develop the 'surface hopping' theoretical method of nonadiabatic dynamics in the context of metal surfaces, and apply it to study strongly nonadiabatic gas-surface phenomena where energy is efficiently transferred between electrons and nuclei. These phenomena include (a) the interaction of hydrogen atoms with a gold surface, (b) the interaction of oxygen atoms with a silver surface, and (c) inelastic electron transport in molecular junctions. The overall goal is to develop a method with broader applicability to surface and interface chemistry that will help to attain a more comprehensive understanding of dynamics beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation."

The ability to understand, predict, and regulate this mechanism could have broad scientific and economic impacts. For example, the vascular cambium influences overall plant growth and is produced through the division of unusually large precursor cells. These divisions are known to rely on the expansion of a plant-specific structure termed the phragmoplast; however, a detailed understanding of phragmoplast expansion is lacking. This CAREER project will fill this knowledge gap using a combination of laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling and will provide foundational knowledge for increasing the rate of cell division, and subsequently wood yield, in trees that are grown for industrial biomass. Although the need for timber has grown by 36% over the past 25 years, forestland continues to shrink and developed countries depend heavily on imports from tropical zones. Bio-engineered trees with faster growth rates has the potential to increase production of timber as a renewable material in the US with additional benefits coming through increased sequestration of carbon dioxide. Cutting-edge concepts of this research will be integrated into an educational program for students that attend regional Native American high schools and nearby Lewis Clark State College (ID) and Walla Walla Community College (WA). The program will introduce the importance of plants as a natural resource; promote STEM education; and encourage careers in STEM-related professions. <br/><br/>The expansion of the phragmoplast centrifugally is critically dependent on the dynamic and asymmetrical behavior of microtubules. The PI has identified the protein MACET, which is specific to embryophytes, promotes microtubule nucleation, exhibits asymmetrical localization in the phragmoplast, and facilitates phragmoplast expansion. This discovery provides an exciting entry point for further studies to unravel the regulation of phragmoplast asymmetry. In this CAREER project, the PI will use a combination of approaches in genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology to characterize MACET function(s) in cytokinesis. In addition, the role of MACET in asymmetrical microtubule dynamics in the phragmoplast will be determined using quantitative live cell imaging and mathematical modeling. These approaches will advance our understanding of the basic rules that govern the construction of highly complex, but transient intracellular structures. As organisms rely on mechanisms that facilitate the irregular distribution of matter and energy to meet biological needs, understanding phragmoplast asymmetry would unravel another facet of the governing principles of life."

However, cultural and lifestyle changes occur much more rapidly than those biological changes, leading in some cases to a mismatch between our biology and our modern life. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how past differences in the food resources of two populations (foragers vs. agropastoralists) may have led to different genetic adaptations in metabolism, and how those adaptations may relate to modern-day well-being and chronic conditions. The investigator hypothesizes that past genetic adaptations to domesticated foodstuffs could result in fewer chronic health problems when a population transitions to a modern diet and lifestyle.  The study will contribute to our understanding of the role of diet in human evolution and adaptation, and its effects on well-being in contemporary populations. Genetic, epidemiological and cultural data from Amerindian individuals, which are crucial for understanding the role of genomic variants in modern well-being among admixed populations, will be shared with participants and stakeholders as well as the scientific community. This investigation will include individuals from underrepresented groups as both research participants and researchers, build and strengthen international research collaborations, and contribute to student training at the graduate and undergraduate levels. <br/><br/>Grounded in the literature of human biology, nutritional and molecular anthropology, and evolutionary medicine, the proposed research aims to (1) evaluate whether genomic regions involved in nutrient metabolism have been differentially targeted by selection in two post-nutrition transition Amerindian populations with contrasting histories of subsistence strategies (hunting-gathering vs. agropastoralism) and (2) evaluate whether these signatures are subsistence-specific and correspond to the prevalence of several chronic condition risk biomarkers. The question arises as to whether relatively recent dietary shifts have had evolutionary consequences for human populations, and to what extent these are related to the rise in chronic conditions in post-nutrition transition populations. This study will include two Amerindian populations:  one that until recently engaged in hunting-gathering in the temperate forest, and the other that has been long engaged in agropastoralism in a desert environment. The research design will comprise ethnographic fieldwork including oral history interviews, dietary and physical activity surveys, measurements of blood and anthropometric chronic condition risk biomarkers, and genome-wide scans for selection."

This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed."

The view that culture is a critical resource for poverty alleviation among indigenous communities has become so widespread that some organizations, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank, compel nation-states to participate in these initiatives. Despite the prevalence of such development schemes, the communities targeted continue to face high indices of poverty and vulnerability. This research sets out to understand why such inequalities remain entrenched, and how that entrenchment varies among communities. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, will test whether current investments in such heritage-based development initiatives contribute to or impede economic welfare objectives in three different contexts. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations interested in development and poverty alleviation efforts.<br/><br/>Ana Hasemann, under the supervision of Dr. Monica Udvardy of the University of Kentucky, will explore whether participation in heritage commercialization and development efforts contributes to economic welfare. This research will be conducted in three Lenca communities located in Southwest Honduras, which are chosen because of their extensive participation in development initiatives. The researcher has engaged in preliminary fieldwork in the region, has gained familiarity with national legislation and development bureaucracy, and has acquired significant contacts with local informants since 2008. The researcher will conduct prolonged visits in each community, during which she will collect information through interviews, surveys, and personal narratives, in order to empirically explore and identify how indigenous women and their communities respond to and negotiate their participation in development interventions. Findings from this research will ascertain the importance of public policy on heritage and culture as driving forces in local development, which is sometimes the only means of survival for poor communities. They will also provide insight into how the political and economic agendas of contemporary national governments and transnational organizations influence the degree of attention paid to ethnic/minority peoples, their livelihoods, and their development."

Our advanced simulation tools will facilitate enterprises and entrepreneurs with bringing products to market in a variety of industries critical to national security, health, and education. Easy-to-use and affordable design tools will also reduce the need to fabricate and test as many iterations thereby conserving environmental resources. This is the next generation of computer-aided design (CAD) tools to accelerate photonics innovation and discovery. <br/><br/>The proposed project involves the development of a turn-key, electromagnetic, simulation platform which automates complex, multi-step tasks involved in the design and prototyping of photonic and optoelectronic devices. Photonics, the science of light, underlies critical technologies in telecommunications, networking, photovoltaics, biomedicine, photolithography, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Phase II involves automating the deployment of finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations in four key areas: (1)large-scale shape optimization for devices involving tens to hundreds of degrees of freedom, (2) sensitivity analysis to assess the impact on device performance of manufacturing errors and predicting manufacturing yields, (3) launching simulation jobs using on-demand, scalable, high-performance computing (HPC) in the public cloud, and (4) seamlessly importing and exporting planar device geometries based on the standard Graphic Database System (GDSII) file format widely supported by electronic design automation (EDA) tools and semiconductor foundries. This will be made possible by combining advances in machine learning, nonlinear optimization, and computational electromagnetics."

Despite more than 50 years of production and the great economic importance of these deposits, their genesis is debated. Some researchers argue that the gold must have come from magmas emplaced in the shallow crust, while others propose that the gold was already present in the sedimentary host rocks and magmatism was not necessary to create economic concentrations of gold. This project addresses the scientific controversy and aims to facilitate exploration efforts through improved understanding of how Carlin-type gold deposits formed. <br/><br/>Particularly in Nevada's prolific Carlin trend, many studies have attempted to link the gold to Eocene magmas; although the data are permissive, unequivocal evidence remains elusive. This project takes a new approach by focusing on the northern Battle Mountain district, where there is Carlin-type gold, porphyry and skarn deposits that are known to have a magmatic origin, and distal disseminated deposits bearing hybrid characteristics of all of those deposit styles. In order to determine whether the distal disseminated deposits link the Carlin-type gold to causative magmatic intrusions, this project will characterize the nature of the ore fluids and the timing of mineralization at adjacent gold deposits. In addition to addressing a long-standing knowledge gap in economic geology, this work contributes towards advancing broader geoscience initiatives to characterize magmatism and metal flux in the crust. Despite the critical importance of mining to national security and the increasingly complex environmental and social framework in which mining occurs, the United States has a shortage of skilled labor in this sector. This project integrates teaching and research on ore deposits to develop innovative curricula that will recruit and retain students in educational pathways leading to careers in mining. The project science will be incorporated into a graduate field course and undergraduate case study modules at Colorado School of Mines, and a K-12 teacher training workshop conducted in collaboration with Relay Graduate School of Education and the Colorado Mining Association. In addition to serving as the basis for two PhD dissertations, the 5-year project will reach 50 graduate students, 150 undergraduate students, 25+ science teachers, and 600+ K-12 students."

It has found several surprising applications even in non-market settings which do not involve any exchange of money but only require the remarkable fairness and efficiency properties of equilibria.  These applications include scheduling, mechanism design, fair division, and others. Designing fast algorithms for computing equilibria in markets is vital for their many applications.<br/><br/>For a number of classical market settings with divisible goods, computing an equilibrium reduces to maximizing the geometric mean of agents' utilities, called the Nash social welfare. Nash social welfare is also considered an important fairness notion in allocating scarce resources in a non-market setting. Recently there has been a surge of interest in finding such an allocation with indivisible goods. However, the problem is NP-hard even when there are only two agents with additive valuations, and hence designing fast and near-optimal approximation algorithms is a crucial problem in this domain.<br/><br/>The PI aims to obtain fast algorithms for computing equilibria in fundamental market models and their extensions, and for the Nash welfare problem. Many of these reduce to network flow problems, which are central optimization problems that arise in numerous applications such as transportation and communication. Despite the extensive work on equilibrium computation and network flows, designing a strongly polynomial time algorithm for many of these market models has been long open. The first main thrust of this project is to make progress towards settling these open questions. New algorithmic techniques and tools, as well as structural insights will need to be developed to solve them. Recent work on the Nash welfare problem crucially uses the market model extensions and their connections with the flow problems. The second main thrust of this project is to obtain improved approximation algorithms for the Nash welfare problem.<br/><br/>The project will support and engage two PhD students, and an undergraduate student to implement the designed algorithms and test them for their practical efficiency. The new algorithmic techniques developed in this project will be incorporated into a graduate course on Games and Markets that the PI teaches.

This project will support a workshop bringing together leading scientists of brain and language to advance the understanding of the brain mechanisms of language from a cross-disciplinary viewpoint, focusing on the novel use of electrical brain recording methods in humans. Understanding language processes from their computational to their neural bases is essential for advancing critical national goals in education, in the medical treatment of language disorders and hearing loss, and in the creation of analytic approaches that will boost U.S. competitiveness in science and engineering, public and private sector research and development, and national security.<br/><br/>The project will connect electrophysiological and computational approaches for understanding human brain language processing. A first aim is to advance the effectiveness of electrophysiological tools for investigating language computations in the brain during comprehension. Language processes unfold rapidly, on a time scale of fractions of a second, and electrical recordings of brain activity are able to track this fast time course. A second aim is to develop frameworks for creating novel applications and approaches, such as the integration of machine learning methods with measures of brain electrical activity to obtain highly selective views of brain processes supporting specific aspects of language understanding. A third aim is to evaluate three main functions in linguistic computation that are being shown to be amenable to study using electrophysiological recordings, namely combinatorial processing, bilingualism, and predictive processing during language comprehension and production. The project will also provide training in leading-edge methods, thus supporting national efforts to develop the work force, and enhance science education and scientific rigor."

Paradoxically, hurricane disturbance may also regenerate certain habitats that particular species of wildlife depend on. The goal of this research is to investigate the interaction of a periodic, small scale disturbances such as fire, with an extreme disturbance (hurricane) on population growth and survival of an endangered butterfly species, Bartram's scrub-hairstreak (Strymon acis bartrami) and its rare host, pineland croton (Croton linearis). These species are patchily distributed throughout South Florida in rockland habitat, which was recently struck by the eyewall of Hurricane Irma. Results from this research will inform management of fourteen sensitive plants and animals in South Florida, including three additional endangered butterfly species affected by Hurricane Irma. By understanding the mechanisms of how one endangered insect-plant host pair responds to interacting disturbances, this project will provide insight into how these disturbances might influence other sensitive species. This project will also provide research training for a postdoctoral fellow and for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that hurricanes interact synergistically with more regular, localized disturbances to accelerate habitat change. Based on existing data from an ongoing experiment and observational data on the distribution of the study organisms in relation to previous hurricane disturbances, researchers will test the hypothesis that the two types of disturbances will interact synergistically to increase host plant recruitment and mortality. Prior research has already measured vital rate responses to management-based disturbance (understory removal to simulate wildfire), and this RAPID project will measure vital rate responses to hurricane disturbance and the interaction between management and hurricane disturbances. Empirical data will be used to parameterize demographic matrix models to predict population responses to future interacting disturbances, and to project populations across a range of disturbance frequencies, including frequencies of human-managed disturbances that can be controlled and frequencies of intense hurricanes that cannot be controlled."

The research is quite clear about the value of diversity to innovation and invention. The wellsprings of creativity do not flow from a single tap. Rather, they lie in the different perspectives, backgrounds and talents that individuals bring to a team. However, despite decades of efforts and millions of dollars in federal funding, the needle has barely moved in terms of the percentages of women and underrepresented minority students (African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans) earning engineering degrees. In 2016, women earned 19.9 percent of engineering bachelor's degrees awarded in the U.S. A decade earlier, the proportion was 19.3 percent. Hispanic students earned 10.7% of engineering degrees. Over the same period, the proportion of engineering bachelor's degrees earned by African Americans fell to 4 percent from 5 percent. Key to increasing the number and percentage of degrees awarded to underrepresented students is to dramatically increase the completion rates of these groups.  The National Society of Black Engineers is convening a conference for 100 Deans of ABET-accredited engineering schools for the purpose of sharing research on the most effective institutional interventions, core strategies, and critical concepts in retaining and graduating underrepresented minorities in engineering bachelor's degree programs.  <br/><br/>The Symposium for Engineering School Deans to Increase the Retention of Women and Underrepresented Minority Students will address barriers to retention by bringing the wealth of research findings that are currently available to the academic leaders of university engineering department, i.e., those who are in the strongest position to move change forward in increasing retention. NSBE compiled a systematic synthesis of research available on successful retention strategies for underrepresented students into a white paper, Paving the Way: Institutional Interventions for Academic Excellence and Success in Engineering (Reid, Ross, & Yates, 2015). The researchers interviewed university administrators with experience in successfully graduating underrepresented minority (URM) students in engineering and reviewed research studies about the interventions. Based on this prodigious body of knowledge, NSBE identified a list of interventions that have proven to facilitate the success of underrepresented students in engineering. The Plenary and breakout sessions will be organized around successful interventions and concepts that are necessary to inform these interventions:  1) Institution or Department Level Interventions: institutional leadership engagement; climate; and faculty development; 2) Core Strategies:  summer bridge programs, scholar cohort programs; collaborative learning environments; early alert systems; and facilitated study groups; 3) Critical Concepts: self-efficacy; and identity. Session presenters and keynote speakers will be invited from the universities that have implemented successful programs in the topic areas."

Advances over the past decades have now enabled one major component of this question to be rigorously addressed by modern neuroscientific tools. That is, how does the brain give rise to perceptual awareness of sensory stimuli? In particular, there has been a concerted effort by neuroscientists and psychologists to unravel the neural bases of visual perceptual awareness. Currently, one major open question is whether regions in the human frontal cortex directly contribute to the content of visual perceptual awareness or, alternatively, are only involved in the maintenance and manipulation of perceptual information represented in posterior visual cortices. With the support of this NSF CAREER award, Dr. Biyu He will address this question and develop a framework for understanding large-scale brain dynamics underlying visual perceptual awareness. To this end, the project combines visual psychophysics, state-of-the-art multimodal human brain imaging, noninvasive brain stimulation and computational modeling. The outcome of this work will lead to a better understanding of the biological basis of human perceptual awareness in both normative and clinical populations. The educational activities supported by this award are intended to stimulate scientific interest and enthusiasm in neuroscience in student populations, and increase the use of computational neuroscience and state-of-the-art multimodal imaging tools in human neuroscience research. <br/><br/>The research objective of this proposal is to tackle a central question in neuroscience: How does the brain give rise to perceptual awareness of sensory stimuli? To investigate this question, the research group will combine psychophysics, multi-modal brain imaging, and noninvasive brain stimulation in humans, facilitated by computational modeling, and use vision as the model system. Specifically, the following questions are addressed: 1) Do neural activities in frontal regions contribute to perceptual content when stimulus ambiguity must be resolved? 2) Do neural activities in frontal regions contribute to gating the access to awareness by a particular piece of visual information? The central hypothesis is that large-scale brain activity during conscious visual perception exhibits initial-state-dependent, robust, transient dynamics shaped by the interactions between frontal and visual cortices. The experimental approach features recording of brain activity at whole-brain and large-scale network levels using a combination of ultra-high-field (7 Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electrocorticography (ECoG) to leverage the high spatial or high temporal resolution of each modality, and to further manipulate brain activity using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). These studies will have a major impact for understanding how brain systems coordinate to generate perceptual awareness of environmental input."

They can also cause blow-outs during the drilling of oil and gas wells, causing loss of life and significant loss of industry investment. Gas hydrates also comprise a major source of natural gas that could form an important methane resource in the future and, when they disintegrate as the seafloor warms, may also contribute to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although there have been numerous studies of these unique minerals over the last two decades, it is clear that our understanding of their dynamics and their response to various environmental forcings is inadequate. This funding provides support to early career scientists to attend the co-located Fifth Gordon Research Conference on natural gas hydrate systems and its companion Gordon Conference Research Seminar on gas hydrates. New data emerging from marine cabled observatories in the Pacific Northwest off Oregon and Vancouver Island will be discussed as will new findings from Japan, China, and India. Other topics include natural gas transport in cold regions and challenges in the development of marine sediment gas hydrate fields. Broader impacts of the funding include support of early career scientists, focusing on engaging those underrepresented in the sciences, and providing a venue for networking and an exchange of ideas and information on on-going research between energy industry professionals and academics. <br/><br/>Marine methane gas hydrates occur widely in marine sediments.  They are ephemeral minerals that are stable at conditions of only small ranges of low temperatures and higher-pressure conditions.  Marine methane gas hydrates are susceptible to rapid and catastrophic dissolution as a result of depressurization (e.g., during borehole drilling) or subseafloor increases in temperature (e.g., due to increasing ocean temperature due to climate change), which moves them out of their thermodynamic stability field. This funding provides funds to support the attendance of early career US researchers at the international gas hydrate system Gordon Research Conference and Research Seminar in Galveston, Texas. Topics include presentations on new data and research and discussions of the dynamics and forcings that impact methane gas hydrated occurrence, distribution, and dissolution. Over the last two decades, many field and laboratory studies have been carried out to characterize these parameters; however, it is still not clear how many of the forcings on gas hydrates operate and are linked and which, and in what setting, are controlling under different conditions. This workshop is constituted to bring the international intellectual pool of experts on gas hydrates from academia and industry together to share results of their most recent research and discuss challenges and possible ways forward to dramatically improve our understanding a marine methane gas hydrate generation and behavior."

However, there are many challenges for effective human-robot collaboration that impinge on this promise, such as communicating with human partners using natural language, providing information to an operator through a visual interface, or quickly providing information so that a person is able to offer assistance. We propose an HRI direction that provides several closely-related projects for undergraduate research experiences. The project team will mentor 10 undergraduates each summer, pursuing research directly impacting assistive robotics, in the following technical areas: development of autonomous robot capabilities targeted for care environments, such as networked robotics devices cooperating with care professionals to perform complex tasks in support of aging in place; human command-and-control infrastructure for operations that utilize robots for technology support; and connectivity and security for a network of robots, computers, and embedded devices collectively used to mission-critical goals while utilizing unused parts of the wireless spectrum. The goal of this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site is to develop and evaluate robotic systems whose function is to help bridge the human-robot collaboration gap and achieve the above objectives efficiently and effectively. The summer activities for undergraduates will provide hands-on science and engineering activities related to current research projects, and professional development with training sessions on writing a graduate school application and how to apply for fellowships to support graduate education. <br/><br/>The site will develop new autonomous robot capabilities and supporting network and data science technology to address real-world challenges of operating autonomous systems in hospital, clinic, home, and infrastructure environments. This site will develop solutions for semi-autonomous robot behavior with humans in the loop, wireless network connections in rapidly changing frequency domains, and processing high volumes of real-world data. The proposed site presents five projects related to these computing domains: Empirical Study of Socially-Appropriate Interaction; Language-Based Human-Robot Collaboration; Autonomous Robotic Exploration of Underground Mine Environments; Multi-robot Collaboration and Human in-the-loop for Safe, Accurate and Reliable Inspection; and Network Management of Heterogeneous Robotics Devices in a Wireless Environment. This REU site links these projects together through the common objective of developing assistive technology. Students will develop domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and interdisciplinary competency. The possible intellectual properties resulting from this project will include study on long-term human-robot interaction, wireless networking for challenging signal environments, autonomous robot capabilities for human-robot teaming, and data science tools for processing high volumes of data from real-world systems."

In fact, the associated flooding can be classified as a 5,000 year event.  Associated to the flooding, significant sediment relocation processes occurred.  Sediment erosion around submerged structures and foundations, commonly referred to as scour, represents a significant risk to the stability of infrastructures.  During Hurricane Harvey, early reconnaissance teams observed significant scour and erosion at bridge piers, river embankments, sheet pile walls, boulder walls, and other infrastructure with submerged foundations.  However, safety constraints limited on site investigations while water levels were still elevated.  An issue of post-event scour and erosion investigations is the refilling of scour holes.  This means that when with receding water levels and flow velocities, sediment transported in suspensions settles and infills the scour holes, often leading to false assessments of the magnitude of erosion during the event.  Additionally, the infill is freshly deposited and often weak, potentially providing a false image of stability.  This award will support the collection of perishable field data investigating scour and erosion, as well as post-event infill at locations impacted by flooding and storm surge during Hurricane Harvey. The collected data will advance the understanding of scour, erosion, and infill during extreme flooding events, and therefore, contribute directly to the improvement of risk assessment.<br/><br/>The research team will visit sites that experienced severe scour and erosion during Hurricane Harvey, and that were initially investigated by early reconnaissance teams.  An integrated geotechnical and geophysical approach will be employed to gather a unique data set of scour and erosion, and the subsequent infilling.  Sub-bottom echo sounders (chirp sonar) will profile the submerged sediment stratigraphy, supported by portable free fall penetrometer deployments which will provide geotechnical parameters of the different sediment layers.  Side scan sonar and photogrammetry will provide detailed imagery and topography.  In-situ erodibility will be tested using a cohesive strength meter.  Gravity coring will enable sediment sampling in submerged areas, while push tube sampling will be conducted at emerged banks.  Sediment samples will be tested for geotechnical sediment characteristics, and erodibility.  The latter tests will be conducted using a Erosion Flume Apparatus.  The collected field data will be unique by providing geotechnical information from the native sediments and the infill, and will enable future research and insights into the erosion and infill processes associated to extreme flooding events as during Hurricane Harvey.  The data will be made available to the public and other researchers immediately after collection through the Designsafe-CI data repository."

Most often, prison building is seen as a way to create jobs and economic growth lost to declines in local industry. States choose to privatize carceral facilities hoping that shifting administration to corporate actors will result in cost savings and lower budgets. However, little research examines the effects of prison and jail privatization on the communities where these facilities are located. Does for-profit incarceration benefit communities experiencing a lack of resources due to loss of industry? This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, conducts a case study in a rural city in northeastern Louisiana to investigate how the historical growth of private jails has affected social and economic community life over time. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations engaged in policy dialogues related to the carceral system in marginalized communities, as well as discussions concerning criminal justice administration and privatization more broadly.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out by University of Kentucky doctoral student Lee Bullock, under the supervision of Dr. Erin Koch to examine the lived experience of pervasive privatized carceral institutions in people's daily lives, their communities, and their influence on prosperity and productivity over time. The project explores whether and to what extent the impacts of this industry vary among different groups within this community. The research takes places in Tallulah, Louisiana, where prison building has been pursued as a major employer following the decline of agriculture and mechanized production. To gain multi-generational perspectives on these issues, the researcher employs the following methods:  interviews and multi-generational life history collection; participant observation of everyday activities and public events; guided tours of the community and surrounding areas; and, secondary analysis of census and community data. This ethnographic research will make contributions to studies of incarceration and privatization while producing regional scholarship that is generalizable and applicable to other areas where these conditions persist. The findings from this research will produce data to better understand the relationships between privatized incarceration, pressing socioeconomic issues, and community well-being in the United States."

For example, crystal growth has direct implications for predicting the conditions for volcanic eruptions because crystallization may induce the formation of bubbles or increase the viscosity of magma, both of which facilitate the build-up of the over-pressures needed for eruptions.  Quantifying crystal growth rates would also provide insight into how long it takes for magma bodies to grow before they erupt catastrophically, generating hazardous conditions for life and human society.  Adequate methods for constraining crystal growth rate, however, remain elusive. The goal of this work is to develop and calibrate a new crystal growth speedometer based on the extent to which trace elements are incorporated into a rapidly growing crystal at levels that deviate from equilibrium.  Theory will be combined with state of the art in situ analytical measurements to develop a generalized workflow for quantifying crystal growth rates.  This work will have implications for 1) magma dynamics prior to eruption, 2) the rate at which faults and cracks heal after a natural or induced earthquake and 3)  the rates at which economically important mineral deposits are precipitated in veins. The work also has implications for controlling the rate of latent heat release by crystallization from melts or solutions, which in turn, has implications for chemical storage of renewable energies (solar and wind).  Participants of this project will also be involved in several community outreach programs in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Rice University: 1) content production for Outcroppings, a department sponsored magazine of the Earth, environment and energy, 2) geology education with K-12 teachers and students in Houston, and 3) participation and organizing of an annual industry-Rice Earth Science symposia that brings together leaders in industry and academia to work on problems of mutual societal interest.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a relatively new crystal growth speedometer based on disequilibrium incorporation of trace elements that would otherwise be rejected by the crystal at equilibrium (incompatible elements).  This speedometer will be developed by calibrating against field studies in which crystal growth rates have been independently constrained.  A fundamental objective will be to evaluate how common disequilibrium effects associated with rapid crystal growth are observed in magmatic systems. A comprehensive sampling of olivines in magmas from different tectonic and volcanic settings will be analyzed for incompatible trace elements using state of the art high resolution laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry.  The empirical speedometer will then be applied to olivine phenocryst populations from different magmatic settings to map out the distribution of crystal growth rates within the population, with particular emphasis on resolving the question of whether phenocrysts grow slowly in a long-lived magma chamber or instead nucleated and grew just before eruption. Insights from this work will be used to develop models for crystal growth in different geologic settings, such as during fault healing and generation of pegmatites."

This Phase II project will provide drug developers and researchers with a tool that can quantify diversity by correlating genetic and spatial information from tumors, providing crucial information about tumor composition that is currently missing today. This project will translate the technology into an efficient, high-throughput workflow that will enable commercialization with drug developers, researchers, and reference laboratories, generating both income and multiple job opportunities. The commercialization of this innovation will significantly impact scientific, corporate, and patient communities. Researchers will have a new tool improving drug development for cancer and other diseases, including Alzheimer?s and diabetes. Payers, such as insurance companies and the government, will save costs by eliminating unnecessary spending on treatments for patients who will not respond. Most importantly, patients will have broader access to personalized medicine through new treatments and screening methods that can help determine the optimum drug combinations for them.<br/><br/>A single tumor contains multiple populations of cells that each have unique mutations, and it is necessary to understand the location and genetic differences of these cells in order to provide effective combination therapies that will not result in overall treatment failure or relapse. This Phase II project aims to provide drug developers, researchers, and physicians with a tool to correlate genetic and spatial information about individual tumors. Using a proprietary microfluidic device adhered to a standard microscope slide and tissue biopsy, incorporated with a laser-coupled microscope, this tool is capable of providing information that it is not possible to obtain from any other method today. Building upon the feasibility established during the Phase I project, Phase II will involve performing NGS to demonstrate the instrument?s usefulness in providing data for clinical research and biomarker discovery. It will also involve building a fully integrated prototype instrument with features that increase automation and throughput to make the technology economically feasible for commercialization.

This project seeks to map the solidification of Earth's inner core using seismic waves reflected and transmitted through it. Education and training will be provided to graduate students in computation, digital data retrieval and processing, and structural imaging from any wave-like phenomena.  These skills are transferable to broad areas of science and engineering, including resource exploration, computational science, and medical imaging.

Unique elements of the proposed activity include separating the effect of earthquake sources on waveforms to improve estimates of inner core attenuation, evaluating the relative contributions of attenuation by forward scattering and intrinsic attenuation, relating small- scale heterogeneity to a solidification fabric and elastic anisotropy, and exploiting the use of a body wave having high sensitivity to the shear velocity structure beneath the inner core boundary."

Fors of Cornell University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry to develop new synthetic methods for the preparation of polymers with control over chemical structures and properties.  This approach takes advantage of interesting characteristics of visible light to enable the synthesis of previously inaccessible polymer architectures. The properties of polymeric materials are directly controlled by chemical structure and the methods developed in this project enable the synthesis and utilization of improved polymeric materials for applications in adhesives, elastomers, and electronics. Educational activities are integrated into this project.  The focus of these activities is on the development of a polymer science summer camp that exposes Native American students to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and research at an early age. The objective is to stimulate the interest of Native American students in STEM related fields.<br/><br/>The project develops a cationic polymerization process for vinyl ethers that is regulated by visible light through the reversible oxidation of a polymer chain end with a photocatalyst.  Precise spatial and temporal control over polymer chain growth is achieved by the photoinitiated reversible formation of a propagating cation.  This cationic polymerization process is being used in combination with other photocontrolled radical polymerization processes to enable switching between different polymerization mechanisms. Monomer selectivity in situ is achieved by modulating the wavelength of irradiation. This protocol provides control over polymer sequence with an external stimulus and allows the synthesis of previously inaccessible polymer structures. Additionally, similar strategies are being developed for photocontrolled polymerization of epoxides, thus extending the scope and expanding the practicality of this approach. Synthetic polymers are of importance in all aspects of modern life and have facilitated major societal advances. Innovative synthetic methods are required to enable the synthesis of complex materials with unknown function. Photocontrolled cationic processes allow for the development of new polymeric structures with previously inaccessible architectures. Importantly, high levels of spatial and temporal control gained in photocontrolled polymerizations facilitate the application of these new methods in fields such as lithography, coatings, and biology. This award enables the establishment of a polymer science camp on the Flathead Indian Reservation in collaboration with the Salish and Kootenai College. This summer camp introduces Native American students to research activities at an early age in order to increase their interest and participation in STEM fields. Additionally, through workshops for teachers on the Flathead Indian Reservation the quality of STEM related education increases for elementary and middle school Native American students.

Despite its importance, systematic tradeoff design space analysis is perhaps one of the most elusive activities in the design of complex systems, as the cost, effort, and discipline needed to conduct tradespace analysis can be extremely high.  This research devises a suite of fully automated techniques to foster systematic analysis of design tradeoff spaces of software systems. By making tradespace analysis of complex software designs less expensive to conduct and more scalable, this project enables the vibrant software industry to improve the quality of its products.<br/><br/>The research project contains both analytical and empirical components. The analytical approaches involve developing models and algorithms that can discover design alternatives via automatically synthesizing spaces of design solutions from designers' high-level inputs, comparatively analyze such design spaces via automatically subjecting each design alternative to the execution of diverse evaluation operations, and facilitate support for design space evolution through leveraging a variety of optimization mechanisms. The empirical evaluation component contains conducting experiments in multiple steps: controlled experiments by means of test beds and experiments in the context of real-world systems. The project advances the state-of-the-art by making synthesis-driven software design more scalable and cost effective.

Unfortunately, prohibitively slow responses to even high-profile APT attacks have shown that authorities lack the capability to quickly investigate ongoing attacks (in a matter of hours or days rather than months). To address this challenge, this research draws inspiration from recent developments in memory image forensics (in particular a recently introduced technique called guided execution), which has provided rapid evidence collection and crime investigation capabilities currently unparalleled in APT investigation.  This research is developing an integrated framework, called GEMINI, which shifts the goal of modern memory forensics from the investigation of physical-world crimes to APT campaigns. Based on the analysis of only a single memory image --- collected from an Android device after an attack is suspected --- GEMINI provides the following set of APT investigation capabilities: (1) Based on exploratory guided execution techniques, GEMINI can search for and re-create previously enacted APT attack stages. (2) Beyond investigating prior attack execution, GEMINI enables the revelation of hidden/potential future attack behaviors by 'puppeteering' their executing with pre-staged memory image data. (3) After exploring future payloads, GEMINI can further leverage its guided execution capabilities for the remediation of the observed attack strategies.<br/><br/>This work directly contributes to national security by advancing research in and developing techniques for the investigation of APT campaigns targeting mobile devices.

This method enables the preparation of structures that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments in precisely controlled amounts and sequences.  Polymers are versatile commodity chemicals commonly found in plastics. The ability to control and change the solvent compatibility of a given plastic has profound implications for its applications.  Fundamental insights arising from this project include novel synthetic methods yielding well-defined functional polymers and insights into the relationship of chemical structure and water solubility. The materials prepared under this project are useful in applications in which hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials are combined, such as the efficient recovery of crude oil from oil spills in marine environments or as durable and solvent-resistant adhesives. This research program provides valuable training to undergraduate and graduate students in the preparation and design of industrially relevant materials and supports the integration of academic and industrial scientific relationships through an educational initiative that brings professional chemists to a university setting to discuss their current research and career trajectories. Additional aspects of the educational initiative focus on the recruitment and retention of talented students from diverse backgrounds into Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to control the hydrophobicity of organic polymers by replacing one or more carbon-carbon (CC) bonds with the isosteric, isoelectronic, and polar boron-nitrogen (BN) bond. A novel azaborine vinyl monomer is prepared and its homo- and copolymerization is studied. Reflecting the central role of organoborane chemistry in organic synthesis, postpolymerization functionalization converts the pendant C-B bond to a C-OH bond. In the course of this work, fundamental research into the reactive intermediate chemistry of unconventional aromatic structures is pursued, novel functional polyolefins are prepared, and structure-dependent properties are elucidated. The methods to be used include organic synthesis, polymerization chemistry, and tools for the characterization of physical properties. The project integrates research and educational endeavors by supporting: (1) a career and professional development seminar series in Baltimore, (2) promoting training and learning in industrially-relevant polymer science, and (3) broadening the participation of underrepresented groups through a summer undergraduate research stipend."

This population shift, often accompanied by a shift from heritage languages to English, can lead to the development of new ethnic identities and dialects of English. Yet little is known about how Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHPI) teens in the U.S. construct identity. This study will investigate how NHPI teens use linguistic and other behavioral resources to construct identity in the context of U.S. public high schools.  Because strong ethnic identity has been shown to improve general well-being and scholastic achievement for minority students, the results will be a valuable resource for educators and community leaders.  The research will also add to the understanding of how ethnicity relates to social network and other aspects of identity, contributing to the fields of sociolinguistics and cultural anthropology. Specific research questions include: (1) To what extent do the NHPI students in the study identify with specific ethnic groups, with a panethnic Pacific Islander group, and with the local population as a whole? (2) How do the density of the NHPI population and the general level of diversity affect identity formation? (3) What linguistic and nonlinguistic practices construct and reinforce each of these identities?  <br/><br/>The study will be conducted in a metropolitan area of Utah, the state with the highest percentage of NHPIs in the contiguous U.S. It utilizes ethnographic and sociolinguistic methods in a study of NHPI and non-NHPI students in two public high schools with different ethnographic compositions.  Quantitative analysis will focus on phonetic features below the level of speaker awareness, such as the pronunciation of vowels in still and steel and of final consonants in long and was.  The social meaning of variation will be sought in the ethnographic work, drawing on speaker perceptions and ideologies. In addition, the study tests predictions from cultural evolutionary theory about the importance of diversity and migrant population size on the use of ethnic markers."

This is important because the limits of cognitive load present a barrier to improving a programmer's productivity and quality. Using newly available biometric technologies such as  fMRI, EMG and eye-tracking, it is possible to conduct studies of cognitive processes in programmers. Such studies make it possible to provide scientific answers to questions such as which programming language constructs are easier to use, what kinds of training produce better programmers, or how different programming environments and situational variables are more conducive to writing the best code. The main thrust of this project is to overcome the significant challenges that currently prevent researchers in the software engineering community from widely adopting these methods. This project performs some of the groundbreaking work that is needed to provide robust measurements of cognitive processes in programmers using the biometric technologies. The resulting tailored methodologies and measurement devices will support a community of researchers working in this space. <br/><br/>The project will develop techniques to use fMRI to measure difficulty in understanding certain programming constructs. This will be done by measuring cognitive effort, as measured by neural efficiency, and level of concentration via neural deactivation. Similarly, measurements of cognitive processes activated during other code comprehension tasks will be obtained.  The objective is to obtain a validated set of measures that predict the cognitive load associated with understanding code, which is necessary to create the scientific basis for the studies. The work will lead to combining different measurements, such as eye-tracking and EMG, to establish more sensitive measurement tools. The project will address technical concerns such as maintaining clean signal data from sensors and learning how to calibrate devices to maintain validity of results, as well as practical concerns such as how to perform measurements on human subjects without interfering with the measurements.  Ultimately, such studies should lead to a better understanding what constitutes best practices in software development and training of software engineers."

It also represents an ecosystem under immediate risk for biodiversity change as a result of energy industry use of new horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies. The deep shale biosphere stores an abundance of methane and other oil hydrocarbons that provide carbon and energy resources for microorganisms both within the shale and along its bounding formations. The extreme conditions encountered within these rocks include the absence of light for photosynthesis, sub-micron pore-spaces, elevated temperatures, high pressures, and brine fluid chemistry. Each of these environmental factors may strongly influence the origin, adaptation and function of the microbial population. The Marcellus and Utica-Point Pleasant shale within the Appalachian basin of West Virginia and Ohio is one of the largest unconventional reserves in the U.S. This shale will serve as a case study to broadly characterize the microbial biodiversity and function in black shale and its bounding rock interfaces. Research objectives include inferring the origin of microbial life with respect to geologic history of these formations, exploring how microorganisms have adapted to the current deep biosphere environment, and investigating the metabolic strategies used to sequester nutrient resources given the extreme environmental conditions encountered in this ecosystem. <br/><br/>The investigators will undertake the first genomic survey of indigenous microbial populations in shale and its interfaces. This research will greatly expand our knowledge of microbial life and function in shale prior to broad-scale environmental disturbance as a result of energy exploitation. The project will also provide further insight into microbial carbon cycling in the deep terrestrial biosphere. The project participants will develop exhibit materials for local venues (e.g. schools, libraries, museums) where the broader public can get to know the residents of the deep subsurface, learn about their characteristics and preferences, match microbes with their deep-sea cousins, and witness what this research has revealed about community structure before and after drilling. Research findings will be communicated to students and the broader public through a variety of educational activities at a joint Ohio State University (OSU)-West Virginia University (WVU) Shale Energy and Environmental Laboratory.

In particular, such approaches often put too much emphasis on the analysis of individual structural members, thereby falling short in providing a solid, easy-to-follow, and holistic approach to comprehending and analyzing complex structures with a large number of interconnected elements.  This research is transforming existing teaching pedagogy in structural analysis and filling a major gap in how structural engineering is currently taught to the nation's future workforce in U.S. institutions. <br/><br/>In this project, mobile augmented reality (AR) is used to superimpose views of the real world with computer generated 3D models of structures under load. In doing so, the potential of AR for improving learning and increasing student engagement in the learning process is being systematically assessed.  Building upon theoretical perspectives on how people learn, this project is also examining if pedagogy involving AR creates an effective learning environment for students, as well as if it enhances adaptive flexibility, which is deemed to be essential to be a successful engineer in the 21st Century. The broader impacts of this project extend beyond its confines through outreach activities such as integrating AR technology into lower-level engineering courses that aim to increase the number of ethnically-diverse students pursuing STEM degrees.  The learning modules integrating AR into teaching of structural analysis will be made available online.  A website and online repository are to include specific details about the learning objectives, implementation procedures, and instructor reflections on things to consider while implementing the teaching techniques.

Increasingly, countries of the Global South are leading the way. For example, China and India have been at the forefront of commercial activities in sub-Saharan Africa. These investments have generated needed jobs for poor countries but they also have produced controversies about labor practices. One question that has arisen is whether national and international labor codes are being ignored to give businesses unfair advantages while also victimizing workers. However, surprisingly little is known about how the situation plays out on the ground, at the work sites where workers and foreign supervisors actually engage. The research supported by this award will help to fill this knowledge gap. This research is in the United States' national interest because the U.S. government and investors need to know that they are playing on a level playing field. It also is essential to better understand the contexts that determine the effectiveness of U.S. foreign aid investments.<br/><br/>This fourteen month empirical ethnographic study will be carried out by University of California, Davis, anthropology doctoral student, Justin L. Haruyama, under the supervision of Dr. James H. Smith. The research will be conducted in two Chinese-operated coal mines in southern Zambia: one operated by a Chinese state-owned enterprise and the other privately owned by five Chinese brothers. Both of these mines hire managers primarily from China while recruiting their ordinary workforces exclusively from Zambia and neighboring African countries. The research will examine how actors from different racial, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds at the mines understand and affect each other. This will illuminate the broader social consequences and capitalist transformations at work in everyday encounters around the extraction of coal. The researcher will also pay close attention to historical experience, as preliminary research has shown that the sometimes-traumatic encounters with colonialism, socialism, and neoliberalism experienced by participants from both Zambia and China continue to have profound reverberations in their actions and discourses at the mines today. Data will be collected through a mixed-methods approach, including archival research, participant observation, census and structured survey interviews, and the collection of life histories. Results from this research will improve understanding of how contemporary international capitalist investments are affecting the lives of ordinary people, and how they are reshaping business environments and capitalist culture in many African countries."

The proposed REU Site will i) expose undergraduate students to hands-on research experiences in security and software development and testing, ii) enhance their research experience, iii) promote their interests in research, and iv) seed their desire to pursue advanced degrees and careers in CS. The project aims to increase the number of students that pursue graduate studies by exposing students to exciting and attainable research goals, giving them the opportunity to build their resumes with research experiences and publications, and providing a supportive community of peers and mentors that encourage them to be successful. By introducing competition and collaboration as drivers for research innovation, the project intends to achieve a unique and cohesive undergraduate research experience that entices students to pursue graduate studies. Students will gain a background to learn state-of-the-art technical knowledge, the ability to think independently, and the confidence to work on challenging problems. As a result, they will be better prepared to enter the graduate school pipeline. The project's broader significance and importance are that it trains three diverse cohorts of ten students recruited from minorities and underrepresented groups including female students. <br/><br/>The project's intellectual merits are that it exposes students to an intense research experience that combines security and software development and testing research with emerging technologies (i.e., web, mobile, and wearable applications) as artifacts used for evaluation of the different research techniques. The intellectual merit of this REU site is reflected in each individual research project, which has interesting and crucial applications that participants can easily identify with. Some projects, designed for highly talented students, seek to advance knowledge and understanding by addressing unsolved problems. Others seek to employ security and testing techniques to solve the real-world problems. The projects will also apply an intellectual approach to encourage students through active learning, free and open exchange of ideas, team spirit, and recognition and rewards for achievements. Specifically, the objectives are to foster i) creative and independent thinking, ii) problem-solving skills and hands-on experience, iii) enthusiasm and confidence, and iv) critical thinking, communication and organization skills. The student projects are designed to include individual and collaborative tasks that foster a strong connection to the group and a better understanding of the larger context of their work. Students work in collaborative teams that explore research questions and innovations in the areas of message integrity, computation on encrypted data for different resource-constrained devices, test suite prioritization, and test suite reduction. The students will investigate cryptographic algorithms and protocols that are suitable for mobile and wearable environments and aim to achieve end-to-end message level integrity and to support computing on encrypted data. They will also conduct empirical studies that hypothesize about the fault detection effectiveness of test suite reduction and test suite prioritization by coverage-based metrics. Empirical studies examine the techniques in the context of emerging technologies (web, mobile, wearable, etc.)."

Acrylate is a mostly overlooked by-product of a very well-studied process through which a compound known as DMSP (dimethylsulfoniopropionate), a compound produced by phytoplankton, is converted to the gas dimethylsulfide (known as DMS). This process is an important part of understanding the marine cycling of sulfur, and DMS plays a role in cloud formation and climate. Thus, these aspects of the conversion of DMSP to DMS have received considerable attention. On the other hand, very little is known about acrylate concentrations, fluxes, or impacts in the oceans, even though it is produced during the conversion of DMSP to DMS.  Acrylate concentrations and fluxes should at times be substantial, especially in shallow-water coral reefs or during blooms of DMSP-rich phytoplankton that are common throughout the world's oceans and often harmful or toxic. It is likely that acrylate is a reactive form of marine organic matter that significantly impacts the carbon cycle and ecology of the upper ocean. This project will foster research and educational opportunities for undergraduates and one graduate student through several avenues including field work with international collaborators, attendance at national and local meetings, mentoring, preparing for and delivering college-level lectures, and presentations made to the general public at forums such as Syracuse's Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, media communications, web-based data bases, and presentations at scientific meetings, public forums and in the classroom. <br/> <br/>A three-year project is proposed to study the effect of sunlight on the formation and loss of acrylate in seawater, to model these processes in the water column, and to determine if photoproduction and photolysis are important pathways in the marine acrylate cycle in a shallow-water coral reef.

Students will be introduced to the research area of applying power optimization techniques to IT systems. The target populations are underrepresented students and those from institutions that do not offer PhDs. In addition to academic mentoring by Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) faculty, this project includes mentors from industry.<br/><br/>Traditionally, IT curricula have been developed with disciplines that focus on parameters, such as performance and runtime optimization. Little or no attention has been devoted to achieving energy efficiency and consumption thresholds, especially from the software and algorithmic perspectives. This project will provide original experiences and singular opportunities for undergraduate students to work on innovative strategies to reduce energy consumption and losses in IT systems. In addition to the potential change in the career paths of the selected students, this project suggests how the electrical and computer engineering curricula can be impacted to incorporate energy efficiency in both hardware and software curricula.<br/><br/>This project will demonstrate novel methodologies in reducing energy consumption and losses within IT systems, which can be accomplished with a multidisciplinary approach. Topics will range from hardware to software solutions with efficiency as the main figure of merit. Traditionally, Multiple-Voltage Multiple-Frequency (MVMF) has been used to reduce energy consumption in computing systems. This project proposes MVMF2, which not only dynamically changes the computer clock frequency, but also dynamically changes power supply switching frequency for further loss reduction. While MVMF2 is considered a hardware optimization managed by software, the second research topic - a higher efficiency power supply based on a new power converter design - is purely a hardware solution. The third and fourth research topics are software solutions to reduce energy consumption in high memory demand applications and processing big matrix multiplication, respectively. The fifth research topic deals with energy consumption reduction techniques in wireless Internet of Things devices by modeling and optimizing power saving modes, such as reduced power operation, cyclical sleep, among others."

In today?s digital age, data collection and storage is inexpensive. The bottleneck lies in society's ability to solve increasingly larger problem instances, where the challenge typically stems from computational or informational limitations. This intractability can often be overcome by searching for approximately optimal instead of exactly optimal solutions. This project will design new mathematical-programming-based techniques that are broadly applicable in approximating combinatorial optimization problems. The project will strengthen connections of theoretical computer science to various fields of mathematics such as discrepancy theory, geometry, graph theory, optimization and probability. The PI will also collaborate with industry colleagues to disseminate the theoretical findings on some of the studied problems and assess their practical impact. The educational aspect of this project includes training undergraduate and graduate students, developing new course material and organizing a workshop for high-school teachers. <br/> <br/>Despite the wide range of possible combinatorial optimization problems, a common approach underlying numerous results in approximation and online algorithms is mathematical programming and rounding. This project will develop new techniques in this area by investigating (1) algorithms based on convex-programming hierarchies, (2) rounding algorithms based on recent advances in algorithmic discrepancy and (3) an online primal-dual framework for convex objectives. This project involves designing general algorithmic techniques (and identifying problem classes to which they apply) as well as improving the state-of-art on central problems such as k-Median, directed Steiner tree, the Beck-Fiala conjecture, unsplittable flow and online multicommodity routing. This project will also expand the applicability of the resulting techniques to areas such as combinatorics and operations research."

Malicious functionality can be added to the devices during the design process, fabrication, or assembly, leading to compromised systems, often without detection.  This collaborative effort seeks to further the national defense by developing novel methodologies and technologies that enhance trust and security of these devices and their respective systems.<br/><br/>The to-be-planned Center is intended to enable researchers and practitioners from diverse areas -- integrated circuits, architecture, cryptography, system safety and resilience, etc. -- to position device security as a coherent, collaborative discipline.  It will be a hub for industry-focused research and a repository for related data.  It will foster dialog to promote advances across disciplinary boundaries. The site will lead collaborative efforts in security of cyber-physical and large-scale systems, secure architecture and virtualization, and embedded system security and privacy. It will adopt advanced machine-learning algorithms, and investigate analysis and mitigation of side channels and covert channels in mobile systems, Graphical Processing Units, and nano-devices.<br/><br/>The Center is expected to influence the design, protection, and resilience of cyber physical systems from vulnerabilities associated with device security and workforce development needed for industry, government, and military.

At that time, they were ~1 m deep.  As of late December 2017, just two months later, those same cracks had grown to over 80 m deep.  These cracks represent the lateral margin of the Rattlesnake Ridge landslide, which consists of an estimated 4 million cubic meters of material that is making its way downhill slowly.  The slowly moving rock mass sits atop a (weak) sedimentary rock layer between thicker layers of Columbia River flood basalt.  The best case (and most likely scenario) is that this material continues to move south slowly and fall into an asphalt quarry.  However, an alternative (unlikely) scenario involves catastrophic failure which could block Highway 82, and dam the Yakima River flooding the surrounding area.  The objective of this RAPID proposal is to deploy 40 nodal seismometers in the surrounding area to continuously monitor seismic signals coming from the slide. Nodal seismometers (or nodes) are small, lightweight, cable free, three-component seismometers.  This state-of-the-art technology was developed for oil and gas exploration, however, nodes can also be used to study a variety of other seismic processes, such as earthquakes and landslides.  The size and (relatively) low cost of individual sensors allows for easily deployable, dense observation networks that produce high-quality data.  The resulting dataset can be used to determine the location, timing and nature of seismic signals coming from the slide.  The spatial and temporal evolution of slide related seismicity can be used to better characterize the landslide and potentially to predict when failure may occur.<br/><br/>Forty nodal seismometers will be deployed around the Rattlesnake Ridge landslide near Yakima, WA.  These instruments will be ""hot swapped"" every 30 days until the landslide fails or until the landslide reaches steady-state.  These deployments will result in three component seismic data from which travel times will be computed to form a 3D grid of potential sources. A network beamforming approach will be followed to detect, locate, and characterize seismic signals coming from the landslide.  This information will provide new insight into the size and nature of the slide of this rock block as well as the degree of internal deformation. This project has a potential broad societal impact and will help quantify and understand the landslide process in general."

This alternation is important not only for local weather but for the global transport of heat and moisture, as warm moist air crosses the middle latitudes from the tropics to the poles while colder and drier transits in the opposite direction.  This north-south exchange of heat and moisture plays an essential role in earth's climate, keeping the poles from getting too cold while limiting the temperature excess of the tropics.  Such climatic effects of weather systems are commonly studied by looking at the midlatitude stormtracks, defined as zones of maximum weather system activity.  In the Northern Hemisphere separate stormtracks are centered over the northern North Pacific and North Atlantic, while in the Southern Hemisphere a continuous stormtrack extends around the ""roaring 40s"" over the uninterrupted Southern Ocean.<br/><br/>This project seeks to understand how the mean latitude of the stormtracks, and the and strength of the energy transport by the weather systems moving along them, change in response to external factors including the seasonal cycle of solar heating, greenhouse gas concentrations, stratospheric aerosols, ice age cycles, and the distribution of continents and oceans.  The research is conducted using a theoretical framework developed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in which stormtracks are characterized in terms of the flux of moist static energy (MSE) across them, where MSE is a measure of energy which includes the thermal energy associated with air temperature, the latent energy of water vapor released as heat during condensation, and the potential energy of air parcels lifted against the force of gravity.  The MSE flux in stormtracks works in concert with MSE flux in circulations around large stationary pressure centers such as the Aleutian Low and the Bermuda High (referred to as stationary waves), and the circumglobal meridional overturning circulations (the Hadley and Ferrel cells), to transport energy from the tropics to the poles and balance the atmospheric energy budget.  Much of the previous research on stormtracks has been conducted through analysis of the momentum budget and related quantities (potential vorticity and Eliassen-Palm flux, for instance), thus the MSE analysis of the present work offers a novel and complementary perspective.<br/><br/>Preliminary work by the PI and colleagues shows compensation between MSE flux in stormtracks and stationary waves as a prominent feature of the seasonal cycle and the midlatitude response to El Nino events, while compensation between MSE flux in stormtracks and meridional overturning circulations appears in simulations of the atmopsheric response to greenhouse gases and the radiative effects of aerosols.  The present work extends these investigations and seeks to determine the fundamental dynamics through which these compensations, in which changes in stormtrack MSE flux are accompanied by opposing changes in other forms of MSE flux, come about.  The work is conducted through a combination of observational analysis and simulations with numerical models at varying levels of complexity.<br/><br/>The work has societal relevance as well as scientific interest due to the importance of stormtrack behavior for human activities in the midlatitudes, including the continental US.  In addition, one goal of the research is the identification of ""emergent constraints"" which can be used to assess the credibility of climate change simulations. Emergent constraints are relationships that emerge between model-to-model variations in simulated present-day climate (the predictor) and model-to-model differences in simulated future climate change (the predictand). Such constraints are used to assess the credibility of climate change projections, as models which incorrectly represent the predictor, which can be compared to real-world observations, are likely to produce comparable misrepresentations in their simulations of future climate change.  Such tests of climate change projections are valuable given the use of climate models to inform climate change adaptation efforts. The project also supports a graduate student and the participation of an undergraduate, thereby providing for the education and training of the future workforce in this research area."

By means of various high-precision on-board sensors, these devices capture rich contextual information about the wearer and his environment to enable several new and useful applications. However, this diverse set of on-board sensors also provides an additional attack surface. Access to these sensors, if not controlled appropriately, can be used as a side-channel by an adversary keen on obtaining private and sensitive information belonging to the wearer. Moreover, active misuse detection and resistance of these wearable device sensors is not straightforward. There is currently a lack of understanding of the various side-channel security vulnerabilities that are possible due to wearable devices and there is an urgent need to study the means for continuously protecting against them. The research in this project addresses this very timely topic.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is twofold: first, to demonstrate that wearable devices enable novel side-channel security and privacy threats, and second, to design continuous authentication techniques and adaptive access control mechanisms to survive these threats. Specifically, this research will evaluate private data inference and wearer tracking threats in wearable devices that utilize unprotected sensors as side-channels. This will be accomplished by designing appropriate learning-based classification and prediction mechanisms that can be used by an adversary for inferring sensitive data. On the protection front, this project will develop a multi-sensor activity and identity classification framework. This framework will leverage rich contextual sensor data (e.g., fine-grained movements, application usage and critical body parameters) to enable continuous identification and authentication of legitimate wearers and their activities. <br/><br/>By studying security and privacy preferences of a diverse population of users, this research will develop usable activity-based access control tools for this new wearable device paradigm. A significant research thrust of this project is to develop adaptive data-sharing mechanisms for dynamically regulating access to sensor data based on the wearers' security preferences, current context and perceived threats. Such mechanisms will serve as a good middle-ground between giving full access (no security) and making manual decisions for each access (poor usability). This project involves industry collaborators to facilitate adoption of research outcomes into the future design and development of wearable devices. Research results, including proof-of-concept applications, will be publicly available to allow dissemination, early industry adoption and integration with curricula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One example of an isoperimetric problem asks for the shape of a fence of fixed length that encloses the most area (the answer being a circular fence, which was known since ancient times).  The specific isoperimetric problems the principal investigator studies can be phrased as probabilistic problems, and this project develops some new tools from calculus to deal with these problems.  Different versions of Question (1) have been studied extensively by game theorists in the 1950s and 1960s, but investigations in theoretical computer science in the last two decades have given renewed interest for Questions (1), (2), and (3).  Generally speaking, theoretical computer science finds ways for computers to solve problems as quickly and as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>This project develops two analytic tools in probability: the calculus of variations and curvature.  Several recent isoperimetric problems in probability and theoretical computer science such as (1) and (2) ask for the Euclidean sets of smallest Gaussian perimeter and fixed Gaussian volume.  A breakthrough result of Choksi and Sternberg from 2007 allows the calculus of variations to be applied to these optimization problems, though others have not yet used variational tools for these problems.  The principal investigator will also develop theories of curvature for hypercontractive and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.  For a Riemannian manifold, Ricci curvature bounds imply logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, a result of Bakry and Emery from 1985.  In this project, different notions of Ricci curvature on random graphs will be investigated. Theories of Ricci curvature for noncommutative logarithmic Sobolev inequalities will also be investigated."

The most useful approximations should give not only accurate estimates, but also (1) come with tight and conservative error bounds and (2) can be improved continuously to trade time for increased accuracy in a memory efficient and predictable way (an ""anytime"" property). Such algorithms should allow us to solve easy problems with strong certificates of accuracy, and also identify harder problems together with clear guidance for further improvement. Unfortunately, most state-of-the-art methods, including deterministic variational methods and Monte Carlo-based methods, often do not fully satisfy these criteria.  <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a new generation of inference tools with tight non-asymptotic confidence bounds and anytime property.

The project also develops novel non-asymptotic error bounds for advanced Monte Carlo methods such as annealed importance sampling (AIS), based on which the researchers construct highly efficient estimates and bounds built on the state-of-the-art AIS. The approaches are tested extensively on various application domains, and provide practical guidance and open source packages for practitioners. The new powerful anytime, error-aware inference tools will lead much more reliable use of graphical models across different application domains, greatly expanding our ability of reasoning over large datasets and complex phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, they represent hope for a more peaceful future. On the other hand, because there is frequently large-scale unemployment, particularly among young men, youth may also personify anxiety about a return to conflict. The research supported by this award, which trains a graduate student in methods of scientific data collection and analysis, explores how young people navigate the limits and possibilities of post-conflict life and the multiple interventions that are designed to help them do so. Previous research has emphasized how peace-building projects transform social life under the expectation of peace-after-war. But young people looking at their own futures, rarely see such a clean break with the past. When governmental and non-governmental intervention programs attempt to make young people ""productive"" in the aftermath of violence, what exactly does that entail? And how do youth both within and outside of such programs make sense of their social position as marginal? Answering these questions has important implications for both security and development in post-conflict situations worldwide, including at smaller and more local scales in the United States.<br/><br/>Duke University anthropology doctoral candidate, Matthew Sebastian, under the supervision of Dr. Charles Piot, will pursue the research through16 months of ethnographic fieldwork on how young people experience and respond to vulnerability and security in post-conflict northern Uganda. He has chosen this site because Uganda, where more than three-quarters of the population is under thirty, offers a sharper view of how these transformations take place in real time than could be obtained in the U.S. He will collect data with multiple ethnographic methods, including participant observation, interviews, focus groups, and mapping techniques. He has chosen three key sites for the research: (1) securitized spaces  where young men and women work as armed guards; (2) a local nongovernmental organization that works to reintegrate formerly incarcerated youth; and (3) a local governmental initiative that is designed to combat youth idleness. These data will allow him to evaluate the carry-over of humanitarian and other  interventions in the everyday lives of young people and whether or not they succeed in improving the lives of youth and securing contemporary society and long-term peace. Findings will help to develop new theories of how post-conflict situations can have sustained peaceful outcomes. They will also be of interest to policy makers concerned to assure security after hostilities cease."

Water scarcity is an increasingly important global-scale issue that has significant negative impacts on health, security and economies.  Recent forecasts show a dramatic increase in the number of countries that will soon be affected by water scarcity given that global water consumption is expected to significantly increase due to population growth.  Membrane-based water desalination, which at large scale requires a huge capital investment, is recognized as a primary technology that can significantly improve supply to meaningfully offset scarcity and its impacts.  A critical factor in desalination plant operations is energy consumption, which increases due to membrane fouling, thus making fouling one of the most significant factors controlling the efficiency of these plants.  The proposed in-situ, real-time sensing system can be the enabling technology to allow implementation of advanced plant control algorithms based upon accurate detection of fouling at its earliest stages.  Such active detection capability will enable the most effective implementation of fouling mitigation strategies that can be optimized to save energy and reduce cost.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel time-reversal waveguide sensor for detection of early-stage (ES) fouling in reverse osmosis (RO) membrane desalination, which is the dominant technology for desalinating brackish water and seawater.  Fouling in RO systems has inorganic (scaling) and organic (biofouling) components and can be a highly variable process that depends on operational parameters as well as environmental conditions.  Efficient implementation of real-time control of RO desalination for fouling mitigation requires real-time sensing.  The overall objective of the proposed work is to develop sophisticated ultrasonic sensor technology that can reliably detect scaling and biofouling in the challenging multi-layer, spiral-wound (SW) geometry of commercial-scale RO systems.  The proposed work will make use of time-reversal mirrors to produce a simple signal from a multi-mode waveguide independent of the geometry of the waveguide configuration, thus overcoming the exceedingly complex and difficult to interpret signals associated with the use of a standalone waveguide.  The goals of the project are to demonstrate the capability to detect both early-stage inorganic and organic fouling under realistic operating conditions, the reliability and the robustness of the technology, and the ability to adapt the technology to the larger size modules that are increasingly important for commercial operation."

A recent surge of interest in acoustic communication in urban contexts highlights a potential adaptation of birds to life in many different cities. These studies have raised several fundamental questions regarding this potential adaptation, which have global applications to studies of animal communication and mate selection. This proposal will address three of these fundamental questions: (1) how are birds adjusting their song to the urban environment?; (2) how has song urbanization affected signal information?; and (3) are urban songs adaptive? To address these questions, this study will employ behavioral, ecological and mechanistic modeling approaches, using an established NSF model organism for behavioral studies, white-crowned sparrows. Meeting the proposal's objectives will transform the state of understanding of urban-dependent selection on mating behaviors and, more broadly, the adaptations of species that persist in urban environments. There are several aspects of the proposed study that should yield broad impacts: (1) broad dissemination of research results through community organizations, local and national museum displays, media outlets, and development of learner-centered teaching modules, (2) research opportunities for students from demographic groups that are under-represented in the sciences, (3) development of a statistical software package for simulating bird song evolution, and a workshop to train scientists, educators, and students in its use, and (4) collaboration and sharing of data with the National Park Service Sound Division, which will help national parks local to this study as well as national parks nationwide with their sound management plans."

A type of light scattering (Raman scattering) can reveal information about the structure of molecules.  In a scanning probe experiment, the probe tip can enhance the Raman scattering signal (this is called tip-enhanced Raman scattering, or 'TERS'). Professor Schultz is investigating the origin of Raman signal enhancements observed from nanostructures coupled with tip enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) imaging. The instrumentation and methodology is being used in collaboration with Snite Museum of Art to identify pigments in medieval artwork and aid conservation studies. The incorporation of graduate and undergraduate students in this research provides a platform for promoting measurement science and a training opportunity for the students to gain research skills relevant to academic research and commercial interests.<br/><br/>The project focuses on understanding the plasmonic effects that give rise to chemical specific signals in TERS experiments. TERS imaging combined with hyperspectral dark-field microscopy determines the plasmon modes and Raman scattering arising from the interaction of a TERS-tip with various sized and shaped nanoparticles (NPs). The electric fields experienced by molecules around the nanostructures are being studied by vibrational frequency shifts rather than signal intensity. Chemical functionalization of the TERS tip and the surface is being used to study the location of the molecules that give rise to the observed TERS signals. The sensitivity of the TERS measurements is being investigated to determine the possibility of single protein studies. This project has the potential to enable chemical characterization of protein receptors in intact cell membranes."

This has correspondingly aggravated water scarcity, which threatens the long-term sustainability of water resources. Since the US is one of the largest in terms of water footprint, the country is very vulnerable to moderate and severe drought. To mitigate the drought vulnerability, an effective drought monitoring and forecasting system with assessment of drought recovery time is critical for decision makers. This project will develop a cyber-enabled ensemble data assimilation and terrestrial modeling system to characterize the land surface condition for not only assessing the agricultural drought but also providing the initial condition for probabilistic drought forecasting. These estimates will provide the basis for drought recovery estimation. The project will serve as a prototype to build capacity for large-scale drought studies and applications, and will directly enhance the ability of state water managers to take appropriate and timely measures during periods of water scarcity as a result of drought.<br/><br/>The study relies on a variety of massive earth and environmental observational data in connection with advanced dynamical and Bayesian modeling, to account for uncertainties and provide reliable drought estimation with the goal to further freshwater resource sustainability. Ensemble modeling and probabilistic estimation to quantify the uncertainties in Earth system science by means of data assimilation has been a salient bottleneck in operationalization. Due to the multi-scale nature of hydrologic processes and under-determinedness of most hydrologic systems as well as the presence of epistemic and random uncertainties, dynamic physical-based and stochastic modeling to probabilistically characterize drought onset and predict it at seasonal scale requires proper parameterization of the system. This research proposes a modern ensemble data assimilation system operating in real time to characterize land surface conditions for monitoring drought, develops a computational framework for effective data assimilation, and implements an approach that targets computational scalability, power, and reliability in the computational framework."

Developers must anticipate and adapt to numerous different devices and users, and to the changing conditions and environments caused by mobility. One minute the network is fast and free, the next it is slow and metered. The importance of adaptation to successful mobile apps is well understood. However, little language and system support exists to help developers create and improve adaptive mobile apps.<br/>This project investigates a new system enabling the next generation of adaptive apps. Central to the approach is a new language construct that allows developers to express flexibility within their source code. This allows decisions that today must be made during development to be deferred, and leaves flexibility that can be harnessed to enable adaptation. Intelligently utilizing flexibility exposed by developers requires novel approaches to automated pre-deployment testing and dynamic adaptation policy generation. The project also explores how to guide developers toward useful flexibility, and how flexibility should be managed and exposed in current and next-generation programming languages.<br/><br/>The integrated educational plan also explores how to harness flexibility, but uses it to adapt online courses to make them more effective.

Extension and shape changes are frequently accompanied with deposition of material into their extracellular environments. In plants, cells also build a network of carbohydrate polymers that act as a rigid barrier, known as the cell wall. Plant cells grow by building new cell wall material and plant cell shape is intimately linked with how this material is deposited on the outside of the cell. This project will work to elucidate the link between delivery of cell wall material and the cell's internal network of dynamic filaments known as the cytoskeleton. In particular the PI will use sophisticated light microscope imaging methods to test the hypothesis that formin proteins are critical for targeting actin assembly processes that initiate cell wall material exocytosis.

Effective response to this public health challenge necessitates adoption of an ""outside-the-box"" strategy for the de novo design of novel classes of microbicides. The goal of this NSF Career award is to develop a novel self-assembling antimicrobial nanofiber (SAAN) platform for safer and more effective therapeutic administration of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) compared to conventional treatment options. Systematic engineering of SAANs has minimized host cell cytotoxicity, improved their protease-resistance and their antimicrobial activity against broad-spectrum bacteria. The success of the proposed work will open new avenues for AMP-based antimicrobial therapy to treat a variety of infectious diseases found in both civilian hospitals and military facilities. The fundamental knowledge developed from the proposed research activities will provide a powerful new glossary of fundamental design principles for the synthesis and deployment of AMPs. It will have a transformative impact on the multi-billion-dollar research focused on conventional antibiotics and AMPs by re-engineering and ""re-formatting"" thousands of available AMPs in the peptide databank to form SAANs, thereby greatly boosting their therapeutic potential. The multidisciplinary research involving chemistry, microbiology, engineering, nanoscience, and pharmaceutical sciences provides ample opportunities to train and educate students at all levels.

This CAREER award supported by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Clarkson University focuses on a new paradigm of Self-Assembled Antimicrobial Nanofibers (SAANs) as a vehicle-free AMP delivery system to alleviate the drawback associated with conventional AMPs. In SAANs, AMPs serve as both therapeutics and key structural components to program and direct the assembly through highly specific intermolecular interactions. Through the proposed work, we will build a toolbox of cationic de novo designed peptides with expanded chemical functionality by which to construct various SAANs families, and explore the effect of new functional groups on the molecular and supramolecular packing of SAANs, antimicrobial activity and hemocompatibility. Fundamental knowledge about the structure-activity relationship is essential for the design of new antimicrobial nanomaterials with precise control over molecular structure, nanostructure, stimuli-responsive antimicrobial activity and exquisite biocompatibility. The impact of this proposal lies in that SAANs could potentially be established as a new and unique AMP delivery platform with well-defined filamentous structure and the ease of incorporating multi-therapeutics for combinatorial antimicrobial and chemotherapy to treat various human diseases.

Bioenergy transduction, a type of energy transport in which the form of the energy also changes, is one of the most fascinating aspects of life.  Biomolecular motors and pumps transduce energy from one form to the other with remarkable efficiency. The study of energy transduction in biomolecular ion pumps involves developing quantum mechanical and classical models that properly describe the energetics and efficiency of ion transport through the interior of a transmembrane protein. The problem of macromolecular assembly, which underlies many fascinating biological processes such as the formation of muscle fiber, requires the development of effective coarse-grained models that strike the balance of computational efficiency and biophysical specificity. The project offers research opportunities for students at all levels who wish to work at the intersection of chemistry, biology and engineering.  Dr. Cui is actively engaged with programs aimed at broadening participation in physical and biological science by members of under-represented minorities.<br/><br/><br/>For the problem of ion pumping, by adopting the minimum free energy path approach and a multi-layer Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QMMM) model, Cui and co-workers can significantly improve the accuracy and sampling for the study of long-range proton transfers in complex biomolecules compared to previous efforts. By adopting the chemical potential equalization scheme to represent the polarization of different QM regions, they can properly describe ion transport through the interior of a transmembrane protein that is rich in polar and charged motifs. This computational framework represents the first attempt to include the membrane potential in QM/MM type of simulations. For the problem of coiled-coil assembly, which describes a broad class of problems in which the proper assembly of biomolecules relies critically on a limited degree of flexibility in their structures, their proposed multipolar coarse-grained model makes a natural connection between atomistic and coarse-grained representations with a transparent framework for parameterization.

Cells must communicate with each other in order to form tissues and ultimately establish a body plan. In contrast to animals, plant cells are surrounded by walls permanently locking cells to their sister cells. Thus, tissue formation and cell-to-cell communication is quite different in plants compared to animals. To negotiate the permanence of the wall, plants have evolved intricate channels that mediate movement of molecules between cells. While these channels were identified in the 1800s, it has been very challenging to understand how these channels function, and what determines whether they are open or closed. The research here will capitalize on findings that a protein named myosin VIII is found near these channels during very specific stages of development. Plants lacking this protein exhibit patterning defects that likely result from impaired cell-to-cell communication. By investigating the nature of how this molecule interacts with the channels, this research will provide much needed insights into regulation of cell-to-cell communication, and have broad implications for the fields of plant cell and developmental biology. Including undergraduates from both a primarily undergraduate institution as well as a research university will further broaden the impact of the research. The undergraduates will work together to incorporate quantitative cellular modeling and molecular cell biology to answer fundamental questions in cell-to-cell communication. Additionally, a program for middle-school aged girls will be developed to encourage the participation of women in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Plasmodesmata, the channels that connect plant cells to mediate cell-to-cell communication, are poorly understood at the molecular level. These channels have been challenging to study because they are absolutely essential for plant viability and development. This project will investigate this critical developmental problem in the cell and developmental biological plant model, the moss Physcomitrella patens. P. patens is uniquely suited for these studies as it has a simple body plan that is highly amenable to cell biological and genetic manipulation. This research will build upon the development of a moss line that contains a single myosin VIII protein, an actin-based molecular motor, which localizes to plasmodesmata at only one cross wall at a particular stage of development, providing a long-needed genetic and cellular system to study how actin and myosin may regulate the conductance of plasmodesmata. Using a combination of quantitative microscopy and computational modeling, this project will determine whether myosin VIII has an impact on the movement of molecules between cells. Taking advantage of myosin VIII as a molecular handle, the proposed research will identify new pathways regulating plasmodesmata function, ultimately impacting patterning and development. Since myosin VIII and actin are highly conserved between moss and seed plants, these studies are expected to identify evolutionarily ancient mechanisms controlling cell-to-cell communication and tissue patterning."

In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, low drug solubility is the most common barrier to developing an effective pre-clinical drug formulation. Pre-clinical formulation is critical to the eventual success of a drug, with major financial consequences of poor drug solubility during pre-clinical formulation. Nearly 70-80% of all drugs fail during pre-clinical and phase I clinical development, with an average investment loss of $100-800 million per drug. Additionally, there are major problems with the biocompatibility of synthetic surfactants such as Tween 80 used to improve drug solubility; Tween 80 has been shown to cause severe side-effects such as anaphylaxis in IV chemotherapeutic formulations. Thus, there is a current, unmet need to develop (1) a detailed understanding of how altering surfactant structure influences drug solubiization to prevent poor drug solubility and associated side-effects and (2) a flexible method for high-yield synthesis of novel biosurfactants at a cost competitive with currently used synthetic surfactants such as Tween 80. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop a series of biocompatible biosurfactants capable of overcoming the current limitations of commercial drug formulations in terms of cost, scale and targeted delivery. The results of this work will contribute directly to improved drug bioavailability, biocompatibility and efficacy and enable use of designed biosurfactants in a wide range of commercial drug formulations. Additionally, in partnership with Northampton Community College (NCC), the PI will develop a laboratory course for Lehigh and NCC students in biomanufacturing, and organize a 10-week summer internship program for NCC students interested in pursuing post-graduate studies in STEM fields. Ultimately, the biosurfactant structure, function and design studies described in this CAREER proposal will provide a unique, long-term project that has direct application to a wide range of challenges in drug formulation as well as a unique, cross-institutional educational opportunity for Lehigh and NCC students in STEM-related fields.<br/><br/>The PI will utilize an integrated, structure-guided approach to design variants of the protein hydrophobin (HYD), a naturally-occurring, fungal biosurfactant, to improve drug solubility, biocompatibility and targeted delivery. Importantly, a major focus of this work is on development and production of designed biosurfactants at a scale and cost competitive with synthetic surfactants such as Tween 80. The challenges of engineering novel functions into the biosurfactant to improve targeting and drug solubility will be addressed through (1) engineering HYD variants with pH-dependent surface activity (pH-HYD) for targeted drug release, (2) evolving HYD variants for enhanced solubilization (s-HYD) of a given target drug and (3) integrating both pH- and s-HYD into a commercial-scale formulation that maximizes drug solubility and targeting. Using previous structural information regarding HYD, the investigator will design a series of electrostatically-stabilized HYD variants, each of which will enable pH-dependent assembly and disassembly. Similarly, using a high-yield secretion system developed for HYD coupled to high-throughput methods for characterization, the PI will utilize directed evolution to select HYD variants that enhance drug solubility using a series of model hydrophobic drug compounds as benchmarks. Lastly, by integrating both engineered and evolved HYD variants, a novel, hybrid formulation will be identified that can both deliver drug at high solubility and target delivery effectively. Ultimately, this approach will lead to tailored biosurfactant properties precisely to enable formulation of previously insoluble drugs, engineer enhanced targeting mechanisms such as pH (pH-HYD) to reduce side-effects associated with current drug formulations and develop a low-cost, scalable and sustainable route for biosurfactant biomanufacturing that is broadly applicable to a wide range of formulation application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies of interdisciplinary research teams indicate that team members struggle to achieve knowledge synthesis across disciplines. Issues arise due to the inability of team members to develop deep knowledge at the frontier of other disciplines and to connect that knowledge with their own expertise to provide a collaborative path forward. The ability to work collaboratively in a research team with others who may hold very different perspectives is a critical aspect of preparing today's students to meet future workforce demands. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track is a collaborative project led by the University of Texas at El Paso involving graduate students and faculty from multiple institutions.  The project will test a new model for training graduate student teams in environmental sciences to overcome knowledge integration and synthesis challenges.<br/><br/>This model will draw on findings from cognitive, learning, and social sciences to develop and test training for graduate students and faculty in model-based reasoning approaches. Model-based reasoning theory posits that humans reason by constructing an internal mental model of the situations, events, and processes that they encounter, and that external representations can be used to facilitate construction of these mental models. External representations include the use of analogies, metaphor, visual models, diagrams and/or other representations for abstraction and communication of complex concepts. In a team setting, these external representations are called boundary negotiating objects.  This project will place doctoral students in multidisciplinary teams and facilitate a structured, participatory process that includes a progression of standard, individual and group model-based reasoning activities as well as instruction on the purposeful co-creation of boundary negotiating objects.  Students from multiple institutions will learn together through two-week summer experiences; students who are conducting research in conjunction with larger interdisciplinary teams will be targeted.  In addition, the project will train faculty from multiple institution in the model.  The project will examine the implementation of ten faculty members.  Survey, interview, and digital data will be collected to examine how graduate students respond to being directly exposed to theories behind the approach as well as the efficacy of the approach as faculty employ it in their graduate classes. This design will allow comparison of the outcomes from guiding students on what to do, versus teaching students why and how to do it.  <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.

Among the various toxicity effects observed, genotoxicity (the damage to genes from chemicals) is of particular concern to human and other lives because genotoxicity from nanomaterial (nanogenotoxicity) can potentially cause cells to mutate and eventually lead to cancer. This study will demonstrate the application of a new high-throughput, rapid and effective nanogenotoxicity assay platform and a new mechanism-driven hierarchical model framework that will be tested. The results of the research will fill in the urgent knowledge gap in mechanistic understanding of the environmental and health impact of CNMs. This research has significant benefits to the environment and public health protection. The outcome from the research will aid strategies related to nanoscience and technology, as well as elucidate the environmental and health implications of nanomaterials, which will help bridge the gap between scientific research, creation of commercial products and public health protection. In terms of broader impact on the community, the synergized arrays of education outreach and public education programs will present the technology, benefits, and societal and environmental impact of nanotechnology to a wide range of audiences at many levels. For example, PI Gu had initiated the BEST (Biotechnology for the Environment, Showcase and Training) program as part of a CAREER award. With this proposal, she will be able to expand that program, as well as collaborate with additional existing programs (e.g. a RET program, NEU CONNECTIONS, etc) to promote training of students and teachers. Both PIs will also work with the Boston Museum of Science to create multimedia that disseminates research to the public.<br/><br/>This project proposes to perform a comprehensive and systematic genotoxicity assessment of a variety of well-characterized carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs), using a newly developed high throughput toxicogenomics-based 3-D gene/protein expression profiling technique, with the aim to relate nanogenotoxicity with CNMs' physicochemical and structural properties and, explore prototype mechanism-driven QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) model. Genotoxicity of four different CNMs (SWCNT, fullerene C60, carbon black and graphene) and their variations will be evaluated by measuring the NM-induced expression alteration in genes and proteins that are indicative or essential for the known DNA damage and repair pathways, using the newly developed molecular genotoxicity assay platform and, with the extension to multiple species across different taxonomic levels (bacteria, yeast and human). Dose-response relationships and molecular genotoxicity endpoints will be determined using the molecular effect level index (MELI) recently proposed by us. To validate the proposed molecular assay and confirm the genotoxicity of CNMs tested, conventional phenotypic genotoxcity assays will be performed in parallel. An array of modern techniques will be employed to determine the purity, elemental composition, dimension, surface chemistry, aggregate size and state, zeta potential, hydrophilicity etc. of the CNMs. A prototype nanogenotoxicity QSAR model with hierarchical structures that integrates current QSAR framework with molecular bioassay information through correlative links among CNMs descriptors, DNA damage mechanism-specific molecular endpoints and phenotypic genotoxicity endpoints will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the carbon is in a dissolved organic form, and it serves as food for aquatic microorganisms.  The challenge is that the chemical diversity of dissolved organic carbon is very great, and the genetic diversity of aquatic microbes is also immense.  Accordingly, this project will use state-of-the art genomic methods to study the diversity and specific functions of these microorganisms.  The results will fill a critical gap in understanding the specific metabolic capabilities of these microbes and how they carry out the key ecosystem function of transforming and metabolizing highly complex, riverborne dissolved organic carbon.  The data that will be collected are important for predicting the impacts of land-use change, nutrient use, and shifting climate on freshwater quality across the USA.  The research involves a collaboration with the Yale Peabody Museum Evolution program for inner-city New Haven high-school students to train interns and develop an interactive museum exhibit on U.S. rivers. The project will also train a postdoctoral researcher, and undergraduate and graduate students, including members of underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to describe interactions and feedbacks between watershed diversity, microbial functional diversity, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemistry in 36 large U.S. rivers, and to experimentally link gene expression with DOM degradation in five of them (the Altamaha, Columbia, Mississippi, St. Lawrence and Yukon). River sampling will be conducted in collaboration with a U.S. Geological Survey stream network. This research will address the concept that microbial genetic mechanisms in river ecosystems are closely linked to climate and landscape features that control river environmental conditions, particularly DOM quality. This concept implies that microbial function is shaped by DOM composition, climate, and river chemistry. These shaping forces alter the functional genetic capabilities required for competitive success within riverine microbial communities, and, thus, drive shifts in functional gene expression and phylogenetic composition, that, in turn, increase the efficiency of DOM metabolism and biogeochemical processes. Three hypotheses are to be tested: (1) the functional genetic composition and gene expression patterns of riverine microbial communities are correlated with the composition of riverine DOM; (2) community gene expression patterns vary predictably in response to shifts in the available forms of DOM; and, (3) the composition of riverine bacterial communities correlates with the composition of riverine DOM over space and time, and varies with watershed-specific climatic factors. The first hypothesis will be addressed with an empirical study of microbial community gene content (metagenomics), gene expression (metatranscriptomics), and DOM diversity (high-resolution analytical chemistry) during four seasons in five rivers that encompass a broad range of DOM composition. The second hypothesis will be addressed with an experimental study to identify active organisms and genes expressed by freshwater microbial metabolism. The third hypothesis will be addressed with an empirical study of microbes, DOM, and river chemistry in 36 major U.S. rivers. Statistical approaches being developed through a Microsoft-sponsored international working group (BioGeoChemistry Data System) will be applied to link microbial and DOM data."

These disabilities include reduced mobility, hearing loss, and respiratory problems. There is currently no cure for OI, and treatments relying on the use of bisphosphonates have questionable efficacy. With improved management, these children now progress to adulthood, where the challenge of age-related fractures occurs. There is therefore a critical need for fundamental, quantitative research into bone that can then support the development of new, effective treatments.  More effective treatments will enhance the quality of life of people with OI. As fracture and fragility are the main symptoms of OI, this CAREER proposal aims to first understand what features of OI bone make it more susceptible to fracture and then evaluate the efficacy of current therapies.  This will be done by examining the actual bone resistance to fracture. Combining rigorous fracture mechanics experiments with high-resolution imaging and innovative computational models, this project will examine the relation between structure, composition, and mechanics of the bone in OI with and without treatment.  This will then reveal the mechanisms of crack propagation in OI bone at an unprecedented detail.  It will also provide a foundation for the development of improved therapies that target the key properties in bone that will affect bone fragility.  The techniques developed through this project can be applied to any bone fragility disease, which will further advance the development of effective therapies for these conditions.  Improved outcomes for individuals with these disorders has the potential for substantial economic, health and welfare benefits to society.  The educational plan of this CAREER plan promotes training, mentoring and learning of diverse students, representing the next-generation of engineers. By broad outreach activities connected with research, we will inspire and attract children, students at any age and the general public to STEM disciplines.  These include social media videos about bone mechanics, learning modules for K12 students, and inviting young adults with OI to participate in workshops to learn about the latest research and bone mechanics in general.<br/><br/>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that causes an extreme susceptibility to spontaneous fracture which then progresses such that skeletal deformities and severe disabilities result.  Current treatments involve the use of bisphosphonates; however, their efficacy has not yet been demonstrated.  By combining cutting edge experimental techniques for the analysis of fracture mechanics with high resolution imaging and novel finite element models, this project will investigate the relationship between structure, composition, and mechanics in OI bone with and without treatment.  Improved understanding of the fracture mechanisms associated with OI and the factors that cause the fracture susceptibility will support the development of improved therapies that can then target those aspects of bone structure and molecular organization. The educational component of this project seeks to increase understanding of bone mechanics and its importance, both among engineering students and the public.  A combination of formal and informal educational activities will reach undergraduate and graduate engineering students, K12 students, and the general public.

For many years, researchers argued that providing individuals and communities with open access to natural resources would inevitably lead to overuse and ultimately to destruction through deforestation, overfishing, overgrazing, and other environmentally detrimental activities. However, subsequent research by political scientist and Nobel laureate Dr. Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues found that this ""tragedy of the commons"" scenario is not universal. Instead, some small communities do effectively manage local lands without external oversight. This appears to occur most often when communities have enduring, well-developed social norms for maintaining the natural environment and for sanctioning individuals who violate community standards. But these findings raise another question: If some communities can do it, why not all? Why are some communities effective at preserving their natural resources while others are not? The research supported by this award seeks to answer that question. Anthropologist Dr. Sean S. Downey (University of Maryland) will test the theory effective land management rests on more than just having the right social norms; in addition, he suggests, the social norms, the particular characteristics of the local environment, and the ecosystem services the environment provides to local users must work together to produce ecological sustainability.<br/><br/>Few communities in the United States are both free of external oversight and also dependent primarily on the local natural environment for subsistence. Therefore, Dr. Downey and his team will travel to two forest-based villages located in a remote area in southern Belize to test the theory. The communities have a demonstrated history of local ecological knowledge and environmental stewardship but there has historically been little top-down environmental management: an ideal location for understanding how local community norms and natural ecosystem dynamics interact and create a sustainable forestry system. The researchers will collect data through multiple methods: household surveys; farmer land use interviews; and close monitoring of how the communities affect their forests. The monitoring will be accomplished through piecing together high-resolution photographs of the usage areas around each village using a GPS-linked multi-spectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. These photos will subsequently be stitched together into geo-referenced two-dimensional photo-mosaics, ground-truthed through farm plots surveys, and analyzed to understand how these environments provide for the local communities, how they are affected by human farming activity, and also how these forests recover to sustain future generations. The research team will also conduct behavioral economics experiments to assess how cooperation and punishment in the communities relate to natural resource use, and use computational analysis to determine the most important social and natural factors for effective long-term natural resource management. The project also has several integrated educational goals, including training the next generation of American scientists, educators, and policy-makers in the science of complexity; developing coursework and facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration at the University of Maryland; and offering a service learning project for American students in Belize. Ultimately, findings from this research will provide insight into the factors that promote effective local management of natural resources and this could lead to better and more efficient management of public lands at a significant cost savings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The processes that structure western Pacific vent communities, such as the extent to which physical and chemical conditions change over time, the dispersal of organisms among hydrothermal vent fields, and the physiological capacities of the symbionts and their animal host are poorly understood. And yet, large-scale industrial mining of polymetallic sulfide deposits at active hydrothermal vents is imminent in the Western Pacific. In 2005 and 2006, 19 long term study sites were established on the Eastern Lau Spreading Center by generating high resolution photomosaics of animal communities in both active and inactive flow areas and on both sulfide chimneys and on lavas, and mapping spatially discrete physical and chemical environmental measurements on to these photomosaics. Revisiting these study sites and acquiring data of comparable resolution in the coming year, combined with detailed studies of the physiology of key species, will significantly increase our understanding of the physiology of the fauna and how these communities respond to change.  The resulting data will provide crucial information on the fauna and communities endemic to this region that is critical for predicting and mitigating the effects of mining activities on these ecosystems, and for informing plans for monitoring potential recovery post-mining. To ensure that Western Pacific Islanders are engaged throughout the duration of our program, local scientists will be included in the fieldwork, in-country presentations to students and the general public will be given in association with port stops, and findings will be communicated to local resource managers through the Geoscience Division of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). The principal investigators are also proponents of fostering greater ""open access and collaboration"" among oceanographers, and telepresence will be used during this expedition to experiment on two different models of collaboration, which - along with the resulting scientific insights - will be published to disseminate the results of this effort. Finally, in collaboration with the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH), an exhibit module and course curricula will be developed presenting the effects of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance on biodiversity. It will feature high-resolution imagery, animal and mineralogical samples, and deep-sea research technologies. Web-enabled kiosks will allow visitors to delve deeper into the subject material. The HMNH attracts 200,000 visitors each year, including 33,000 students (K-12) and their teachers, as well as visitors from around the world. <br/><br/>The funded interlinked studies of holobiont (symbionts and their animal host) physiology and distribution, community structure and change over time, genetic connectivity, and holobiont ecosystem engineering will significantly increase our understanding of the processes structuring hydrothermal vent ecosystems in general, and those of the Western Pacific in particular. Vent fields in the proposed study area within the Lau Basin are located in relative proximity to one another with no known barriers to biological dispersal and span a pronounced regional gradient in both geological setting and physico-chemical conditions. This natural laboratory, that is home to a significant diversity of vent fauna and where long-term study sites were established a decade ago, presents an opportunity to gain broad new insights into the ecological and physiological characteristics of the vent fauna and the processes that structure these communities. Accordingly, the project will A) determine the rates and patterns of natural physical, chemical, and biological changes at vents in the Lau Basin over a decadal time period by acquiring new high-resolution, co-registered geological, chemical and biological maps and comparing these with data of comparable resolution acquired in 2005, 2006, and 2009; B) evaluate the role of symbiont physiology -in particular their use of key energy sources not previously measured- in the realized distribution of the holobionts by coupling genetic characterization of host and symbionts with shipboard physiological measurements and gene expression studies, and physico-chemical microhabitat characterization; C) quantify the effects of different holobionts on the surrounding environment by coupling repeated spatially integrated measurements of physico-chemical conditions to all collections and; D) assess the influence of genetic connectivity of populations in the Lau Basin on the distribution of holobionts across regional gradients in geology and geochemistry. They will provide new and generally applicable insights on the role of multiple symbionts in both the distribution of their animal hosts and in structuring associated communities. These efforts will also constrain the roles of genetic connectivity, environmental chemistry, and holobiont capabilities in structuring communities along this spreading center. Moreover, through co-registered animal collections and in situ geochemical measurements, the investigators will develop first-order estimates of the extent to which holobiont aggregations affect geochemical flux from diffuse flows, which accounts for ~50% of all vent geochemical flux. Ultimately, this effort will provide critical and robust data on the dynamics of vent fields and communities in the western Pacific biogeographic province, as well as on the underlying physiological and ecological factors governing these patterns."

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a central chemical in streams and rivers that affects the forms and movements of contaminants, light penetration through the water, metabolism of life in the streams, pH, and the efficiency of water treatments by municipalities.  This study aims to improve predictions of DOM formation and movement from small headwater streams and our understanding of the factors that change the amount and forms of DOM during as it moves downstream.  One goal of this research is to greatly improve a computer model of DOM transport and transformation as it moves through a watershed and into the headwater streams.  This model links rainfall and runoff that generate streamflow to the biological and chemical processes that lead to changes in the amount and forms of DOM.   The model will be tested against actual measurements of DOM made in several headwater streams of the Connecticut River along its length.  Measurements will then also be made in larger parts of the Connecticut River downriver that will help explain how DOM changes along the entire drainage network.  This project challenges a long standing picture of how streams and rivers work, called the River Continuum Concept, proposing that a newer view may be required, referred to as the Pulse-Shunt Concept.  <br/><br/>This project will involve graduate students and a post-doctoral associate in the laboratory, field, and modeling ends of the research.

This approach accommodates behavior adaptation in the recovery of physical aspects of infrastructure. This adaptation is not well understood or integrated with current restoration plans. By better understanding adaptive behaviors and their dependence on different infrastructures and coordinating recovery across these infrastructures, such a framework can help households return to productive activities faster. For instance, if employees cannot commute, they may work remotely if power is available. This approach to infrastructure restoration has the potential to substantially improve the efficiency of post-disaster return to productive daily life. If infrastructure recovery is coordinated and focuses on actual needs, restoration also may be more cost effective. To help realize these benefits, the project's team of civil engineers, social scientists, and computer scientists will convey research results through practitioner-oriented seminars held with FEMA, state emergency management agencies, transportation authorities, and electric power utilities.  The multi-disciplinary approach and outreach activities developed for Virginia Tech's Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity and the University of Michigan's Detroit-Area Pre-College Engineering Program will help broaden the research participation of underrepresented groups and attract new students to the respective fields.  <br/><br/>Technically, the project's objectives include: developing improved methods for collecting, analyzing, and archiving tweets and webpages - integrated with data collected from official or specialized sources - in support of understanding the interplay of behavior and power and transportation infrastructures in disruptions; collecting novel data with activity diaries that incorporate adaptation and use of technologies; determining how the nature of information about infrastructure disruptions and the way in which individuals process this information shape responses to disruptions and preferred tradeoffs; identifying how these behavior adaptations induce or magnify substitutive interdependencies between transportation and power systems; and developing recovery strategies that coordinate among the infrastructures and account for adaptation. To achieve these objectives, the study will use social media, official utility and transport information, and activity panel surveys to develop behavioral and infrastructure outage models that feed a coordinated, behaviorally-aware power and transport recovery model using optimization and agent based modeling. The project team's approach specifically examines the adaptation of individuals who pursue alternate means to accomplish an activity goal and the interdependence between power and transportation infrastructure that results from this adaptation during disruptions.

The ready availability of cells is crucial for the wide application and eventual success of cell-based therapies involving tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, cell transplantation, blood transfusion, and stem cell therapy. The objective of this project is to perform a systematic investigation to understand the protective effect of trehalose, a nontoxic sugar, during freezing and drying of trehalose-laden human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) and in banking the dried cells at ambient temperature. As trehalose has been used for many lower organisms to survive extreme cold and drought in nature, it is hypothesized that trehalose-laden stem cells will behave similarly.  <br/><br/>This project will have a significant impact on improving healthcare by facilitating the development of cell lyopreservation as an enabling technology for the success of cell-based medical treatments. The use of a nontoxic sugar (trehalose) to replace toxic chemicals (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide or DMSO) for cell banking is well aligned with the NSF SusCHEM initiative to replace toxic chemicals with earth-abundant, inexpensive, and benign materials. To understand the fundamental science of drying living cells for banking in a state of suspended animation at ambient temperature, three specific research tasks are proposed. These include  (i) investigation of the effect of freeze-drying parameters on the kinetics of drying trehalose solutions important for lyopreservation of primary hADSCs and on the microscopic morphology of the dried products, using freeze-drying microscopy and a benchtop freeze-dryer for small and large samples, respectively; (ii) simulation and experimental quantification of the biophysical responses of the trehalose-laden hADSCs to freezing and drying including cell dehydration and intracellular ice formation important for cell survival; and (iii) analysis of the morphology, survival, long-term proliferation, and stem cell properties and functions of the primary hADSCs after freeze-drying and banking at ambient temperature. The stem cell properties and functions will be assessed by the expression of stem cell gene and protein markers and their capability of adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation. A high survival and intact function of the primary hADSCs are anticipated after freeze-drying and long-term storage at ambient temperature under optimal conditions.<br/>This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is cosponsored by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research."

One of the most defining characteristics for the human species and the other primates is large brain size relative to body size. Yet, despite having larger brains than most other mammals, human and nonhuman primates do not show an increase in their basal metabolic rate (a measure of energy utilization by the body) compared to other mammals, raising the question of how the high energetic cost of such large brains is met. This trend suggests that there is an energetic trade-off with another energy-demanding tissue in the body when brain size increases; if we are not using more energy overall, then energy that could be invested in another part of our body is instead likely being utilized to fuel our large brains. Preliminary research shows that primates have low muscle mass when compared to other animals, and humans, who have the most notable increase in brain size, show a 50% reduction in overall muscle mass when compared with other mammals. This research therefore tests the hypothesis that skeletal muscle is in direct competition with the brain for glucose and oxygen, such that the high energetic demands of large brain size are met through constraining muscle mass, constituting an energetic tradeoff between skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, and brain growth and maintenance.      <br/><br/>If the brain does constrain muscle mass, then 1)larger brains should be associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass; 2)the percentage of type I muscle fibers (a type of muscle cell that uses energy [glucose, a type of sugar] in a similar fashion to brain cells) should show a relative decrease in relation to larger brain size; and 3)muscle mass development should be suppressed until brain growth is complete, and once complete, there should be an increase in muscle mass development. To test these predictions, muscle tissue samples will be collected from a diverse array of primate specimens, comprising a range of brain sizes and representing all developmental stages. The generated muscle energy use profiles for each species will then be analyzed in relation to variation in brain size, with the results applied to understanding the interaction between brain size and evolved metabolic strategies. <br/><br/>Reducing muscle mass may have predisposed primates such as humans to certain metabolic disorders (e.g., type 2 diabetes); thus, understanding if there is such a constraint has important health implications. Ultimately, the data collected can be incorporated into studies of growth and development, as well as biomechanics, and the results may encourage development of biomedical gene therapies. The research also will provide a rich database for scientists in other disciplines focusing on animal anatomy and physiology, facilitating and expanding future research. The collaborative project brings together international researchers, and will support the training of multiple undergraduate and graduate students from three US universities. As two of these universities are in EPSCoR states, and one is a historically minority-serving institution, the project will foster research advancement for underserved and underrepresented populations."

For example, prey often spend less time feeding and more time watching out for predators, which comes with the cost of lower food intake and thus slower growth. Such ""non-consumptive effects"" (NCEs) have been described for a wide range of terrestrial and marine prey species, from elk to clams, but mostly in short-term (< 1 month) experiments. These prior results suggest that in some cases, the behavioral changes (NCEs) have a bigger effect on prey populations than consumption by predators (CEs). However, those short-term, controlled experiments may artificially inflate the perceived importance of NCEs. Over longer time periods, prey may adapt or become acclimated to predation risk, and NCEs may become less important. Additionally, environmental variability (e.g., differences in the availability of the prey's food between study sites) may have a bigger effect on prey populations than NCEs do. This project will use a combination of short- (months) and long-term (years) field experiments and mathematical models to evaluate the role of NCEs on Florida oyster reefs. The prey species in this study is the eastern oyster, an important marine resource in the southeast US for harvesting and habitat creation; the main oyster predator is a mud crab. In this study, results from mathematical models of oyster populations will be compared to experimental data from the field to see whether including NCEs in the model leads to better model predictions. Better understanding of NCEs in oysters should improve management of that important marine resource. Furthermore, the mathematical model will be used to develop broader, generalizable conclusions about the importance of NCEs that could be applied to other important prey species. This project will provide data useful for oyster resource management, will support public education regarding the ecological importance of NCEs, and will enhance the scientific engagement of underrepresented groups in the study region. The project will support a partnership with the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve in Florida, including data sharing, sponsoring an oyster management symposium, and funding the development of multimedia scientific outreach materials at the reserve that will be used by a large and diverse population of K-12 students in the surrounding community. The project will train a postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, two undergraduate students, and research results will be disseminated by those students and the principal investigators at scientific conferences, in journal publications, and in online content through an ongoing partnership with a Florida public television station. <br/><br/>Predators can alter prey population dynamics by causing fear-based shifts in prey traits (nonconsumptive effect, NCE). The importance of NCEs for prey populations -relative to direct consumption by predators (consumptive effects, CEs) -remains uncertain, particularly because short-term studies of NCEs cannot estimate their effect over multiple prey generations. This project addresses that knowledge gap by combining short- and long-term field experiments with population models to investigate the importance of NCEs on oyster population dynamics in a Florida estuary. The central question is whether accounting for NCEs improves the ability to predict long-term trends in oyster population abundance. Several types of NCEs are present in this system: exposure to water containing predator odors reduces oyster larval recruitment and causes juvenile oysters to increase shell thickness, reducing their somatic growth. In addition to CEs and NCEs , environmental gradients in stress, food, and propagule delivery are also present in this system. Those environmental factors can have strong effects on post-settlement survivorship, growth, and recruitment of oysters, so the relative importance of predator CEs and NCEs may vary along those spatial gradients as well. This project will consist of four components. (1) A series of short-term field experiments to test how NCEs vary with predator density and environmental variables, and whether one of the NCEs (increased shell thickness) actually reduces vulnerability to predators. (2) A population model, parameterized using experimental results; model simulations will quantify how the relative importance of NCEs should vary over time, space, and environmental gradients. (3) A longer-term (3.5 year) field experiment; the results from this experiment will be compared to model predictions to test whether accounting for NCEs improves predictions of long-term variation in oyster population dynamics. (4) A general form of the model will be developed to broadly investigate the effect of NCEs on non-equilibrium, transient population dynamics. By combining models and field experiments, this project will bridge the gap between the theoretical understanding of how NCEs affect population dynamics and empirical tests of that theory, advancing the field towards the goal of predicting how multiple interacting factors structure communities."

Cyanobacterial blooms occur in freshwater lakes and reservoirs as a result of environmental conditions, resulting in the release of small-molecule cyanotoxins into the water. These toxins pose a serious threat to human health, with exposure resulting in both acute and chronic disease. Cyanotoxin contamination is especially problematic with the accelerated eutrophication of water sources promoted by phosphorus- and nitrogen-fueled cyanobacterial growth, as was observed in the Lake Erie incidence in 2015.<br/><br/>The proposed research and outreach activities build from a firm and successful foundation established by the principal investigator (PI). The PI developed DNA split aptmer technology for cocaine and has demonstrated her group's ability to construct lateral flow sensors using this technology in a sandwich format. The PI will apply this knowledge to create DNA split aptmers for the detection of two cyanotoxins - microcystin and saxitoxin. Algal toxin levels in drinking water are actively monitored in developed nations. However, such monitoring is lacking for much of the global drinking water supply. Toxin exposure frequently results from recreational water use where widespread monitoring is impractical. Among the most prevalent and harmful of these waterborne small-molecule toxins are microcystin-LR and saxitoxin. The proposed research activities explore two novel, and potentially transformative concepts: (1) The use of DNA aptamer-functionalized membranes to selectively remove toxins from drinking water, and (2) The application of DNA split aptamer ligation to construct inexpensive, user-friendly lateral flow sensors. In addition to generating new technologies, this research will provide insight into DNA assembly and DNA-small molecule interactions, and will establish a reliable and efficient method for generating DNA split aptamers. This will lay a foundation for a long-term effort aimed at developing new methods for the detection and removal of small-molecule water contaminants. Additionally, future expansion of the proposed activities could focus on developing a user interface that would enable the general public to report positive test results for waterborne toxins. This would harness the power of crowdsourcing to share information among the public regarding contamination events, and would provide scientists and engineers with data to help them better understand the environmental conditions that give rise to toxic cyanobacterial blooms."

Experimental studies and mechanical models have revealed how certain body shapes maximize swimming and feeding ability of the fish, in response to ecological factors such as predator presence or habitat and food availability, or in response to environment conditions such as water temperature and salinity. However, very little is known about how these ecological and environmental factors interact to explain fish body shape over evolutionary time-scales.  This research will test hypotheses of the ecological, environmental and functional drivers of body form evolution across teleost fishes using a dataset of body shape diversity that will be generated from approximately 7,500 fish species.  The project also will help to digitize the fish collections of several natural history museums making the information collected freely available to the public. Approximately 40 undergraduate students will receive training in fundamental research skills and will work together to design and execute an ambitious group research project based on the data they help to collect. Beyond illuminating the mechanisms by which life diversifies, in particular the process of convergent evolution whereby independent fish lineages have evolved similar body shapes, this study will provide the basis for identifying functional groups of fish, which are used for assessing aquatic ecosystem health.<br/><br/>This research will use a phylogenetic comparative approach to reconstruct the history of ecological shifts and biological innovations and their impact on trends in teleost shape diversity. Body-shape, including regions vital for swimming and prey-capture performance, will be estimated from approximately 20,000 teleost specimens using geometric morphometrics and linear measurements on lateral and dorsal views. The teleost ecomorphospace generated will provide the context for exploring the nature of exceptional adaptive radiations, such as the African rift lake cichlids. Large databases of biological, environmental and ecological and functional traits will be assembled from the scientific literature and museum records. Morphological convergence, novelty, and the ecological, environmental and functional factors associated with them, will be identified using an adaptive landscape approach using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models in a robust phylogenetic framework.

This will be accomplished by combining the data from two high sensitivity and stability Doppler magnetographs deployed to the Antarctic South Pole Station along with the data collected by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager instrument on-board the NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in space. The project will be imaging ""line-of-sight"" solar plasma velocity fields with high spatial resolution at three separate heights in the solar atmosphere. These images will provide the basis for the first detailed characterization of the properties of internal gravity waves as a first step towards developing suitable diagnostic tools for probing the solar atmosphere from the ground. <br/><br/>Solid science, collaborative effort, and the Doppler magnetographs' deployment to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve excellent education and outreach goals.

This study examines at a fundamental level how interactions between the supporting oxide material and the active noble metal can be engineered to control the stability and activity of isolated Rh atoms.  Insights from the work will be used to design catalysts with high selectivity in propylene hydroformylation - an important industrial reaction currently operated under homogeneous liquid-phase catalytic conditions.

Additionally, the research will provide opportunities for a broadly diverse student body at UC Riverside to develop both the analytical and communication skills needed for successful technical careers.<br/><br/>The project focuses on controlling the selectivity, reactivity, and stability of isolated metal atom catalysts by varying the oxide support and by functionalizing the support with organosilane moieties in ways that create electronic and steric structures that replicate those of single-metal-atom homogeneous catalysts.

Fundamental experiments will be carried out using probe molecule spectroscopy, probe reaction kinetics, in-situ spectroscopy and microscopy, and density functional theory calculations.  While the immediate focus will be on propylene hydroformylation, the associated fundamental understanding will benefit society through the design of heterogeneous catalytic processes that are more energy and environmentally friendly than homogeneous processes.

Aging of glassy materials is a long standing problem:  a glass is an out-of-equilibrium material, so its mechanical and electrical properties change over time, but the microscopic reasons for this are still unknown.  Understanding aging has implications for extending the lifetime of products made from glassy materials (both ""regular"" glass and plastics).  This project involves simulations of glassy systems and will employ novel statistical techniques to reconstruct local elastic properties of the material.  We will learn how these properties change during the aging process.  Complementary experiments will be conducted on colloidal glasses, a well-characterized model system which exhibits aging.  Due to the limited amount of data the experiments can obtain - and more fundamentally, the limited data one can obtain before a system ages into a new state - we will need to extend statistical techniques from bioinformatics and econometrics to be able to the relevant information from our data.<br/><br/>The developed statistical techniques will be useful in a variety of applications beyond aging or materials science.  Of equal importance is understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging in glassy systems, which may have a long-term impact on how glassy materials are produced.

However, the highly directional propagation of mmWave signals and the special mmWave hardware requirements introduce fundamental technical challenges for mmWave-based M-MIMO network systems that may require a clean-slate of hardware and software beamforming architectures. In light of these challenges, the goal of this research program is to advance knowledge in both hardware design and theoretical foundations of mmWave and M-MIMO wireless networks. By exploring new hardware-software technologies for mmWave M-MIMO wireless networks, this research program is envisioned to serve a critical need in mmWave communications, signal processing, networking, and control research communities.  In terms of broader impacts, the PIs plan to incorporate findings into graduate courses and develop new special topic courses on the fundamentals of mmWave and M-MIMO communication networks. Engagement of undergrad and high school students is also planned with the aim to provide hands-on experience in RF components, communications, networking, control, and signal processing techniques.<br/><br/>The proposed research address foundational problems in mmWave large antenna arrays and communication networks, with potential breakthroughs in both theory and practice to enable the success of on future multi-Gigabit wireless communications and associated networking applications.

The novelty of this project lies in the joint beam training and scheduling algorithms through the introduction of novel algorithms in the radio-frequency front-end, and in the exploitation of subarray clustering to increase throughput and reduce energy consumption. The PIs' efforts are organized around three interdependent research thrusts: i)  Transceiver and beamforming architectures that offer large agility in frequency tuning and high performance at several metrics, ii) Spectral-efficiency optimization algorithms based on mmWave-based subarray clustering,  and iii) Energy-efficiency scheduling algorithms based on mmWave-based subarray clustering.

A key species in this ecosystem is Antarctic krill, which in addition to being commercially harvested, is the principle prey of a wide range of marine organisms including penguins, seals and whales.  The aim of this study is to use penguins and other krill predators as sensitive indicators of past changes in the Antarctic marine food web resulting from climate variability and the historic harvesting of seals and whales by humans. Specifically this study will recover and analyze modern (<20 year old), historic (20-200 year old) and ancient (200-10,000 year old) penguin and other krill predator tissues to track their past diets and population movements relative to shifts in climate and the availability of Antarctic krill. Understanding how krill predators were affected by these factors in the past will allow us to better understand how these predators, the krill they depend on, and the Antarctic marine ecosystem as a whole will respond to current challenges such as global climate change and an expanding commercial fishery for Antarctic krill.  The project will further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. This project will support the cross-institutional training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced analytical techniques in the fields of ecology and biogeochemistry.  In addition, this project includes educational outreach aimed encouraging participation in science careers by engaging K-12 students in scientific issues related to Antarctica, penguins, marine ecology, biogeochemistry, and global climate change.<br/><br/>This research will help place recent ecological changes in the Southern Ocean into a larger historical context by examining decadal and millennial-scale shifts in the diets and population movements of Antarctic krill predators (penguins, seals, and squid) in concert with climate variability and commercial harvesting.  This will be achieved by coupling advanced stable and radio isotope techniques, particularly compound-specific stable isotope analysis, with unprecedented access to modern, historical, and well-preserved paleo-archives of Antarctic predator tissues dating throughout the Holocene.  This approach will allow the project to empirically test if observed shifts in Antarctic predator bulk tissue stable isotope values over the past millennia were caused by climate-driven shifts at the base of the food web in addition to, or rather than, shifts in predator diets due to a competitive release following the historic harvesting of krill eating whale and seals. In addition, this project will track the large-scale abandonment and reoccupation of penguin colonies around Antarctica in response to changes in climate and sea ice conditions over the past several millennia. These integrated field studies and laboratory analyses will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that influenced past shifts in the diets and population movements of charismatic krill predators such as penguins. This will allow for improved projections of the ecosystem consequences of future climate change and anthropogenic harvesting scenarios in the Antarctica that are likely to affect the availability of Antarctic krill."

Spatial visualization skills have been linked to success in engineering and mathematics as well as to creativity and technical innovation. Unfortunately, of all of the cognitive processes identified through previous research, spatial skills exhibit the most robust gender differences, favoring males. Improving spatial skills has been shown to be effective in improving the success of engineering students, particularly women.<br/><br/>This project is conducting a large-scale study involving undergraduate engineering students in order to answer research questions regarding the role that spatial visualization plays in solving two types of engineering problems. Convergent problems are typically those that have a unique solution that is based on prior theories. Divergent problems have multiple possible solutions. Since engineers are asked to solve both types of problems, it is important to know how spatial visualization skills impact how students attempt to solve these problems and the solutions that are ultimately obtained. The project is employing a mixed methods approach that includes electroencephalograms (EEGs) as a brain imaging technique to answer questions about the links between spatial visualization and engineering problem solving.  The results from this research will close a gap in what is currently known about brain function, spatial visualization and engineering problem solving. The results could be used to improve the success of students in undergraduate engineering degree programs and to ensure the full participation of women in the engineering workforce.

In addition, these enzymes offer an opportunity to replace harsh chemical cleaning agents with biocompatible, safe and green alternatives.<br/><br/>This project will result in afamily of cleaning products formulated for a wide range of uses in cleaning of produce and other packaged foods. The uniqueness of the enzyme-based cleaning products are (1) ability to engineer specificity and target a broad range of microbial biofilms, (2) ability to select enzymes that retain activity under actual cleaning conditions, (3) ability to discriminate between pathogen and non-pathogen microbial biofilms, (4) demonstrated methods for high-yield production and (5) providing a safe, biocompatible alternative to current chemical cleaning agents. Collectively these features provide a new, green and targeted alternative to current industry standard chemical disinfectants such as peracetic acid in this market space. <br/><br/>This project addresses key gaps in knowledge required to translate this technology to the marketplace. Chemical disinfectants and mechanical disruption often have limited efficacy against microbial biofilms, allowing potential pathogens to persist in processing environments despite cleaning and cause foodborne illness. Furthemore, biofilm chemical structure is often complex and heterogeneous due to the presence of multiple microbes present within a biofilm community. This technology addresses both of these gaps by engineering enzymes that can degrade chemically heterogeneous biofilms, and can act synergistically with other cleaning methods or alone to enhance removal of microbial pathogens present during food processing. In particular, the project utilizes some leading industry partners such as Highland Fresh Technologies who will assist in designing and simulating actual process conditions under which application testing can be performed to determine amount per use and method of application. Also, production costs during scale-up will be calculated to identify critical costs associated with the final product. Additionally, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students working on this project will receivetechnology translation expertise, working to answer critical questions necessary to identify production costs, business plan development as well as direct exposure to key industry partners to design and execute key testing of products."

Such sensor selection problems are very challenging for large-scale networks, as they are combinatorial in nature and intractable in general. The goal of this project is to design a comprehensive sparse learning based methodology, which converts challenging combinatorial sensor selection problems to sparsity-encouraged convex optimization problems that can be solved efficiently. The research agenda will include development of sparse learning approaches in view of sensor collaboration structures, design of incentive-based mechanisms to fulfill sensing demands as well as individual sensors profits, and design of dynamic management policies that adapt to time-varying environments and incentives of sensors. Success of this project will greatly advance sensor management designs and potentially significantly improve efficiency of practical mobile phone sensing systems. This project will offer hands-on training opportunities to students from diverse backgrounds."

Record linkage is a perennial and challenging problem across the social sciences, with important applications in areas such as demography, economics, public health, and official statistics.  Plummeting costs of new forms of data collection and storage and the proliferation of ""big data"" have increased the need for merging such databases as researchers and statistical agencies struggle to integrate carefully curated datasets with messy and incomplete data from historical, administrative, and commercial sources.  The methods developed in this project will facilitate the successful integration of different data sources, thus generating new resources for future research.  These combined data sources may also provide some alternatives to expensive survey data collection in an era of declining response rates.  Freely available software will be developed and stored in a public repository.<br/><br/>The increasing desire to deploy probabilistic record linkage has spurred significant research into various components of the process, such as how to compare records, how to reduce the number of record comparisons to keep the problem computationally feasible, how to quantify the weight of evidence for or against a link between records, and how to ultimately generate a merged database.  Often these components are studied in isolation from each other and from the ultimate goal of making inferences using the merged files.  This research project will take a more holistic view of the record linkage process in order to advance the state of the art.  The project has two primary goals. The first goal is to develop new models for record linkage that incorporate the impact of preprocessing methods that reduce the total number of record pairs to be evaluated.  While widely deployed and well motivated, these methods have effects on subsequent modeling that are not well understood.  The second goal is to enhance understanding of uncertainty and error throughout the process and to develop imputation methods for propagating error due to uncertain record links and other missing data, such as item nonresponse in a survey. These methods will be designed with an eye toward large applications that require new computational approaches.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology."

Through this CAREER Award, Martinez Outschoorn and her UIUC research team will address such issues both analytically and technically in the ATLAS Experiment.   <br/><br/>The UIUC group is developing and implementing new analytical tools to search for Higgs bosons decaying into pairs of hypothetical new spin-zero particles, which subsequently decay into known particles such as b-quarks, electrons and muons that can be observed directly in the ATLAS detector.

Additionally, these events are expected to be very rare, and to find them requires high intensity colliding beams at the LHC over several years.  To enhance the technical capabilities of the ATLAS detector to observe these particles, the UIUC group is collaborating with ATLAS colleagues in the development of new electronics upgrades to the experiment, to allow for the effective triggering and recording of these particles.   <br/><br/>Martinez Outschoorn brings significant experience in outreach and education to her companion program called the ""Particle Adventure"", which will connect elementary and middle school students in grades 4-8, including children from underrepresented and at-risk groups, to the excitement of physics with the aid of undergraduate and graduate student volunteers from the UIUC Physics Department.

This project will investigate the integration of CT with mathematics and science with the goal of informing the development of new resources that provide preschool children with rich learning experiences that promote critical thinking and problem solving skills crucial for later school success. Project activities will include: 1) the development of research-based learning blueprints that delineate learning goals that integrate CT with mathematics and science; 2) the design and iterative testing of complementary hands-on and digital activities that address these learning goals, capture young children's interest, and also yield learning; and 3) the identification of design principles that guide the design of activity formats that can be used by educators and caregivers at school and at home. <br/><br/>The multidisciplinary project team will develop learning blueprints to serve as anchor documents, guiding the design of activities and research instrumentation. Furthermore, the team will engage in Design-Based Research and use a co-design approach in which multiple stakeholder, including preschool teachers, parents, children, and advisors, are directly and actively involved in the development and iterative pilot testing of digital and hands-on activities. This will ensure that design decisions link home and school learning, take into account the interests of young children, and address the needs and strengths of preschool programs and culturally diverse families. Researchers will conduct observations and interviews and make assessments of children's learning using evidence centered design learning tasks developed as part of this study and conduct mixed method analyses. The results of this investigation could inform future research and practice seeking to integrate CT with early childhood science and mathematics. Likewise, the co-design process used here could inform other efforts that seek to include diverse stakeholders in design based research."

Yet, this ideal has failed to gain widespread practical traction, challenged, in part, by the lack of developed methodologies and also because of privacy's conceptual complexity, which hampers its operationalization. This project addresses both challenges simultaneously, seeking (i) to demonstrate how a robust operationalization of privacy can lead to meaningful PbD and (ii) to contribute methodological insight by engaging with ongoing research and development in the area of small data applications, namely, systems that advance wellness and personal productivity by utilizing digital traces from individuals' day-to-day activities, such as e-mail, grocery shopping, TV watching, transportation, mobile devices, and so forth. Adopting the definition of privacy as contextual integrity, the project will focus on selected small-data applications currently ""on the drawing board"" in PI Deborah Estrin's Small Data lab. With these design cases, the project rises to one of the PbD challenges, namely consideration of privacy early on in development and, as a research enterprise, its primary aim is to uncover more and less productive methodological approaches for doing so, resulting in system characteristics well correlated with privacy requirements. <br/><br/>At the same time, the project will provide invaluable insight into how to operationalize contextual integrity, which conceives of privacy as appropriate flow of personal information, modeling appropriate flow as conformance with context-specific informational norms, which, prescribe (and prohibit) information flows according to three parameters: actors (subject, sender, recipient), information types, and transmission principles (functional constraints on flow). Adopting contextual integrity as an operational definition means that researchers will assess privacy properties by carefully mapping data flows, and evaluating these flows in terms of the context of application and use. The project also extends past work on formal representations of informational norms by demonstrating how they may be integrated into design practices.  In addition to its substantive contributions this project embodies an innovative collaborative model -- a novel pairing of a computer scientist, Deborah Estrin (Cornell), with a philosopher, Helen Nissenbaum (NYU), in an equal partnership to forge technologies that embody meaningful privacy."

The proposed method for designing antibodies is inspired by the natural hydrogen bonding interactions between beta-strands within folded proteins. This approach is based on mining the Protein Data Bank for small peptides (3-6mers) within beta-strands that are naturally paired to segments of the target epitope in neighboring beta-strands. By identifying multiple small peptides that are complementary to the target epitope and which overlap with each other, larger complementary peptides will be generated. These peptides will be evaluated for their ability to mediate antibody binding to the target epitope when grafted into the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibody fragments. Moreover, molecular modeling and directed evolution methods will be used to identify mutations in the grafted complementary peptides and neighboring CDRs that further increase binding affinity. Finally, solubilizing mutations in and near the CDRs will be introduced to overcome the hydrophobic nature of the grafted peptides.<br/><br/>This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the GOALI Program of the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships and by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It happens to be useful and natural to make ""time"" itself more abstract and replace it with any other discrete system of symmetries, say of some object (such symmetries form what is a called a discrete group). In the case of a very chaotic physical system, one cannot effectively predict its future state. This fact gives rise to an important quantity, the entropy of the system, that measures how unpredictable it is. Entropy was originally defined directly within an information theoretic context, but it turns out that, if one views it instead from the perspective of a statistical mechanics formalism, the scope of entropy theory is increased to encompass a very large class of groups known as ""sofic groups."" Seen through this new lens, entropy becomes a measurement of how many finitary approximations the physical system has. The general question of how well an infinitary process can be approximated by a finitary one is a fundamental question of scientific inquiry, and the class of sofic groups includes many natural examples coming from geometry and number theory. This project also sheds light on the connection to physics that is inherent in its statistical mechanical and information theoretic origins. Moreover, the subject has proven to have interesting links to diverse areas of mathematics, including the following: functional analysis, ergodic theory, combinatorics, and operator algebras. Many of the links are direct consequences of the principal investigator's research.  The project is part of ongoing activity to strengthen and understand such connections.<br/><br/>This project revolves around three main problems. The first is to understand the orbit equivalence consequences of positive or complete positive entropy for actions of nonamenable groups. For example, the principal investigator has shown that actions with complete positive entropy are strongly ergodic and that positive entropy actions are not weakly compact. He seeks to prove that actions with compete positive entropy are solidly ergodic, as defined by Chifan and Ioana, which will give further indication of the Bernoulli-like behavior that these actions exhibit. Part of the interest in this objective is that it places the theory of entropy for actions of nonamenable groups in stark contrast to the study of entropy for actions of amenable groups, where it is impossible to derive any orbit equivalence consequences of entropy. These consequences of complete positive entropy apply to algebraic actions (i.e., actions on compact groups by automorphisms), for the principal investigator can already demonstrate that algebraic actions related to invertible convolution operators have complete positive entropy. A second problem is concerned with investigating the entropy theory of algebraic actions of equivalence relations, which is joint work with Lewis Bowen and Dylan Airey. One aim of this part of the project is to generalize the principal investigator's results on entropy and Fuglede-Kadison determinants from the group case to the equivalence relation case. Lastly, the principal investigator will further the connections between dynamics and operator algebras by defining sofic entropy for actions on operator algebras."

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research that will provide this missing knowledge.  Specifically, it will develop of a novel design framework with tools for system modeling, analysis and design that can be used to concurrently realize resiliency and enhance sustainability in system designs while considering system retrofits. Results from this research will likely stimulate growth in several technologically advanced industries such as the green energy, aviation, or automotive industries, which suffer from catastrophic failures and high maintenance costs at the post system design stage.  By providing new design methods and tools for failure resilient realization and sustainability enhancement, the total lifetime cost of ownership of such systems can likely be reduced significantly. This research offers unique opportunities for researchers across the fields of engineering design, failure prognosis and sustainability, and will train students in an interdisciplinary learning environment. Educational initiatives with a wide range of dissemination and outreach programs will attract students, especially underrepresented groups, to engineering careers. <br/><br/>This research pioneers a new design paradigm for resiliency and sustainability by integrating design of system functions, failure prognosis, and system retrofits in a unified design framework. Such an effort has been neglected in the past because quantitative analysis methods for failure prognosis and system retrofits were only applicable in the use-phase of a system and were not suited for early-stage design. This research encompasses four thrusts: 1) resiliency and sustainability quantification with retrofits, 2) predictive resiliency and sustainability analysis, 3) concurrent design for resiliency and sustainability, and 4) design validation through collaborations with three leading industry partners. The fundamental research will be rooted in a new theory for resilience and will specifically address the challenge of post-design retrofits in engineering system design. This research will be the first attempt to adapt the concept of resilience and integrate it into system design while simultaneously considering environmental sustainability. The research outcome will open up a new avenue for research to exploit innovative methodologies leading to design of resilient and sustainable engineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An attacker in the untrusted foundry has access only to an incomplete design, and therefore cannot easily pirate or insert Trojans into it.

The project will address national and local conversations by providing a living example of how to bring together a cohort of schools, informal learning providers, and academics to create and implement an intro to computational making middle school strategy. This strategy will blend together learning activities designed to develop core computational making skills, with content-focused projects (e.g. math, science, social studies, literacy and art), and community showcases designed to support and grow student and family understanding and engagement in the diversity of ways to use computer science and computational thinking to create, develop, and control interactive artifacts that have meaning in everyday life.<br/><br/>The Bronzeville Fusion Network RPP team will work to address two shared questions: (1) How can we foster a community learning environment, anchored within schools, that recognizes, supports, and promotes computational literacies as a desirable and accessible form of social capital by educators, youth, and families? (2) How do these community level connections impact youth CS/CT learning opportunities, participation, social networks, knowledge, and understanding? To address these questions the RPP team will leverage existing quality CS/CT resources (e.g. tools, programs, curriculum, especially those that are free and research-based), existing local infrastructure and policies (e.g. online learning platforms, professional development models), and programmable interactive electronics (e.g. sensors, arduinos, makey makey) to create culturally meaningful computational making learning opportunities that connect middle school learners to quality opportunities in ways that work and that are sustainable. To accomplish this goal, the project will systematically engage in hyperlocal work in Bronzeville, a Chicago community on the southside of Chicago, representing approximately 119,000 residents. The project will work with schools, educators and leaders from local community organizations to collaboratively explore, curate, and organize existing national CS/CT learning resources into culturally meaningful blended learning activities and modules intentionally designed to engage Bronzeville youth in exploring and discovering the essential role of CS/CT literacies in making the interactive objects students use daily. We will also use a networked strategy in Bronzeville, capitalizing on a citywide online learning platform that brings together face-to-face and online learning resources to support students, families, and teachers in finding and participating in formal and informal activities designed to increase student engagement in academics and enrichment activities, allowing youth to develop portfolios of work and participation and to see and comment on the interactive artifacts created by peers. While this work will focus within the Bronzeville community, all of the curricular and learning resources developed through this RPP will be deployed at a broader city level through this online platform."

Specifically, the research team will examine if and how Ecocon, a computer-based tool, can improve students' problem-solving and collaborative learning skills leading to the design of more sustainable and better performing buildings.  Students enrolled in architecture, civil/construction engineering, and mechanical engineering courses will engage in four four-week units, and after each, will complete a collaborative assignment in interdisciplinary teams.  As there is little known about how people learn and collaborate using the integration of new technologies and AR, addressing the research questions of this project will potentially contribute significantly to advancing the design of learning environments using new and emerging media. The broader education of engineers and architects emphasizing collaboration, leadership, and communication skills will also potentially lead to increased innovation, enhanced sustainability, and reduced cost of training once they enter the work force.  Florida International University has a proven history of providing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education for underrepresented minorities that comprise 80% of the student population. Therefore, activities deployed in this project including K-12 student involvement, seminars, presentations, and developed courses will impact diverse student populations and serve as a foundation for a diverse high quality building and construction workforce in the future.<br/><br/>The investigators will use a design-based research approach to discover: (1) How does engaging with Ecocon impact students' problem-solving skills and collaborative learning interactions? (2) How does interaction with the project change students' understanding of building science principles in their respective disciplines? (3) Does use of Ecocon enhance the ability of students to successfully transfer the principles they have learned to new situations? (4)   What is the impact of the use and the project approach on student motivation for further collaborative learning?  A design-based methodology was selected because the pedagogical experiments will be set in real-world learning environments where there are many variables that cannot be controlled, and this approach will allow the researchers to try to optimize as much of the design as possible and to observe carefully how the different elements are working.  Assessment and evaluation will be conducted using mixed methods, including, but not limited to cognitive assessments such as pre- and post-tests and technical reports, and affective assessments such as pre-and post-attitude surveys and exit interviews.  Project outcomes and techniques will provide guidelines to create similar multi-disciplinary learning tools for other STEM fields.  All project methods and tools will be easily accessible on a dedicated open source website to allow other institutions to replicate and/or modify the learning experience for their own circumstances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In each city studied, project researchers will examine the operation and use of science in four arenas of governance: environment, health, transportation and education. They will explore how these different arenas interrelate, and they will map the sources of scientific evidence used in governance, how these sources are evaluated, and translated into policy and programming. They will also document and analyze the scientific infrastructures that produced the findings used in governance, the diversity of stakeholders involved in interpreting scientific findings, and diverse cultural logics that shape the creation and use of scientific knowledge in different settings. Ethnographic interviews will be the primary means of data collection, supplemented by analyses of scientific publications, policy debates, and media coverage. The final stage of the project will result in recommendations that will be actively disseminated among policy makers, journalists and other stakeholders in all cities and countries studied in the project. Project results will also be translated into curriculum for K-undergraduate students, using the techniques and infrastructure developed by RPI's EcoEd Research Group.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>This project is an innovative extension of an ongoing project, The Asthma Files project. The digital platform built for the ongoing project will support collaboration among researchers (including student researchers) involved in the new project. In addition, there will be in each city a field school to teach the project's methods to students. The aim of the project is to advance understanding of different ways scientific capacity is developed and used in governance, examining how environmental health research and governance has developed. The project will result in a theoretically robust, empirically grounded conception of environmental health research and governance styles, detailing and categorizing different ways of developing environmental health data, advancing the sciences of environment and health, and directing these toward governance of complex problems. It will extend theorization of governance by addressing how scientific cultures, practices, and infrastructure shape governance processes and outcomes; and it will test and stabilize the process and cyberinfrastructure needed to support collaborative research in the social studies of science. Project results will have wide implications in efforts to improve collaboration between governance regimes (across scale, and between nations); such collaboration is particularly important in addressing complex, often trans-boundary problems like air pollution, which call for new levels of cooperation and sharing of technology, data, and effective policy design."

In many domains, such as vaccination, resource conservation, or blood donation, the outcome that is optimal for the group cannot be achieved unless individuals act beyond their narrow self-interest.  The current research harnesses the principle of signaling to develop and test interventions that may inspire pro-social behavior by appealing to agents' desire to appear prosocial.  Whereas some people may be motivated to contribute to the public good simply by altruistic concerns for others, even absent those purely altruistic motives, nearly everyone likes to be viewed by others as a prosocial person or to think of themselves as prosocial.  In economic terms, this idea is captured by the concept of signaling -- engaging in a behavior that signals the type of person one is. Thus, a self-interested reason to engage in pro-social behavior is to signal (to oneself or to others) that one is a good person.   Five sets of experiments in the current project test the idea that prosocial behavior can be increased if people are given the opportunity to use that behavior to signal their prosocial nature.  <br/><br/>In the proposed research the investigators test the effects of interventions designed based on signaling theory for their influence on prosocial behavior in a series of field and lab experiments. First, a field study in the context of a blood drive tests whether monetary incentives motivate blood donation more effectively when framed in a way that signals the pro-social motives of the decision maker to perform the behavior. Second, a study on framing messages to emphasize the signal value of vaccination examines whether parents of young children are more likely to receive an influenza vaccination for themselves after viewing a message presenting vaccination as a signal that one puts their children first than after seeing a message presenting vaccination as a signal that one puts self-care first, or after seeing either of two control messages. Third, in a study on peer recommendation, researchers will test whether a message advocating blood donation is more effective if it emphasizes the signal value of this behavior, and whether this signaling effect is more pronounced when the message comes in the form of a personalized recommendation from a co-worker as compared to a standard message from a blood drive. Fourth, three studies on social comparison will investigate whether feedback comparing one's performance to that of others promotes performance improvement in a pro-social task because the social comparison feedback serves as a signal, indicating what the performance says about the agent. Fifth, in a series of studies using a common pool resource game, researchers will explore the effect of a partitioning manipulation that signals the equitable amount for each agent to consume into order to achieve the group optimal outcome, and they will test whether the partition serves as a coordination signal. This research extends previous work in economics, social psychology, and decision research, and it applies signaling theory to the design of interventions to facilitate pro-social behavior. The body of research combines powerful field experiments with tightly controlled laboratory experimental designs to test the efficacy of signaling interventions by assessing actual behavior and examining the decision processes underlying these effects. The findings will simultaneously shed light on the nature of both pro-social behavior and signaling mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The drug praziquantel (or PZQ) has a surprising effect on the regenerating worm; it results in a two-headed animal. The goal of this project is to understand how, in this organism, stem cells can be re-programmed to regenerate a head rather than a tail. This project will generate for the community both scientific resources (for example databases of DNA and protein sequences) and educational resources, including kits that can be used by both schools and universities as aids to teaching stem cell biology. The researchers will organize courses for high school teachers, and provide interdisciplinary research opportunities in stem cell biology and bioinformatics for both graduate students and undergraduates.<br/><br/>The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that in the regenerating planarian Dugesia japonica the drug praziquantel (PZQ) activates a neuronal Ca2+ channel (Cav1A) to alter neurotransmitter levels within the excitable cell niche and thereby miscue stem cell differentiation. Two opposing neurotransmitter pathways are proposed that control head versus tail polarity by differentially impacting muscle biology where known planarian polarity cues (e.g. Wnts) reside.

Construction and infrastructure projects consist of interconnected networks of people, equipment, and materials. Most often, finding optimal work strategies, and making timely operational decisions that lead to maximum productivity while minimizing project completion cost and time is not trivial. Unlike manufacturing and industrial systems, construction projects involve dynamic (constantly evolving) layouts, complex resource interactions, uncertainties in workflows and processes, and unforeseen conditions that can result in deviations from plans and unwanted delays. Figures show that only 30 percent of construction projects finish on time and within budget. Therefore, the accuracy and timeliness of operational-level decision-making in construction projects is of utmost importance. This award supports fundamental research to enhance construction decision-making accuracy by reducing uncertainties through the seamless integration of process-level data into decision-making. This will be achieved by building the theoretical foundation and significantly advancing the current state of construction simulation modeling through enabling real-time interaction with a simulation model as the real project evolves, and communicating the simulation output through a feedback loop to steer the events in the real project. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and the society since it leads to better decision-making which results in reducing waste, rework, cost, time, and ensures safety. The multi-disciplinary nature of this project will help broaden participation of underrepresented and diverse student groups in integrated research and pedagogical activities, and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The knowledge-based simulation modeling framework in this project enables process-level models to autonomously learn from and adapt to ever-changing and evolving construction systems. Process-level knowledge that serves as the input of such simulation models is obtained from ubiquitous sensory data that describe relationships, interactions, and uncertainty attributes of field processes, and enable the generation and maintenance of more accurate simulation models. In doing so, some scientific barriers are yet to be overcome to realize the full accreditation and application of this framework. The research team will design and test methods that draw from data mining, machine learning, forecasting, and control to fill the existing knowledge gaps in capturing and mining complex data and meta-data from equipment and human crew interactions. The resulting process-level knowledge will be rich enough to describe, model, analyze, and project the uncertainties of construction systems at any point in time and consequently help adjust resource allocations and operational scenarios on the job site."

Therefore, a broader scope of understanding is needed to synthesize and use metal oxides for detecting a specific chemical at trace concentrations with no interference from other compounds in a complex mixture.  Within this project, the structure (rather than the composition) of an oxide is being correlated to its ability to detect a specific vapor of interest, whether it is a disease marker in breath or a harmful pollutant in the environment. The experiments being undertaken include novel synthesis of ceramic phases at the nanoscale, and atomic level characterization of gas-oxide interactions. Fundamental knowledge about how to produce tailored ceramic nanostructures with high specificity to the chemical vapors of interest is sought. This project is training scientists to use advanced materials processing and characterization techniques, and is educating the public at large about the benefits of ceramics research to human health and welfare. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: While semiconducting metal oxides have been used as resistive gas sensors commercially since 1968, the nature of gas-oxide interactions still remains unknown. These inherently polymorphic ceramics exist in various distinct crystallographic configurations, each behaving as a different material with respect to it?s physical and chemical properties, even though they all have the exact same composition. Nanoscale processing of ceramics has made available a ""toolbox"" of ""metastable phases"" at room temperature in high quantities. Sensing elements based on nanostructured binary metal oxides of controlled stoichiometry and phase distribution need to be studied in order to elucidate how gas selectivity is achieved. The underlying hypothesis is that phase distribution, rather than oxide composition, determines the gas sensing properties. Therefore, this study is synthesizing such controlled nanostructures, single crystal nanowires and nanopowders of both stable and metastable phases for common oxides used in sensing (MoO3, WO3, TiO2) by means of blend electrospinning, soft chemistry routes, and a rapid solidification process; and then carrying out detailed characterization studies on gas-oxide interactions, including in situ gas sensing experiments in an electron microscope. The physico-chemical changes occurring on the oxide surfaces in contact with a given gas (e.g., oxidation, reduction, ferroelectric poling) will be assessed for a selected group of oxide crystals (rutile, perovskite, etc.) and a respective set of classes of chemicals (such as amines and alkanes). The expected outcome from this project is a gas-oxide polymorph selection library for building the next generation of gas-sensing systems with inherent selectivity, to be used in health monitoring as non-invasive diagnostics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such force sensing, monitoring, and mapping are of great interest in smart system-driven healthcare, robotics and military applications. A variety of electronic and optical tactile sensors have been developed to approach the desirable tactile sensing imager with high spatial resolution and great flexibility. However, the major drawback of the state-of-the-art tactile sensors is low spatial resolutions due to their fundamental limitations on the sensor pixel size on the order of sub-centimeter/millimeter. In this work, the investigators will leverage recent advances in quantum-inspired photonics to develop a high spatial resolution tactile sensing system with highly scalable sensor pixels that can monitor strain response at a microscale. Its integration with smart phones can create a compact and portable tactile sensor platform overcoming barriers in low spatial resolution, high cost, and high instrumental complexity of the state-of-the-art tactile sensors. This research is closely integrated with the existing educational activities, providing both undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge science and technology in an innovative way. The investigators also provide educational outreach activities to promote the interests and participations of K-12 students and broaden the participations from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>The primary focus of this research project is to develop novel planar optical systems with optical exceptional points and arrange them on a flexible plastic platform in a chessboard configuration for high spatial resolution tactile sensing and imaging. The optical exceptional point structures, due to their planar nature, can support highly scalable fabrication using the widely used photolithography technique with spatial resolution down to even the microscale in a large area. Based upon a flexible plastic platform, this microscale tactile sensing imager can not only perform high-throughput real-time microscopic strain detection, but also enable simultaneous strain and temperature measurement with a microscopic resolution. The tactile sensor platform can be further integrated with portable electronic devices (e.g. hand-held smart phones), which would create a compact and portable tactile sensor imager platform for real-time detection in microbiology and healthcare, for example, the detection of mechanical properties of biomolecules. The principal investigators have highly complementary expertise in optics theory, advanced micro/nanofabrication technology, and device integration to design and fabricate the unique portable high spatial resolution tactile sensing platform based on novel optical exceptional point structures. The realized tactile sensing systems are expected to represent an important technological breakthrough in strain sensing, mapping and monitoring at a microscale with sensitivities orders of magnitude better than the state-of-the-art tactile sensors."

The objective of the proposed research is to test this hypothesis and to delineate the underlying mechanism of nanotopographical memory effects. Three research objectives using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) as model cells are proposed to study the nanotopographical memory effects: (1) Regulate Yes-associated protein (YAP) intracellular localization by using nanotopography, (2) Validate nanotopographical memory effects, and (3) Delineate the underlying mechanism of nanotopographical memory effects. This research will advance the understanding of cellular mechanotransduction and stem cell plasticity during developmental and pathological processes.

The study will identify patterns of successes and failures of Hispanic STEM transfer students and identify factors related to effectiveness of interventions to promote transfer, retention, and graduation of Hispanic STEM undergraduates. This synthesis will contribute to achieving PCAST recommendations for a million more STEM graduates by 2018, supporting efforts within federal agencies to improve the success of under-represented students in STEM, and increasing knowledge about what works based on a comprehensive synthesis of published research.    <br/><br/>The research question guiding this systematic review is: What student and contextual characteristics and interventions have prior studies identified as supporting successful transfer and STEM bachelor's degree completion of Hispanic students who matriculate at two-year institutions?  A preliminary scoping review of several databases yielded 1,328 potential sources to inform this systematic review to develop a framework specific to Hispanic STEM transfer students.  Most retention and transfer work has been based on a framework of social integration. A good example of this framework is: Vincent Tinto, ""Leaving college: Rethinking the causes and cures of student attrition,"" Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993.  This perspective has been found by some to be less relevant to Hispanic students.  An example is the work of Tatiana Melguizo, ""Are community colleges an alternative path for Hispanic students to attain a bachelor's degree?"" Teachers College Record, Volume 110, No. 12, 2008."

This is due to intrinsic hardware latencies from mechanical rotors or electronic phase shifters, or excessive computation time from digital signal processing.  These limitations can fundamentally be overcome by transforming imaging concepts from optics into microwaves, enabling a microwave panoramic camera (MPC). The knowledge and understanding of such integration will lead to a novel category of radars and imaging sensors that can be used for a wide range of sensing applications. The proposed MPC will be applied, in particular, to automotive radar to provide driver assistance, making driving safer and more convenient.  The fast sensing speed and panoramic FOV enabled by MPC-based radars will provide early warning of potential collisions to drivers. Furthermore, the ultrafast frame rate of MPCs will allow differentiation of objects by detecting their Doppler signatures.  With a panoramic FOV, MPCs can also be used in autonomous driving systems requiring constant monitoring of road situations.  The educational component of the proposed work will integrate advanced automotive technologies into undergraduate education by engaging community college students in the Metro Detroit area.   It will be conducted through the University Bound Program, a State of Michigan King-Chavez-Parks (KCP) Initiative.  Community college students, especially those from underrepresented groups, will be encouraged to participate in research activities in antenna and microwave engineering essential for today's automotive radar imaging sensors and telematics. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to transform spectrally encoded confocal microscopy, a fiber-based optical imaging method for high-speed scanning, into the microwave and millimeter-wave regime. This integration will enable the proposed microwave panoramic camera with ultrafast scanning speed and a panoramic field of view. The technical approach relies on the creation of transmission-line based microwave metamaterials, also known as composite right/left-handed transmission lines. By tailoring microwave metamaterials to form a frequency scanned array, a two-dimensional frequency-to-space mapping mechanism can be realized.  Utilizing the two-dimensional angular mapping scheme along with the range information obtained from the reflected signal will result in an image of the scene in three dimensions.  This research will demonstrate the capability to capture a three-dimensional microwave image with 180-degree FOV in both azimuth and elevation, with a frame-rate speed of 1 MHz.  The fast frame refresh rate will allow any Doppler and micro-Doppler effects of moving objects to be captured and exploited for target recognition and identification. Furthermore, by engineering the dispersion characteristics of microwave metamaterials, the proposed MPC can be designed to work in multiple bands, making it feasible to perform dual-band operations for radar systems, such as 24 GHz and 77 GHz automotive radar sensors."

But these benefits come at the expense of security: An attack anywhere along the supply chain can insert malicious components into an integrated circuit, pirate its design or counterfeit it. These attacks, which are exceedingly difficult to detect, jeopardize the computer industry, undermine national security, and put critical infrastructure in danger. More than a decade of research in hardware security has resulted in a plethora of solutions for these problems, but many of these solutions address specific attack models and, hence, are not universally applicable. This project breaks this barrier by developing hardware design approaches that are both provably secure and applicable across the entire hardware industry for differing businesses and threat models. To engage and teach the next generation of cybersecurity experts, the project uses puzzle-, challenge-, and competition-based educational and outreach activities at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.<br/> <br/>The project has three components. First, the research develops a secure synthesis approach to prevent piracy and reverse engineering using provably-secure camouflaging and logic encryption,  where the attacker is provided with only partial knowledge of the design to obfuscate the design intent. Second, the research analyzes the security implications of untrusted test facilities by demonstrating an attack to compromise secrets through test data. It develops a provably-secure test pattern generation technique for testing chips with secrets. Third, this project designs chips such that any (malicious) alterations and counterfeits are provably-detected by existing techniques."

This research seeks a set of best practices or guidelines that can be used by community members to facilitate increased civic engagement in the Internet context, and the participatory design activities will produce situated tools for specific civic activities within each of the three communities to be studied. By focusing on rural contexts, this study will also contribute to our understanding of how an understudied population uses information and communication for social purposes.  Both women, who outnumber men among rural social media users, and rural residents generally are underrepresented in current studies of social media. <br/><br/>The participatory design components of the project will help design useful tools for increasing civic engagement and will contribute to a critical discourse on design methods. This effort builds on current research in the development of social capital through social media, technology and social change to produce a model of the relationship between social media and civic engagement that provides more nuanced understanding of how social media facilitates collaborative endeavors. This model will explain how users decide which social media to use, under what conditions, for what purposes, and how their use impacts collective civic endeavors.

Professor Seidel is a member of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  This project aims to advance the field of asymmetric catalysis on a fundamental level through exploration of conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of substrate activation. Asymmetric catalysis is the development of small molecules that can achieve high selectivity in chemical reactions - producing a specific product in high prurity. Chiral molecules have a right-handed and left-handed version.  These two mirror image molecules are described as enantiomers. A major goal of this resesarch is the development of reactions that produce enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral ion pairs.  Novel Brnsted acids and hydrogen bond donor catalysts are used to facilitate unprecedented enantioselective processes and address challenging problems. Multifunctional catalysts are being used as a means to achieve enzyme-like catalysis under mild reaction conditions.  The research provides an excellent training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and preparing them for future careers in industry or academia. There is a strong commitment to engage a diverse group of students carrying out this research. <br/><br/>The ability to prepare complex chiral molecules in the most cost-effective way possible is directly dependent on the availability of sustainable synthetic methodologies.  The new synthetic methods that are emerging from this work provide enhanced access to biologically significant, chiral nitrogen containing compounds such as amines, amides, lactams, amino acids and indole containing substances that, in turn, help advance the chemical industry.  Furthermore, this project provides an ideal training ground to prepare the next generation of researchers in the chemical sciences. Students working on this project gain expertise in modern synthetic methods and laboratory techniques while being exposed to an intellectually stimulating and challenging environment that will prepare them for future careers."

One of the important unanswered questions in astronomy is how these galaxies formed and how they change in time.  Our current understanding of structure in the universe suggests that a large galaxy like the Milky Way should actually host a larger number of dwarf satellites than we observe.  To examine whether this is universal or merely a property of our local group, this program will conduct a detailed census of the regions surrounding two of our nearest galactic neighbors.  They will survey two types of galaxy -  spiral, like the Milky Way, and a large elliptical galaxy - and then measure the basic properties of these newly discovered systems. This involves a collaborative effort between three institutions and will use some of the largest and best ground-based telescopes.  All three PIs are active in education and public outreach. PI Sand's institution, Texas Tech University, has a new astrophysics research group and undergraduate concentration.  The science in this proposal will help establish TTU's astrophysics program and reach out to the larger Lubbock community.  In particular, two undergraduate astrophysics students will spend summers in California doing research for the program, allowing them to interact with the larger astrophysics community. PI Guhathakurta is very actively involved with several programs that provide mentoring and research experiences for high-school students.  <br/><br/>The three PIs, along with a postdoctoral researcher and students, will address the observed lack of faint dwarf galaxies associated with the Milky Way and M31 (compared Lambda-CDM  predictions for small-scale structure formation).  Using the Magellan and Keck telescopes, they will conduct a panoramic imaging study to measure the stellar stream and dwarf galaxy content in NGC 253, a Milky Way-like spiral in a filamentary environment, and NGC 5128, a massive central elliptical galaxy.  They will also use Keck+Diemos and newly-developed coaddition techniques to obtain spectra of tidal streams and dwarf galaxies.  If successful, this would enable kinematic and metallicity studies for the first time outside the local group."

Traditional solutions reduce the cloud access latency by deploying servers at the network edge, but ignore the impact of mobile users' workload patterns on the efficiency of cloud operation. Instead, this project aims to design the edge cloud as a tree hierarchy of geo-distributed servers, so as to efficiently exploit the cloud resources for handling the peak load from mobile users. This research will benefit end users with various mobile devices by facilitating practical integration of these devices into the cloud. The results from this research are likely to foster new research directions on edge cloud design and mobile cloud computing.

Despite this success, cloud computing primarily targets users whose virtual machines (VMs) are rarely idle, as cloud users are typically billed for the amount of time the VM is awake, not how much work it does.  Thus, services that are long-lived but mostly idle a significant fraction of the time are prohibitively expensive for many potential users of cloud computing.  In this project, the PIs are developing a finer-grained model of cloud computation based around lightweight instances.  Lightweight instances are more akin to processes than virtual machines; they allow clients to only pay for their actual usage of  cloud resources, and to not have the complexity and overhead of running an entire operating system.  The lightweight instance approach has the potential to bring the benefits of cloud computing to a variety of users for whom it is a poor fit today.  The PIs are exploring a new, finer-granularity model for cloud computing, wherein the cloud makes it appear that all client instances are running all the time, but may actually swap them out while idle to permit statistical multiplexing.  Compared to today's VM-based model and container-based model, the proposed process-based model provides a much higher level of abstraction, and lets clients run long-lived, mostly-idle services much more cheaply than is possible today.  If successful, the research would open up a wide variety of new applications and architectures: processes could cheaply be run in the cloud on behalf of end users, providing them with the ability to run long-lived services cheaply."

For example, a hockey puck gliding across ice tends to keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless a force acts on it. It is implicit in Newton's laws that you can always measure everything about the puck's motion, such as its position and its speed, without affecting the motion. It seems that the same should be true of any object, whether it is huge like the planet earth or tiny like an atom. However, this is not how nature works; very small objects, such as an atom or an electron, seem to obey a different set of rules, called quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics predicts that strange things can happen, for example, an atom can have properties of being in two places at the same time, until its position is actually measured. As strange as those rules are, they make the electronics in computers and cell phones work, so we know they are accurate. Why don't hockey pucks have this strange quantum behavior? Interaction with other objects tends to hide the effects of quantum mechanics for objects much larger than atoms. The research team supported by this project will levitate a tiny diamond crystal in a chamber with almost no air remaining to minimize its interaction with other objects and stretch the size limits over which quantum mechanics does apply. The results of these experiments will improve our understanding of quantum mechanics, which is the foundation on which almost all our modern technology is based. <br/><br/>This program ultimately seeks to produce ""cat states"" in a mechanical system, where an object is in a quantum superposition of two different positions. This is a challenge which has puzzled physicists since the famous thought experiments of Schrodinger, 80 years ago. Researchers supported by this program will demonstrate that a trapped diamond nanocrystal containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers is a nearly ideal platform for creating such motional quantum states. In particular, they will work towards demonstrating four critical capabilities of this system. First, the diamond nanocrystal must be trapped in vacuum with an ultra-high quality factor (Q). Second, it must be possible to manipulate and read out the spin state of the NV centers. Third, the NV center spin states must couple to the state of the mechanical motion. Last, the mechanical motion must be cooled to near the ground state to initialize the system to a known configuration. The experiments begin by loading a diamond nanocrystal into the trap. Next, the spin state of NV centers in the trapped nanodiamond will be read optically and manipulated with a microwave drive. Finally, the mechanical motion is coupled to the NV center spins through externally-imposed magnetic field gradients. The combination of the ultra high Q of the mechanical motion and quantum control of the NV centers makes trapped, NV-containing nanodiamonds a unique system for generating motional quantum states. The development of this system could be of great value in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum mechanics and the properties of novel motional quantum states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept of a phase of matter allows one to account for drastically different physical properties in systems made out of the same underlying constituents, e.g. the liquid and solid ice forms of water.  Solid state materials can also typically come in one of several phases - e.g. metal versus insulator, or magnetic versus non-magnetic - and much of their usefulness derives from exploiting the different physical properties characteristic of such phases.  A theoretical framework for understanding the organization of constituents of materials into phases, ""ordering"" that materials undergo when they transform into a phase, was established over 50 years ago and had proven extremely successful until exotic new phases - called fractional quantum Hall effect states - were discovered.  These states, found when electrons are confined to two dimensions and are placed in large perpendicular magnetic fields, did not fit into the old theoretical framework and possess striking new physical properties that currently go under the name of ""topological order"". <br/> <br/>This research is aimed to advance fundamental understanding of topological phases and how the classification of topologically ordered phases is enriched when additional symmetries are present.  For example: topological insulators, which differ from ordinary insulators by the necessary existence of a metallic state at the surface, can exist because reversing the direction of time leads to a state that looks the same as the original one. This time reversal symmetry is not obeyed by a simple ferromagnet for which time reversal flips the direction of magnetism.  The research will address important questions:  What interesting properties can arise with other symmetries present, or with combinations of such symmetries?  How robust are they?  Are there any such phases that have no analogue in conventional solid-state materials?  Can the quantum mechanical connectedness of spatially separated parts of such phases be exploited to store or manipulate quantum information for future information technology?  The PI will investigate these questions using analytical techniques and novel mathematical methods.<br/><br/>This award also supports education and outreach activities including: the development of a new one-semester course focused on topological order at the advanced graduate students level; the PI will present lectures related to the research area to high school students through a program organized at Stony Brook university; the PI will organize a once-a-month physics lecture series aimed at the broader community, which will bring in outside speakers to introduce the audience to cutting-edge research in this and related fields.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education to identify and classify new phases of matter, termed topological phases, with a specific focus on how symmetries enrich possible topological phases.  Although topological order is robust and independent of any global symmetries, the inclusion of symmetries can lead to additional phases, for example the recently discovered topological insulators, which are robust only when time reversal symmetry is present.  The PI will use analytical techniques, including those from algebraic topology, to pursue several research directions:<br/><br/>1) Classifying symmetry-enriched phases for physically realistic symmetry groups, e.g. continuous, anti-unitary, and spatial symmetries, generalizing results for finite discrete symmetry groups.<br/>2) Classifying both symmetry-enriched and symmetry-protected phases involving fundamental fermion degrees of freedom.  This research will focus on the stability of such phases accessible through the band framework, as well as on the search for inherently strongly interacting phases.<br/>3) Constructing many-body invariants, which distinguish among the states in such a classification.  In particular, the PI will explore the connection between non-trivial symmetry-protected phases and anomalies in one lower dimension.<br/>4) Constructing a unified mathematical framework, based on topological quantum field theory, to tackle the above classification problems.<br/><br/>This award also supports education and outreach activities including: the development of a new one-semester course focused on topological order at the advanced graduate students level; the PI will present lectures related to the research area to high school students through a program organized at Stony Brook university; the PI will organize a once-a-month physics lecture series aimed at the broader community, which will bring in outside speakers to introduce the audience to cutting-edge research in this and related fields."

Experimental tests of this model will:  1) Establish the in vivo consequences of the interaction of R with flavonoids that have been identified to bind to the ACT; 2) Investigate ACT-small molecule structure-function relationships, by defining which other small molecules bind to the ACT, identifying the ACT residues relevant for the small molecule interaction, and establishing how general the results are for ACT domains in other plant transcription factors; and 3) Analyze in vivo the dynamic associations controlled by the ACT domain of R, by combining genetic resources with cellular approaches to investigate where and which interactions occur, in the presence and absence of flavonoids or other small molecules.

Real-life survey data often are unrepresentative due to selection bias and nonresponse.  Existing methods for adjusting for known differences between the sample and population from which the sample is drawn have some advantages but also practical limitations.  Classical weights are subject to large variability and can result in unstable estimators, while regression approaches present computational and modeling challenges.  The new framework developed by these investigators will allow adjustment for selection bias and nonresponse as well as improvements in design-respecting inference.  Using this approach, survey analysts will be able to properly account for non-ignorable design issues in the regression framework, and practitioners who conduct surveys in government, academic, commercial, and non-profit sectors will be able to construct statistically efficient survey weights in a routine manner.  This new framework may be applicable to problems resulting from the newly emerging explosion of ""big data,"" such as integration of surveys from multiple sources, analysis of streaming data, and respondent-driven sampling.  The project will develop software that can be accessed by the general research community. <br/><br/>This research project will connect survey weighting with poststratification under the framework of MRP.  In MRP, data are partially pooled during the modeling process and then local estimates are combined via poststratification to obtain the population inference.  This smoothed estimation borrows information from neighboring poststratification cells and allows flexible multilevel modeling strategies that have the potential to be robust to model misspecification.  The project generalizes MRP to handle weighting adjustments for regression, deep interactions, calibration for non-census variables, complex survey design, multistage sampling, multiple survey frames, and other complications that arise in real-world survey analysis.  The new methods will be applied to two ongoing surveys, the New York Longitudinal Poverty Measure study and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study.  Computations will be performed using the open source Bayesian program Stan and will be freely disseminated.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology."

These kinds of problems arise in a broad range of applications in engineering systems. Despite the substantial literature on convex and non-convex quadratic programming (general classes of optimization problems), most available optimization techniques are either not scalable or work efficiently only for convex quadratic programming and do not provide adequate results for non-convex quadratic programming. This project focuses on fundamental research on an integrated approach which the research team expects will lead to powerful solution methods for classes of non-convex programming problems. The new approach will be applicable for non-convex problems arising in many areas, such as power and energy systems, transportation, and communications. The project will involve students from underrepresented groups and will positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The general difficulty of power and energy optimization problems has a direct impact on power and energy systems management. This is one of the most fundamental concerns that must be dealt with in electrical power system management. The primary objective of this project is to address the difficulty associated with problem non-convexity by developing high-performance optimization techniques that apply to a broad set of nonlinear energy problems, particularly the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem. There is a critical and urgent need for developing smart and robust OPF solvers. The conventional options currently available for DC-OPF are quite limited. The research will fundamentally address AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) with active and reactive quadratically constrained quadratic programming optimization problems of a form that arises in operation and planning applications of the power system. Besides being non-convex, these problems are identified to be NP-hard. The proposed solution method is based on several basic and powerful optimization techniques in convex optimization theory such as linearized approximation techniques, linear and global search procedures, bi-linear and convex relaxation, and alternate direction methods. Also, new schemes and theories must be introduced to establish the convergence of the algorithm and guarantee the global optimality of the solution results. The research team devised a new successive linear optimization based branch and bound (SLOBB) method based on deploying principles of the classical linear approximation, improved convex relaxation, and the branch-and-bound technique to find the global optimal solution of the AC-OPF problem. Since the linear programming and convex solvers are robust and fast, and also the power systems community is already familiar with linear and convex programs for OPF, the algorithm that will be developed will be beneficial and user-friendly for the AC-OPF problem. We will also pursue theoretical investigations to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm and analyze its efficiency on existing test bed systems and synthetic data sets. The developed models and methodologies will be executed in real-world practical power grids."

Solid mantle rocks deform and flow over long time scales, and the viscosity (resistance to flow) of mantle rocks affects the rate of flow in the mantle, the energy budget of Earth's deep interior, and the speed with which tectonic plates move past one another. One of the best constraints on the mantle viscosity structure comes from modeling variations in Earth's long-wavelength gravity field. The team will combine mantle flow models, seismic images of the Earth's interior, and results from mineral physics to better constrain the depth variation of viscosity and its influence on mantle convection. The project will address the following scientific questions: (1) How does viscosity vary with depth, (2) How does viscosity structure affect behavior of buoyant, upwelling mantle material, and (3) How does uncertainty in seismic images of Earth's mantle affect our uncertainty in the viscosity profile? In addition to this research, the project contributes to the training and professional development of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher. Additionally, the team will work with a Portland-area high school teacher to develop curricular materials to teach concepts related to flow in the mantle from the Next Generation Science Standards.<br/><br/><br/>Full waveform whole-mantle tomography has recently provided improved measurements of lower mantle shear wave velocity anomalies. These images shed new light on the behavior of mantle upwellings and downwellings. Wide plumes, continuous from just above the core mantle boundary to the base of the lithosphere, are resolved beneath many of Earth's active volcanic hot spots, and plumes frequently appear to be deflected laterally below the transition zone, at a depth of 1000 km, a depth not coincident with known seismic discontinuities, but at which slabs stagnate, plumes are deflected, and changes in long-wavelength radial correlation structure appear in many tomographic models. Tomographic studies combining whole-Earth free oscillations with various other seismological observations (e.g. body wave travel times, surface wave dispersion, full waveforms) have recently improved constraints on the long-wavelength variations in wavespeed in the transition zone and mid mantle. Recent seismological data sets also suggest a deviation from simple scaling relationships between density and shear velocity, indicative of large-scale chemical heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle. The investigators will identify robust aspects of recent tomographic models, estimate uncertainties associated with their translation to density variations and employ a new inversion technique that incorporates these results in a probabilistic way to obtain improved constraints on the mantle viscosity structure. They will then use the solutions as the basis for numerical mantle convection simulations to evaluate the extent to which the inferred viscosity structures are compatible with available constraints on the style of convection and rate of heat transport in the mantle. In addition to training and mentoring of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher, the investigating team will work with a high school educator to develop curricular materials relevant to the Next Generation Science Standard HS-ESS2-3."

Project outcomes will provide researchers in the field with the first tool to understand the fundamental mechanisms of human-CTS interaction (e.g., the impact of system reliability on human acceptance and trust), by predicting the effects of technology on driver behavior.

In line with this perspective, most laboratory research focused on rock failure has been limited to experiments utilizing slow loading rates. However, many natural processes that pose significant risk for humans (e.g., earthquakes and extraterrestrial impacts), as well as risks associated with human activities (explosions, mine failures, projectile penetration), occur at rates which are hundreds to thousands of time faster than typically simulated in the laboratory. As a result, little experimental data exists to confirm or calibrate theoretical models explaining the connection between these dramatic events and the pulverized rocks found in fault zones, impact, or explosion sites. Therefore, a combined experimental and field investigation is proposed to study brittle rock failure in both earthquake and impact environments.   The mechanical behavior of different rock types at fast loading rates is postulated to depend on the microscopic composition and structure of individual minerals within the rocks.  If true, this will allow scientists to better predict the consequences of earthquakes and impact events based on the rock structure in individual areas and furthermore allow engineers to design more effective structures to withstand the pressures in mining, petroleum and military environments.  Integrated into this research plan is a partnership with Teach for America (TFA), a national teacher corps of college graduates and professionals who commit to teach for two years and raise student achievement in public schools, to create the TFA Geocorps. The TFA Geocorps will be high-achieving secondary school teachers involved in summer research activities related to the project who will also work with the Principal Investigator to design Geophysics-based thematic curriculum units to teach in their own classrooms.  Graduate students supported by this project will supplement their academic training by taking active roles in collaborations with the participating TFA Geocorps teachers.  <br/><br/>Brittle damage accumulates in the earth?s crust via numerous processes ranging from very slow (fault creep) to very fast (extraterrestrial impact).  The strain-rate-dependent micromechanics of brittle damage formation in rocks, particularly under confinement, is poorly constrained, yet it is generally understood that rocks become stronger at higher strain rates, and that above a critical strain-rate threshold, failure in compression transitions from localized damage along discrete fractures to delocalized (distributed) fracture damage (i.e., fragmentation or pulverization).  A recent series of studies focused on pulverized rocks in fault damage zones provide evidence that ultra-high strain rates (>100/s) associated with rupture tip propagation and/or supershear earthquake rupture are responsible for this pulverization. The transition from discrete fracture to fragmentation depends on confinement (burial depth); and the mechanism, although poorly constrained, is likely controlled by the grain-scale structure of rocks and the dynamics of microcrack propagation.  Here it is proposed to characterize the high strain rate inelastic response of rocks by following an integrated field, experimental, and theoretical study focused on the strain rate dependence of fracture toughness, strain rate (and confinement) dependence of compressive strength and damage, and comparison with field observations to determine a microstructural signature of strain rate.  The proposed work is expected to calibrate damage mechanics models of high strain-rate rock failure, and to characterize damage zones formed in different strain rate (and confinement) regimes.  Expected results should provide a basis for distinguishing strain rate and stress conditions responsible for rock damage based on observing fracture networks and seismic anisotropy.   While the focus of this work will be on damage created during earthquakes and impacts, the strength and failure characteristics of rocks under high strain rates are also of fundamental interest in mining, petroleum, and military applications related to blasting, rock burst, underground explosions, and protective design."

Research project addresses the issues of: balancing the processing of location-based data streams coming into MOD servers with efficient processing of visualization-related queries; determining optimal distribution of queries/tasks among multiple regional servers; maximizing the scalability of prediction techniques in terms of efficient management of objects' data and queries; modeling data uncertainty; coupling map generalization with trajectories' data reduction when zooming across different scales; resolving issues of privacy and security; and enabling semantic querying. A demonstration of the outcomes is available within the TerraFly testbed (http://TerraFly.fiu.edu) -- a public Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping engine and location-based data repository.<br/><br/>This work explores the novel steps towards combining the real and virtual worlds, an emerging research frontier. The virtual world is relatively well understood, but the combination of the real and virtual poses great challenges and promises transformative results with high potential payoff, including in-car navigation systems, massive fleets of mobile sensors, self-navigating vehicles, situation command, and location-based services. While advancing Computer Science, the project also leverages prior investment of, and provides direct benefit to, NSF, NASA, DoI, DoT, DHS, and other stakeholders such as the NSF EarthCube project. By improving the efficiency of spatial, temporal, and moving object data management and making these results available to constituencies via TerraFly, EarthCube and other venues, the project will produce societal benefits. This project provides a foundation for improving the quality of services in multiple applications such as disaster management, environmental monitoring, transportation, education, and logistics. The resulting technologies may serve as a base to advance research on self-navigating vehicles, robots, and mobile sensors. In particular, this work facilitates the technologies of Informed Traveler Programs, dynamic navigation, situation control, and airborne observational systems. The project provides rich educational and research opportunities for students from the collaborating institutions -- including underrepresented students. In addition, educational modules are developed, and research results will be incorporated in curriculum expansions.

These next generation robotic systems can benefit greatly by the development of computationally efficient tools to synthesize optimal feedback control laws to achieve specified output signal statistics in presence of model and sensing uncertainties. To support commercial applications such as package delivery, it is imperative that the robotic systems operating in uncertain environments negotiate specific waypoints with prescribed tolerance. This unique challenge of routing the vehicles operating in uncertain environments involves a strong coupling between the uncertainty propagation and control. Successful negotiation of this challenge is contingent on the development of stable optimal feedback control laws, while accounting for the uncertainties that pervade dynamical systems. The fundamental formalisms that underpin this research are widely applicable to the control of next generation robotic systems and unmanned vehicles. The project includes plans to integrate research into educational efforts involving graduate and undergraduate students, including expanding efforts to reach under-represented populations in science and engineering. Outreach activities include the technical interchange meetings with local school teachers and instituting robotics related tutorial courses to motivate middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The focus of the research is to investigate a unified approach to stable optimal feedback control laws and uncertainty propagation methods by developing computationally efficient solutions to the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) partial differential equations (PDEs), respectively. Recent advances in sparse approximation and non-product quadrature rules are exploited to solve the HJB and FPK equations. The intellectual merits are drawn from advancing the state of knowledge in uncertainty quantification, optimal control theory, and numerical analysis, and integrating them effectively to realize a scalable framework for study of dynamical systems. The Conjugate Unscented Transformation (CUT) technique in conjunction with sparse approximation methods forms an enabling tool to drive the uncertainty propagation and optimal feedback control realization processes. This research culminates in the development of nonlinear stable feedback control laws for uncertain dynamic systems, impacting various estimation and control problems in engineering. The proposed research will be demonstrated on several benchmark problems, along with two key applications involving optimal momentum transfer in control of gyroscopic systems and surveillance of a ground region with the help of unmanned vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach developed in this project is based on dimension reduction methods whereby heterogeneous agents are grouped into a small number of types.   <br/> <br/>Discrete methods provide a way to reduce the dimensionality of heterogeneity. This may be advantageous for both computational and statistical reasons. However, existing methods such as finite mixtures face computational challenges, and they are mostly studied under the strong assumption that heterogeneity is discrete in the population. The investigators broaden the scope of discrete methods, by developing computationally tractable two-step estimators and studying their properties in the absence of such substantive assumptions. This research also illustrates the usefulness of these methods in applications, particularly in structural models where allowing for unobserved heterogeneity raises important challenges, and in models with two-sided heterogeneity."

Geopolymer composites are a new class of amorphous polymeric hybrids with attractive attributes that have the potential to drastically change the way composites materials are synthesized. Geopolymer-based hybrids are relevant to a vast array of fields such as civil, aerospace, mechanical, and biomedical engineering. However, established relationships between performance, chemistry, and composition are lacking. As a consequence, the widespread application of geopolymer-based materials has been impeded, despite their high potential. The integration of cutting-edge experiments with advanced computational modeling will accelerate the discovery of high-performance multifunctional structural composites. Geopolymer composites have been theorized for many interdisciplinary applications including enhanced-performance construction materials, passive cooling systems for buildings, biomaterials for bone repair, membranes for clean energy generation, and sound insulation systems. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U. S. economy and society, and spur materials discovery. This research involves the collaboration between three institutions and across disciplines including nanoscience, solid mechanics, and materials science.

Many spatial studies are compromised due to a discrepancy between the spatial scale at which data are analyzed and the spatial scale at which the phenomenon under investigation operates.  One consequence has been that research findings often conflict when analyses are conducted at differing scales.  Decision making and policy formulation therefore may be misguided by conflicting, biased research findings brought about by spatial scale.  Lacking appropriate ways to deal with this spatial problem has made many existing findings less compelling or even invalid.  In the era of big data with the advancement of spatial data collection technologies, data that were once difficult or impossible to obtain are now widely available at various spatial scales and are being used to study a variety of problems.  Questions regarding spatial data thus become more pressing.  The strategies to be developed for addressing the spatial scale issues have the potential to be applied to many fields and applications.  The research results will benefit researchers and practitioners in processing, analyzing, and presenting multi-source, multi-scale spatial data. <br/><br/>Numerous studies have been conducted to understand how issues related to scale influence analyses and interpretation. Despite the efforts, this remains a widely recognized, complex problem with few generalizable solutions.  Even when studies are conducted at the appropriate spatial scale, uncertainty may exist because data are usually collected at different scales and therefore must be aggregated or interpolated to achieve the study scale.  Using a large public health surveillance dataset, the investigators will develop a measurement error-based statistical framework to quantify the space scale-induced uncertainties and provide strategies to ameliorate the issues.  The research will address issues of 1) characterization of scale due to spatial scale definition and data misalignment in the measurement error framework; 2) quantification of the effects of scale issues on the estimation significance and parameter biasedness; and 3) strategies that may be used to reduce uncertainties in a multi-scale analysis."

Interactions among engineering, organizational, and behavioral factors and incentives determine building energy use and related environmental sustainability, and potentially cause divergence between true energy performance and theoretically possible performance. There has been increasing investment in energy efficient commercial building designs and technologies. Among the studies that conduct statistical post-occupancy evaluations (POE), there has been debate about whether ""green"" commercial buildings (i.e. LEED buildings) actually save energy or not, and this casts doubt on their energy sustainability. Evaluating the true energy performance of green commercial buildings requires empirical analysis of long data histories and larger sample sizes. To understand a complete picture of energy sustainability, social factors such as organizational management and occupant behaviors, as well as environmental and economic impacts of energy use, must be studied. Additionally, evaluating the effects of these factors on the timing of building energy use (i.e. peak hours versus non-peak hours) is essential to understand environmental (i.e. carbon) costs of electricity consumption. This project will conduct such holistic energy sustainability analysis using a comprehensive building energy dataset in a city (Phoenix) that is typical of energy use patterns in many of the world's rapidly growing hot and dry urban areas. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project will: 1) provide reliable statistical evidence of the true energy performance of green commercial buildings based on large datasets; 2) quantify the impact of green commercial buildings on power grid load profiles and electricity generation fuel mix; 3) apply surveys to quantify engineering, organizational, and behavioral factors that determine observed building energy performance; and 4) evaluate the systemic environmental and economic impacts of green commercial buildings in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The project will advance engineering research into energy sustainability of green commercial buildings through a novel ""big data"" empirical approach. First, this project will analyze much larger and reliable datasets of commercial buildings than previously studied, including historical electricity consumption and other key building level attributes. The dataset contains more than 700 Energy Star and LEED commercial buildings, and more than 17,000 total commercial electric customers. Second, compared to existing POE studies, this project adopts more rigorous and advanced statistical analysis including matching, panel regression, and nonparametric modelling. Importantly, this project uses much more credible control groups. Third, this project will provide the first empirically reliable evidence of how green building technologies impact environmental footprints by time of day and season, which are critical for determining environmental costs associated with electricity consumption. Finally, this project will empirically explore the interrelated factors in the coupled human-environmental systems including engineering (e.g. technical reliability and compatibility), organizational (e.g. principal-agent problem), and behavioral (e.g. bounded rationality) factors that influence the observed energy performance of commercial buildings and the impact on environmental sustainability. The insights produced may be directly implemented by practitioners including state energy policy makers, city environment planners, energy service companies, building engineers, building owners, and utility companies."

These languages increase software productivity by supporting programming at a very high level, hiding the complexity of modern computer hardware and operating systems. Examples include JavaScript, PHP, Objective-C, Java, C#, Python, and Ruby. These languages have great economic importance. Unfortunately, most of these languages are inefficient, imposing overheads as large as a factor of fifty compared to orthodox language choices such as C. The broader impacts of this research are two-fold: (1) Since managed languages are increasingly becoming economic linchpins, deployed in the engine rooms of global e-commerce platforms and Internet applications (including those of key software companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Oracle, and Microsoft), improving the reliability and performance of these managed language platforms will lead to economic efficiencies as well as resource efficiencies in the form of reduced power costs to data centers and improved battery lifetime on mobile devices;(2) Concerning human diversity in the computing field, the research will engage undergraduates from under-represented groups, and encourage them to pursue graduate school and careers in computing and research.<br/><br/>This research project is defining, developing, evaluating, and refining the essential components of a new foundation layer for managed language implementation. In doing so, it addresses a key source of systemic inefficiency, by pioneering the ""micro virtual machine"" (microVM) as an efficient high-performance substrate for managed language implementation. The relationship between a microVM and existing managed language implementations is analogous to that between an operating system micro kernel and monolithic operating systems such as Linux. The microVM captures the insight that there exists a well-defined foundation common to most modern languages that can take responsibility for fundamental abstractions over hardware, concurrency, and memory. By isolating and exposing this substrate, the microVM embodies state-of-the-art base technology available to language implementers while isolating them from the pernicious complexities of these abstractions, freeing them to focus on all-important language-specific optimizations. The research is enabling more efficient software and a distinctly sharper focus for language implementation research and development. The intellectual merits of the research are: (1) Researching and identifying, via prototyping and evaluation, the right microVM abstractions, allowing clean separation of low-level language-neutral and high-level language-specific concerns, capturing the core behaviors, while also admitting high-performance language implementations; (2) Generating secondary research challenges, especially with regard to the effective and efficient combination of abstractions for hardware, concurrency, and memory; and (3) Creating a viable target for formal verification because the microVM has a relatively small code base, thus taking one step on the way towards trustworthy subsystems for assurance of managed software."

Recent work in the field has had a significant impact on the advancement of optimal crossover designs and designs for interference models for arbitrarily given covariance structures and design size configurations. However, these results have for the most part been limited to approximate designs for relatively simple models. While these results are arguably important in their own right, this project will extend methods and tools to achieve the ultimate goal of deriving exact designs for a wider spectrum of practical models. The results will be a much needed addition to our collective design toolbox. Most importantly, this project will go beyond the territory of design and apply the tools and ideas from design of experiments to subsampling problems emerging in big data with both statistical and machine learning methods under consideration.

A set of prior research projects demonstrated that it is technically feasible to construct FPGAs based on non-volatile memories (NVMs). These NV-FPGAs offer attractive features such as better scalability, superior energy efficiency, near-zero power-on delay, anti-radiation, as well as the ability to store more than one bit per cell. However, NV-FPGAs also display a complex design space involving information density, read and write speeds, data retention time, and device endurance.

First, considering the needs of self-adaptive applications, this project fine-tunes various steps on the FPGA synthesis flow. Novel techniques are proposed to optimize task scheduling, data allocation, logic mapping, placement, and routing to improve reconfiguration speed, energy efficiency, reliability, and endurance of NVM FPGAs. Second, this project explores the rich NVM design space and sets different optimization goals for look-up tables, flip-flops, and on-chip memories. The success of this project will lead to a long-lasting, rapid-adaptive, reliable, and energy-efficient platform better suited to the needs of a wide range of applications with self-adaptivity requirement, including healthcare, wellness, industry, and even military applications, all of which are critical for the United States to drive its new strategies of innovation and technology.

It is a very active field, since many questions in other fields can be represented mathematically as matrix problems. For example: the spectra of heavy atoms in physics, statistical estimation of covariance matrices in statistics, capacity of quantum channels in quantum communication, conducting properties of semiconductors (Anderson models). This project aims to study the basic properties of some random matrix ensembles, which will shed some light on the nature of the highly correlated many-body system. In particular, for understanding the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems, as explained by the Anderson model in quantum physics, one main project in this research program is designed to provide rigorous proof that similar (conducting) property appears in the random matrix models. There are some problems in this program designed for training graduate and undergraduate students who have an interest in probability theory. The investigator will also run workshops designed to foster the upward professional development of graduate and undergraduate students working in fields related to random matrix theory as well as to stimulate interaction across barriers between these disciplines.  <br/><br/>The investigator will focus on the identification of the eigenvalue densities, the local eigenvalue statistics and the  eigenvector distributions of  many different classes of random matrix ensembles. The ensembles considered in this project include anisotropic  matrices, band matrices, i.i.d. random matrices, and general non-Hermitian matrices. One main project will be focused on the localization-delocalization conjecture of random band matrices, which is very similar to the metal-insulator phase transition for disordered quantum systems (i.e., the so called Anderson conjecture in quantum physics). Different from regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure. Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random matrices). The study on this type of ensembles is much weaker than the study on random Hermitian matrices, since the regular spectrum method can not be applied. The investigator will apply some new ideas on these type of matrices. In this proposal, some projects are also designed for training graduate and undergraduate students, which include proving the universality phenomenon for more general random matrix ensembles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials could enable faster data connections between computer chips while consuming less energy. The approach is to add a small amount of carbon to germanium to make a new alloy semiconductor, Ge:C, with strong optoelectronic properties, making it a potential alternative for laser materials besides the conventional III-V materials. A new synthesis and growth technique eliminates the major sources of defects in the grown material. Ge:C-based material replaces toxic and scarce elements such as arsenic and indium in semiconductor lasers. The research project motivates first-year undergraduate students in engineering and physics, and encourages undergraduate students to pursue graduate studies. Outreach activities include involving women in science and underrepresented minority high-school students in the research. <br/><br/>Technical Description: The goal of this project is to demonstrate Ge:C-based alloy semiconductors with a direct bandgap and high optical gain. The films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy using tetra(germyl)methane (4GeMe) as a precursor, which is synthesized in electronic grade by the team. The specific tasks are: (1) Experimental verification of band anticrossing in Ge:C and related alloys; (2) ab-initio simulations of band structure and desirable compositions for Ge:C materials; (3) Growth of highly crystalline Ge:C with minimal interstitials or other unwanted defects; and (4) Growth with pseudo/surfactants for substitutional C, and demonstrating direct bandgap emission. The advantage of the 4GeMe precursor is that it pre-bonds each C atom to four Ge atoms, preventing undesirable carbon-carbon bonds at the substrate surface. By eliminating these defects, this study provides direct experimental demonstration on highly mismatched alloys with small bandgaps and enables the predictive modeling to design related highly mismatched alloys with high optical gain and suppressed Auger recombination. This experiment and theory combined project closes the knowledge gap between the thin film growth and modeling of the Ge:C thin film systems, and provides  a chemical route to grow highly crystalline Ge:C with direct bandgap and high optical gain."

The abundance of DNA sequence data arising from genome sequencing projects has led to important computational challenges in the estimation of these phylogenetic relationships. Among these challenges is the estimation of the evolutionary history for a group of species based on DNA sequence information from several distinct genes sampled throughout the genome. This research is focused on the development of computationally efficient methods for estimating the evolutionary history when the number of species under consideration is very large (i.e., hundreds to thousands). This is accomplished by considering collections of three species at a time, and using properties of the estimated evolutionary history for groups of three to infer the overall evolutionary history. Properties and performance of the method will be evaluated theoretically as well as with both simulated and empirical data sets. This work has numerous practical applications, such as the study of the evolutionary relationships among human populations.<br/><br/>Though the amount of genomic data available for inferring phylogenetic species trees has increased rapidly within the last 10 years, few methods have been developed to efficiently estimate species trees for data sets consisting of hundreds or thousands of species. A fast approximation to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) that retains desirable statistical properties, such as consistency and asymptotic efficiency, is proposed. Results from preliminary work suggest that this approach will be significantly faster than existing likelihood and Bayesian approaches, while also being highly accurate. The method can be applied to a range of data types, including allele frequency data arising under a Brownian motion model along the phylogeny and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data arising from the coalescent model. A software package will be developed to implement the methodology. The project will also support one PhD student, who will contribute to the development and implementation of the methodology."

Some strategies take the form of overt and direct criticism of states to punish and deter repression of citizens, known as ""naming and shaming"".  Other strategies involve positive cooperation with governments to change legal and de facto protections of rights and freedoms. To date, we know little about which strategy is more effective, because systematic research on this topic has ignored direct collaboration between these organizations and states. Instead, there has been a recent explosion in the number of social science studies examining the efficacy of contentious strategies.  This research will provide new insight into whether such cooperative strategies are an effective means to improve human rights and social conditions.<br/> <br/>This project is the first to analyze the large-scale digital communications from human rights non-governmental organizations (HR NGOs) to understand the specific issues and contexts where cooperation can be successfully implemented. The researchers will demonstrate the usefulness of this approach through quantitative text analysis procedure analyzing a wide range of digitally available information (i.e. press releases, published reports, newsletters, and social media posts from multiple HR NGOs).  These are an especially rich source of information as they contain both cooperative and confrontational signals to states. The research team plans to build theoretically informed models that predict 1) the issues and circumstances that provide incentives for government-HR NGO partnerships versus public criticism known as ""naming and shaming,"" and 2) when particular HR NGO strategies ultimately lead to the desired changes in state behavior. This research has the potential to enhance the well-being of society by providing a better understanding of strategies that improve human rights performance around the world.  It is also poised to make an important contribution in helping to foster collaboration between the social sciences and other STEM disciplines."

However, a wide range of evidence now demonstrates that this theory is not able to explain how many people make certain specific kinds of decisions -- for example, the highest price someone is willing to pay for an object is often lower than the lowest price he or she is willing to accept to go without the same object. This award will fund the PI's continued efforts to develop alternative models of behavior based on the idea that individuals may not be able to compare all options; in other words, people have incomplete preferences. The PI plans to consider whether and how this theory can account for a range of document decision making behaviors. He also plans to conduct decision making experiments in a lab environment to test hypotheses drawn from the theory. The results will advance our scientific understanding of this kind of human decision-making, and could be useful to businesses and governments that need to predict how individuals will respond to new products and policies.<br/><br/>The research will focus on developing a model in which subjects' preferences may be incomplete, and using that model to analyze several specific biases in decision making: the gap between willingness to accept and willingness to pay, certainty effects, decision in stochastic environments, and intertemporal choice. The goal is to provide axiomatic characterizations of models in which subjects chose to randomize, including a special case where the desire to randomize comes from the agents' uncertainty about her own utility of consumption. The project will also include work on preferences on lotteries over consumption streams and will introduce an axiom that captures aversion to variability of consumption over time."

The importance of understanding the reasons for this condition at a fundamental level is very significant, since this condition that can sometimes result in deaths.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to advance the fundamental knowledge of biological fluid dynamics in prediction and control of human snoring through a combined physiology-based modeling, physics-based simulation, analysis, verification, and optimization approach. This approach is also applicable to a wide range of engineering and biological systems, such as noise reduction and phonation. There are mainly two objectives: (1) to develop a methodology for unveiling the flow physics and sound-producing mechanism of biological fluid-structure coupling problems and (2) to use the methodology for the investigation of optimal intervention procedures in order to ease the vortex-induced snore symptoms towards a better quality of life. The proposed work is highly interdisciplinary and involves fundamental scientific problems in the fields of biology, physics, physiology, and engineering. Snoring is an audible sign coded with richness of information about human respiratory functions. The sound comes from a complex interaction between compliant airway structures and the transient vortex shedding which is induced by the narrowing of the airway passage. However, the specific snore source mechanisms are still elusive, despite the significant in vitro and clinical efforts. Physics-based numerical investigation of the snore source will promise to quantify the relationship between the nonlinear response of the flexible airways and the respiratory vortex dynamics for sound generation. Currently, snore source diagnosis relies on expensive and time-consuming procedures that are outsourced to special analytical laboratories. Such challenges in performing in vivo and in vitro snore diagnosis will make the numerical methods ideal investigative tools. The PIs propose to systematically study the snore-producing mechanisms of different age and gender groups, paying particular attention to the underlying physics of biological fluid-structure interaction and associated sound sources. This is to be accomplished through the use of a combined modeling, simulation, analysis, validation, and optimization approach. The findings from the proposed research could provide pre-surgical guidelines for alleviating the apnea-causing factors by minimizing sound production of the system. Findings from this work could be used by acoustic experts and respiratory therapists for understanding the sound source production and control from its biological origin. The theories developed from this research will promote accurate diagnosis of snore sources and effective treatment of patients with snoring or other respiratory disorders. The research work will also be the central theme in a multi-level education program in which: (1) PIs will continue to provide summer undergraduate research experience to attract and retain engineering students from under-represented groups; (2) the proposed methodology will be incorporated into the PIs' existing graduate level course on bio-inspired flow and respiratory aerosol dynamics; and (3) an educational lab curriculum in snore specialty will be developed to provide multi-disciplinary training and research opportunities for high-school and college students and to support biomedical and bio-inspired engineering programs in both University of Virginia and Central Michigan University"

Both technical and conceptual limits have prevented the collection and analysis of rich empirical datasets with high temporal frequency over large spatial extents necessary to investigate how changes to seasonal precipitation patterns are affecting food security.  This research project will transform both methodological and conceptual frameworks for assessing the sustainability of dryland agricultural systems.  The research will bring new understanding of how dryland farmers adapt to within-season variability in climate and how those adaptations affect their current and future resilience to climate variability and climate change.  Project findings will improve forecast models used to monitor and predict the sustainability of water-dependent agricultural systems.  By marrying the simple idea of cell phone adoption with state-of-art research in data science, crop prediction, and environmental/social monitoring, the project will advance and accelerate scientific understanding of an important global sustainability problem.<br/><br/>This project will focus on characterizing the nature and impact of intra-seasonal smallholder decision making on adaptation to climate variability in semi-arid agricultural systems. Specifically, the research addresses three critical research questions: (1) How do intra-seasonal dynamics of both the environment and social systems shape farmer adaptive capacity? (2) To what extent does intra-seasonal decision making enable farmers to adapt to climate uncertainty? and (3) How can intra-seasonal data improve the ability to model, predict, and improve adaptation to climate variability in ways that enhance food security?  The research team will integrate physical models of hydrological and agricultural dynamics with real-time environmental data and weekly farmer decision making in individual fields.  These real-time data are obtained from previously-developed novel cellular-based environmental sensing pods coupled to real-time reports of farmer decision making submitted via cell phones.  The team will use a combination of environmental and social data to develop a suite of modeling tools for understanding how climate variability impacts the sustainability of agricultural systems in the study regions.  The research team also will develop modeling tools for improved forecasts of food security capable of producing new understandings of the intra-seasonal dynamics of both social and environmental processes.

Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the viability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and building new kinds of learning technologies and studying their possibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them effectively. So-called 'non-cognitive' factors such as grit, tenacity, and perseverance have drawn renewed attention from researchers, policy makers, and the public. Cutting across all three concepts is the fundamental idea of 'self-regulation,' or the ability to monitor and appropriately regulate one's attention. Self-regulation skills are critical for success in today's era of rapid technological and social change. Luckily, evidence is accumulating that such skills can be taught. New technologies for collecting, tracking, and reporting data offer great promise for developing and scaffolding students' ability to self-regulate. One such tool is the touch tablet application entitled Tenacity. Tenacity is a tablet based application for middle schoolers designed to train and track the user's attentional self-regulation. Prior research found that, after using the tool for roughly 20 minutes per day for a period of two weeks, students showed significant improvements in self-regulation skills. In this project, researchers will adapt the existing prototype application for more accessible use on wearable devices, add a data dashboard for monitoring one's skill development over time, and then assess its use and effectiveness in the natural environment both inside and outside the classroom. The results will be a market ready application for wearable technologies (smart watches) for self-regulating attention, empirical results assessing its use and impact among everyday users, and the public release on iTunes of the software for dissemination and assessment at mass scale. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research team will adapt the current prototype for use on the Apple iWatch, debug and polish its ability to train and track breath-counting accuracy intermittently throughout the day, and implement data visualization tools for use by users and their parents and teachers. They will then assess its effectiveness in an 8-week experimental study using a pretest/posttest control group design with teens (13-15 years old). Finally, they will release the tool to the public via the Apple App Store to examine its use and effectiveness at mass scale. The hypothesis is that systematic use of Tenacity will result in behavior change on standard measures for attention, foster a more productive conceptual understanding of self-regulation, increase self-regulation skills on first order tasks (i.e., direct skill improvement measures within the application) and second order variables, such as school grades and social wellbeing, and increase school affiliation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Greeting cards have processors that play songs. Fireworks have processors for precisely timing their detonation. Computers are in engines, monitoring combustion and performance. They are in our homes, hospitals, offices, ovens, planes, trains, and automobiles. These computers, when networked, will form the Internet of Things (IoT). The resulting applications and services have the potential to be even more transformative than the World Wide Web. The security implications are enormous. Internet threats today steal credit cards. Internet threats tomorrow will disable home security systems, flood fields, and disrupt hospitals. The root problem is that these applications consist of software on tiny low-power devices and cloud servers, have difficult networking, and collect sensitive data that deserves strong cryptography, but usually written by developers who have expertise in none of these areas. The goal of the research is to make it possible for two developers to build a complete, secure, Internet of Things applications in three months.<br/><br/>The research focuses on four important principles. The first is ""distributed model view controller."" A developer writes an application as a distributed pipeline of model-view-controller systems. A model specifies what data the application generates and stores, while a new abstraction called a transform specifies how data moves from one model to another. The second is ""embedded-gateway-cloud."" A common architecture dominates Internet of Things applications. Embedded devices communicate with a gateway over low-power wireless. The gateway processes data and communicates with cloud systems in the broader Internet. Focusing distributed model view controller on this dominant architecture constrains the problem sufficiently to make problems, such as system security, tractable. The third is ""end-to-end security."" Data emerges encrypted from embedded devices and can only be decrypted by end user applications. Servers can compute on encrypted data, and many parties can collaboratively compute results without learning the input. Analysis of the data processing pipeline allows the system and runtime to assert and verify security properties of the whole application. The final principle is ""software-defined hardware."" Because designing new embedded device hardware is time consuming, developers rely on general, overkill solutions and ignore the resulting security implications. The data processing pipeline can be compiled into a prototype hardware design and supporting software as well as test cases, diagnostics, and a debugging methodology for a developer to bring up the new device. These principles are grounded in Ravel, a software framework that the team collaborates on, jointly contributes to, and integrates into their courses and curricula on cyberphysical systems."

Buildings are the largest sector and therefore an attractive target of these efforts: current Federal sustainability goals mandate that 50% of U.S.commercial buildings become net-zero energy by 2050. A range of options exists to achieve this goal, but financial concerns require a data-driven, empirically-validated approach. However, critical gaps exist in the energy and water measurement technology, and indoorclimate control science, needed to benchmark competing options, prioritize efficiency investments, and ensure occupant comfort.<br/><br/>To address these challenges, this project proposes a new kind of ""peel-and-stick"" sensor that can be affixed to everyday objects to infer their contributions to whole-building resource consumption. To use the sensors, occupants or building managers simply tag end loads like a ceiling light, shower head, or range top. The sensors monitor the ambient conditions around a load and, using statistical methods,correlate those conditions with readings from existing electricity, gas, or water meters, providing individual estimates without intrusive metering. The sensors are built from integrated circuit technology laminated into smart labels, so they are small, inexpensive, and easy-to-deploy. The sensors are powered by the same ambient signals they sense, eliminating the need for periodic battery replacement or wall power. Collectively, these properties address cost and coverage challenges, and enable scalable deployment and widespread adoption.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal stems from the insight that the transfer and use of energy (and other resources) usually emits energy, often in a different domain, and that this emitted energy is often enough to intermittently power simple, energy-harvesting sensors whose duty cycle is proportional to the energy being transferred or used. Hence, the mere activation rate of the sensors signalsthe underlying energy use. The power-proportional relationship between usage activity and side channel harvesting, when coupled with state-of-the art, millimeter-scale, nano-power chips and whole-house or panel-level meters, enables small and inexpensive sensor tags that are pervasively distributed with unbounded lifetimes. But, networking and tasking them, and making sense of their data, requires a fundamental rethinking of low-power communications, control, and data fusion to abstract the intermittent, unreliable, and noisy sensor infrastructure into actionable information.<br/><br/>This project's broader impact stems from an integrated program of education, research, and outreach that (i) creates a smart objects focused curriculum whose classroom projects are motivated by research needs, (ii) provides research experiences for undergraduates and<br/>underrepresented minorities, (iii) mentors students on all aspects of successful research from articulating hypotheses to peer-reviewing papers,(iv) disseminates teaching materials on embedded systems and research pedagogy, (v) produces students who bridge disciplines,operating at the intersection of measurement science, information technology, and sustainability policy, and (vi) translates scientific discovery and technical knowledge into beneficial commercial products through industry outreach and internships, and (vii) engages with the National Labs to ensure that the research addresses pressing problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
