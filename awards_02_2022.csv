Participants will work under the guidance of Texas A&M University (TAMU) faculty from four colleges (Agriculture and Life Sciences, Engineering, Geosciences, and Bush School of Government), alongside international experts based in Costa Rica. Participants will spend 5 weeks on-campus at TAMU and 5 weeks at the TAMU Soltis Center near San Isidro de Peñas Blancas, Costa Rica. This program aims to enhance student development towards future careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by A) demonstrating the foundational importance of Diversity in Science; B) instilling competencies and appreciation for Interdisciplinary Breadth while broadening awareness of the interconnection between forests, water, people, and planet; and C) fostering Global Awareness by providing a transformational international research experience within the tropical forest and nearby sites.  In addition to conducting research projects, students will undertake professional development activities to foster their acceptance of a place in STEM research and continuing education and participate in cultural exchanges and hands-on learning projects that enhance their ability to live and work effectively in a diverse and global society. The expected outcomes include joint faculty-student publications in leading research journals, research conference presentations, and studies to assess the success of international field experiences. The project directors will share strategies to recruit diverse student cohorts, program design and management, and building successful international REU programs through workshops and other far-reaching outlets.<br/><br/>The unique learning environment of this international REU site supports crosscutting discoveries that relate changing climate and land management to tropical ecosystem function and associated hydrological services provided by forests for local communities, e.g., clean reliable drinking water and hydropower generation. Key science questions will include, among others: how will altered climate affect tropical forest ecosystem function, water reliability, biodiversity, and soil carbon sequestration?; how does land management affect the land-atmosphere interaction through changes in evapotranspiration, leaf wetness duration, and productivity?; and how are hydrological services provided by forests for local communities affected by climate, land management, and natural geology? Our recruitment and multi-phase selection process prioritizes potential impact from this REU, appropriate expectations and attitudes, and contribution to diversity of the cohort. Cohort-building activities are designed to create an inclusive and supportive learning community to improve skills in critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration. Educational program assessment will also be conducted to understand the full timeline of student experience and self-conception as researchers. In addition to standard pre- and post-program surveys, more frequent assessments will be used to evaluate students? experiences with overconfidence versus struggle cycles for various aspects of the research process. Additional outcomes of this program include workshops through the TAMU Center for Teaching Excellence and assisting with the TAMU Office of Undergraduate Research on topics such as application design, processes for recruitment and selection, setting appropriate expectations, cohort-building, designing professional development aimed at ?entering research?, and building successful international programs outside of the study abroad model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However most of them are still not readily accessible or readily usable; thus, hampering efforts to address biodiversity questions. It is often the biodiversity data from regionally focused small institutions that are inaccessible, despite their importance. Such an institution is the Claude E. Phillips Herbarium in Delaware, which houses over 200,000 specimens from all major plant groups. These specimens were collected locally on the Delmarva Peninsula as well as nationally and globally over the last 200 years, and represent valuable resources for research and education. This project will digitize about 130,000 plant specimens to help fill gaps in herbarium specimen digitization. The mobilized data are particularly significant in their geographic, taxonomic, and temporal coverage and will provide baseline information to assess patterns and trends in biodiversity across space and time. At the same time, the project will also train the next generation of the herbarium workforce to help ensure that centuries of botanical legacy will be cared for and will continue to provide long-term benefits.<br/><br/>To increase accessibility of biodiversity data, the project will produce about 130,000 high resolution specimen images and a database of both transcribed specimen metadata and georeferenced localities, all of which will be released online for public access through iDigBio (idigbio.org) and the Consortium of Mid-Atlantic Herbaria's Symbiota portal (midatlanticherbaria.org). In parallel with, and aided by, the digitization process, a curatorial upgrade will be undertaken to modernize collections care and management at the Claude E. Phillips Herbarium, with the ultimate goals of improving curation and customer service as well as promoting usage and sustainability of the collections. Training of undergraduate students at Delaware State University is an integral part of the project and will expand participation of groups still underrepresented in STEM, particularly natural history. Project personnel will be involved in all aspects of digitization and curation. Meanwhile, access to the mobilized data will enable further educational and research opportunities both within and outside the institution. The project will also contribute to regional capacity building by engaging the public through workshops, tours, crowdsourcing, and other outreach events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, big data is only valuable when it can provide useful insights, which analysts often seek to extract from data visualizations. Much like mastering a new recipe, it takes effort and skill to process data and design effective visualizations, and analysts are increasingly turning to computational tools to support their efforts to visualize massive data and process it into a form suitable for consumption. However, evaluating these tools is challenging, both because they are used for a wide variety of problems and by a wide variety of people, and standard tool benchmarks are unequipped to handle these variations. The vision for this project is to develop better ways to evaluate tools as they are used in the wild; if we can automate the way we evaluate data exploration tools, then we can automatically test new tools as soon as they are created, tune them to real workloads, and help analysts be more efficient and effective at generating insights. To this end, the research team will develop automated testing software that can determine: (1) whether a data exploration tool is capable of helping someone achieve the particular goals they have in exploring their data; and (2) what problems these tools and evaluation methods may introduce to the data exploration process. The team will also work with leading visualization researchers and software companies to fine-tune the software and maximize its impact, and develop new programs to help students learn fundamental visualization and research skills.<br/><br/>To make the envisioned software feasible, the research objective of this project is to formally specify an analyst?s goals in exploring a dataset, and to measure whether a given system helps or hinders an analyst?s ability to achieve these specified data exploration goals. During data exploration, analysts visually and interactively query their data to help their organization make informed decisions. The research will be conducted in three phases. Phase 1 will theoretically and programmatically define a person?s exploration intent at different granularities (e.g., goals, sub-tasks, interaction patterns). Phase 2 will integrate foundational theory in HCI with AI path planning methods to generate a valid sequence of user interactions that achieve a programmatically defined intent. Phase 3 will extend the models from Phase 2 to develop customizable performance testing software that can simulate how people alternate between goal-directed interactions (i.e., following a planned sequence) and open-ended interactions (i.e., exploring alternative analyses). The research team will implement the framework as an open source platform so others can use the findings to evaluate their own systems and data exploration use cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One disconcerting form of disinformation is the manipulation of images/audios/videos to impersonate someone else. Realistic manipulations can be generated by advanced AI technologies in the form of deep neural networks, and commonly known as deepfakes. Deepfakes can be weaponized to cause negative consequences. Although detection methods have demonstrated promising performance on benchmark datasets, they are not adequate and have several limitations. This project aims to combat deepfakes more effectively and beyond detection with active and proactive approaches to root out deepfakes and protect individuals from deepfake attacks. The active and proactive approaches take effect before the deepfake is generated. The active approach does not interfere with the training or generation of deepfake, whereas the proactive approach aims to disrupt these processes to prevent the deepfake. This project work provides timely and needed technologies to mitigate the negative impacts of deepfakes in cyberspace and society at large.<br/><br/>This project includes four main research activities. The first is to strengthen the defense of current deepfake detection methods against anti-forensic attacks. The approach taken here is to use random ensemble models that process input with a randomly chosen member from an infinite ensemble of classification models. The second activity aims to attribute a deepfake to its generation model, i.e., recover the specific means that a deepfake is created. This step is important tracing a deepfake's origin and author. In the third activity, the research effort is focused on the methods that actively add traces to synthesized deepfakes by contaminating the training data.  The fourth activity of this project further studies methods that can obstruct deepfake generation by using data poisoning to sabotage the training process. The poisoned data will lead to reduced efficiency and low-quality deepfakes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, they may evaluate the website?s structure, professionalism, or other design features. However, many of these strategies are not helpful when searching for information when using voice technologies, many of which lack screens and thus don?t present visual credibility cues. Further, older adults, who often use voice technologies to address accessibility challenges posed by vision, motor, and cognitive disabilities, are also often more susceptible to contradictory or uncertain information that characterizes important topics such as healthcare. Combined, these factors place older adults at greater risk of making risky decisions when accessing information online. This project investigates approaches for developing voice technologies that help older adults with credibility assessment, managing uncertain or inconsistent information, and making informed decisions. The work will advance knowledge about how older adults use voice technologies in seeking information online, develop models for non-visual information seeking, and create new ways of interacting with voice assistants and information to reduce these risks. <br/><br/>This project draws upon behavior change research to investigate how to nudge older adults towards better information decisions when using voice technologies. To do so, the research team will engage older adults as community partners, not only in involved in data collection, but also as members of the research team. The research will (1) provide empirical evidence of older adults? information behaviors when using voice interfaces; (2) evaluate a range of choice architecture strategies for voice-based information seeking and decision-making, using findings to inform the design of a framework for non-visual information seeking; (3) implement the design framework through a toolkit of novel audio tools; and (4) deploy these tools, evaluating their effectiveness at mitigating information uncertainty ?in-the-wild? with older adults. The outcomes of the work will advance research in human computer interaction, information retrieval and sensemaking, and aging. Further, as voice interface design is understudied in computing education, this project will also contribute new modules for teaching voice application design to middle and high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A primary question is what factors and mechanisms shape the composition of microbial communities. A related issue is whether and how the structure of microbial communities affects the host. This project addresses these two questions by focusing on how distinct environmental factors, in combination with host genetic variation, shape the composition and functional influence of microbial communities. The work will take advantage of an established, highly accessible plant-fungal symbiosis in Populus, in which leaf endophytes are known to confer disease protection. A complementary educational program will enrich and broaden the research through student-led work investigating seasonal variation in the drivers of endophyte community structure in common gardens and in greenhouse experiments. Overall, this CAREER project will deepen our understanding of how environment and genotype affect endophyte communities and disease protection in plants, while promoting diversity in a STEM field and contributing to conservation and crop production in the face of climate change.<br/><br/>Interactions between plants and their associated microbial communities are known to be sensitive to the environment, but the underlying drivers of this variation are poorly understood. This CAREER project tests mechanistic hypotheses for how plant genotypes interact with distinct, abiotic and biotic components of the environment to give rise to variation in associated microbial communities. This work will be conducted in the cottonwood model system (Populus trichocarpa), in which host genetics, leaf fungi, and distinct environmental factors can be precisely controlled and quantified. The first objective tests how distinct environmental factors and plant genotype jointly influence the composition of fungal leaf endophyte communities. The second objective is to understand how endophyte community structure affects plants, specifically testing the hypothesis that increasing phylogenetic diversity in an endophyte community provides the host plant with a higher degree of disease protection. The third objective connects the prior two objectives by testing how a particular plant trait (the level of cuticular wax) influences endophyte community structure, thereby indirectly affecting disease susceptibility. By elucidating the environmental sensitivity of host control over beneficial fungi, the results of this CAREER project will inform global efforts to conserve plant biodiversity and to sustainably grow crops for a growing human population. The educational components of the project will provide research opportunities to a diverse group of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral scholar.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, exactly how much modern ice sheets will respond to a warming climate is uncertain. During the last glacial maximum, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered a large portion of North America, and as it retreated in response to climate warming, it contributed greatly to sea-level rise. Available data constrain the location of past ice sheet margins and associated timing of ice retreat for the Laurentide Ice Sheet, but less is known about the ice sheet thickness, a key parameter for ice-volume estimates. Furthermore, the processes by which the ice sheets thinned over complex topography remain uncertain with direct implications for modern ice-sheet behavior. This project will gather new data about the timing and rate of ice sheet thinning in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, which, together with existing data, will be incorporated into a high-resolution ice-sheet model capable of resolving ice flow across complex terrain. These new analyses will inform how the surface of the Laurentide Ice Sheet across the Northeast United States thinned during the last deglaciation, how it responded to climate, and the role this ice sheet thinning and retreat played in past sea-level rise. Educational and community outreach associated with the project will include providing in-class and field geology experience and training to community-college students.<br/><br/>This project will gather new geochronological data of surface thinning of the Pleistocene Laurentide Ice Sheet across the Adirondack Mountains of New York. The research will generate cosmogenic surface exposure data that will constrain the timing and spatial variability of Laurentide Ice Sheet thinning after the Last Glacial Maximum for an inland sector of the ice sheet. The data will be paired with a 3-D thermomechanical ice sheet model capable of resolving ice flow at sub-kilometer scales. The simulations will focus on the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent glacial termination and will resolve characteristics of ice thinning, ice flow, and thermal regimes at the spatial scale of the geologic data proposed. The paired data-model analysis addresses key questions of Laurentide Ice Sheet thinning histories, characteristics of ice sheet retreat, and how past climate change influenced the deglaciation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will be performed in collaboration with two Indian institutions, the India Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) and the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD). CUNY students will travel to Mumbai and work with Indian students from these two institutions to collect and analyze micro-scale (neighborhood and block-level) data about air pollution levels using both fixed and mobile sensing equipment. In doing so, they will explore urban patterns and sources of pollution, and fill a gap in data collection that could provide critical findings to inform further research and public policy in India and in urban centers worldwide. CUNY students will work virtually with US and Indian faculty and students to plan routes, calibrate instruments, and become oriented to Indian language, culture, and geography. CUNY students will then travel to India for four weeks of research over the winter (January) intercession, which will include monitoring pollution in Mumbai and a weekend visit to New Delhi to compare pollution findings. Delhi traditionally has high levels of pollution during this period. Upon their return, students will analyze and then present their findings to students, faculty, and staff at CUNY and beyond. The database they create will be used for research and instruction at both CUNY and at IITB and IITD.<br/><br/>The overall project goal is to develop underrepresented students? STEM competencies and research skills through high-quality, collaborative international research experiences to support their retention, college graduation, and persistence in STEM studies. There have been many air pollution studies in Indian cities, but this one will be unique based on the combination of fixed and mobile measurements taken at the micro-scale level. Indian cities are far more polluted than American cities, so students will experience a more data-intensive environment with greater societal impact. Second, the focus on matching demographic data to pollution measures will allow for an assessment of pollution exposure of marginalized populations. Third, weather in the tropics tends to change seasonally rather than daily, greatly simplifying the analysis for student-level science. Until now, pollution and climate data have not been captured at the micro-scale (neighborhood and block) level in urban areas in India. This proposed research will introduce to Mumbai and New Delhi the approach of measuring air pollution on a micro-scale, combining mobile sensors and similar fixed sensors with supporting data from fixed weather stations. Near simultaneous vertical profiles of pollution and climate parameters will also be possible with the use of drones available at BCC that will be transported to India. This will allow researchers to see air pollution gradients and urban heat island structure of the selected neighborhoods, literally block by block. The proposed research will provide better assessment of the process of interpolation of data between fixed sensors in urban environments. The use of LoRAWAN sensors and the Vernier backpack weather stations mobile platform makes it possible to identify point sources of pollutions in the city and to determine the concentration gradient as a function of distance from the source, which can be paired with vertical gradients obtained by the drone flights with the sensors LoRaWAN sensors mounted. This will aid the development and fine-tuning of air quality models already in use to model the city?s air quality. As a coastal city, Mumbai will allow us to observe land and sea breeze influence on air quality on a micro-scale to aid in forecasting pollution alerts. Matching demographic data to pollution observed on fixed routes will allow an assessment of pollution exposure of marginalized populations, particularly in Dharavi, the largest slum in Asia. The project design will allow for the correlation of air pollution data retrieved by satellites to air pollution data collected on a street-by-street and block-by-block levels using mobile sensor platforms. Ground-truthing on such a microscale has not been previously performed in India and may provide a model to extend the application of satellite observations to urban settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, the demand for healthcare resources and societal support are growing substantially. Our society, however, is presently experiencing a shortage of caregivers, and current caregivers are at increased risk for burnout. Project outcomes will allow users with little or no knowledge of coding or engineering to easily customize their robots through a variety of means (e.g., demonstrations) to perform tasks that meet their needs, such as organizing their shoes or cleaning the bathroom.

While much is understood about these beliefs in the social sciences, this project will develop new methods to measure these beliefs at an unprecedented scale, allowing a new understanding of the distribution of racial ideologies and their correlates with place, identity, and network structure.  The long-term research goal is to expand knowledge on how computational methods can be constructively used alongside social theory and large datasets to help address social inequality.

The deployment of AI systems in business settings has thrived due to direct access to consumer data, the capability to implement personalization, and the ability to run algorithms in real-time. For example, advertisements users see are personalized since advertisers are willing to bid more in ad display auctions to reach users with particular demographic features. Pricing decisions on ride-sharing platforms or interest rates on loans are customized to the consumer's characteristics in order to maximize profit. Marketing campaigns on social media platforms target users based on the ability to predict who they will be able to influence in their social network.  Unfortunately, these applications exhibit discrimination.  Discriminatory targeting in housing and job ad auctions, discriminatory pricing for loans and ride-hailing services, and disparate treatment of social network users by marketing campaigns to exclude certain protected groups have been exposed. This project will develop theoretical frameworks and AI algorithms that ensure consumers from protected groups are not harmfully discriminated against in these settings. The new algorithms will facilitate fair conduct of business in these applications. The project also supports conferences that bring together practitioners, policymakers, and academics to discuss the integration of fair AI algorithms into law and practice. <br/><br/>The project develops novel theoretical frameworks to analyze algorithms according to both fairness and business objectives for three canonical business domains: auctions, pricing, and marketing. The approach considers three aspects of the decision-making pipeline. First, the project aims to understand the new types of criteria required to ensure fair auctions, pricing, and marketing, and designs novel algorithms that can incorporate these fairness criteria in real-world large-scale systems. Second, for each of these business contexts, the project considers how data can and should be collected in order to induce fair outcomes in the downstream decision-making task. Thirdly, the project considers how incorporating fairness measures, or failing to do so, can positively or negatively affect firms and consumers in the long-term, particularly in the presence of competition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sea salt aerosol are natural particles suspended in the atmosphere, formed at the ocean surface from breaking waves and bursting bubbles. Despite their small size, they are important in the marine atmosphere as they directly and indirectly impact phenomena including solar radiation and cloud formation. However, due to scientists? incomplete understanding of the sizes and number of particles produced by breaking waves, especially in coastal regions, it is difficult to assess their impacts. This study will use low-cost, 3D-printed instrumentation both for sampling sea salt aerosol, and for observing weather on multiple Pacific islands. Enhanced estimation of the amount of sea salt in the atmosphere and additional real time weather information will improve weather and climate predictions worldwide. Also, using high-quality, low-cost, hand-made instrumentation allows for this work to be accessible and engaging for students in a unique way, highlighting the role of curiosity, problem solving, and hands-on methodology from start to finish.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to investigate the role of the coastal environment in determining the size distribution of sea salt aerosol particles (SSA) measured in-situ within the coastal marine boundary layer. SSAs are especially important due to their role in direct and indirect radiative effects, including aerosol-cloud interactions, providing one of the largest uncertainties in future climate scenarios. It is notoriously difficult to measure large coarse mode SSA (> 3 microns), and as such, few observations of this size range exist. Using portable, low-cost, 3D-printed and Arduino controlled instrumentation, this study will regularly measure coarse mode SSA size distributions under a wide variety of environmental conditions and in multiple locations in order to provide a consistent, quantifiable, and climatological understanding of SSA production in tropical coastal environments. In addition, 3D-Printed Automatic Weather Stations (3D-PAWS) will be built and installed by undergraduate students in area schools on O?ahu and training workshops will be provided on two additional Pacific Islands to jumpstart cyberinfrastructure and build capacity for atmospheric monitoring on remote Pacific islands.

Hydrogen is a critical component of many fuels and chemicals, such that hydrogen demand in the US is projected to increase 2-5 times over the next 30 years. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are a promising technology for large-scale, sustainable production of hydrogen from water, but development of efficient and stable catalysts for water oxidation in acidic conditions has been a longstanding roadblock for widespread implementation. The project will 1) investigate a class of precisely tuned catalyst materials that are designed to withstand the harsh oxidative and acidic conditions of PEM electrolyzers with minimal use of expensive and strategic precious metals, and 2) characterize critical relationships between catalyst structures and reaction mechanisms, as related to reaction rates and efficient utilization of electrical energy. The scientific outcomes of this work will lead to improved technological feasibility of sustainable processes for production of fuels and chemicals from renewable electricity sources. Furthermore, the research will be integrated with a sustainable plan for collaborative development and implementation of new curriculum and classroom activities that emphasize student engagement to improve retention of students from diverse backgrounds and fulfill Next Generation Science Standards, via work with Chicago Public High School teachers.<br/><br/>This project focuses on water oxidation in acidic conditions as a critical, yet comparatively simple, electrochemical oxidation reaction for fundamental study of reaction mechanisms, surface structure evolution, and deactivation processes for perovskite oxide catalysts as a function of their electronic and geometric structure properties. Perovskite oxide structures provide a tunable platform for systematically modulating properties of catalysts both at the surface and in the bulk, while utilizing lower loadings of iridium compared to IrO2 and Ir/C benchmark catalysts. In situ spectroscopy and kinetic isotope studies will probe trends in reaction mechanisms and assess extent of catalyst surface reorganization with relation to material properties (oxidation states, metal-oxygen bond covalency, metal-oxygen-metal bond angle, etc.) and reaction conditions. Microscopy, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, and impedance spectroscopy will monitor morphology, mass changes, and charge transport effects as a result of long-term testing to provide insights to various deactivation processes. This work will also establish intrinsic catalyst material stability metrics to complement more ubiquitous performance stability metrics to guide development of high performance electrocatalytic systems.

This effort will provide an unprecedented characterization of cloud chemical processing that is expected to help reduce a major uncertainty in climate model predictions.<br/><br/>This project adds advanced chemical characterization of clouds to EPCAPE by leveraging recent instrument developments of single-particle mass spectrometry techniques, miniaturized static thermal gradient cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) instruments, and a custom-designed instrument for measuring aqueous hydroxyl (OH) radicals formed in nascent cloud droplets (the OH ""burst""). The sampling strategy enables testing of the following hypotheses: (1) The subset of the aerosol population that is activated to cloud droplets is chemically distinct from the unactivated particles, and its size-resolved chemical composition is further differentiated by adding aqueous-oxidized components that can be identified in single-particle mass fragments. The chemical changes lower the activation supersaturation required for subsequent activation of particles, which in turn may affect cloud structure and drop distributions. (2) Gas-phase compounds that are removed by denuding will lower the supersaturation required for activation of each particle by enhancing water solubility during the uptake process. The effect is expected to depend on the amount of pollution influence, on the composition and concentration of gaseous species, and on particle size. (3) Particles with longer times between cloud cycles will produce a larger OH burst, and as a result, larger changes to particle chemical composition during cloud cycling.

Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria and fungi evolve to stop responding to antibiotics and to continue to grow. Each year in the US alone, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or fungi cause infection in more than 2.8 million people and more than 35,000 deaths. Developing alternatives to traditional antibiotics is critical for addressing this global challenge. This collaborative project supports fundamental research to develop a new type of antimicrobial nanoparticle to combat  antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These nanoparticles are unique in that they display a non-uniform coating of hydrophobic and positively charged molecules. Such nanoparticles are expected to act through novel antibiotic mechanisms that are less likely to cause acquired drug resistance in bacteria. The research team will combine experiments with computational modeling to elucidate how interactions of these nanoparticles with bacteria depend on the non-uniform surface chemistry of nanoparticles and the cell wall chemistry of bacteria. The mechanistic understanding from this study will guide the rational design of antimicrobial nanoparticles against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria. By integrating nanoscience research with educational and outreach activities this collaborative project outlines interdisciplinary approaches to promote critical thinking and increase diversity in STEM. These approaches include the development of introductory undergraduate courses that integrate science teaching with art, a collaborative outreach project to K-12 students in rural areas, and training of the next generation of researchers, especially underrepresented minority groups. <br/><br/>Developing broad-spectrum antimicrobial nanoparticles is challenging because a single nanoparticle design cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution effective against all bacteria.

Specifically, experiments will be combined with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate interactions of amphiphilic nanoparticles with model bacterial membranes and a diverse selection of Gram-negative bacterial strains, many of which are resistant to most available antibiotics. The expected results will establish the structure-activity relationship governing the antimicrobial mechanisms of the amphiphilic nanoparticles.

However, exactly how much modern ice sheets will respond to a warming climate is uncertain. During the last glacial maximum, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered a large portion of North America, and as it retreated in response to climate warming, it contributed greatly to sea-level rise. Available data constrain the location of past ice sheet margins and associated timing of ice retreat for the Laurentide Ice Sheet, but less is known about the ice sheet thickness, a key parameter for ice-volume estimates. Furthermore, the processes by which the ice sheets thinned over complex topography remain uncertain with direct implications for modern ice-sheet behavior. This project will gather new data about the timing and rate of ice sheet thinning in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, which, together with existing data, will be incorporated into a high-resolution ice-sheet model capable of resolving ice flow across complex terrain. These new analyses will inform how the surface of the Laurentide Ice Sheet across the Northeast United States thinned during the last deglaciation, how it responded to climate, and the role this ice sheet thinning and retreat played in past sea-level rise. Educational and community outreach associated with the project will include providing in-class and field geology experience and training to community-college students.<br/><br/>This project will gather new geochronological data of surface thinning of the Pleistocene Laurentide Ice Sheet across the Adirondack Mountains of New York. The research will generate cosmogenic surface exposure data that will constrain the timing and spatial variability of Laurentide Ice Sheet thinning after the Last Glacial Maximum for an inland sector of the ice sheet. The data will be paired with a 3-D thermomechanical ice sheet model capable of resolving ice flow at sub-kilometer scales. The simulations will focus on the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent glacial termination and will resolve characteristics of ice thinning, ice flow, and thermal regimes at the spatial scale of the geologic data proposed.

The project will be performed in collaboration with two Indian institutions, the India Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) and the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD). CUNY students will travel to Mumbai and work with Indian students from these two institutions to collect and analyze micro-scale (neighborhood and block-level) data about air pollution levels using both fixed and mobile sensing equipment. In doing so, they will explore urban patterns and sources of pollution, and fill a gap in data collection that could provide critical findings to inform further research and public policy in India and in urban centers worldwide. CUNY students will work virtually with U.S. and Indian faculty and students to plan routes, calibrate instruments, and become oriented to Indian language, culture, and geography. CUNY students will then travel to India for four weeks of research over the winter (January) intercession, which will include monitoring pollution in Mumbai and a weekend visit to New Delhi to compare pollution findings. Delhi traditionally has high levels of pollution during this period. Upon their return, students will analyze and then present their findings to students, faculty, and staff at CUNY and beyond. The database they create will be used for research and instruction at both CUNY and at IITB and IITD.<br/><br/>The overall project goal is to develop underrepresented students? STEM competencies and research skills through high-quality, collaborative international research experiences to support their retention, college graduation, and persistence in STEM studies. There have been many air pollution studies in Indian cities, but this one will be unique based on the combination of fixed and mobile measurements taken at the micro-scale level. Indian cities are far more polluted than American cities, so students will experience a more data-intensive environment with greater societal impact. Second, the focus on matching demographic data to pollution measures will allow for an assessment of pollution exposure of marginalized populations. Third, weather in the tropics tends to change seasonally rather than daily, greatly simplifying the analysis for student-level science. Until now, pollution and climate data have not been captured at the micro-scale (neighborhood and block) level in urban areas in India. This proposed research will introduce to Mumbai and New Delhi the approach of measuring air pollution on a micro-scale, combining mobile sensors and similar fixed sensors with supporting data from fixed weather stations. Near simultaneous vertical profiles of pollution and climate parameters will also be possible with the use of drones available at BCC that will be transported to India. This will allow researchers to see air pollution gradients and urban heat island structure of the selected neighborhoods, literally block by block. The proposed research will provide better assessment of the process of interpolation of data between fixed sensors in urban environments. The use of LoRAWAN sensors and the Vernier backpack weather stations mobile platform makes it possible to identify point sources of pollutions in the city and to determine the concentration gradient as a function of distance from the source, which can be paired with vertical gradients obtained by the drone flights with the sensors LoRaWAN sensors mounted. This will aid the development and fine-tuning of air quality models already in use to model the city?s air quality. As a coastal city, Mumbai will allow us to observe land and sea breeze influence on air quality on a micro-scale to aid in forecasting pollution alerts. Matching demographic data to pollution observed on fixed routes will allow an assessment of pollution exposure of marginalized populations, particularly in Dharavi, the largest slum in Asia. The project design will allow for the correlation of air pollution data retrieved by satellites to air pollution data collected on a street-by-street and block-by-block levels using mobile sensor platforms. Ground-truthing on such a microscale has not been previously performed in India and may provide a model to extend the application of satellite observations to urban settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the planet?s biodiversity has been generated through adaptive radiation, a process in which a group of organisms diversifies into many new species with different ecological roles. However, we lack a thorough understanding of the genomic changes underlying these events, particularly in marine ecosystems where there are no obvious barriers to migration. Rockfishes in the genus Sebastes are a highly diverse (>110 species) group of fishes that live across a range of depths and habitats, making them an excellent model for studying the dynamics of diversification. This CAREER project will advance our understanding of how species diversify by examining the genomic processes underlying speciation in rockfishes, as well as the accompanying shifts in habitat, body shape, size and color among sister species. This research program is integrated with educational activities, including undergraduate research opportunities and teacher training, with the goal of contributing to a strong and diverse workforce in science and engineering. <br/><br/>This study will combine genomic data with information on phenotypic diversity, ecology and biogeography to develop a holistic understanding of the dynamics of diversification in this extraordinarily species-rich genus.

In the second aim, whole genome sequencing will be used to infer likely divergence scenarios among sympatric species pairs, characterize patterns of genomic differentiation, and reconstruct demographic histories of lineages in the context of speciation events and oceanographic data. The third aim will examine the correspondence between genomic and ecomorphological divergence by assessing overlap between sister species across a suite of habitat factors and quantitative phenotypic characters. These research aims will be integrated with educational objectives via the development of a scaffolded set of classroom-based undergraduate research experiences, and the creation of a learning and mentoring community focused around biodiversity and evolutionary genetics.

Automated driving technologies are expected to improve traffic safety, promote travel efficiency, protect the environment, reduce mobility barriers for older generations or people with disabilities, and thus deliver overall societal benefits. However, existing algorithms embedded in autonomous vehicles still face fundamental challenges in recognizing the quickly changing intentions of pedestrians moving on the road and sidewalks, making it hard to predict their behavior and plan vehicle motions. Such limitations impede the implementation of fully autonomous and safe cars in city environments and create additional risks for pedestrians and other road users. This project focuses on developing novel techniques to model and predict the complex and changing intentions of pedestrians. By learning the thinking process of drivers and their driving responses, an algorithm will be created to equip the automated cars with similar capabilities to interact with pedestrians and other road users smoothly and safely. The research process will include naturalistic driving data collection, subject experiments, knowledge modeling, and learning algorithm development. The developed algorithm will be evaluated in an immersive virtual environment. The project also includes activities to promote user-centered design in engineering education, foster the awareness of biases and ethical issues related to artificial intelligence technologies, and increase the participation of underrepresented communities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. <br/><br/>This project surmounts limitations of current pedestrian behavior prediction to achieving mutual intelligibility between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Principally, unlike the traditional static view of pedestrian intention at a critical moment, this research investigates the relationship between non-verbal actions and intention changes of pedestrians moment-to-moment in dynamic (changing) and interactive situations. The project collects temporal video segments and human reasoning descriptions simultaneously through event-segmentation-based video experiments. Then, it develops a compositional learning method to learn and combine language features with visual features. This method can avoid the rigid structure of expert-selected feature space by creating collective features from ordinary drivers, and the three-level explainability of the learning model can justify model outputs from input features. Finally, the developed intention prediction model will be evaluated through subject experiments in a virtual interactive pedestrian simulator. The research findings will be shared through industrial collaborators and conferences, and a pedestrian behavior benchmark dataset will be disseminated to the public. The research results will be included in engineering education to promote design approaches that take into account the users? feelings, values, and overall mental state (empathic design).

The conventional way of growing most of the world?s crops is to apply reduced forms of nitrogen as fertilizer. Although it promotes crop yields, much of the fertilizer leaches out into groundwater, streams, and oceans, causing severe ecological disturbances, including overgrowth of plant life, oxygen depletion, and death of animal life. Due to overuse, more than 500 sites of coastal waters worldwide are now declared ?dead zones?. A group of soil bacteria collectively known as rhizobia can reduce (fix) nitrogen. Legumes establish mutually beneficial associations (symbioses) with compatible rhizobia, by allowing their selective entry into newly developed organs (root nodules), thus acquiring an internal source of fertilizer. Nitrogen fixation efficiency varies in different legume-rhizobia associations; therefore, for high yields, fertilizer nitrogen needs to be applied on legume crops. This shuts down symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF). The project seeks to uncover new mechanisms of host-strain specificity to improve SNF efficiency, informing the development of crop varieties and engineered bacterial strains that can enhance the economic potential of SNF for low-input, sustainable agriculture. Research activities from this project will be integrated into an inquiry- and project-based revamped graduate course-lab, and into various educational activities including training of undergraduate and graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and middle- and high school students. <br/> <br/>An intriguing aspect of SNF is host-strain specificity, critical for efficient nitrogen fixation, but, still, poorly understood at the genetic and the molecular level. Because the rhizosphere contains multiple rhizobial strains at any time, it is critical for a legume host to distinguish between friend and foe, and, also, to distinguish between efficient and less efficient friends, for optimal nitrogen fixation. The proposed research builds on the hypothesis that the Medicago truncatula MtNPD1 gene (nodule-specific polycystin-1, lipoxygenase, alpha-toxin domain-containing protein) orchestrates rhizobial selection in order to maintain effective nitrogen fixation in root nodules. The host-strain specific phenotype of the npd1 mutant implies that MtNPD1 may be interacting with certain bacterial factors to promote survival and normal function of compatible strains inside root nodules. An assortment of molecular, genetic, proteomic, genomic, and microscopic approaches will be used to decipher the biological roles of MtNPD1 and the other four members of this nodule-specific gene family. The main goals of the project are to identify plant and/or bacterial protein partners of MtNPD1, refine intracellular MtNPD1 localization in a strain-dependent manner, and identify bacterial factors linked to the NPD1 gene function and host-strain specificity using pan-genome analysis and genomic library switching between strains with contrasting fate in npd1 nodules. Altogether, the proposed work is poised to enhance our understanding of how M. truncatula selects favorable symbiotic partners, thus optimizing SNF with specific rhizobial strains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The bolstered connections improve the effectiveness of dynamic pricing, marketing campaigns, and large-scale behavioral change on digital platforms. On crowdsourced review platforms such as Yelp and Google Review, publicly ratings and reviews reduce consumer information search friction; on E-commerce retailers such as Amazon and Alibaba, information about products strengthens consumers' trust in the products. Integrating machine learning methods and rich behavioral data improve consumers' experience, accrues revenues, and guides manufacturers' and retailers' pricing strategies. Even though connections among individuals are powerful in a wide range of applications: it is not always available for various reasons: (1) network data is costly to collect; (2) network data may be too sensitive and confidential to share; (3) network data is dynamic and static data's accuracy may decay over time. In the meantime, strengthened social interaction and data integration pose privacy risks, leading to data security issues at a systematic level.<br/><br/>This project lays the groundwork for learning social network structures based on large-scale behavioral data. Two inversely-related issues motivate this research: 1) How to design network interventions to leverage social externality when structural data is unavailable? 2) Does publicly available behavioral data pose social privacy risk in leaking social network information? This project studies the general and fundamental problem of learning the network structures and approximating utility functions based on observed decisions. This project first analyzes this network learning problem's fundamental and conditional identifiability by imposing a linear-quadratic network game structure in a network of strategic decision-makers. It will extend this linear-quadratic game to a broader class of network games. This project further develops a generative deep learning framework to approximate human decision-making processes on social networks. Finally, the researchers will demonstrate the practical value of this research by applying the theory and approach to network intervention (e.g., information diffusion and influence maximization) and privacy risk evaluations (e.g., shadow profiling and social attack) using three large-scale digital behavioral data and two small-scale experimental data. This interdisciplinary project builds upon and contributes to game theory, machine learning, network science, and management science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This effort will provide an unprecedented characterization of cloud chemical processing that is expected to help reduce a major uncertainty in climate model predictions.<br/><br/>This project adds advanced chemical characterization of clouds to EPCAPE by leveraging recent instrument developments of single-particle mass spectrometry techniques, miniaturized static thermal gradient cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) instruments, and a custom-designed instrument for measuring aqueous hydroxyl (OH) radicals formed in nascent cloud droplets (the OH ""burst""). The sampling strategy enables testing of the following hypotheses: (1) The subset of the aerosol population that is activated to cloud droplets is chemically distinct from the unactivated particles, and its size-resolved chemical composition is further differentiated by adding aqueous-oxidized components that can be identified in single-particle mass fragments. The chemical changes lower the activation supersaturation required for subsequent activation of particles, which in turn may affect cloud structure and drop distributions. (2) Gas-phase compounds that are removed by denuding will lower the supersaturation required for activation of each particle by enhancing water solubility during the uptake process. The effect is expected to depend on the amount of pollution influence, on the composition and concentration of gaseous species, and on particle size. (3) Particles with longer times between cloud cycles will produce a larger OH burst, and as a result, larger changes to particle chemical composition during cloud cycling. The OH burst activity, together with the availability of gas phase species will explain much of the variation in the chemical changes observed between cloud events.<br/><br/>This effort includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students in instrument maintenance and measurement analyses to prepare the next generation of scientists for conducting atmospheric research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Equally important and relevant is the rate at which this warming occurs - how fast is the warming? The rate of warming fluctuates in space and time. Acceleration in the rate of warming is of primary concern since it might trigger climate change feedbacks. Furthermore, acceleration in the rate of warming can leave less time for species to adapt in the future, threaten biodiversity and ecosystem function, and impact communities? ability to adapt and survive. The investigator will conduct statistical analysis of global climate observations to identify coherent regions and periods with accelerated rates of warming over the last two centuries. The investigator will then use model simulations to identify the causes of the detected changes (human, natural, or random) and to quantify future changes in the rate of warming through the end of this century.

Because this process makes use of expensive rare-metal catalysts and requires corrosive chemical agents to promote the desired reactions, the result is stringent and costly reactor designs, complex catalyst recycling schemes, and environmentally unfriendly waste streams. This project aims to discover effective porous solid-acid catalysts as a technologically and environmentally appealing alternative. Designing an optimal solid acid, however, is a challenging task, as there are hundreds of potential structures to choose from, each with unique, molecular-scale cavities that can stabilize or prevent different reactions. This project will develop computer models that allow us to make accurate predictions of which chemical reactions will take place, enabling a computationally efficient approach to catalyst design. These developments will positively impact manufacturing processes based on carbonylation chemistry, and also many other large-scale industrial processes that create the chemical products for our modern society. The research efforts are closely integrated with educational and outreach activities to serve our overarching goals of improving computational competency in the training of the next-generation workforce and promoting diversity and broadening participation of underrepresented students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Recent experimental work has demonstrated that nanoporous zeolites with 8-membered rings can potentially catalyze the carbonylation reaction with high selectivity, providing a compelling alternative to traditional rare metal-based catalyst systems. Despite the tantalizing potential, fundamentally important questions remain, including: What are the structural motifs that will make possible effective carbonylation of small methoxy groups versus larger carbocations in different zeolite architectures? How can acid-catalyzed side reactions be controlled by selectively suppressing undesired reactions? What are the mechanisms that determine the function of promoters and poisoners in these nanoporous solid acids? This research program will address these questions by developing and applying computational tools that integrate quantum chemical and forcefield-based molecular-scale simulations. The project will generate fundamental insights into confinement effects in nanoporous catalysts and will make possible the rational design of catalysts that target reactions selectively. A successful outcome may not only lead to industrially feasible, environmentally friendly solid acids for the synthesis of ethanol and acetic acid, but also provide general strategies for using solid acids in other organic syntheses and for controlling side reactions in many existing, large-scale solid acid catalytic processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Individuals with episodic amnesia, that is, amnesia for vivid personal past experiences, are modeled in both science and the popular media as trapped in time. This core metaphor shapes our understanding both of what episodic memory is (mental time travel) and of its role in our lives as people (anchoring us in time). Amnesia is seen accordingly as a pathology affecting an individual?s entire subjective temporality, one that undermines their decisions about the future and scuttles all possibility of autonomous living.  Our work shows that  amnesic individuals are not trapped in time; they are capable of more as moral and practical agents than the trapped-in-time model would lead one to predict.  <br/><br/>We study temporal cognition in individuals with episodic amnesia to learn how episodic memory is involved in cognition about time. Do individuals with amnesia develop and maintain concepts of the  past, present, and future? Do they understand time?s irreversible order or that events can be sequenced earlier to later? Do they care about the difference between the future and the past? Do they discount the value of future rewards, make impulsive choices, or exhibit presentist bias in their practical and moral decisions? Research in our and other labs increasingly reveals that individuals with amnesia are not trapped in time but understand time and its implications well. These findings are transformative for humanists interested in the value of memory in human life, philosophers interested in the source of our knowledge of time,  scientists struggling to understand what memory is and how it contributes to our lives as persons, and, finally, to clinicians trying to help people with memory loss live fuller human lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria and fungi evolve to stop responding to antibiotics and to continue to grow. Each year in the US alone, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or fungi cause infection in more than 2.8 million people and more than 35,000 deaths. Developing alternatives to traditional antibiotics is critical for addressing this global challenge. This collaborative project supports fundamental research to develop a new type of antimicrobial nanoparticle to combat  antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These nanoparticles are unique in that they display a non-uniform coating of hydrophobic and positively charged molecules. Such nanoparticles are expected to act through novel antibiotic mechanisms that are less likely to cause acquired drug resistance in bacteria. The research team will combine experiments with computational modeling to elucidate how interactions of these nanoparticles with bacteria depend on the non-uniform surface chemistry of nanoparticles and the cell wall chemistry of bacteria. The mechanistic understanding from this study will guide the rational design of antimicrobial nanoparticles against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria. By integrating nanoscience research with educational and outreach activities this collaborative project outlines interdisciplinary approaches to promote critical thinking and increase diversity in STEM. These approaches include the development of introductory undergraduate courses that integrate science teaching with art, a collaborative outreach project to K-12 students in rural areas, and training of the next generation of researchers, especially underrepresented minority groups. <br/><br/>Developing broad-spectrum antimicrobial nanoparticles is challenging because a single nanoparticle design cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution effective against all bacteria. Instead, nanoparticles whose antimicrobial activity can be tuned to match the bacterial diversity are needed. This collaborative project is focused on developing a new strategy to tune nanoparticle-bacteria interactions by using the anisotropic organization of ligands on nanoparticles. Specifically, experiments will be combined with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate interactions of amphiphilic nanoparticles with model bacterial membranes and a diverse selection of Gram-negative bacterial strains, many of which are resistant to most available antibiotics. The expected results will establish the structure-activity relationship governing the antimicrobial mechanisms of the amphiphilic nanoparticles. Such new understanding will enable the development and optimization of antimicrobial nanoparticles that are potentially more potent than existing ones and whose effects are tunable. The educational and outreach goal of this project is to develop interdisciplinary approaches to promote critical thinking and increase diversity in STEM. These approaches include innovation of introductory undergraduate courses by integrating art with science teaching, a collaborative outreach project to K-12 students in rural areas, and training of next generation of researchers with a particular emphasis on the involvement of underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As they respond to disturbance, algae alter their surrounding environment through fluctuations in their growth, the processing of carbon and nutrients, and biotic interactions. This makes algae important mediators of lake ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycles and gas exchange. In the past, the regular seasonality of lake ecosystem processes made it possible to predict the composition of algal communities and the traits that influence lake ecosystem function. Lake ecosystems, however, are changing rapidly in response to multiple interacting environmental change disturbances, making previously predictable seasonal processes such as ice cover, evaporation, and run-off increasingly uncertain and chaotic. This project will identify algal traits that confer persistence across a gradient of disturbance intensity over short and long timescales. This project seeks to understand how algal communities form and influence ecosystem function, not as a disruption to expected stable conditions, but as a fluctuating, dynamic process. As  part of this CAREER proposal, the research will be integrated into undergraduate curriculum and will train undergraduates, a graduate student, and a postdoctoral researcher using collaborative team science approaches. Through a partnership with lake managers and professional workshops, findings will be communicated with stakeholders and translated into management action. <br/><br/>This CAREER award aims to describe a disturbance phenology framework for phytoplankton community assembly that is scalable across space and time in order to predict feedbacks and threshold shifts for lake ecosystem function. First, the project will seek to understand the heterogeneity of algal responses to stressors across nearshore benthic and open water pelagic vertical zones to better predict ecosystem scale response to stochastic events. Across lake zones, synchronous fluctuations of phytoplankton communities are expected to amplify and destabilize ecosystem function, measured as lake metabolism, carbon dioxide, and methane flux. Second, the project will investigate phytoplankton traits that confer persistence across time scales, and will test the hypothesis that traits which confer persistence in response to short term, stochastic disturbance such as dormancy or alternative metabolic strategies will be recruited to communities over multi-decadal time scales. Hypotheses will be tested across scales in laboratory microcosms, outdoor mesocosms, and using modern and paleolimnological approaches across a trophic gradient in five lakes. Experimental mesocosms, high-frequency sensor arrays, and microscopy facilities will be integrated into undergraduate limnology, phycology, and ecosystem ecology curriculum aimed at training students in team science, experimental design, and ecological theory. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Population and Community Ecology Cluster and Ecosystem Science Clusters in the Division of Environmental Biology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, systems that rely on traditional statistics and prediction from historical or human-curated data also naturally inherit any past biased or discriminative tendencies. The overarching goal of the award is to mitigate this problem by using information representations that maintain its utility while eliminating information that could lead to discrimination against subgroups in a population. Specifically, this project will study the different trade-offs between utility and fairness of different data representations, and then identify solutions to reduce the gap to the best trade-off. Then, new representations and corresponding algorithms will be developed guided by such trade-off analysis. The investigators will provide performance limits based on the developed theory, and also evidence of efficacy in order to obtain fair machine learning systems and to gain societal trust. The application domain used in this research is face recognition systems.The undergraduate and graduate students who participate in the project will be trained to conduct cutting-edge research to integrate fairness into artificial intelligent based systems.<br/><br/>The research agenda of this project is centered around answering two questions on learning fair representations, (i) What are the fundamental trade-offs between utility and fairness of data representations?, (ii) How to devise practical fair representation learning algorithms that can mitigate bias in machine learning systems and provably achieve the theoretical utility-fairness trade-offs? To answer the first question, the project will theoretically elucidate and empirically quantify the different trade-offs inherent to utility. This will be done consideringdifferent fairness definitions such as demographic parity, equalized odds, and equality of opportunity. To answer the second question, the project will develop representation learning algorithms that (a) are analytically tractable and provably fair, (b) mitigate worst-case bias, as opposed to average bias over instances or demographic groups, (c) are fair with respect to demographic information that is only partially known or fully unknown, and (d) mitigate demographic bias both due to an imbalance in samples as well as features through optimal data sampling and projection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach developed can potentially be integrated with other existing biomanufacturing approaches to fabricate new tissues by providing gel-coated cells with locally defined properties as building blocks. The educational program will provide both high school teachers and students from diverse backgrounds with opportunities to be engaged in hands-on research activities that integrate multiple fields in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). This integrated effort is designed to promote early exposure to multidisciplinary thinking and learning processes that are critical to solve challenging problems in biological systems.<br/><br/>The investigator's career goal is to achieve a paradigm shift by showing that microgels can be designed as instructive cues to precisely understand and control single stem cell functions.  Toward this goal, this CAREER project is based on the central premise that building instructive niches that recapitulate physiologically relevant extracellular matrix properties around single cells offers a unique direction that will enable investigations into how microenvironments regulate stem cell functions at an unprecedented resolution. To confirm this premise, the project will investigate how three-dimensional microenvironments can be designed to precisely direct fundamental processes that are essential for cell fate decision, including cell growth, symmetry breaking, asymmetric division and differentiation at the single cell level. Multidisciplinary approaches will be employed to pursue this project, including biomaterial design, droplet microfluidics, biophysical methods, mathematical modeling, imaging and genetic engineering. The research will yield a library of designed microenvironment models that can be used to recapitulate and control specific biological processes of cell fate decision in a deterministic manner. A greater understanding of cell fate decision enabled by the tools developed in this research will aid in endeavors to develop effective stem cell-based therapies and biomanufacturing approaches for tissue regeneration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such small creatures must adopt a different strategy for efficient swimming. Many of them propel themselves in the fluid by wiggling micro-structures such as cilia and flagella. The remarkable efficiency of microorganisms at moving and navigating through a surrounding fluid has inspired recent construction of microfluidic devices for mixing and transport, and micro-machines for drug delivery and manipulation of cells. Since theoretical analyses and experimentation are challenging in this setting, mathematical modeling and numerical simulation have become indispensable in these developments. This project aims to create improved computational and visualization tools for advancing understanding of the motility of microorganisms and our capability to harness this process. The project will develop an interactive three-dimensional visual computing system to serve as (1) a research tool for studying the hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms, (2) an engineering tool for testing and improving the design of artificial, bio-inspired micro-swimmers, and (3) an educational tool for introducing students of all levels to this field.

The project includes plans to develop virtual reality games based on microswimmers to be exhibited at the Museum of Science & Technology as well as public libraries. <br/><br/>Research objectives in this project include the development of an efficient, multigrid-like method for manipulating the large, dense matrices arising from the simulation of interacting micro-swimmers, a data-driven, reduced order model for tracking fluid particles, an efficient numerical method for optimizing the design of bio-inspired swimmers given a task, and a three-dimensional interactive visual computing system for real-time fluid visualization and manipulation. Multigrid methods exploit the geometry of the swimmers and are therefore expected to be more efficient than current numerical approaches. An artificial neural network will be leveraged as a data-driven, reduced order model for the change in a fluid particle?s position. This approach is intended to simulate a fluid particle's trajectory very efficiently, since it does not require calculating fluid-structure interactions, an important aspect in real-time and/or multi-query scenarios. The planned numerical optimization method takes advantage of both the reliability of a genetic algorithm at finding global optima and the efficiency of a gradient-based method when a good initial guess is given. The interactive visual computing system is intended to serve as a virtual laboratory for analysis of the effects of parameter changes.

C in the atmosphere is produced through burning fossil fuels and also as a byproduct of decomposition of plant matter by microorganisms in soil. As a result, soil C is directly connected to that in the atmosphere. Earth system models (computer simulations) struggle to predict whether soil C will increase or decrease over the next 100 years. Some simulations predict huge increases in soil C, leading researchers to hope that soils will help to mitigate continued CO2 emissions. By contrast, other simulations predict that soils will release more C, leading to a feedback loop that will cause atmospheric C to increase even if CO2 emissions are greatly reduced. Research in this NSF CAREER project will improve predictive understanding of the C cycle and global warming by adding details to the simulations about how C moves through soil, as well as by pulling together more data to help calibrate and validate simulations. The project will also develop and promote a useful terminology to more accurately describe the detailed processes to be modeled in computer simulations, as well as provide research training for graduate and undergraduate students.   <br/><br/>This project will expand predictive understanding of soil C dynamics by connecting traditional soil C models to a process-rich understanding via a new multi-scale modeling framework. Traditional soil C models divide soil C into pools; C then leaves a pool at a rate proportional to the C in that pool. While this captures the observed dynamics in incubation studies, the parameterization remains difficult to predict, a priori, for a given soil type, relying on soil organic C stocks and incubated respiration rates for both parameterization and validation. By representing processes like microbial dynamics and mineral-organic interactions more explicitly in non-linear models, and linking these process-explicit models to the traditional linear soil C models via numerical experiments and mathematical analysis, this work will be able to incorporate non-traditional measurements to inform traditional model parameterizations. In this project, soil measurements will be interconnected from primary open data archives in repositories and held by U.S. government agencies to support an expanded predictive understanding of soil carbon dynamics. This project will also spearhead development of shared language (ontology) with a democratized governance structure via data-centered communities of practice linking researchers across soil projects internationally.

The dynamics and mechanics of near-interface polymers can have strong implications for the design and performance of various nanostructured polymeric materials, polymer nanocomposites, thin polymer films, and functional interfaces which have numerous applications in areas such as energy, environmental, healthcare, infrastructure, and sustainability. For instance, thin polymer film design plays an essential role in the multi-billion dollar semiconductor industry. In many instances, the polymers at the nanometer vicinity of interfaces can exhibit large spatial variations (sometimes orders of magnitude) in elastic moduli, viscosity, and diffusion coefficient. A fundamental issue that this project will address is the molecular mechanisms responsible for these large variations and the spatial dependence of the near-interface polymer dynamics. By improving our understanding of these microscopic effects, this project will allow for the rational design of polymers at the interface. This project will also offer training for graduate students with multiple characterization tools, including spectroscopy, rheology, and small-angle scattering, and will provide opportunities for them to use national user facilities and build a network of professional contacts. Furthermore, the project expands research participation by engaging undergraduate students, with recruiting emphasis on students from underrepresented groups through the Lansing School District (74% population are African American) and the Lansing Community College/Michigan State University 2+2+2 Engineering Program. An educational program on polymers at the interfaces will also be implemented at the graduate level. A K-12 outreach-activities module will be created and delivered through MSU K-12 high-school summer camp to improve public understanding of polymers and polymers at the interface.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project aims to elucidate the dynamics gradients of near-interface polymers and their dependence on polymer chemistry and nanoconfinement. Polymers at the interface can exhibit profound alterations in dynamics and mechanical properties compared with the bulk. These changes can involve large shifts (> 50 K) in glass transition that correspond to six to eight decades of change in structural relaxation time. However, deficiencies in the quantification of gradients of interfacial dynamics impose grand challenges and obfuscate the understanding of interfacial dynamics and their connection with the bulk glass transition. A comprehensive experimental program will quantify the dynamics gradients at the interface through a combination of dielectric spectroscopy, rheology, and small-angle scattering. A new dielectric marker system will be developed with their precise placement at the interface to quantify the dynamics of the near-interface polymer at ~ 1 nm spatial resolution.

The project will assess the role of river discharge, tides and winds in the formation and maintenance of the buoyant plumes throughout the continental shelf. For such assessment, the project will use shipboard measurements, Autonomous Surface Vehicles, Autonomous flying vehicles (drones), and a floating platform that will be complemented by computer model simulations. The project will provide approximations of the linkage between land and open-ocean processes to be used in global-scale models. The project will also facilitate interactions between a research intensive university and an undergraduate college. It will train graduate students and provide valuable experiences to undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>This study concentrates on the dynamics of supercritical coastal buoyant plumes that expand obliquely across the shelf. These buoyant plumes transport low salinity waters across the continental shelf and can be entrained by ocean currents flowing by the shelf?s edge. The buoyant plumes are influenced by the balance between wind stress (upwelling-favorable) and buoyancy forcing. Tidal pulses of brackish water interfere with such dynamic balance to produce radial fronts referred to as sub-plumes. These sub-plumes are subsequently advected by Ekman transport. Data collection will consist of 4 seasonal surveys of Winyah Bay plume using ships (UNOLS ship requested), drones, Autonomous Surface Vehicles, and a floating platform to obtain profiles of water velocity, salinity, temperature, and turbulence properties. The sub-plume fronts shall be ubiquitous as long as the horizontal density gradient is prominent and the inertial period is greater than the tidal period. Observations will be complemented by numerical simulations with a non-hydrostatic numerical model. As Broader Impacts, the study will allow parametrization of cross-shelf plumes into lower resolution models that study land-ocean exchanges. The project will support 2 MS and 1 PhD students, and offer cruise opportunities to several undergraduate students. Data collected and their analysis will produce Ocean Data Analysis modules to be distributed to the oceanographic community.

The current era of geospatial big data combined with advancements in data science is enabling public and private organizations to gain new insights and build new capabilities. Various agencies and scientific communities rely on spatial data management and analysis to gain insights and produce actionable plans. This project will design efficient algorithms for spatial data analytics that can serve as a crucial tool for solving a wide set of research problems from different scientific areas. The algorithms and implementations will leverage high performance computing (HPC) to speedup compute and data intensive workloads in domains that employ spatial data. The computational geometry algorithms chosen are broadly applicable in various domains that make use of spatial data, including sociology, epidemiology, pathology, climate science, solar physics, etc. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained to carry out high performance computing research. Educational materials relevant to the research agenda will be developed and disseminated through educational workshops in the parallel computing and spatial computing domains.<br/><br/>Most of the existing work in the literature for geospatial analytics is limited to exploiting basic thread-level and data parallelism. Existing work on I/O efficient algorithms are mostly based on shared memory parallelism and data on disk. Data  movement due to communication among processors is a dominant cost incurred by an application running on a high performance computing (HPC) system. We propose communication efficient designs for geospatial analytics on heterogeneous platforms. A second area of research is topology aware designs for spatial computing systems that can seamlessly leverage Data Processing Units (DPUs). A DPU is a new class of coprocessor that evolved as a successor to programmable smart network interface cards.  This project will develop distributed memory parallel algorithms for filter and refine-based spatial analytics kernels. Motivated by the heterogeneity in a compute node, there is a new opportunity for design space exploration for geospatial applications. New parallelization techniques based on communication vs. computation tradeoffs will be investigated. The new design will leverage network topology aware spatial data partitioning and remote direct memory access (RDMA) capability in DPUs for implementing hierarchical filter and refine techniques. The implementation of parallel algorithms will be incorporated into publicly available MPI GIS software. These libraries will be implemented to be scalable in heterogeneous computing systems. For broader impact, the new software libraries will be integrated with CyberGIS geospatial packages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly true of hybrid systems based on superconducting quantum bits (qubits) coupled to piezoelectric surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. These engineered systems, in which quantum information stored in the qubit can be  controllably coupled to the microscopic surface waves of a piezoelectric crystal, are an ideal platform for understanding the exotic behavior of strongly-coupled synthetic quantum systems. Additionally, SAW devices are already a key component in many classical electronic devices such as cell phones, touch screens and chemical sensors. Given their wide applicability in classical electronics it is natural to ask if SAW-based devices might find similar success in the field of quantum information science (QIS). Developing piezoelectric SAW-devices for quantum applications is in its infancy, with much uncharted territory ripe for the development of new technologies and exciting discoveries. By harnessing the controlled quantum behavior of superconducting qubits, the proposed program will investigate the fundamental properties of SAW-based quantum systems and advance the development of next-generation technologies for quantum sensing, computation and communication. The program will also advance the education and research experiences of graduate students and strengthen the QIS educational initiatives that the principal investigator (PI) is developing at Michigan State University (MSU). As the Associate Director of the MSU Center for Quantum Computing, Science and Engineering the PI is also working to enhance the breadth of QIS researchers at MSU by helping to recruit graduate and undergraduate students and provide support to find local research opportunities and private sector internships for the Center?s junior QIS researchers.<br/><br/>This program is focused on the experimental investigation of novel regimes of circuit quantum optics using hybrid quantum systems composed of superconducting circuit-based qubits coupled to piezoelectric surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. The projects cover new topics ranging from quantum acoustic bath engineering to the generation of squeezed states of high-frequency SAW piezo-phonons. Transmon qubits coupled to precisely designed SAW-resonators will leverage controllable levels of acoustic dissipation to autonomously stabilize coherent qubit superpositions and engineer exotic quantum states via acoustic loss. Additionally non-classical states of SAWs will be transduced from non-classical states of microwave photons using parametric Josephson junction devices, creating the opportunity to investigate non-Markovian properties of itinerant piezo-phonons coupled to superconducting qubits. The program will also explore the possibility of developing novel SAW-based devices with qubits beyond transmons (i.e. via the incorporation of flux-qubits or fluxonium-based devices). The realization and understanding of these ?quantum acoustic? systems and devices will greatly expand the fundamental knowledge of highly-controlled synthetic quantum systems and how they might realize new quantum technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High levels of noise can have negative effects on animals, particularly those that communicate with sounds. Several studies have investigated how human-generated noise can impair the recognition of vocal communication signals. Interestingly, some studies have shown changes in signals produced by animals that live in cities that help them cope with the negative effects of noise. Whether and how the sense of hearing can change in response to human-generated noise is not known. Studying the iconic ?ribbit? of Pacific chorus frogs, this project explores precisely this. We will compare the calls and the hearing abilities of frogs that live in urban and rural regions across the San Francisco Bay Area. We will also study whether such changes in calls and hearing abilities allow animals to communicate easier in noisy environments. Further, we will explore whether changes in hearing among urban and rural populations are related to changes in the structure of the ear. These research activities will be complemented by educational activities, including research training of diverse student populations and science education outreach in local communities. As this project will further our understanding of the consequences of noise pollution for sensory perception and behavior, our results can inform conservation and urbanization efforts and promote progress in the design of communication devices that interact with humans.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic noise has dramatically increased over the past decades, becoming a major form of pollution. Accordingly, there is growing interest in understanding the effects of anthropogenic noise on animal behavior. For animals that communicate acoustically, anthropogenic noise can impair the detection and recognition of vocal signals. Several studies have investigated how vocal signals and signaling behaviors change to minimize the detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise. In contrast, we do not know whether the hearing capabilities of urban animals also change to better cope with high levels of noise. The central hypothesis of this project is that, among populations with different levels of natural and anthropogenic noise, the auditory system varies in ways that facilitate signal reception. We will test this hypothesis using Pacific chorus frogs (Hyliola regilla) from populations with low and high levels of natural and anthropogenic noise. Specifically, we will (i) characterize the acoustic environment (soundscape) and vocal signals of populations with different levels of noise, (ii) determine how auditory processing abilities vary among soundscapes, (iii) determine how such variation in vocalizations and hearing abilities relate to acoustically-mediated mating behavior, and (iv) examine anatomical mechanisms underlying population-level variation in auditory processing abilities. By combining behavioral, physiological, and anatomical studies of auditory processing, this project will further our understanding of how novel environments shape sensation, perception, and animal communication systems in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the conventional radio spectrum is quite congested, and hence, it cannot satisfy such high demands. Consequently, unused high-frequency bands will be adopted in the fifth generation and beyond (5G+) wireless networks. Yet, wireless connectivity in high bands is challenged by frequent outages induced by user mobility. Recent studies show that advanced network management techniques based on artificial intelligence can maintain a reliable high-quality link with user mobility. However, to develop such advanced techniques, comprehensive highly-accurate datasets of wireless channel quality are required. Unfortunately, these datasets are not accessible to the research community. The first goal of this project is to develop a realistic and highly-accurate simulator that generates rich datasets of 5G+ wireless channels in the frequency range 400 ? 800 Terahertz. This simulator will be made publicly available to empower research efforts in data-driven 5G+ network management solutions. The generated datasets will be validated through a state-of-the-art testbed. Moreover, the generated datasets will be characterized to learn the impact of user mobility patterns on the wireless channel quality. In addition, novel methods will be developed to predict the channel quality due to user mobility, which will further help in developing effective 5G+ network management tools. By empowering future research in data-driven network management solutions, this project enables a broad integration of high-frequency bands in 5G+ wireless networks. As a result, this project supports high-rate low-delay 5G+ technologies, much needed in the era of smart and connected communities and the internet of everything. Thereby, this project broadly impacts myriad aspects of the evolving digital society, particularly, for indoor mobile applications. Furthermore, this project provides workforce training in a highly desirable multi-disciplinary skillset while ensuring the participation of a broad range of students.<br/><br/>The 5G+ wireless networks will operate in the unused high-frequency bands, e.g., the visible light (VL) frequency band (400 ? 800 Terahertz). While they can support ultra-high throughput and ultra-low latency traffic demands, the wireless channels at such bands suffer from limited diffraction capabilities. This results in frequent outages in communication links with user mobility due to blockage from static and/or mobile objects. Preliminary studies demonstrated that it is not practical to describe these link outages using a general probability distribution model, as such outages are tied to the environment-confined user mobility details. As a result, classical optimization tools will be ineffective for 5G+ network management. On the other hand, data-driven strategies can be used to design intelligent network management strategies that learn from the environment and adaptively allocate resources to the mobile users. However, adopting data-driven network management strategies is challenged by: 1) the absence of high-quality datasets of indoor mobile VL channel gains and 2) the sparsity of the VL channel gain data, which impedes the adoption of conventional data-driven tools. To address these limitations, the proposed project pursues the following research thrusts while considering office room layouts: T1) Development of efficient 5G+ mobile channel simulator that reflects realistic spatio-temporal features in the VL band and captures the impact of link unavailability due to dynamic blockages with the objects and users' bodies. The simulator will be publicly available to empower further research in 5G+ data-driven network management; T2) Development of an efficient 5G+ channel predictor that provides useful VL channel state information for future time frames despite the high sparsity in the channel dataset. The predictor will empower various proactive data-driven 5G+ network management strategies. The developed methods and tools in this project will be validated through a testbed that mimics a VL-based indoor networking setup.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(Pleasure and displeasure are here understood broadly to cover all positive and negative affective states, including not just sensory pleasures and pains, but emotions of joy, happiness, pride, and enjoyment, as well as those of guilt, fear, sadness, and boredom.) It has a long and distinguished history, but has undergone a resurgence recently with the current explosion of work in affective science and neuroscience. Many in the field think that people make decisions by anticipating the positive and negative emotions they are likely to experience in the future, and by choosing to maximize the balance of positive over negative feelings. The upshot is a form of egoism: all decisions are ultimately taken to benefit oneself, to create good and avoid bad feelings in oneself. Even someone donating a kidney to a stranger is really just acting to feel good for having done so. This result is morally and socially destructive. The present project aims to show that the scientific findings have been misinterpreted, thereby securing a place for genuine altruism.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop an extended argument against motivational hedonism, but one that is grounded in affective science. The view that pleasure and displeasure (more technically described as positive and negative valence) are the common currency of all decision making will not be challenged, but endorsed. However, the project will examine different accounts of what valence is?for example, whether it is a felt property attaching to our experiences that we seek to maximize (hedonism), or rather whether it is a representation of the value we assign to the experienced objects and events themselves (which would secure altruism). The project will proceed in part by integrating and explaining a wide range of results from affective science and neuroscience, and in part through careful analysis of the nature of representation in cognitive science generally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will also catalyze the transformation of the engineering culture to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion.<br/><br/>This mixed-methods multi-case study seeks to understand engineering faculty beliefs about DEI and develop a gaming intervention to catalyze their engagement with DEI efforts. The study is framed by basic values theory to answer the following research questions:<br/><br/>RQ1. What beliefs and values do engineering faculty hold about diversity, equity, and inclusion? <br/>RQ2. How do faculty values and beliefs about DEI impact their approach to integrate DEI into their professional activities?<br/>RQ3. How does the gaming intervention impact engineering faculty values and beliefs about DEI?<br/><br/>This proposal will initiate a national conversation about the role of engineering faculty in promoting diversity and inclusion. Specifically, the project will develop an online gaming tool that can provide asynchronous access to a DEI training instrument tailored for engineering faculty. The synergistic activities of research and teaching will provide a medium to introduce the DEI concepts into the engineering culture, curriculum, and classroom. The results of the study will increase the engineering faculty engagement with DEI efforts. Through their gaming and communities of practice (COP) interactions participants will develop a tailored individualized understanding of what it takes to implement DEI concepts into their faculty activities. Finally, the results of the study will update our understanding of strategic approaches for broadening participation and how faculty can effectively teach diverse students in STEM. The study will provide an exemplar for improving diversity and inclusion initiatives that various institution types can model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous work studied the response of tendon cells to different strains under artificial conditions. However, it is important to understand how cells response to damage inside the native tendon tissue. This is because many important interactions are lost when cells are isolated from their native environment. Also, these interactions between cells and their environment have a strong effect on cell behavior. Therefore, this project will develop novel techniques to study cell behavior in their native tissue environment. These techniques will be used to understand how tendon fatigue damage causes tendon degeneration. This information will provide the scientific foundation for developing new treatments for tendon disorders. Also, engineering students will help incorporate our results into high school biology classes. We will identify whether this improves the recruitment and retention of more women in engineering.<br/><br/>The research goals of this CAREER project are to determine how tendon cells sense physical stimuli in the native tissue environment and to identify the role of dysfunctional cell mechanobiology in tendon degeneration. The central hypothesis is that fatigue damage alters the physical stimuli presented in situ to cells within tendon and that mechanotransduction of these altered stimuli initiates the negative cellular response leading to tendon degeneration. To test this hypothesis, the researchers will develop a live tissue explant model enabling simultaneous in situ measurement of local physical stimuli and gene expression and will identify the mechanotransduction mechanisms that drive the response of tendon cells to mechanical loading within the native tissue environment. The innovative technique of colocalizing fatigue damage (i.e., altered strains and collagen organization) with cellular gene expression will identify the specific physical stimuli that initiate tissue degeneration in the native tendon environment. Importantly, the explant model also enables the researchers to perturb mechanotransduction signaling pathways during fatigue loading and investigate their mechanistic role in inducing tendon degeneration. Beyond tendon, by investigating whether canonical mechanotransduction mechanisms observed in 2D also operate within tissue explants, this work will advance the broad understanding of how cells within fibrous soft tissues (e.g., tendon, meniscus, skin) respond to physical stimuli in the native tissue environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing energy demand associated with the growing population, environmental concerns, and technological advancements imposes pressure on modern society to utilize renewable energy sources. Sodium (Na)-ion batteries are promising candidates for large-scale/grid-scale energy storage in terms of availability of raw sources, cost reduction and its environmentally benign nature. However, the electrochemical performance of Na-ion batteries suffers from short cycle life and rapid capacity fade due to severe instabilities in the cathode materials. Lack of understanding of instability mechanisms limits the design of novel cathode materials for Na-ion batteries.  The research program will generate fundamental knowledge of the underlying governing forces behind the instabilities and deformations in Na-ion cathodes. This knowledge is a potentially transformative concept for other ?beyond Li-ion battery? technologies such as K-ion, Mg-ion, and Ca-ion batteries. The overarching educational objective in this CAREER proposal is to facilitate learning the fundamentals of batteries at K-12, undergraduate and graduate student levels as well as increase public knowledge of the fundamentals of battery operations. The educational and outreach activities include developing graphic novels about battery operation mechanisms for K-12 students, providing an educational platform for future K-12 teachers in STEM fields, preparing battery exhibits at a Science Museum, and integrating research outputs into college education.  <br/><br/>This CAREER proposal addresses the scientific problem related to poor interfacial and structural stabilities of transition metal oxide cathodes in Na-ion batteries.  The proposal will focus on transition metal oxides made of earth abundant minerals such as manganese and iron. The goal of the research activities is to identify the impact of transition metals, operation voltage and electrolyte chemistry on chemo-mechanical instabilities in transition metal oxides cathodes. The guiding hypothesis is that intercalation of Na+ ions in transition metal oxide structure inevitably alters the coupled transport-reaction processes, leading to chemo-mechanical instabilities in the surface and structure of the electrode, resulting in rapid capacity fade. The project will examine the coupling between reaction-transport behavior and mechanical deformations in single and binary transition metal oxide cathodes cycled in organic liquid electrolytes. In operando stress / strain measurements will be coupled with chemical and structural characterization techniques to identify the governing force on interfacial and structural deformations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For such assessment, the project will use shipboard measurements, Autonomous Surface Vehicles, Autonomous flying vehicles (drones), and a floating platform that will be complemented by computer model simulations. The project will provide approximations of the linkage between land and open-ocean processes to be used in global-scale models. The project will also facilitate interactions between a research intensive university and an undergraduate college.

These buoyant plumes transport low salinity waters across the continental shelf and can be entrained by ocean currents flowing by the shelf?s edge. The buoyant plumes are influenced by the balance between wind stress (upwelling-favorable) and buoyancy forcing. Tidal pulses of brackish water interfere with such dynamic balance to produce radial fronts referred to as sub-plumes. These sub-plumes are subsequently advected by Ekman transport. Data collection will consist of 4 seasonal surveys of Winyah Bay plume using ships (UNOLS ship requested), drones, Autonomous Surface Vehicles, and a floating platform to obtain profiles of water velocity, salinity, temperature, and turbulence properties. The sub-plume fronts shall be ubiquitous as long as the horizontal density gradient is prominent and the inertial period is greater than the tidal period. Observations will be complemented by numerical simulations with a non-hydrostatic numerical model. As Broader Impacts, the study will allow parametrization of cross-shelf plumes into lower resolution models that study land-ocean exchanges.

The use of water softeners, spreading salt on roads in winter, and some agricultural activities add salts to lakes, rivers, and groundwater. This project will study where the salt is coming from, how it moves through rivers and lakes, and what impacts it has on freshwater habitats in Wisconsin. The overarching goal of the project is to protect our freshwater resources from further salt pollution through improved scientific understanding, education, and public engagement.

While there have been several federal efforts to increase the deployment of broadband infrastructure across the United States, many communities seem to be persistently excluded from the impacts of these deployment efforts. It can be especially challenging to quantify these inequities for mobile broadband technologies. Currently, government subsidized broadband deployment efforts rely on provider-generated coverage maps, which use radio propagation models to demonstrate where mobile broadband is available across space. Ad hoc investigations of these maps have revealed that propagation models substantially overstate the penetration of ICT infrastructure and point to a need for widespread measurements of ICT infrastructure to better assess the true extent of coverage.  As ICT infrastructure becomes increasingly necessary for essential services such as education, healthcare, banking, and civic participation, accurate assessment of ICT infrastructure accessibility becomes essential. To measure ICT infrastructure at scale and in a manner that illuminates inequities, it is necessary to rely on crowdsourced measurements of ICT infrastructure. <br/><br/>This research seeks to answer two fundamental questions that drive ICT infrastructure policymaking and deployments: How do we know that ICT infrastructure deployment efforts are actually improving access to ICT infrastructure and how should crowdsourcing platforms for ICT measurements be designed in order to ensure that representative data are generated by crowdsourced ICT measurement efforts?

This is especially true in the context of designing biologically-derived materials that can mirror the properties of petroleum-based plastics. Terpenoids, which display a wide range of carbocyclic structures, are valuable platforms for preparing polymers that lend themselves to systematic structure-property studies. Indeed, polymers comprised of rigid carbocyclic motifs (e.g., cyclic-olefin copolymers) are enticing materials that exhibit unique (and, in certain cases, predictable) physical properties. Unfortunately, the limited scope of carbocycles that can be incorporated within macromolecular architectures has significantly hindered efforts to systematically probe more subtle structure-property relationships. This research seeks to elucidate the interplay between constitutional isomerism, backbone stereochemistry, and bulk  thermomechanical properties in terpenoid analogues of cyclic olefin (co)polymers. The work is expected to dramatically expand the chemical space available to polymer science and reveal fundamental insights into an unexplored family of biologically-derived polymers. The insights gained from this research will accelerate the development of biologically-derived plastics (including thermoplastic elastomers) with precisely tailored properties and functions. This research will be integrated with a broader effort to promote science literacy and engage academic and public communities at the state and national levels. A multifaceted plan will develop new curriculum initiatives, promote collaborative learning, and promote science literacy through web-based platforms (i.e., YouTube) by connecting research outcomes to real-world applications and challenges.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The number of students from non-dominant linguistic backgrounds (NDLBs) is increasing in U.S. higher education. Most students from NDLBs in the United States have grown up in Spanish-speaking households, yet there are increasing numbers of students who speak other languages such as Arabic, Somali, Swahili, and Nepali. While students from NDLBs bring useful resources for academic success, they also experience challenges when learning STEM content within English-dominant learning environments. Research in K-12 science education has shown that students from NDLBs learn and participate better when their learning environments offer opportunities to move flexibly between two or more languages. Through such practices, the students can build on linguistic and knowledge resources developed in their primary languages, and their multilingual identities can be validated. Despite evidence that supports this flexible language use for STEM and English learning, it has been rarely studied at the college level as a way to enhance college students? STEM learning. This project seeks to fill this gap by, first, examining how college students from NDLBs use multiple languages in the context of STEM learning, and, second, by designing a STEM learning environment that encourages and supports flexible use of languages for students from NDLBs. This project will advance understanding about the interrelationship between STEM learning and language use and to investigate pedagogical environments and practices that better facilitate STEM learning. Given that students from NDLBs are a growing population in the U.S. education system, findings can have broad impacts on students and educators in post-secondary STEM education.<br/><br/>The practice of moving dynamically between, and combining elements of, two or more languages to make sense of multilingual contexts is known as translanguaging. The project team will conduct three studies: Study 1 seeks to identify the translanguaging practices of college students from NDLBs through task-based paired interviews that engage two speakers of a common language; Study 2 aims to use semi-structured interviews to examine linguistic experiences in STEM learning environment of college students from NDLBs; and Study 3 intends to design and test a learning environment that supports the learning of students from NDLBs by encouraging translanguaging practices appropriate for college STEM learning and participation. The project team will administer Studies 1 and 2 in two different institutional contexts, an urban R1 university (University of Illinois at Chicago) and Spanish-bilingual community college (Saint Augustine College). Similarities and differences between the two institutions will provide critical insights into the conditions under which students from NDLBs may develop various translanguaging strategies and fully leverage their linguistic resources. Study 3 will be implemented in a freshman general chemistry course at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Taking the approach of design-based research, the project team will design the learning environment by building on the findings of Studies 1-2 and relevant literature, analyze the data collected through the intervention (videorecordings, interviews, and surveys) to revise the learning environment design for the second iteration, and generate robust evidence-based theories about the creating linguistically responsive learning environment in college STEM education.

Proofs and logical reasoning are tools used in mathematics to solve advanced problems. Many STEM majors, especially those in the mathematical sciences, need support in learning how to read and produce mathematical proofs. This skill is a primary means of learning and doing mathematics in third- and fourth-year college mathematics courses. Unlike most existing curricula, the new curriculum will focus on guiding students to read, understand, and appreciate mathematical proofs through several intertwined project activities. Rooted in prior research, the project's curriculum will support students in learning mathematical logic through reading and comparing proof texts. In conjunction with this, the project team will partner with several mathematicians to produce rich mathematical proof texts for students to study. As it is the case that students most often learn literature by reading great works, the curriculum will help students to learn about mathematical proofs by reading rich, challenging, and engaging proofs. The curriculum will include biographical stories of the mathematician authors to humanize mathematics. Project team members will collaborate with mathematicians of color and women mathematicians. The curriculum will provide an opportunity for students to see broader representation in the mathematical sciences. The three underlying components - reading, understanding, and appreciating - are designed to empower students to learn about and from mathematical proofs. They will support students in experiencing mathematics as a human activity in which they can participate.<br/><br/>This project will pursue several goals related to enhancing student experiences and successes in transition to proof (TTP) courses. Because there has been relatively little clarity about the specific learning goals for TTP courses, a primary project goal is to build on prior research to establish clearer learning goals for TTP courses. A second goal is to incorporate the learning goals in the process of designing, developing, implementing, and refining a research-based curriculum for TTP courses in mathematics. The project aims to generate new knowledge and fill gaps in the TPP literature through the project?s research findings. An additional goal is to disseminate project outcomes and curriculum resources nationwide, particularly to mathematical sciences departments working to enhance student learning and success in TTP courses as well as subsequent courses and scenarios that rely on problem solving, proofs, and proving. The researchers will employ a rigorous research design to pursue efforts for establishing a curriculum while developing a theory regarding how learning occurs in this teaching and learning space.  The project hypotheses is that: comparing proofs will support students in learning abstract logical concepts and proof techniques; analyzing and discussing complex proofs of non-trivial claims will support students in learning from proof texts; and reading stories from a diverse set of professional mathematicians will help humanize proof-based mathematics while envisioning their participation in the discipline. The project will employ research-based measures of understanding of logic, proof comprehension, and belonging in mathematics to study implementation of these hypotheses in the curriculum. The researchers will compare these outcomes to TTP courses taught with standard curricula, and, in the process, will study the learning activity fostered in the classroom to gain insight into these learning processes. Curriculum materials will be freely available to faculty and students online. These resources will also be disseminated through workshops, journal publications, professional conferences, and professional communities of mathematics instructors. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also supported by the NSF IUSE:HSI program, which seeks to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will improve understanding of ENSO response to climate change. The project will synthesize observational data with existing model ensembles and novel, targeted sensitivity experiments to provide both physical understanding of the ENSO climate change response and improved observational constraints on future ENSO projections. The project will train undergraduate and PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. Research results will be incorporated into a series of instructional modules on climate and ocean modeling (the ?Climate DataLab?). Introductory modules will familiarize environmental science professionals with climate model fundamentals, and more advanced modules will describe ocean model parameterizations and dynamics. The project will also train undergraduate student researchers, providing data science skills and facilitating retention in STEM careers.<br/><br/>The objective of this work is to improve constraints on future ENSO projections. The project will address how forced changes in ENSO are related to mean climate and mesoscale and submesoscale ocean dynamics. It will also examine how the mesoscale influences the interactions between ENSO and the mean state. The primary tool to be used will be an unprecedented array of CMIP-class ensembles. The project will also investigate whether the relationships between ENSO and mean and mesoscale dynamics are consistent across CMIP-class models. A suite of idealized ocean-only experiments and novel diagnostics for Tropical Instability Wave (TIW) activity will allow isolation of the influences of individual processes on mesoscale eddy behavior, and their interactions with mean climate. Additionally, the first set of fully coupled perturbed physics ensembles optimized for elucidating ocean physical controls on ENSO projections will be created and contrasted with the behavior of existing coupled model ensembles. When combined with the proposed development of new, more detailed emergent constraint diagnostics, the result will be more robust insights into how climate change may affect 21st century ENSO.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Snow processes are especially relevant in the Arctic system, where temperatures are rising more rapidly than the global average, partially because of feedback processes that take place as snow melts. As air temperatures increase, snow begins to melt, which lowers the snow?s reflectivity and increases the amount of sunlight it absorbs. The absorbed light leads to further temperature increase, and this warming process can have far-reaching implications for our climate. Although snow is one of nature?s most reflective materials, the exact reflectivity can be quite variable. Several factors darken snow, such as larger snow grain sizes and impurities in the snow like dust, soot and algae. One factor that is not well understood is how the liquid water content in snow reduces reflectivity. This presents significant uncertainty in determining how changing snowpacks will impact the climate system, particularly in the Arctic, as wet snow becomes more prevalent due to more frequent rain on snow events and larger extent and duration of surface melt on ice sheets and glaciers. This project will enhance our understanding of wet snow reflectivity through field measurements in Minnesota and Colorado, lab experiments, and modeling. Our results will probe fundamental physical relationships and therefore, broadly apply to cold regions. As part of this work, undergraduate students will be engaged in the research projects. They will collect and analyze data in an Engineering Thermodynamics class and will design and build instrumentation for this work and to support other faculty projects in a new Engineering Fellows Program. The investigator will also share teaching materials about snow reflectivity and climate online and at a workshop for faculty at minority serving institutions.<br/><br/>The naturally high albedo (or reflectivity) of snow provides a strong control on earth?s surface temperatures. Because of this critical role, accurately reproducing snow albedo is essential for effective climate modeling. Even in the Arctic, the already prevalent periods of wet snow are increasing because of more frequent rain on snow events and increased extent and duration of glacial surface melt; however, nearly all existing snow albedo models employ albedo schemes designed for dry snow. These models play a key role during snow melt because of the amplifying effects of the snow albedo feedback process, where melting snow leads to lower albedo, higher temperatures, and further snow melt. Therefore, explicitly incorporating the effects of liquid water content on snow albedo is a critical next step in improving model accuracy. The proposed work aims to quantify the effect of liquid water content on snow albedo, combining several approaches. 1) The investigator will conduct field-based measurements of albedo, liquid water content, grain size and snow impurities in Minnesota and at Niwot Ridge in Colorado to determine the effects of individual physical properties on the overall snow albedo. Wet snow conditions at these locations represent those that are increasingly common in the Arctic. 2) Through a new course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) implemented in the Engineering Thermodynamics class, students will conduct laboratory measurements of the reflectance of artificial snow with controlled grain size and liquid water content. 3) The investigator will complement this work with two different modeling approaches to calculate wet snow albedo to investigate an array of snow conditions and inform potential changes to physically based snow albedo models. Studying these phenomena in different landscapes, in the laboratory, and in simulations will allow us to extrapolate our understanding of wet snow albedo to cold regions more broadly, particularly in the rapidly changing Arctic. This project will support the development of students through multiple avenues by providing opportunities to engage in research and build their scientific identities. The investigator will develop an Engineering Fellows Program in which students work with faculty over the course of the year on a design project, in addition to enrolling in a professional development seminar course. The investigator will also partner with the Ice Drilling Program Education team to serve as a visiting scientist in the School of Ice workshop and create an online Virtual Field Lab on snow albedo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this Germination Expansion project is to develop a Center for Urban Transformations at Georgia State University expanding on an educational model piloted at Arizona State University for graduate research and training in urban sustainability (funded through NSF award 1444755). The pilot successfully equipped graduate students to collaborate across disciplinary lines (for example, ecology, engineering, and social science) and with decision-makers, practitioners, and civic groups to produce novel research agendas, datasets, and questions to solve complex urban problems. Under the aegis of this Expansion award, the Center for Urban Transformations at Georgia State University aims to scale the pilot model to the Greater Atlanta region through strategic partnerships with research-practice networks. Likely broader impacts of the proposed center are inherent in its focus on sustainable cities, with a centering on resilience for under-resourced communities. As a minority-serving institution, Georgia State University is well-positioned to provide a valuable experience to students.<br/><br/>This project aims to foster the transformative capacities needed to co-produce innovative research agendas that advance urban sustainability transformations. The central research question of the project is: What capacities are needed for students, researchers, practitioners, and community partners to co-produce innovative research agendas that advance sustainability transformations? In addressing this research question the project seeks to: increase the motivation and capacity of the next generation of urban systems scientists to conduct, apply, and communicate transdisciplinary transformations research; promote co-learning and collaboration among graduate students, scientists, and decision-makers to advance urban social-ecological-technological systems transformations; and ensure the participation of broad groups of people in the knowledge-implementation cycle. These goals will be approached through a set of activities, including: (1) an Urban Transformations Studio interdisciplinary core course for graduate students in a range of fields related to urban sustainability; (2) an Urban Transformations Summer School designed to enhance science communication and interdisciplinary research skills; (3) an Atlanta Transformative Leader Series to foster relationships with community stakeholders and thought leaders; (4) mentorship and support through involvement in research-practitioner networks; and (5) Knowledge Mobilization Showcase events.

One such approach is to tap into the energy from sunlight; however, current materials used to capture solar energy are costly to manufacture and relatively inefficient. To contribute to efficient harvesting of solar light for energy conversion processes, this project is designed to determine how specific properties of two types of 2-dimensional materials enable absorption of solar energy. State-of-the-art computational approaches are used to model these energy conversion processes at the level of atoms and their electrons. The project integrates the knowledge of material science, engineering, and computational physical chemistry. The results of this research will improve our understanding of materials currently under experimental investigation for use of solar energy harvesting devices and provide insights to improve their efficiency. Dr. Trivedi?s research program is integrated with an educational component to inspire undergraduate and graduate students to pursue careers in science, technology, and engineering.<br/>Two dimensional nanoporous materials displays a rich array of photophysical properties that govern excitation dynamics within the material resulting in efficient charge and energy generation and transport. However, fundamental questions have emerged from recent experiments regarding the influence of interface, defects, and dopants on the charge and energy dynamics of planar nanoporous materials and their power conversion efficiencies used in solar energy harvesting devices. Specifically, how exciton quenching and undesired charge trapping contribute to these events is uncertain. This project will investigate nonequilibrium processes involved in exciton generation and transport, and in charge separation following photoexcitation in two specific types of nanostructures: (i) Cu3HHTT2 MOF as a representative of a family of 2D ?- conjugated MOFs with honeycomb-like sheet structures and (ii) monolayer of tri-s-triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride. Using a combination of mixed quantum-classical approaches and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics this computational research will provide a detailed, atomistic level description of the photoexcitation dynamics. The investigation of influence of dimensionality, interfaces, defects, and dopants on the material?s light harvesting performance will be understood by pursuing two objectives, to (i) elucidate the influence of interface on charge and energy transfer using electronic structure theory and (ii) investigate nonequilibrium phenomena involved in exciton generation and transport followed by charge separation at the interface. Computational determination of the charge and energy dynamics within and at interfaces of these planar nanoscale materials will provide essential insights for their optimal use in devices for solar energy harvesting, sensing, imaging and other advanced technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such achievement relies on an important assumption: the reasoning process on an entirely known network always reaches a decisive conclusion. But the sheer size and complexity of modern networks make it hard, if not impossible, to obtain complete knowledge of the target network, and even when some knowledge is missing, it is still desirable to perform some (perhaps weaker) reasoning. This project challenges the assumption that logical reasoning must be complete and develops techniques for networks only partly known.<br/><br/>To achieve logical reasoning of networks with uncertain events and limited visibility, this project plans to develop (1) loss-less modeling in which network uncertainty is explicitly handled without corrupting the querying capability; and (2) complete verification relative to the level of information available, which reaches an inconclusive result only when more information is needed. A realization of this vision is built around knowledge representation and partial reasoning, resulting in a simple yet powerful logical language for uncertain and missing information, enabling a rich set of semantics-based manipulation of partial networks by partial evaluation, program containment, predicate instantiation, etc.<br/><br/>As a step towards logical reasoning of real-world networks in which an omniscient view is unlikely and partial reasoning is most sought-after, this project plays a unique role in the continued growth and evolution of computer networks. Simultaneously, the hyper-scale of networks as a driving challenge engages the knowledge reasoning community to revise and advance earlier complexity results, producing a more compelling use in networking. By leveraging the connection between the incomplete knowledge representation in this project and the numerical methods of inductive reasoning, this project may also facilitate future development of probabilistic reasoning for quantitative network behaviors.<br/><br/>The project website https://ravel-net.org/ will be maintained to disseminate the progress of the project.

In hot environments where leaf functioning is vulnerable to high temperatures, plants must cool leaves to avoid heat damage. This cooling might occur even when plants cannot photosynthesize, which is counter to the commonly understood benefit to plants of using water. However, the prevalence of these alternative water use strategies remains unknown, despite the important implications they have for understanding local, regional and global carbon and water cycles. This project will quantify alternative water use behavior across a broad range of species to determine whether this prioritization of cooling over photosynthesis is common. In turn, results will improve efforts to model vegetation responses to heat waves and identify species that are potentially best suited to cope with heat stress. The project will contribute to the training of early career scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students in modern plant and environmental science research. Public outreach will focus on developing an outdoor exhibit for the Desert Botanical Garden, a public facility that receives approximately 500K visitors per year. The bilingual display will demonstrate to visitors the physiological and societal costs of heat waves on plants and the ways in which plants regulate their temperatures.<br/><br/>Episodic heat waves that are increasing in duration, frequency and intensity will likely amplify plant thermal stress and mortality. Therefore, plants occurring in hot environments must cool leaves below a critical threshold that can result in permanent leaf damage. Contrary to stomatal regulation models, transpiration can achieve this cooling independent of changes in photosynthesis when conditions are thermally stressful. Recent studies have reported such alternative water use strategies in several species, which then do not maximize carbon gain for a fixed level of stomatal conductance or hydraulic risk. This project combines tightly controlled leaf gas exchange measurements with experimental manipulation of environments, and a hierarchical modeling framework in order to (1) determine the prevalence of alternative water use strategies across a diverse set of species, (2) determine the traits that best predict this behavior, (3) develop optimality theory to predict under what environmental conditions this behavior should occur, and (4) validate predictions along a broad desert ? montane elevation gradient. Results will advance theory for stomatal regulation, a core topic in the fields of plant ecology and Earth system modeling. It will also provide one of the largest and most standardized datasets for plant responses to extreme environmental conditions, yielding a data resource of high value to other investigators. These findings can then be used to directly inform a revised representation of plant water use in Earth System Models. This representation will ultimately yield more useful predictions under climate change scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, students have difficulty in trying to understand the theoretical concepts in these courses, which can create a significant barrier to student success. While conceptual models have been widely adopted in primary and secondary STEM education to help students make sense of important concepts, their use in computer science education has not been well explored. This project will study the impact of teaching students how to create their own conceptual models of theories. It is expected that the project will result in measurable improvements in student understanding of theoretical concepts and ability to create well-conceived conceptual models. This project will also provide insights for instructors on how to effectively integrate conceptual models in existing computer science theory courses.  Students who understand the theoretical concepts will be better prepared to address the complex computational problems that they will encounter in the computing workforce. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to improve student learning outcomes related to the theory of computing, particularly with respect to understanding, skill sets, and ability to apply theory to new situations. This study is grounded in constructivist theories of learning and previous work on the use of modeling in STEM education. After presenting a theoretical concept in a class, a set of open-ended questions will be posed to students who will be asked to draw a conceptual model and then iteratively revise it as they address the open-ended questions. The research questions that will be addressed by this study are: (1) What is the quality of models produced by students? (2) How do the models impact student understanding of theoretical concepts? (3) How do the models affect instructors? teaching?

In addition, this project is jointly funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Biological Sciences Directorate and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The ability of an animal to perform well in its environment is central to accomplishing many of its most basic and important functions. Since those abilities--and the physical features of the animals that permit them--evolved slowly over thousands of generations, rapidly changing environments challenge the ability of animals to respond and adapt. A key feature of an animal?s environment is temperature, particularly for cold-blooded animals like chameleons, who rely on heat from the environment to warm their bodies to the best operating temperature while seeking ways to cool off when it gets too hot. To investigate how the temperature impacts a fundamental ability--the chameleon?s feeding with its projectile tongue--this project measures the range of environmental temperatures experienced by different species of African chameleons, how those different habitats correspond to differences in feeding performance, how differences in feeding are related to differences in the temperature sensitivity of the muscles and connective tissues of the tongue, and how those differences might have evolved. In addition, this research harnesses the charismatic nature of chameleons and the captivating visuals of high-speed video of their feeding to engage and educate a broad audience. In particular, these results will be integrated into education modules developed to address specific K-12 learning objectives in the biological and physical sciences. Specifically, as part of a curriculum enhancement resource developed to connect scientists to teachers and classrooms in rural and tribal communities in South Dakota, this research will result in free curriculum modules based on scientific research occurring in South Dakota?s higher education institutions that are aligned with the South Dakota Science Standards. In the process, this research will form a foundation for developing content for new curricula offerings at the undergraduate and graduate level through the development of novel laboratory modules, original case study materials, and new course offerings.<br/><br/>Temperature exhibits strong effects on animal movement and performance through its effect on muscle contractile dynamics. Movements powered by the recoil of elastic tissues, however, respond differently to changes in environmental temperature than movements powered by muscle contraction directly. These systems and their underlying functional processes therefore may also experience different selection pressures relating to thermal specialization to their environment. This project will compare patterns of thermal specialization in two movement types: elastic recoil-powered tongue projection and muscle-powered tongue retraction in chameleons. These comparisons will focus on examining the thermal sensitivity of whole organism performance and the different underlying mechanistic processes involved in producing these movements (e.g., motor control, muscle contractile physiology, anatomical variation) in chameleons living in different thermal environments. Combining ecological work in the field and experimental work in the laboratory, this work will determine to what extent different types of movement undergo thermal specialization, at what mechanistic level thermal specialization occurs for both movement types, what environmental factors drive these patterns, the extent to which acclimation affects performance in both movements, and evolutionary trends in these patterns. In the process, this research will provide insight into how animals using different types of movement for critical ecological functions may respond to shifts in environmental conditions. These advancements in our understanding of adaptation to differing and changing environmental conditions, particularly temperature, will impact the fields of ecology, physiology, and evolutionary biology.

This CAREER project seeks to improve understanding of a new plasma-based upcycling process for transforming discarded plastic into valuable products, helping to mitigate the ever-increasing plastic pollution that negatively impacts the environment and health of the world?s population. The objectives of this research program are to analyze the mechanism whereby a plasma (consisting of charged particles) breaks down plastic in ambient-temperature water in the presence of a catalyst to produce carboxylates, a group of oxygen-containing organic chemicals that can readily be used to produce high-value materials. This research will lay the groundwork for transforming a broad range of discarded plastic into high-value chemicals, working toward a circular end-of-life approach for dealing with plastic pollution. The transformation process uses a low-energy plasma generator that can be powered by renewable electricity from wind and solar sources, making the process economically viable and reducing its carbon footprint. This research will be integrated with educational and outreach programs to increase engagement of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM, and to educate both STEM and non-STEM majors about chemical processes that can benefit the environment. These activities will emphasize the importance of plastic upcycling for a healthier environment and a sustainable society.<br/><br/>Common plastic for packing, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, is inert and capable of withstanding high temperature. Thus, derivation of useful materials from waste plastic normally requires energy-intensive measures, such as pyrolysis, that convert plastic to alkane-like compounds. The objective of this project is to develop an alternative approach to plastic conversion based on a catalytic plasma-mediated depolymerization process that operates at ambient temperature and in liquid water. This process begins with modification of the waste plastic surface to increase its wettability and to reduce the polymer backbone C-C bond strength, followed by plasma-mediated depolymerization in the presence of a metal-organic framework catalyst. The proposed research seeks to 1) measure the effects on plastic depolymerization activity of the type and extent of surface functionalization with sequence of polar groups, and 2) detail the mechanisms of plasma-assisted depolymerization and analyze selectivity towards carboxylate products. The project?s education plan centers on developing an innovative interdisciplinary undergraduate course, ?Giving Life to Discarded Plastics? designed for STEM and non-STEM majors and incorporating the SODOTO (See-One-Do-One-Teach-One) method of teaching to build student engagement, communication, and teamwork skills. In addition to the course, the principal investigator will institute summer programs that introduce chemistry concepts to students with diverse backgrounds, emphasizing how chemistry can help address environmental problems, focusing on the benefits of plastic upcycling, and helping to inspire interest in STEM careers. The course and summer initiatives will expand the PI?s on-going efforts to recruit underrepresented minorities, women, and underprivileged students at the secondary level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The data most useful for science are longitudinal and naturalistic, such as data collected periodically over time in children's homes. Unfortunately, the longitudinal, naturalistic corpora most likely to advance knowledge may contain information that renders participants identifiable. For this reason, naturalistic corpora are rarely shared with other researchers, hindering science. Sharing requires careful redaction--the removal of potentially identifying information. Currently, naturalistic corpora are often too large for manual redaction, and current automated tools both miss critical redactions and over-redact important information. To enable such data to be shared, this project seeks to develop novel computational methods for redaction.<br/><br/>This project's aim is to develop initially automated, human-in-the-loop redaction of identifying information in unstructured text data. First, to better understand key challenges around what aspects of transcripts make participants identifiable, the researchers are conducting interviews with social and behavioral science researchers and members of ethics boards. From these insights, the researchers are developing novel models for predicting what language may need to be redacted and they are designing novel user interactions for leveraging human expertise in redaction decisions. The unique characteristics of conversation transcripts require modeling novel features of language, drawing from natural language processing, psychology, privacy engineering, and linguistics. Because automated methods lack human insights into conversational context for making complex redaction decisions, the researchers are designing user interfaces that summarize how marked language, or tokens, appear longitudinally in transcripts, enabling human coders to quickly make redaction decisions. As a case study, the researchers are applying these techniques to the Language Development Project, a longitudinal corpus of 100 diverse children's development of language. The project is also training students in multidisciplinary research across the computational and social sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A multi-faceted approach will be used encompassing a new team-taught course that involves SEEG dimensions, a new green chemistry elective course, and an overhaul of requirements for the doctoral qualifying research proposal and dissertation research to include substantial SEEG components. Increased consideration of, and appreciation for, institutional contexts, policy processes, and innovation opportunities should enable students to position themselves to use their chemical knowledge more effectively for change in service of societal needs, particularly with respect to sustainability and the circular economy. Success in this exploratory study could lay the foundations for expansion to disciplines and institutions beyond the pilot base.<br/><br/>This project will investigate a systematic approach to equip graduates with the knowledge, skills, experience, and perspectives to meaningfully propose research aimed to better address important societal problems through the chemical sciences in a highly interdisciplinary manner. A new pedagogical framework for chemistry doctoral education will be developed and piloted that integrates important societal, economic, environmental, and governance issues with chemistry disciplinary education. This framework will involve multiple components, including: 1) a graduate-level team-taught interdisciplinary chemistry core course that integrates SEEG aspects to provide a foundation for understanding environmental sustainability and the circular economy; 2) a team-taught graduate course in Green Chemistry involving multidisciplinary instruction encompassing chemistry, economics, and social science; 3) a seminar program presented by a range of experts from academia, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector, who will also serve as mentors; 4) a requirement for the Ph.D. qualifying research proposal to include substantial SEEG components; and 5) a requirement that the doctoral dissertation include a chapter on posing SEEG-informed research questions.

However, rapid urbanization and expansion of the traffic system have caused many issues worldwide including congestion and accidents. As urbanization and vehicle production are projected to further increase in coming decades, better planning and management of traffic become imperative. Traffic is a dynamical system that propagates from one area to another in a city. So, in order to optimize it for various purposes, a holistic and systematic viewpoint of city-scale traffic dynamics is inevitable and necessary. Nevertheless, studies of this topic are currently lacking due to the limitation of traffic data and the multi-scale interpretation of the traffic system. This proposal focuses on leveraging mobile data to effectively and efficiently reconstruct city-scale traffic. The reconstructed traffic can be used to not only plan and manage urban traffic but also to predict traffic patterns by leveraging advanced traffic simulation. This project is expected to innovate in transportation and traffic research, and thus benefit people from various disciplines, including computer science, civil engineering, urban planning, earth science, and supply chain management. The accompanying educational and outreach activities include curriculum development at the intersection of Computer Science and Intelligent Transporation Systems, and research opportunities for students in underrepresented groups as well as high school students. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is developing effective and efficient reconstruction methods of city-scale traffic using mobile data. First of all, the travel time of individual road segments will be estimated using the time information embedded in mobile data. With the estimated travel time, other macroscopic traffic states such as speed, flow, and density will be subsequently estimated. Second, a novel map-matching technique for generating vehicle trajectories will be developed in case of low-sampling rate mobile data. Third, simulation-based optimization will be adopted to reconstruct microscopic traffic dynamics while ensuring consistent traffic flows at the boundaries of data-sufficient and data-lacking areas. Lastly, a hybrid simulation will be explored with the aim to achieve highly-efficient traffic reconstruction through studying various ITS applications' requirements on efficiency and reconstruction fidelity, and an effective conversion method between macroscopic and microscopic traffic simulation. The proposed methods will be evaluated using both publicly available and proprietary data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Programming is a powerful tool that scientists, engineers, and mathematicians use to gain insight into their problems. Educators have shown how programming integrated into other subjects can be a powerful tool to enhance learning, from algebra to language arts. However, less than 5% of high school students in the US learn programming. Most students do not have an opportunity to use programming to support their learning. TSP languages are not typically universal languages. Additionally, considering the specific domains of a language?s syntax, semantics, and interface, few languages fit smoothly into a given learning context. TSP languages are explicitly designed for integration in specific classes, to meet teacher needs, and to be usable with less than ten minutes of instruction. TSP languages can make the power of programming to enhance learning more accessible. This project will use TSP languages in ebook combinations to study undergraduate student learning of counting processes. The project will test the value of TSP languages in discrete mathematics, which is a gateway course in some computer science programs. <br/><br/>This project will test the use of two different TSP languages and contrast the TSP languages with a traditional programming language such as Python. The proposed work has the potential to advance knowledge about (1) the role of programming in learning in discrete mathematics, (2) the value of task-specific languages to scaffold learning, (3) how alternative representational forms of programming will influence student use of TSP languages, and (4) how the use of TSP languages alone or in combination with traditional languages will enhance students? sense of authenticity and ability to transfer knowledge. Students working in pairs will think aloud as they solve counting problems using TSP languages. The think aloud data will be analyzed to assess students? understanding of combinatorics and the languages.

However, students have difficulty in trying to understand the theoretical concepts in these courses, which can create a significant barrier to student success. While conceptual models have been widely adopted in primary and secondary STEM education to help students make sense of important concepts, their use in computer science education has not been well explored. This project will study the impact of teaching students how to create their own conceptual models of theories. It is expected that the project will result in measurable improvements in student understanding of theoretical concepts and ability to create well-conceived conceptual models. This project will also provide insights for instructors on how to effectively integrate conceptual models in existing computer science theory courses.  Students who understand the theoretical concepts will be better prepared to address the complex computational problems that they will encounter in the computing workforce. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to improve student learning outcomes related to the theory of computing, particularly with respect to understanding, skill sets, and ability to apply theory to new situations. This study is grounded in constructivist theories of learning and previous work on the use of modeling in STEM education. After presenting a theoretical concept in a class, a set of open-ended questions will be posed to students who will be asked to draw a conceptual model and then iteratively revise it as they address the open-ended questions. The research questions that will be addressed by this study are: (1) What is the quality of models produced by students? (2) How do the models impact student understanding of theoretical concepts? (3) How do the models affect instructors? teaching? To answer these questions, the project team will use mixed research methods to analyze qualitative and quantitative data including student survey responses, assessments of student models, student performance on exams, and weekly discussions with instructors.

This opportunity to learn from an ongoing pandemic and inform choices in the future requires extensive and timely data gathering. U.S. state governments have taken tens of thousands of public policy actions?executive orders, regulations, and laws in response to COVID-19. This project advances our understanding of the causes and consequences of states' policy responses to the pandemic. The PIs collect data on state governments' decisions to mitigate COVID-19's impact, analyze the adoption and diffusion of pandemic-related policies, track state officials' online discussion of the pandemic, and study health impacts of policies implemented in response to it. This project provides insights into how states manage a global health crisis, the ways that online communication and policy debate involving public officials factor into the contemporary management of a public health emergency, and the public health impacts of rapid innovations in state health policies. It provides comprehensive data sources on state policy activities as well as online communication by state officials. These data are helpful to others who seek to understand the causes and consequences of states' pandemic policies. The project also involves hiring and training a diverse, multidisciplinary team of graduate and undergraduate research assistants as well as a post-doc. The project leaders will provide extensive training, experience, and mentorship to these early career researchers.<br/><br/>State policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have occurred rapidly, with information and choices updated daily. This timeframe provides an opportunity to study the rapid spread of policy responses?two orders of magnitude more frequent than the typical yearly timescale covered in policy diffusion research. The data collected in this study cover hundreds of pandemic-related policies and tens of thousands of policy actions by states, all unfolding over a three-year time period.  The decision environment in which governments select their responses to COVID-19 involves several key components that have been found to be important in the study of the spread of public policy: information, imitation, competition, and coercion. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a rare opportunity to study the spread of public policy with voluminous contemporary information about the factors that influence states' decisions. Specifically, this project uses the recent timeline and high salience of COVID-19 policy to understand the relationship between online communication involving policymakers and official policymaking activity. Because most elected state officials are active online, particularly on Twitter, policy responses to COVID-19 present the opportunity to understand the relationship between online communication by officials and public policymaking. Lastly, to illustrate the utility of the data collected, this project uses a difference-in-differences approach to study the COVID-19 policies? secondary impacts on health. Given that COVID-19 policy responses have affected every facet of public and private life, this project includes a focused study of the impacts of pandemic policy responses on maternal and infant health in the American states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Robotic construction has been increasingly recognized as a promising solution to relieve human workers from dangerous and physically demanding tasks and thus improving productivity and occupational health and safety. However, the unstructured and dynamic workspaces and the diverse and complex construction activities make it extremely difficult to apply industrial robots that are traditionally pre-programmed to conduct a single task in a fixed working environment. This project will advance the understanding of the bi-directional influence and interaction between human and robot when collaborating in complex construction activities in dynamic environments by developing new methods to predict worker intention from their  behavior and adaptively plan robot?s motion considering both job contexts and human dynamics. The developed human-robot collaboration mechanism will provide new opportunities for proactive, adaptive, safe, and productive robotic construction solutions. The new knowledge gained from this research will provide insights on human-robot collaboration in complex and dynamic environments, and can be generalized to other domains, such as search and rescue, agriculture, and manufacturing. This project also involves education and outreach activities to promote broad participation of students, especially those from underrepresented groups, through which younger generations will be motivated to enter the industry and trained with new capabilities to work with high technologies to increase competitiveness of the industry and the nation.<br/><br/>This research will lead to a new paradigm for safe and productive human-robot collaboration in dynamic and uncertain construction workspaces by predicting human intention and motion, estimating robot subtasks, and generating optimal motion trajectory, considering the complex worker-robot-workpiece-workspace interaction.

This project will involve several steps including: the preparation of model Ni-Co and Ni-Rh particles with controlled structures, compositions, and coverages on well-defined CeOx(111) (1.5<x<2) with controlled degrees of Ce reduction (Ce3+/Ce4+); the detailed characterization of their sizes, chemical states, surface sites, metal-metal and metal-ceria interactions; as well as the examination of activation of reactant gases and catalytic performance in DRM ranging from ultrahigh vacuum to reaction conditions. The chemical state of the catalysts and the nature of the active sites under relevant DRM conditions will be investigated using ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in collaboration with Dr. Senanayake at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Professor Zhou will actively engage in efforts to recruit and mentor female students at all levels and encourage their pursuit of career paths in science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project analyzes whether current deplatforming strategies mitigate harmful communication.  The project analyzes whether removing hate speech and extremist actors and communities curbs the spread of malicious content throughout social media. The analysis also can reveal whether whether deplatformed actors regroup on fringe platforms, reappear in potentially larger numbers, grow more cohesive communities, or attract a more extreme following with increased levels of hateful content, perhaps on platforms that do not moderate this content.  Through this research, the project provides a new understanding of how content moderation and deplatforming affect the development of online hate and extremism, leading to the design of effective policies to limit malicious content online.<br/><br/>This project is collecting data on online hate clusters, or groups, across multiple social media platforms.  The project team is constructing a machine-learning tool that can use these data to classify a wide range of hate speech types and targets, and the extent to which social media posts contain these types and targets. The team uses statistical models to analyze the effects of deplatforming events on the use, volume, and toxicity of hate speech, as well as on the extent to which groups reorganize on unmoderated platforms.

Underrepresented and first-generation college students face many structural impediments in higher education such as a lack of awareness on how to become involved in high impact practices like undergraduate research experiences and internships. Undergraduate research has been shown to be a major contributor to student academic success, helping to shape students' sense of belonging in STEM. A major goal of this project is to increase the number of course-based undergraduate research (CURE) laboratories so that more students, including those from underrepresented groups have access to this transformative pedagogical intervention. Students who complete CURE labs will be invited to meet with industry representatives to explore potential internship opportunities. This project aims to determine how experiential learning through CUREs influences student success.<br/><br/>This project will expand CUREs as an approach to provide research opportunities for students interested in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. The plan has two components. First, the department will establish four new faculty-led CURE labs that will engage up to 100 undergraduates. By bridging research and education, this program will create opportunities for students to work with faculty on authentic research projects in cutting edge fields in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. Through embedding research into the curriculum, the project will empower students from groups underrepresented in STEM to become members of the research community. The second part of this project will focus on developing partnerships with biotechnology companies in Silicon Valley to provide student internships. These partnerships will increase the college?s capacity for providing research experiences for undergraduates as well as providing students with important networking opportunities for post-graduation careers. The project will assess student learning in the CURES by examining a student?s understanding of experimental design and their self-reported gains in scientific skills. Finally, the project will examine the impact CUREs have on student achievement by comparing the retention and graduation rates of students enrolled in the CURES to those of students who do not enroll in a CURE. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, given the vast heterogeneity in edge devices, a series of challenges also emerge: (1) How to efficiently generate adaptive AI models to accommodate vast edge system heterogeneity? (2) How to overcome the AI model heterogeneity across edge learning collaboration at the same time? (3) How to unify heterogeneous edge computing systems and provide scalable edge AI support? This project addresses these fundamental challenges with three major research thrusts: Thrust 1 thoroughly investigates the hardware resource consumption of different deep neural network (DNN) operator structures and designs a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method to address the edge heterogeneity down to the architecture level. It significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of edge AI model generation and adaptation. Thrust 2 advances the federated learning technique?s capability with heterogeneous AI models, by revealing the underlying structure-information correlation problem. And therefore, it enables extreme heterogeneous edge collaboration with optimal convergence and communication performance. Thrust 3 renovates the full-stack edge AI system support with hardware abstraction and software virtualization to enhance the system scalability and ease of development for pervasive edge AI development.<br/><br/>With these thrusts completed, this project could achieve a joint innovation with deep learning, computing system, edge collaboration techniques, and related edge AI applications. Regarding its significant advantages of flexibility and feasibility, we name this framework as ?Liquid Intelligence?. With the success of this project, a pervasive and continuous edge AI ecosystem could be targeted, boosting the next wave of AI applications, edge computing, as well as other technologies.

The light-initiated movement of protons has myriad chemical implications, including in the harnessing of solar energy. The goal of this research is to study how the chemical characteristics of these molecules and their environment affect their ability to exchange protons effectively, information that will be used to design photo-acids and photo-bases for targeted applications. The project will be conducted by a team of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds, supporting an inclusive research culture that fosters science identity and belonging in students. Laboratory modules will be created and embedded into courses to introduce students to the field of photochemistry, and students will have the opportunity to become part of the broader scientific community through collaborative research projects and meetings.  <br/><br/>Photo-acids and photo-bases allow temporal and spatial control of proton donation and abstraction via light. Designing photo-acids and photo-bases for desired applications requires a fundamental understanding of the driving forces and solvent parameters that promote excited state proton transfer (ESPT). The proposed project utilizes the chemical modularity of Schiff base chemistry to build photo-acids and photo-bases for detailed mechanistic studies of ESPT and excited state intramolecular proton transfer. Inherent in this design is a carbon-nitrogen double bond capable of photo-isomerization that can potentially trigger a structural rearrangement coupled to ESPT. In this project, Aim 1 will test whether the Schiff base template provides a suitable scaffold for naphthol photo-acid derivatives. Aim 2 will test whether the Schiff base template provides a suitable scaffold for quinoline photo-base derivatives.

Supported by this CAREER award, Fan and his group will use over two decades of earthquake data from large arrays of seismometers to characterize properties of the Cascadia Subduction Zone fault, as well as subduction faults in Japan and Alaska. They will investigate how fault zone properties in all three locations correspond to earthquake slip behaviors, which is necessary to forecast future megathrust earthquake ruptures and their potential impacts.

Understanding the source processes of various slip events at subduction zones can illuminate heterogeneous stress and strength conditions along the subduction interface. Imaging fine-scale material properties can also offer insights into physical mechanisms that may regulate the development of various types of slip events. This award will investigate these two aspects simultaneously by systematically detecting, locating, and modeling very low frequency earthquakes at megathrust seismogenic patch edges, resolving finite-source attributes of small to moderate magnitude earthquakes, and imaging fault zone properties with high-frequency body wave phases. Collectively, the results will be used to track spatiotemporal evolutions of the fault zone environments and unravel the interaction and triggering processes among different slip events. The award will comparatively study three subduction zones, including the Japan, Cascadia, and Alaska subduction zones, using both onshore and offshore seismic records. The expected findings on small-scale properties might be universal to all megathrust faults, while findings on stress and strength heterogeneities could inform future hazards at Cascadia and Alaska based on the knowledge from the Japan subduction zone.

This opportunity to learn from an ongoing pandemic and inform choices in the future requires extensive and timely data gathering. U.S. state governments have taken tens of thousands of public policy actions?executive orders, regulations, and laws in response to COVID-19. This project advances our understanding of the causes and consequences of states' policy responses to the pandemic. The PIs collect data on state governments' decisions to mitigate COVID-19's impact, analyze the adoption and diffusion of pandemic-related policies, track state officials' online discussion of the pandemic, and study health impacts of policies implemented in response to it. This project provides insights into how states manage a global health crisis, the ways that online communication and policy debate involving public officials factor into the contemporary management of a public health emergency, and the public health impacts of rapid innovations in state health policies. It provides comprehensive data sources on state policy activities as well as online communication by state officials. These data are helpful to others who seek to understand the causes and consequences of states' pandemic policies. The project also involves hiring and training a diverse, multidisciplinary team of graduate and undergraduate research assistants as well as a post-doc. The project leaders will provide extensive training, experience, and mentorship to these early career researchers.<br/><br/>State policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have occurred rapidly, with information and choices updated daily. This timeframe provides an opportunity to study the rapid spread of policy responses?two orders of magnitude more frequent than the typical yearly timescale covered in policy diffusion research. The data collected in this study cover hundreds of pandemic-related policies and tens of thousands of policy actions by states, all unfolding over a three-year time period.  The decision environment in which governments select their responses to COVID-19 involves several key components that have been found to be important in the study of the spread of public policy: information, imitation, competition, and coercion. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a rare opportunity to study the spread of public policy with voluminous contemporary information about the factors that influence states' decisions. Specifically, this project uses the recent timeline and high salience of COVID-19 policy to understand the relationship between online communication involving policymakers and official policymaking activity. Because most elected state officials are active online, particularly on Twitter, policy responses to COVID-19 present the opportunity to understand the relationship between online communication by officials and public policymaking. Lastly, to illustrate the utility of the data collected, this project uses a difference-in-differences approach to study the COVID-19 policies? secondary impacts on health. Given that COVID-19 policy responses have affected every facet of public and private life, this project includes a focused study of the impacts of pandemic policy responses on maternal and infant health in the American states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, ASE analysis serves as a powerful analytical tool to determine expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and to study a variety of biological processes such as imprinting, protein-truncating variants, and X-chromosome inactivation. The recently established RNA-sequencing technology (RNA-seq) provides an accurate and efficient way to quantitatively measure ASE. However, the sequencing reads generated from current technologies are not full-length. Hence, computational methods are needed to reconstruct the full-length mRNAs expressed from the two different alleles that exist on homologous chromosomes, a problem referred to as allele-specific transcript assembly. Allele-specific transcript assembly is exceedingly difficult. <br/><br/>Allel-specific transcript assembly is difficult because it requires simultaneously threading mutations and splice junctions while inferring unknown number of full-length transcripts and their abundances. This project aims to develop accurate allele-specific transcript assembly methods that are applicable to short-reads, long-reads, and single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, these investigators first tackle how to use phased SNPs (i.e., mutations) to improve allele-specific assembly. they show that, phased SNPs can be equivalently represented as incompatible pairs of vertices in a so-called variant splice graph. Then heuristics are proposed to solve a formulation with incompatible pairs included. Long-range information will be used in paired-/multi-end RNA-seq data to improve allele-specific assembly, with an algorithm that decomposes the variant splice graph into paths while fully preserving the paired-/multi-end constraints. The allele-specific assembly will be solved in the presence of structure variations, a crucial scenario in studying cancer. A new data structure will model SNPs, alternative splicing, and structure variations all together. A new algorithms is also proposed to identify allele-specific structure variations, which is of independent interests but also leads to a two-step algorithm for allele-specific assembly. Covariate-adaptive multiple hypothesis testing will control false positive rates. Implementing these algorithms result in accurate allele-specific transcript assemblers for various types of data and a new ASE analysis pipeline for broader use. The proposed research is well integrated with educational activities. High-school curricula will be developed that focus on using graph structure--a key abstract in mathematics and computer science--to model biological data. High school teachers will be provided opportunities to conduct interdisciplinary research related to transcript assembly. New undergraduate course will be developed with a focus to enhance students? ability in modeling and solving real-world problems. Efforts will also be made to engage undergraduates and graduate students from underrepresented groups in research opportunities.

Graphs provide a universal representation for a variety of data including online social networks, knowledge graphs, transportation networks, and chemical compounds. Entities can usually be represented as nodes while their relations can be denoted represented as edges. Many important real-world applications on these data can be treated as computational tasks on graphs. A crucial step to facilitate these tasks is to learn good vector representations either for nodes or graphs. Recently, graph neural networks, which generalize deep learning techniques to graphs, have been widely adopted to learning representations for graphs. Though graph neural networks have advanced numerous real-world applications from various fields, they still suffer from many limitations in terms of efficacy and efficiency.  This project aims to address these limitations by conducting theoretical analysis and developing innovative algorithms. This project is specifically motivated by applications to computational social science, computational biology, and fraud detection in e-commerce. Furthermore, this project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in pursuing their theses or honor projects. Discoveries and research findings of this project will be tightly integrated into several current and new courses at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into two tasks corresponding to the two major building components of graph neural networks: graph filtering operations and graph pooling operations. The graph filtering operation aims to refine node representations for all nodes in a graph. On the other hand, the graph pooling operation aims to summarize node representations to obtain a graph representation. The first task aims to investigate graph filtering operations under heterophily?a setting typically poses great challenges for graph filtering operations. In particular, the investigator will conduct theoretical analyses on graph filtering operations to gain deeper insights into their intrinsic mechanism, especially under the scenario of heterophily. Then, based on these understandings, more advanced graph neural networks models will be proposed to handle heterophilous graphs. The second task aims to develop more efficient and effective graph pooling operations. The investigators will explore and develop graph pooling operations based on clustering and down-sampling process. To improve the efficacy and efficiency of the graph pooling operations, the clustering/down-sampling process will be nicely incorporated into the entire learning framework in an end-to-end way.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Successful completion should result in novel PROTAC-CID inducible gene expression platforms for multiplex gene regulations in living eukaryotic cells. These systems will provide deep insights into the approaches to achieve high-induction and low basal-level gene expressions.

These fluid forms can be bulk liquids, thin sheets, filaments, bubbles, foams, droplets, and aerosols, all of which exhibit mixed-dimensional geometric features, highly nonlinear evolution, and vastly contrasting scales.  Because these fluid manifestations constitute the diverse, complex, and in many cases invisible pathways for disease transmission in the physical world, the ability to simulate them with high fidelity, and the accessibility of these simulations to the public, would not only help families, schools, and small businesses solve their different problems but would also pave the way for fundamental advances in hygiene-related science. This research will develop the computational infrastructure to simulate fluid phenomena such as sneezing mucus, splash plumes, and hand-washing foam, which have been out of reach for visual and scientific computing due to their interleaving dynamic and geometric complexities. Project outcomes will have broad impact by making it possible to create novel scientific animations, educational illustrations, and interactive design tools, which jointly support an inclusive and accessible platform that allows scientists, engineers, healthcare professionals and STEM students to investigate these complex flow processes in highly individualized settings.<br/><br/>This research will advance the state of the art in computer graphics and scientific computing by establishing a novel set of computational methods to tackle flow phenomena that were previously understudied or intractable. These fluid systems consist of different substances such as mucus, saliva, or biosurfactants, that exhibit intricate geometries such as thin films, filaments, foam, and extremely small droplets, and that encompass multi-physics processes such as thin sheet fragmentation, vortex-capillary interaction, and fluid contact. The project aims to enable the accurate simulations of complex interfacial fluid phenomena characterized by these thin, dynamic, and non-manifold flow features on the mesoscopic length scale between 0.1 micrometer and 1 millimeter. At this intermediate length scale, fluids exhibit complicated flow dynamics and geometric forms due to the interaction between surface tension and other physical ingredients which are remarkably different from their macroscopic or microscopic counterparts (for instance, fluid can bounce, walk, glide, contact, or form non-manifold foam structures which are difficult for conventional approaches to simulate). The work will bridge this scientific gap by leading multifaceted efforts to develop novel geometric data structures, non-manifold interface tracking algorithms, structure-preserving PDE gauge formulations, multiphase coupling schemes and parallel numerical solvers, all of which will be integrated into a unified simulation framework to boost a broad range of hygiene-related applications centered around these flow processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This opportunity to learn from an ongoing pandemic and inform choices in the future requires extensive and timely data gathering. U.S. state governments have taken tens of thousands of public policy actions?executive orders, regulations, and laws in response to COVID-19. This project advances our understanding of the causes and consequences of states' policy responses to the pandemic. The PIs collect data on state governments' decisions to mitigate COVID-19's impact, analyze the adoption and diffusion of pandemic-related policies, track state officials' online discussion of the pandemic, and study health impacts of policies implemented in response to it. This project provides insights into how states manage a global health crisis, the ways that online communication and policy debate involving public officials factor into the contemporary management of a public health emergency, and the public health impacts of rapid innovations in state health policies. It provides comprehensive data sources on state policy activities as well as online communication by state officials. These data are helpful to others who seek to understand the causes and consequences of states' pandemic policies. The project also involves hiring and training a diverse, multidisciplinary team of graduate and undergraduate research assistants as well as a post-doc. The project leaders will provide extensive training, experience, and mentorship to these early career researchers.<br/><br/>State policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have occurred rapidly, with information and choices updated daily. This timeframe provides an opportunity to study the rapid spread of policy responses?two orders of magnitude more frequent than the typical yearly timescale covered in policy diffusion research. The data collected in this study cover hundreds of pandemic-related policies and tens of thousands of policy actions by states, all unfolding over a three-year time period.  The decision environment in which governments select their responses to COVID-19 involves several key components that have been found to be important in the study of the spread of public policy: information, imitation, competition, and coercion. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a rare opportunity to study the spread of public policy with voluminous contemporary information about the factors that influence states' decisions. Specifically, this project uses the recent timeline and high salience of COVID-19 policy to understand the relationship between online communication involving policymakers and official policymaking activity. Because most elected state officials are active online, particularly on Twitter, policy responses to COVID-19 present the opportunity to understand the relationship between online communication by officials and public policymaking. Lastly, to illustrate the utility of the data collected, this project uses a difference-in-differences approach to study the COVID-19 policies? secondary impacts on health. Given that COVID-19 policy responses have affected every facet of public and private life, this project includes a focused study of the impacts of pandemic policy responses on maternal and infant health in the American states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key driver of ice loss in the polar regions is the wave-induced erosion of icebergs, glaciers, and ice-shelf fronts. While rapid progress has been made in recent years in understanding a number of ice decay processes, wave erosion at the waterline of ice cliffs has not been studied in detail. This project will conduct an in-depth investigation of wave erosion in a laboratory setting, with the goal to provide new insight on how ice cliffs erode and improve the representation of these processes in large-scale ocean and climate simulations. The primary focus is on icebergs since wave erosion is most impactful in the open ocean environment. However, many of the findings will apply directly to glacier and ice-shelf fronts. In addition to its scientific significance, the project will train two graduate students at the forefront of climate science. A further aim is to construct a basic wave flume for educational purposes and involve K-12 teachers in the study through summer research experiences.  <br/><br/>How ice cliffs decay is one of the most ardently researched questions in the cryosphere. A key driver of ice loss that has garnered relatively little attention in this context is wave-induced erosion. Wave action at the sides of icebergs and at the fronts of water-terminating glaciers and ice shelves can cause ice loss in several ways: (i) Waves mix meltwater and ambient water, efficiently transport heat toward the ice, and accelerate melt at the waterline. (ii) The resultant incisions at the waterline can lead to failure of the overhanging ice cliff. (iii) The remaining submerged ice is buoyant, and the induced stresses can trigger full-depth calving events. This project aims to conduct the first detailed investigation of these processes in a laboratory setting, which will be used to guide new theoretical considerations and the development of a revised iceberg erosion parameterization to be implemented in comprehensive ocean models. The primary objectives of this work are two-fold: (1) To gain insight into the fundamental physics of wave erosion and derive theoretical relationships between melt rates and environmental conditions. (2) To develop a decay parameterization that accounts for the processes (i)-(iii) above with the aim to reduce the uncertainty associated with ice loss in model projections. This constitutes an important next step toward the larger goal of more accurate climate projections and improved estimates of future sea level rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems, however, increasingly operate in the presence of ubiquitous and diverse forms of data and asynchronous, often irregular workflows. Foundational knowledge about how to leverage such data streams in designing and controlling the behavior of the next generation of critical systems, including those meant to assist humans in data-intensive situations, is lacking.

Next, it derives conditions on the sampling that preserve observability and enable probabilistic optimal sampling subject to uncertainty. Finally, an outer loop controller based on the Youla-Kucera parameterization is tailored to achieve high-performance tracking beyond the Nyquist frequency of the individual sensors.

In order to cause an infection, the virus must first pass from the respiratory tract through a layer of molecular thickness, the lung surfactant film, into the lung. The passage through the lung surfactant film is a process that is not well understood because the coronavirus and lung surfactant film continuously affect and remodel each other. The lung surfactant film is a complex and fragile nanoscale biomaterial that consists mostly of surfactant molecules. Certain types of surfactant molecules are capable of destabilizing and breaking up the coronavirus. This capability may be utilized by the medical administration of exogenous surfactants in surfactant therapy, which is currently being tested in clinical trials as a COVID-19 treatment approach. This award supports computational research and educational activities to study in detail and on a molecular level how SARS-CoV-2 and its variants adhere to the lung surfactant film, how the virus particle is capable of passing through the film, and how surfactant molecules affect this process. The computational research method, known as molecular dynamics, is applied with the goal to learn how pathophysiological behavior can emerge from the material properties of lung surfactant layer and associated coronavirus particles. The materials-centric approach places this research at the interface between condensed matter physics and biology. Among the broader impacts is the potential to inform the search for novel therapeutic pathways that inhibit coronavirus activity by using exogenous surfactants. Educational and mentoring aspects of this project include training graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds and developing teaching modules on the modeling of complex biological nanoscale systems. The developed simulation codes will be made available for the scientific community through curated data repositories. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>COVID-19 is transmitted by inhaling airborne coronavirus particles, SARS-CoV-2, which penetrate the respiratory system and cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that can lead to lung failure. SARS-CoV-2 virions are spheroidal nanoparticles, with a lipid bilayer envelope of about 85 nanometer diameter decorated by a ?crown? of 20 nanometer long spike protein protrusions. Whereas our knowledge of the biochemical structure and functions of SARS-CoV-2 is quickly growing, the interfacial properties of the virions, as nanoparticles interacting with the respiratory system environment, have not been addressed and are poorly understood. Bridging this knowledge gap is important for informing clinical studies on surfactant therapies to treat SARS by administering exogenous surfactants. This project aims at using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to explore the fundamental mechanisms of interactions of SARS-CoV-2 virions with lung surfactant films and their fate in the respiratory system. Consideration of SARS-CoV-2 virions and the lung surfactant film as nanoscale multifunctional biomaterials that interact within the respiratory system environment represents the main methodological novelty of the project. The PI will (a) develop original coarse-grained computational models of SARS-CoV-2 virions and lung surfactant films, (b) establish in-silico the molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 virion interfacial interactions with lung surfactant films and exogenous biosurfactants, and (c) explore the effects of these interactions on the stability of lung surfactant films and the fate of SARS-CoV-2 virions in the respiratory system. The project will produce multiscale computational models of interfacial processes involving SARS-CoV-2 variants to address the currently unresolved questions: (1) how sorption of lung surfactant lipids and proteins affects the envelope membrane and spike proteins, (2) how SARS-CoV-2 virions affect the integrity and stability of lung surfactant films, (3) if detergent activity and sorption of pulmonary and exogenous surfactants can induce lysis of the viral envelope, and (4) to what extent the difference in specifics of lung surfactant interactions with mutated SARS-CoV-2 virions may explain why some coronavirus variants cause more infections and spread faster than others. Special attention will be paid to the differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants with respect to adhesion of pulmonary and exogenous surfactants. Answers to these questions will advance fundamental understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virions and lung surfactant films as interacting nanoscale biomaterials and may have clinical implications for the selection of exogenous surfactants for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. The PI expects the project will have an interdisciplinary transformative impact by advancing computational studies of pathophysiological behavior and fate of coronavirus virions in pulmonary environment, surfactant-induced inhibition of the viral activity, as well as adhesion and translocation of synthetic virion-type drug carrier nanoparticles through cell membranes and other physiological interfaces. The proposed research will support diversity, train graduate and undergraduate students, and produce modules on the modeling of complex biological nanoscale systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Drawing from existing and to-be-created databases, the overarching goal of this project is to identify and understand what demographic, behavioral, and linguistic factors initially spark suspicion and trigger dangerous confirmation bias processes leading to false convictions. We focus on one of the earliest moments in which a person might become a suspect: when they call 911. A key hypothesis is that when witnesses? behaviors violate expectations, people ?morally typecast? the witness as less capable of being a victim and more capable of being a perpetrator. Increasing basic understanding on how these expectations are formed, how they are violated, and how they interact with witnesses? gender and race, is a critical step towards predicting whether callers are ultimately charged with the crime they are reporting. Moreover, understanding how these processes emerge will be critical in developing state-of-the-art curriculum to educate police about their expectations? accuracy and consequences, and to educate attorneys on defending clients they believe to be innocent. Given the serious consequences that false convictions have on both innocent individuals and the public trust in the criminal justice system at large, the project?s focus has broad societal impact by systematically investigating the source of detectives? misguided ?hunches? that have anecdotally led to false convictions.   <br/><br/>This study employs a variety of data-driven methods to identify predictors of suspicion and being charged with the crime one is reporting. First, we will create a large corpus of real 911 calls to analyze linguistic and acoustic behavioral aspects of reporting a violent crime to see if laypeople and law enforcements? expectations are accurate. We will recruit lay people, police officers, 911 operators, and trauma clinicians to listen to these calls and report their impressions of the caller to identify what aspects of reporting a violent crime generates suspicion and predicts actually becoming a suspect in the crime. We will identify psychological explanations for these effects as well as factors that might moderate these effects, such the caller?s race and gender. Across studies, we will use indirect, data-driven ways of assessing what makes people suspicious without imposing the researchers? hypotheses on the design, such as using natural language processing machine-learning models. We will also test downstream consequences of witnesses? emotion expression in a 911 call for the likelihood of being falsely convicted at trial for the crime they reported. Finally, we will quantitatively code cases of known innocence (exoneree case files) for what sparked suspicion about the innocent person, focusing on mentions of their behavior seeming ?unusual?.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work will be the first experimental study to focus on the fabrication and characterization of spin FETs that leverage screw dislocations in single srystal-crystalline semiconductors. A screw dislocation is a type of crystal defect that promises to act as a suitable channel for a spin transistor that operates at variable temperatures  (i.e., room temperature and above) for commercial, industrial, and military applications. The improved knowledge and technological advances generated in this project will potentially accelerate very-large-scale integration of high-performance spintronic devices, which is required for the practical realization of hybrid and entirely spin-based classical and quantum computers. This program will also benefit society by impacting science, technology, engineering, and math  (STEM) education. Experiential exhibits that will target K-12 students and the public will be established to increase engagement in STEM. As such, this work will have a wide-ranging impact by communicating the value of nanoscience, nanotechnology, and spintronics to a broad audience.<br/><br/>The research effort encompasses three strongly overlapping intellectual threads: (i) fabrication and structural characterization of spin FETs embedded screw dislocations(SDs); (ii) characterization of gate-tunable spin transport; (iii) investigation of process-structure-property relationships in the fabricated spin FETs. The operation of the proposed spin FET is based on controlling the spin lifetime in screw dislocations channels using a gate voltage. Two opposite aligned spin-selective ferromagnetic/semiconductor contacts will be placed at the two ends of a screw dislocation. As the spin lifetime in the dislocation core is expected to be long, the transistor will be in an OFF state in this condition. Under an applied gate voltage, spin-polarization can be tailored to allow transport from one ferromagnetic contact to another, putting the transistor in an ON state. The ratio between the spin lifetime and the relaxation time will determine the ON/OFF ratio of the device. Spin FETs designs that rely on controlling spin lifetimes have been proposed before. However, these devices have not found practical uses due to the requirement of large (>100 ms) spin relaxation times at room temperature. Screw dislocation channels can overcome this limitation owing to a unique form of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) that promises to increase spin lifetimes even at high temperatures, thereby enabling the practical application of the proposed spin FET design. Briefly, the interplay between Rashba and Dresselhaus SOC in screw dislocations of materials with medium ionicity makes spin polarization scattering resistant. The technical plan relies on the controlled synthesis of a screw dislocations network by annealing ultra-compliant twisted bicrystals or two single-crystalline nanomembranes (NMs) that have been previously overlayed with a controlled twist angle. NMs will provide more uniform interfacial bonding than their bulk counterpart, expand the palette of semiconductor hosts of screw dislocations to include epitaxially grown alloys, and increase the ON/OFF ratio of the transistor by reducing the transit time of the carriers.  Dislocated NMs will be processed in spin FETs, and the process-structure property relationships of the devices will be evaluated. The focus will be on SDs in SiC NMs as theoretical predictions have shown that a fixed spin orientation, which is robust against all forms of electron scattering, can be obtained in this material.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite longstanding and intensive research by the scientific community, several key aspects of the earthquake rupture process remain poorly understood. This project focuses on understanding the physical origin of the high-frequency seismic energy that is generated during the rupture process as earthquake faults slip past one another. These advances in scientific understanding have broad implications for earthquake hazard mitigation, informing how future building design codes should be constructed in order to prevent earthquake damage to vulnerable structures. The project also supports early career scientists and provides research opportunities to traditionally underrepresented groups in the geosciences. Through targeted outreach efforts, the project will engage high school students from a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds, with an aim toward experiential learning that will guide them in their future careers.<br/><br/>The physical origins for high-frequency ground motions have traditionally been explained in terms of a frictional model that postulates that frictional processes during fault slip determine rupture properties like stress drop, which in turn control shaking amplitudes. However, these classical frictional models often struggle to explain many aspects of the high-frequency ground motions observed in nature. This discrepancy has led to the hypothesis that elastic impacts of fault-zone structures that occur to accommodate the geometric complexity of fault systems may play an important role in the generation of high-frequency ground motions. The project will explicitly test this hypothesis using three sets of seismological observations ? corner frequencies, radiation patterns, and the ratio of S-wave to P-wave radiated energy ? for which the frictional and impact models make distinctly different predictions. This work has a number of important implications for our understanding of the physics of earthquake rupture, including determining the degree to which detailed measurements of fault zone structure are needed to make accurate ground motion predictions, revising the physical interpretation of seismological stress drop estimates, and constraining the degree of wave scattering in the Earth?s crust. These advances, taken holistically, will provide crucial observational constraints for future earthquake hazard mitigation efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

College students often find introductory level mathematics courses to be very challenging, and these courses can create barriers that slow down the progress of STEM majors in their degree programs. Mathematics education researchers have argued for significant revisions to undergraduate course structure and faculty development to improve student learning outcomes in these foundational courses. This project will create and assess the effectiveness of a new faculty professional development program that will help mathematics faculty implement UDL in introductory mathematics courses. UDL provides guidelines for using teaching strategies that account for the diversity of learners and seek to improve student accessibility to course content. The research team aims to develop and test a new instrument to assess the degree to which UDL is being used in courses. The project will create two faculty workshops to prepare mathematics faculty to implement UDL in their courses.

Currently, the observed warming in the Arctic is almost twice that of the Northern Hemisphere as a whole. A major concern is that further warming of this region could potentially weaken the North Atlantic circulation, which will have a profound influence on climate in Europe and North America. In order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that control the rate and magnitude of future climate change on the Northern Hemisphere, we need to acquire robust data from past climate events from this region that can be compared to current observations and help with future predictions. Much of our knowledge of the Earth?s past climate is deduced from chemical analysis of fossil foraminifera shells recovered from drill cores. Foraminifera, which are ubiquitous in the World?s Oceans, are small organisms that form a sand-grain-sized calcium carbonate (calcite) shell. At the end of their life cycle, the empty shell is deposited on the seafloor where it can be preserved for tens of millions of years. While the approach to reconstruct past climate events from fossil foraminifera shells, which was developed in the 1950s and continuously improved over many decades, works well in low- and mid-latitude oceans, deducing accurate past temperatures from foraminifera shells from the Polar North Atlantic remains challenging. Pilot data from fossil foraminifera shells (species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma) from the Polar North Atlantic acquired for this study reveal that the so-called ?lamellar calcite?, which is the early generation of shell calcite that forms in the upper water column and provides a ?near-surface? signal, is often partially or largely dissolved. Thus, the remaining shell comprises mostly the later-formed outer ?crust calcite?, which records environmental conditions from much greater (typically colder) water depths. As affected shells look unsuspicious ? the loss of the lamellar calcite is not visible from the outside when inspected by microscope ? shells that have lost their lamellar calcite have likely been selected for analysis in many prior studies. We hypothesize that temperature reconstructions from shells with dissolved lamellar calcite are biased towards colder temperatures. Fortunately, shells with well-preserved lamellar calcite are typically co-occurring with those featuring poor preservation in the same core samples and can thus be selected for analysis. This study aims to carefully select shells with intact lamellar calcite (preserved near-surface signal), and the ratio of Magnesium/Calcium of the lamellar calcite as a chemical recorder of past temperatures will be measured. This is a significant deviation from conventional analytical approaches that average the composition of the whole shell with an unknown proportion of lamellar calcite (warm near-surface signal) and crust calcite (cold deep-water signal). The analytical approach, which will be developed within the framework of this study, has the potential to significantly improve the veracity of paleorecords from the Polar North Atlantic, which is essential to gauge the response of this sensitive region to future greenhouse gas forcing. <br/><br/><br/>Part 2: Climate change in the polar North Atlantic occurs at a much higher rate than most other areas of the World?s Oceans. Therefore, accurate records of past climate variability from this area are essential to improve forecasts of how this sensitive region will react in future scenarios with enhanced greenhouse gas forcing. However, even after decades of research, paleoclimate records from the polar North Atlantic leave many questions unanswered and often do not align with results from model simulations. <br/>The vast majority of sea surface temperature records, reflecting past climate variability, are derived from fossil shells of planktic foraminifera; minute, single-celled organisms which are ubiquitous in the World?s Oceans. A characteristic feature of foraminifera is their sand-grain-sized calcium carbonate (calcite) shell which is eventually deposited on the seafloor where it can be preserved for tens of millions of years. Fossil shells can be recovered from drill cores, and subsequent analyses of their chemical or isotopic composition allows for the reconstruction of the water temperature (and other parameters) that persisted while the shells were formed. This approach to reconstruct paleotemperatures works very well outside the polar regions. One of the main objectives of this study is to assess whether certain characteristics of the foraminifera species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, which is the only abundant foraminifera in high latitude sediments, contribute to the challenges to deduce robust paleorecords from the Polar North Atlantic. <br/>Pilot data acquired for this study indicate that the so-called inner ?lamellar calcite? of fossil N. pachyderma shells, which is the early generation of calcite that forms in the upper water column (typically warmer temperatures), is often largely dissolved, whereas the outer ?crust calcite?, which forms in much deeper waters and thus typically reflects colder temperatures, is still well preserved. Interestingly, this loss of the lamellar calcite is not visible from the outside when the shells are inspected by microscope. Thus, it is likely that shells with dissolved lamellar calcite were selected for analysis in many prior studies, which may have biased the calculated temperatures towards the cooler, deeper waters where the remaining outer crust was formed. Fortunately, we have found that shells with well-preserved lamellar calcite are typically co-occurring with those featuring poor preservation.<br/>The objective of this study is to develop new screening methods to carefully select N. pachyderma shells featuring well-preserved lamellar calcite. Subsequently, the lamellar calcite, which has formed near the sea surface, will be analyzed by laser-ablation for its Magnesium/Calcium (Mg/Ca) ratio, which can be converted to the water temperatures that persisted in the past when the foraminifera formed their shells. This is a significant deviation from conventional approaches that use the entire shell, whereby the information recorded in the lamellar calcite (near-surface signal) is mixed with the composition of the crust calcite (deep water signal). Thus, conventional analytical approaches may not capture the entire temperature variation at or near the sea surface. The analytical approach, which will be developed within the framework of this study, has the potential to significantly improve the veracity of paleorecords from the Polar North Atlantic, which is essential to gauge the response of this sensitive region to future greenhouse gas forcing. This new technique will further be tested on two sediment cores from the Polar North Atlantic, spanning the past ~26,000 years from the coldest temperatures of the last ice age to the modern, much warmer climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These challenges stem from the rarity of precisely dated sites that preserve the archaeological and paleoenvironmental data needed to disentangle natural and human system interactions.

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) transforms organic wastes into liquid biofuels by processing the waste in water at high temperature and pressure. One advantage of HTL over other biomass conversion techniques is that it directly treats wet wastes without an energy-intensive pre-drying step. To date, the majority of HTL research has explored the impact of process conditions on products generated from a range of biomass feedstocks. However, this research approach cannot overcome the primary challenges to widespread application of HTL for biofuels, namely that (1) product distributions cannot be accurately controlled or predicted, resulting in the need for significant downstream upgrading of the biocrude, and (2) the byproduct process water requires considerable treatment. These two challenges combine to make current large-scale HTL economically infeasible. The new approach to process design proposed in this project, however, could enable widespread implementation of HTL for wet waste to biofuel conversion. The production of such renewable fuels could help transform the U.S. into a green energy exporter and job opportunity creator. To fill such high-tech positions, a diverse workforce is needed. The Principal Investigator (PI) of this proposal has a strong track record training students from under-represented groups; at least one graduate student, one post-doctoral associate, and two undergraduate students will be trained as part of this work. The PI will develop a new course on Sustainable Engineering Design specifically aimed at encouraging and retaining women engineers. Garnering widespread public acceptance and support for policy initiatives promoting biofuels is critical to widespread deployment. To do this, the PI will conduct original survey research to benchmark public knowledge and opinion on biomass-based renewable fuels. Then, by incorporating results from the research into a first-of-its kind survey, the PI will uncover how scientists can best frame messages to increase public support for green energy technologies.<br/><br/>Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a reactive and multiphase biomass conversion process producing supersaturated solutions of aqueous-organic mixtures and a separate organic biocrude phase. HTL process water (PW) contains organic molecules that are either insoluble or beyond their solubility limits, suggesting that as the dielectric constant of the HTL aqueous reaction media changes, it can create a supersaturated solution where sparingly soluble organics remain even after the PW is cooled. It is hypothesized that the selectivity and yields of HTL reactions are a function of this supersaturation degree, which is controlled by the dielectric constant and reaction enthalpies. To confirm and develop this concept, a new apparatus will be constructed to measure the dielectric constant of model molecules and mixtures at HTL-relevant conditions and solubilities of HTL intermediates and products. Using a Design of Experiments approach, the statistically significant relationships between dielectric constant and solubility parameter, and the selectivity and yields of HTL reactions will be explored. The accuracy of thermodynamic models used to predict the solubility of the organics in the aqueous phase and partitioning between the biocrude and organics phase will be improved by incorporating the dielectric constant and solubility measurements. Finally, the research team will investigate how organic compounds in the PW produced in the HTL process can be recovered through a combination of kosmotropic salting out and liquid-liquid extraction using a variety of salts with varying kosmotropic strength. Model HTL products will be examined individually at their solubility limits to estimate the maximum recoveries of each product as a first step towards estimating the separation selectivity in mixtures of these products. This work will lead naturally to the investigation of mixtures of model compounds to determine the degree to which these organics can form their own phase separate from the PW, and the abilities of kosmotropes to salt-out the organic products in a selective manner. This fundamental thermodynamic approach to HTL and product recovery could accelerate the transition to a renewable energy future by facilitating the design of more efficient and selective HTL processes. In addition to the advances made in terms of HTL, the Educational Component of this CAREER proposal will advance the way Introductory Environmental Engineering courses are taught to retain women and minorities in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Learning what happened when climate changed in the past can help predict what could happen over the next 50 years: Which species will become extinct, and why? Is there anything that can be done to protect Arctic species from the impacts of climate change? The goal of this project is to understand what caused the extinctions of giant, ice-age animals like woolly mammoth around the time that the last ice age ended. Some people think they were killed off by people; others say they died because of rapid changes in climate. No one knows for certain, but everyone argues about it. It is not even known when, exactly, these extinctions occurred: Was it 12,000 years ago, or 4000 years ago? This project aims at pin-pointing when the last mammoth, the last steppe bison, and the last tundra lion lived in Alaska. Once it is known for certain when they became extinct, it will be possible to eliminate some of the proposed explanations. For example, it may turn out that herds of mammoths still roamed across Alaska 4000 years ago. Because it is already known that the first people arrived in Alaska around 14,000 years ago, if this project shows that mammoths and people coexisted for 10,000 years, it makes it unlikely that people drove them to extinction. The research proposed here will obtain more precise dates on when the last ice-age mammals lived in Alaska using new methods based on the DNA that is preserved in frozen ground where these animals once lived. All animals (people included) continually shed DNA into the environment in their skin fragments, hair, feces, and urine. Some of these tissue fragments are buried and preserved in the ground. This is especially true in the Arctic where decay is slowed by cold temperatures. The plan is to extract tissue fragments (think: fur and dandruff) from the ground, and then use the DNA it contains to identify which animal species it came from. Next, the soil layer containing this DNA will be dated, and these new dates will be used to test ideas about what caused this species? extinction. By better understanding the causes of extinctions in the past, the Arctic mammals that still survive can be better protected, species like polar bears, musk oxen, and caribou. A major goal of this study is to educate students and high school teachers about climate change, DNA, and ice-age ecology. A particular effort will be made to involve students who are Alaskan Natives. All data will be shared in archives that everyone has free access to, and new discoveries will be shared through scientific publications, newspaper articles, and public lectures. <br/><br/>Arctic ecosystems now lie on the front lines of global change. There is an urgent need to better understand how rapid changes in temperature, sea-ice extent, and land use could impact large-bodied Arctic mammals like musk oxen, polar bears, and caribou. The geological record preserves many examples of what happened to animals and plants when climate changed rapidly during prehistory. Extinctions are of particular interest, because understanding what caused extinctions in the past can help us conserve the planet?s remaining megafauna, many of which are now endangered. A wave of extinctions occurred in the Arctic around the end of the last ice age, 14,000 to 10,000 years ago. This is when most scientists believe that giant ice-age mammals like woolly mammoth, steppe bison, tundra horses, and tundra lions disappeared from mainland Siberia and Alaska; however, no one is sure what caused these extinctions, and many explanations have been proposed. One reason for this debate is that a key piece of information is still missing, namely: When did these species actually go extinct? Unless it is known with precision when an extinction occurred, the various hypotheses about causation cannot be tested. Present understanding of when these extinctions occurred is based on a few hundred radiocarbon dates scattered across the northern continents, and there is a real possibility that the bones of the last woolly mammoth will never be discovered. But now there is a new and better way to detect the presence of now-extinct animals. All animals shed DNA into the environment in their skin fragments, hair, feces, and urine. Some of this DNA is buried and preserved in the ground, especially in the Arctic, where things decay slowly because it is cold. The aim of this project is to extract the ancient DNA of extinct mammals, use it to identify which species it belonged to, and then to date the soil layer where it came from. These new dates can then be used to test ideas about what caused this species? extinction. In this study, emphasis will be placed on educating students and high school teachers about climate change, DNA, and ice-age ecology. A particular effort will be made to involve students who are Alaskan Natives. All our data will be shared in archives that everyone has free access to, and new discoveries will be shared through scientific publications, international conferences, newspaper articles, and public lectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project tests theory from cultural anthropology to investigate how different levels of stakeholder, from individual, to community, to governmental, interact in energy infrastructure planning. It leverages emergent dynamics of unfolding energy initiatives to understand how energy politics is shaped by communities, powerful actors, and the law. Project data will be shared widely and results will be disseminated to academic and non-academic audiences, including policy experts and the public. <br/><br/>The project uses interviews and participant observation to test research hypotheses that investigate how the politics of electricity are evolving as electrification becomes increasingly central to models of energy transition. Specifically, the project studies the motivations, stakes, attitudes and desired outcomes of six study populations: (1) state and local government officials, (2) electrical utility administrators and engineers, (3) energy transition entrepreneurs, (4) critics of electrify everything measures, (5) environmental activists and electrify everything champions, and (6) early adopter homeowners and drivers participating in new and recent electrification initiatives.

Yet, questions remain about how specific changes in rain patterns can cause excess or insufficient water with the potential to beget such crises. There is poor integration between disciplines studying the causes and societal impact of climate change. Climate variables are often directly used as proxies for water availability in climate impact studies, thus missing the important role of hydrology in dampening (or amplifying) the effect of climate change and shaping people's response to it. This project develops the theoretical, empirical, experimental, and educational tools necessary for hydrology to be properly leveraged to understand ? and mitigate ? the societal impacts of climate change. These new tools incorporate four key hydrologic characteristics of climate-related crises that are not currently simultaneously addressed: local scale, non-stationary drivers, human- water feedback, and data-scarcity. The project provides interdisciplinary training for one graduate and nine undergraduate students and creates valuable education and outreach material (including a web-based simulation game) for easy use by researchers, policy makers and community educators outside of hydrology. <br/><br/>In the theoretical realm, the project clarifies the effect of irrigation withdrawals on changing flow regimes by incorporating human- water feedbacks into a widely used process-based probabilistic model of catchment-scale water storage dynamics. In the empirical realm, the project introduces statistical tools to leverage natural experiments for causal inferences in observational studies. This allows hydrological changes in data-limited regions to be attributed ex-post to their natural and anthropogenic drivers. In the experimental and educational realms, the web-based simulation game will serve as an experimental platform to determine the relationship between the properties of hydrological change and water users? response to it. The game will simultaneously serve as an open platform to integrate research, outreach, and education at scale. It will be leveraged for high school and undergraduate education and used to support climate preparedness training for water and policy professionals in the US and abroad.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the GEO/EAR Hydrologic Sciences Program and the SBE/BCS Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences Program, with additional support from the Directorate of Education and Human Resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, a framework is developed for estimating tool grasping compliance matrices of underactuated robotic hands using combined feedback from hand sensors (joint angles and proprioception) and wrist-mounted force and torque sensors. Then, the estimated compliance is used to infer grasping status and stability and to develop novel force control strategies.

These challenges stem from the rarity of precisely dated sites that preserve the archaeological and paleoenvironmental data needed to disentangle natural and human system interactions. This project will resolve this issue by assembling a diversity of high-resolution climatic, environmental, and archaeological datasets to understand the nature of the transition from Middle to Later Stone Age technologies. In addition to addressing fundamental questions about the emergence of behavioral complexity in Homo sapiens, this work builds U.S. scientific research capacity by fostering research links across networks of scholars, and providing a foundation for undergraduate and graduate student training.<br/><br/>The transition from Middle to Later Stone Age technologies is one of the most prominent behavioral shifts observed in Homo sapiens? evolutionary history. Understanding what precipitated this transition is closely intertwined with discussion and debates about the origins of modern human behavior. This project tests the hypothesis that the technological, dietary, and social shifts associated with the Middle to Later Stone Age transition result from climate-driven environmental change, specifically changes in the seasonal distribution of foods and other resources. This work will be accomplished through a combination of (i) archaeological excavations that will document behavioral change across the Middle to Later Stone Age transition, coupled with (ii) the assembly of both local- and regional-scale paleoenvironmental records that will inform on past climate dynamics and its effects on terrestrial ecosystems. The datasets generated in this study will contribute to unresolved questions about modern human origins. They will also enable future research across numerous disciplines, including archaeology, paleontology, paleoecology, and paleoclimatology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how to gain support among those most skeptical in high carbon-emitting economies is key to forming effective policy. This project identifies the material and psychological sources of public support for and resistance to climate mitigation policies around the world. It will develop three new public datasets and associated qualitative materials, encouraging replication and extensions, and contributes to education and research infrastructure. <br/><br/>In wealthy nations, women tend to express more concern about climate change than men.

Researchers from across the natural and social sciences have made great progress in understanding their life ways, how they successfully adapted to the extreme climates of the last ice age, and why they ultimately disappeared millenia  ago. Archaeologists and geoscientists, with their common interests in deep time and human-environment interactions, are particularly well equipped to contribute to the study of Neanderthals. Within this broad context, researchers will lead a three-year study of Neanderthal adaptation to extreme climate variation during the last ice age. The project will contribute to theories about human evolution and the fate of Neanderthal populations, informing on the roles that environmental change, technology, and diet choice played in human evolution. Additional benefits include field and laboratory training, scientific engagement, and cultural enrichment for student participants who will join an interdisciplinary research team in an international setting. Many of the students involved in this project will be first-generation college students from under-represented, working poor, and rural demographic groups in Kentucky and eastern North Carolina who may not otherwise have opportunities for international travel. <br/><br/>This project is designed to address the fundamental question: do temporal variations in Neanderthal land use, demography, technology, and diet represent responses to extreme climate shifts during the last ice age? The project team will address this question by developing complementary archaeological, chronological, and paleoenvironmental datasets from the ongoing excavation at a Neanderthal archaeological site) and integrating them with local and regional climate records. Previous work at the site has established that the cave preserves rich cultural deposits and non-cultural faunal remains, including biomolecular compounds such as ancient DNA. Lithic artifact and animal bone assemblages will provide a robust record of changes in Neanderthal technology and raw material selection that can be directly synchronized with paleoclimate records, and with seasonality indicators from stable isotope analyses of associated faunal remains from the same stratigraphic position. The proposed methodology uses radiocarbon and uranium-series dating to establish age control, stone tool analyses to understand the decision-making of Paleolithic humans, animal bone assemblages to reconstruct paleoenvironments and understand Neanderthal diets, and sedimentological analyses to infer site formation processes and environmental context of human occupation. Taken together, the work will establish a complete paleoenvironmental and geoarchaeological chronology for Neanderthal site adaptations, providing critical context that is missing from many other sites in the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the strategies used by the first people to settle such a region.

The results of this study will help illuminate the adaptive processes used by pioneering groups in the Americas and will have relevance to other peopling processes in human history. This project will contribute as well by using previously excavated archaeological collections: many archaeological sites are excavated but then never thoroughly analyzed, leading to a loss of research potential and money spent excavating and housing site collections, especially as available museum storage space declines. The use of museum collections is especially important in this case, as they may include rare examples of a fundamental process of human history.  <br/><br/>To investigate the adaptive strategies of the early populations in this region, research will focus on six sites found across the study area. These sites are part of a group of unique, large basecamp sites with complex spatial patterning that occur throughout the region. While these base camps must have been occupied soon after the region was populated, their exact relationship to the broader peopling process is still unclear. Stone tool raw material source representation and procurement patterns, as inferred from macroscopic source analyses and geochemical source analyses, will provide information on landscape familiarity and mobility patterns. Stone tool technological analyses, including tool and projectile point morphology, tool diversity, and tool use diversity, will be used to infer mobility patterns, site activities, and technological strategies meant to mitigate risk, with the assumption that risk minimization strategies will be more pronounced at sites in which people were less familiar with the surrounding landscape.

This is because higher rainfall and warming increase runoff from land to coastal waters. Runoff also influences coastal algal blooms. These changes are expected to alter the distribution of mercury in the water and impact its availability for biological uptake. Mercury is a potent toxin. Its uptake into the food web contaminates fish and seafood and affects human health. This project will study how organic matter delivered from land to coastal waters affects mercury concentrations in seawater and in the food webs of the Gulf of Maine. The Gulf of Maine is one of the largest and most important coastal fishing grounds in the United States. This project will measure the concentration and isotopes of mercury on samples collected from research cruises under different algal bloom conditions and river flows. Lab experiments will be used to study how land-derived organic matter affects mercury accumulation in plankton. The project will provide research experiences for four undergraduate students in a STEM field. Training will be provided to a PhD student and a postdoctoral fellow. Findings from the project will provide critical information about the effect of climate change on mercury levels in marine waters and food webs. This information is needed for achieving the goals of the Minamata Convention, a global treaty for reducing mercury emissions to the environment.<br/><br/>This project will examine the effects of climate change on terrestrial organic matter and mercury concentrations in Gulf of Maine waters. Specifically, the scientists will study the complex and often competing processes that influence: 1) mercury cycling and distribution; 2) the formation of methylmercury; and 3) methylmercury uptake to microplankton. Terrestrial organic matter plays an important role in transferring mercury from watersheds to coastal and offshore waters. It also controls the formation of methylmercury in water by providing a microenvironment that promotes the methylation of mercury by microbes, which represents the first step for uptake of methylmercury into seafood. However, some plankton can directly use organic matter as a food source (so-called ?mixotrophs?) and can bioaccumulate methylmercury during feeding. Mixotrophs can dominate microplankton assemblages in coastal waters at some times of the year, and previous studies have not explored the impact of this feeding mode on methylmercury uptake at the base of the food web. This project will study the effects of organic matter dynamics on mercury and methylmercury cycling and bioaccumulation through 1) field surveys and shipboard experiments in the Gulf of Maine, where delivery of terrestrial organic matter is increasing, and 2) through laboratory microcosm experiments using autotrophic and mixotrophic microplankton taxa under contrasting carbon acquisition modes and organic matter characteristics and concentrations. This work will also apply novel mercury and methylmercury-specific isotope analyses and measures of organic matter quality to increase understanding of mercury cycling in coastal environments. This research will fill important gaps in predicting the effects of environmental changes on marine methylmercury levels, providing critical information to mitigating mercury emissions and methylmercury exposures, and for predicting changes in mercury levels in seafood in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MVTS instances represent states of dynamical systems and natural events using multiple time series of interdependent variables. Functional networks leverage the interactions of MVTS variables by finding higher-order relationships among them. The appropriate choice of data representation (MVTS or functional network) poses a challenge in machine learning (ML) efforts that can affect the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. This project will develop cyberinfrastructure that is public, web-based, and Graphical User Interface (GUI)-enabled and enables both novel and previously developed predictive, exploratory, and generative tasks on both data representations. The project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of solar physics science through facilitating solar flare prediction from MVTS-based solar magnetic field data and advancing national health through improving prediction models for neurological diseases (e.g., Schizophrenia) from fMRI-based functional brain networks. The research outcomes, including the cyberinfrastructure developed and ML models designed, will provide an opportunity for interdisciplinary research involving undergraduate students including those from underrepresented groups, for course curriculum development, and for high school outreach activities. <br/><br/>MVTS instances are formed from the time series records of multiple sensors. In functional networks, the nodes represent the variables, and the edges represent the statistical similarity of the time series of the corresponding nodes. While in the MVTS representation completeness of data is preserved, noisy or missing data in time series due to events such as faults in sensors can compromise the performance of downstream ML tasks. Functional network representations help leverage multi-hop relationships of the variables, but the threshold-dependent sparsity in network construction can make ML models lose important features. Machine learning challenges of MVTS and functional network datasets include the appropriate choice of data representation and the limited number of training samples (especially in the medical domain). This project will provide a unified framework for performing (un)-supervised ML tasks on both data representations through application and customization of contemporary ML modes such as matrix/tensor decomposition, sequence models, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and dynamic graph embedding.  The project will also provide a framework for augmenting datasets with synthetic training samples through autoregressive, autoencoder-based, and adversarial models. The project will design and implement a web-based system that contains modules for data import and preparation, representation learning, data augmentation, validation, result visualization, and for exporting derived and synthetic datasets.

The presence of such strong flow in the upper troposphere exerts a controlling influence on middle latitude weather systems and even subtle changes in the jet streams can be consequential for surface weather.  Simulations of climate change due to greenhouse warming typically show shift of the jet streams toward higher latitudes in both hemispheres, and observations show indications that poleward shifting has already occurred.  The poleward shift is similar to the unforced natural variability of the longitudinally averaged jet streams, in which north-south shifting is the most prominent mode.<br/><br/>Work under this award considers the role of moisture in the natural north-south shifting of the jet streams and their poleward movement in response to greenhouse gas increases.  Moisture can affect the mean jet position through the heating that occurs when it condenses to form cloud droplets, and the clouds cause additional heating and cooling through cloud radiative effects (CREs), in particular cooling by reflecting sunlight back to space and warming by the trapping of outgoing longwave radiation.  Recent work suggests that CREs play a strong role in the poleward drift of jets found in climate change simulations, but the exact mechanism has not yet been determined and little work has been done on the role of CREs in natural variability.  The role of latent heating in the poleward drift is also relatively unexamined, and two recent studies disagree as to whether latent heating reduces or increases the persistence of naturally occurring jet displacements.<br/><br/>The research uses a suite of simplified models, in which moist effects can be added in a controlled manner, to study the influence of latent heating and CREs on north-south jet fluctuations and forced poleward drift.  A further resource for the work is the archive of model simulations produced for the Clouds On-Off Klimate Intercomparison Experiment (COOKIE), in which comprehensive climate models are integrated with and without CREs.<br/><br/>The work has societal relevance given the effects of jet shifts on surface weather, including their role in determining the frequency and severity of extreme events associated with frontal storms and blocking events.

Although error-controlled lossy compressors have been employed to mitigate these data issues, many scientists still feel reluctant to adopt them because these compressors provide no guarantee on the accuracy of downstream analysis results derived from raw data. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a trust-driven lossy data compression infrastructure capable of strictly controlling the errors in downstream analysis theoretically and practically to facilitate the use of data reduction in scientific applications. Success of this project will promote the progress of science in multiple disciplines via effective data reduction, and contribute to resolving important societal problems including electric generation, weather forecasting, material design, and transportation. Moreover, this project will contribute to the growth and development of future generations of scientists and engineers through educational and engagement activities, including development of new curriculum and recruitment of K-12 students.<br/><br/>Existing lossy compression techniques either overlook error quantification or provide error control only for raw data, leaving uncertainties in the outcome of downstream quantities of interest (QoIs) computed from the raw data. This greatly concerns many computational scientists who wish to reduce their data while preserving necessary information, preventing them from adopting lossy compression in their applications. This research will address these problems through an integration of theory and implementation via three tasks. First, a novel theory enabling error control on downstream QoIs will be developed. This will fundamentally address the trustability issues of existing error controlled lossy compressors that provide error control only on raw data. Second, an optimization method ensuring tight error control will be applied based on rigorous analysis, to achieve higher compression ratios under the same requirements. Third, a scalable infrastructure will be built through a careful integration with advanced compression frameworks and tailored parallelization based on target QoIs, in order to take full advantage of existing compression algorithms and computational patterns in the target QoIs. The project will enable application scientists to store the most valuable information in their data based on their unique needs, creating opportunities for novel findings in multiple scientific disciplines including climatology, cosmology, and seismology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as CPS become machine-learning-intensive due to rapidly increasing interactions between CPS and machine learning technologies, two major distinguishing factors associated with machine learning techniques raise significant safety concerns about CPS upgrades which play a critical role in enabling lifetime safety assurance. First, upgrades of machine learning components, which inherently result in system changes, come at significant safety risk for safety-critical CPS due to the vulnerabilities of machine learning techniques. Second, the traditional safe-by-verification upgrade framework, in which upgrades and verification have to be two separate procedures, is no longer valid for machine learning processes that update instantaneously during system operations. This project targets these unique challenges by developing scalable verification and monitoring methods for upgrades as well as safe upgrade procedures to enable trustworthy upgrades and achieve lifetime safety assurance in machine-learning-intensive CPS.<br/><br/>This project will advance the state-of-the-art in the research of safety in machine-learning-intensive CPS from local time windows to global life cycles. With the expected research results, machine learning components in CPS can upgrade with desired safety assurance for lifetime safety purposes. In particular, this project will develop a novel scalable incremental verification framework as well as self-adaptive runtime monitoring methods for upgrades of machine-learning-intensive CPS. The proposed approach will also design safety-assured upgrade procedures by developing novel upgrade renewal procedures, safety-aware upgrades, and safety backup co-design methods. The project will develop an indoor vision-based autonomous vehicle testbed with upgradable neural networks for a variety of upgrade scenarios to perform rigorous evaluations. The integration of research and education plans will address CPS workforce shortage gaps, develop CPS curriculum, and design hands-on training for students. Activities such as engagement in K-12 STEM camps and collaboration with government and industry partners are also designed to inspire students early and promote public understanding of CPS, which aims to build a healthy and sustainable CPS workforce supply.

This is because higher rainfall and warming increase runoff from land to coastal waters. Runoff also influences coastal algal blooms. These changes are expected to alter the distribution of mercury in the water and impact its availability for biological uptake. Mercury is a potent toxin. Its uptake into the food web contaminates fish and seafood and affects human health. This project will study how organic matter delivered from land to coastal waters affects mercury concentrations in seawater and in the food webs of the Gulf of Maine. The Gulf of Maine is one of the largest and most important coastal fishing grounds in the United States. This project will measure the concentration and isotopes of mercury on samples collected from research cruises under different algal bloom conditions and river flows. Lab experiments will be used to study how land-derived organic matter affects mercury accumulation in plankton. The project will provide research experiences for four undergraduate students in a STEM field. Training will be provided to a PhD student and a postdoctoral fellow. Findings from the project will provide critical information about the effect of climate change on mercury levels in marine waters and food webs. This information is needed for achieving the goals of the Minamata Convention, a global treaty for reducing mercury emissions to the environment.<br/><br/>This project will examine the effects of climate change on terrestrial organic matter and mercury concentrations in Gulf of Maine waters. Specifically, the scientists will study the complex and often competing processes that influence: 1) mercury cycling and distribution; 2) the formation of methylmercury; and 3) methylmercury uptake to microplankton. Terrestrial organic matter plays an important role in transferring mercury from watersheds to coastal and offshore waters. It also controls the formation of methylmercury in water by providing a microenvironment that promotes the methylation of mercury by microbes, which represents the first step for uptake of methylmercury into seafood. However, some plankton can directly use organic matter as a food source (so-called ?mixotrophs?) and can bioaccumulate methylmercury during feeding. Mixotrophs can dominate microplankton assemblages in coastal waters at some times of the year, and previous studies have not explored the impact of this feeding mode on methylmercury uptake at the base of the food web. This project will study the effects of organic matter dynamics on mercury and methylmercury cycling and bioaccumulation through 1) field surveys and shipboard experiments in the Gulf of Maine, where delivery of terrestrial organic matter is increasing, and 2) through laboratory microcosm experiments using autotrophic and mixotrophic microplankton taxa under contrasting carbon acquisition modes and organic matter characteristics and concentrations. This work will also apply novel mercury and methylmercury-specific isotope analyses and measures of organic matter quality to increase understanding of mercury cycling in coastal environments. This research will fill important gaps in predicting the effects of environmental changes on marine methylmercury levels, providing critical information to mitigating mercury emissions and methylmercury exposures, and for predicting changes in mercury levels in seafood in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER project will investigate a novel measurement-informed learning-based framework called Argus to significantly lower the management barriers faced by modern enterprises.<br/><br/>This project will focus on scientific inquiries in three synergistic thrusts to realize the Argus framework. First, it will design calibrated measurement tools and techniques, using which enterprises can gain visibility into the federated underlays. Second, adhering to the privacy concerns of providers, it will investigate learning-based modeling capabilities, using which enterprises can accurately infer, localize, and attribute performance bottlenecks to appropriate providers. Third, it will take a principled approach to design a management capability, using which enterprises can effectively and efficiently navigate egress costs and operational goals while avoiding inferred performance bottlenecks.<br/><br/>This project's goal is to lower multi-cloud management barriers, to enhance the operational productivity of enterprises, and to foster breakthroughs in the aforementioned domains and beyond.

Researchers from across the natural and social sciences have made great progress in understanding their life ways, how they successfully adapted to the extreme climates of the last ice age, and why they ultimately disappeared millenia  ago. Archaeologists and geoscientists, with their common interests in deep time and human-environment interactions, are particularly well equipped to contribute to the study of Neanderthals. Within this broad context, researchers will lead a three-year study of Neanderthal adaptation to extreme climate variation during the last ice age. The project will contribute to theories about human evolution and the fate of Neanderthal populations, informing on the roles that environmental change, technology, and diet choice played in human evolution. Additional benefits include field and laboratory training, scientific engagement, and cultural enrichment for student participants who will join an interdisciplinary research team in an international setting. Many of the students involved in this project will be first-generation college students from under-represented, working poor, and rural demographic groups in Kentucky and eastern North Carolina who may not otherwise have opportunities for international travel. <br/><br/>This project is designed to address the fundamental question: do temporal variations in Neanderthal land use, demography, technology, and diet represent responses to extreme climate shifts during the last ice age? The project team will address this question by developing complementary archaeological, chronological, and paleoenvironmental datasets from the ongoing excavation at a Neanderthal archaeological site) and integrating them with local and regional climate records. Previous work at the site has established that the cave preserves rich cultural deposits and non-cultural faunal remains, including biomolecular compounds such as ancient DNA. Lithic artifact and animal bone assemblages will provide a robust record of changes in Neanderthal technology and raw material selection that can be directly synchronized with paleoclimate records, and with seasonality indicators from stable isotope analyses of associated faunal remains from the same stratigraphic position. The proposed methodology uses radiocarbon and uranium-series dating to establish age control, stone tool analyses to understand the decision-making of Paleolithic humans, animal bone assemblages to reconstruct paleoenvironments and understand Neanderthal diets, and sedimentological analyses to infer site formation processes and environmental context of human occupation. Taken together, the work will establish a complete paleoenvironmental and geoarchaeological chronology for Neanderthal site adaptations, providing critical context that is missing from many other sites in the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These engineered tissues could replace damaged heart muscle in adults. Heart attack causes permanent loss of heart muscle and can lead to heart failure. Current treatments cannot regenerate damaged heart muscle. Induced pluripotent stem cells, which come from a person?s own cells, can become any cell type.  As such, these cells offer new hope for personalized engineered heart tissue regeneration. However, heart tissues made from these cells to date lack the functionality of adult tissues. This is because heart muscle cells generated from stem cells are immature in shape, size, and function. There is a critical need to improve heart muscle cell maturity for engineering adult heart tissue. Drawing inspiration from the heart?s multiscale structure, this research will explore how three-dimensional biophysical signals can be used to improve heart muscle cell maturity and how this knowledge can be leveraged to manufacture personalized adult heart tissues. The complementary education program will use this research context to promote equity in engineering education through curriculum innovation.

Symmetric organisms persist through evolution in nature, symmetric protagonists are perceived as especially beautiful in art, and symmetric components are critical to engineering structures that can withstand powerful forces. The set of symmetries of a particular physical object enjoys a rich algebraic structure, because symmetries are operations that can be composed together.  This group of all symmetries can then be conveniently studied by encoding each symmetry as a rectangular array of numbers called a matrix.  This process of passing from a symmetric object in the natural world to a related collection of matrices is the hallmark of the mathematical field of representation theory. Representation theory thus reduces the complex study of symmetry in nature to questions in the well understood area of mathematics called linear algebra. As such, the proposed projects have broad potential to substantially impact our understanding of many symmetric structures occurring throughout the mathematical and natural sciences. This project also provides opportunities for directly involving undergraduate students in mathematical research, with a focused goal of supporting the development and recruitment of women in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project will address two topics in the algebra, geometry, and representation theory of reductive algebraic groups over non-archimedean local fields.  First, applying techniques from geometric group theory to the associated Bruhat-Tits building, the investigator will provide a global approach to understanding the conjugacy classes of any affine Weyl group.  Second, this geometric perspective will also be applied to reinterpret the K-theoretic generalization of Peterson's isomorphism from the equivariant homology of the affine Grassmannian to the equivariant quantum cohomology of a finite flag variety.  Specific objectives include a complete description of an affine conjugacy class in terms of the underlying finite Weyl group, and new representatives for the Schubert classes in the equivariant K-homology of the affine Grassmannian.

A second focus is non-reductive geometric invariant theory, which can be used to construct moduli spaces that include unstable objects or involve non-reductive group actions; important work on the cohomology of such quotients is in progress.  Next, higher rank Brill?Noether theory, an ongoing enterprise, has already born some fruit in applications such as computing the Kodaira dimension of spaces of Pryms.

Despite longstanding and intensive research by the scientific community, several key aspects of the earthquake rupture process remain poorly understood. This project focuses on understanding the physical origin of the high-frequency seismic energy that is generated during the rupture process as earthquake faults slip past one another. These advances in scientific understanding have broad implications for earthquake hazard mitigation, informing how future building design codes should be constructed in order to prevent earthquake damage to vulnerable structures. The project also supports early career scientists and provides research opportunities to traditionally underrepresented groups in the geosciences. Through targeted outreach efforts, the project will engage high school students from a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds, with an aim toward experiential learning that will guide them in their future careers.<br/><br/>The physical origins for high-frequency ground motions have traditionally been explained in terms of a frictional model that postulates that frictional processes during fault slip determine rupture properties like stress drop, which in turn control shaking amplitudes. However, these classical frictional models often struggle to explain many aspects of the high-frequency ground motions observed in nature. This discrepancy has led to the hypothesis that elastic impacts of fault-zone structures that occur to accommodate the geometric complexity of fault systems may play an important role in the generation of high-frequency ground motions. The project will explicitly test this hypothesis using three sets of seismological observations ? corner frequencies, radiation patterns, and the ratio of S-wave to P-wave radiated energy ? for which the frictional and impact models make distinctly different predictions. This work has a number of important implications for our understanding of the physics of earthquake rupture, including determining the degree to which detailed measurements of fault zone structure are needed to make accurate ground motion predictions, revising the physical interpretation of seismological stress drop estimates, and constraining the degree of wave scattering in the Earth?s crust. These advances, taken holistically, will provide crucial observational constraints for future earthquake hazard mitigation efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microbes will play an important role if properly engineered. Product yield increases are needed. Routing material efficiently through different metabolic pathways is critical for increasing yield. The objective of this project is to balance material and energy flows through cell metabolism and product synthesis pathways.  A library of sigma factors, which control pathway flows, will be created, and tested.  The research will be tied to outreach and workforce development activities. To learn synthetic biology techniques, first year undergraduates and high school teachers will characterize a sigma factor of their choice. <br/><br/>Transcriptional balancing of enzyme expression and resource reallocation towards bioproduction are two general strategies that have resulted in enhanced bioproduction. Alternative sigma factors naturally carry out these functions by redirecting transcriptional resources towards new genetic programs in times of stress. Through this work, we will evaluate whether alternative sigma factors will confer bioproduction benefits in E. coli. Mutations to promoter spacer region as well as changes in spacer length will provide transcriptional diversity for a set of non-native sigma factors. A screening approach followed by deep sequencing will determine the identity of promoter variants that give rise to specific transcriptional amounts, improving the prediction of how changes in promoters influence transcription. Libraries of promoters will be applied to heterologous pathways that have multiple side reactions to provide a balanced flux throughout the pathway. Additionally, using a multi-sigma factor-based approach, we will coordinate enzyme expression for complicated pathways that require intermediate build-up to improve specificity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Qualitative researchers collect and analyze non-numerical data to understand people's interactions, opinions, and experiences. The presence of potential bias in qualitative research is a well-recognized problem, but research to increase transparency and trustworthiness in the analysis phases have been limited. This research develops a novel role for visualizations in addressing current challenges in qualitative data analysis through the integration of text analysis and multimodal data extraction. Given the prevalent use of qualitative research in academia, qualitative data analysis without transparency and verification can have far-reaching negative impacts such as discriminating policies, suboptimal patient-care, and reinforced stigmas. Thus, qualitative data analysis should be conducted in a rigorous manner to yield trustworthy and meaningful results. The techniques developed will significantly contribute to the data analysis, visualization, and human-computer interaction fields.<br/><br/>Despite advances in qualitative data analysis software, there are three key dilemmas in the current qualitative research process: the cognitive burden resulting from the vast amount of data, subjectivity and potential bias that are introduced by the researcher, and the underutilization of multimodal data containing important non-verbal cues such as vocal tones and facial expressions. The specific objective of this proposal is to identify and demonstrate: (1) how text analysis techniques can be combined with visualization and human feedback to alleviate cognitive burden and lessen bias; and, (2) how visual summaries of audio features can promote the incorporation of non-verbal cues in qualitative analysis. An open-source visualization webtool supporting these enhanced analysis techniques will be developed using an iterative, user-centered design methodology. Prospective users with qualitative analysis experience will be selected for a participatory design session, usability tests, and a field study.

Simulated classroom experiences will be utilized throughout the curriculum and developed with simulation specialist, Mursion. The project has two goals. One is to enhance an online MAT program to meet student, industry, and partner needs, and increase enrollments and production of highly qualified STEM teachers in the future. The second goal is to enhance partnerships with local four-year and two-year colleges, school districts, military bases, and STEM-industry stakeholders, and to improve statewide and interstate marketing and recruitment for the MAT program. The project will revise an existing, online MAT Program, as well as design a 1-year streamlined pathway to completion of that program and teacher licensure. Additionally, the project will collaborate with simulation technology company Mursion to develop classroom simulations to be embedded in this online teacher education program with the aim of producing highly skilled STEM teachers. Further, the project will collaborate with NRCTC to revise articulation agreements to provide model pathways to secondary STEM teaching careers through this online program for institutions in the region. The project will be guided by input from working groups including community college, university, and high school STEM faculty. Through new recruitment strategies, the proposed project will contribute knowledge about how to attract second-career STEM professionals, military veterans, and others to secondary STEM teaching careers in high-need schools. Outcomes of the effort could produce insights for other institutions nationwide about making STEM teaching careers more accessible and affordable for STEM majors and professionals through accelerated, online teacher education. The institution?s connections with the AACTE will enable widespread sharing of lessons learned.

Soil erosion by stream or wind causes significant environmental and economic consequences. The estimated cost of soil erosion on the US farmland is as high as $44 billion per year. Wind-induced soil erosion associated with construction or mining activities, i.e., dust, negatively impacts air quality and consequently the health of workers, their communities, and the environment. Soil erosion around bridge foundations (i.e., bridge scour) is the No. 1 cause of bridge failures. Improvement of soil erosion resistance requires enhancing the inter-particle bonds, which is commonly achieved by use of chemicals such as lime or cement. Such treatments, however, are not sustainable since the production of these chemicals consumes nonrenewable resources and produces significant carbon footprints. This innovative research will leverage fibrous fungi, a microorganism abundant in soils, to achieve environmentally-benign, sustainable soil improvement by: 1) reinforcing the soil microstructure with the fungi-induced bio-adhesion and fiber network, and 2) leveraging the hydrophobic nature of fungi fibers to reduce the interfacial erosive shear stress induced by flowing water. The project will provide graduate and undergraduate students opportunities to work on an interdisciplinary research topic. The recruitment efforts will emphasize involving female and minority students. The research will be incorporated into instructional materials. The project outcomes will be disseminated via a variety of outreach activities on the Case Western Reserve University campus and in collaboration with local communities.  <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand the multiscale interactions between fungi and soils, and therefore, offer insight on how fungi-soil interactions can be tailored to improve soil erosion resistance.  The research objectives of this research include: 1) the study of topological interactions between fungi and soil, fungi adaptation to soil microstructure and response to bio-stimuli to design tactics to tailor the growth of fungi fibers in soil; 2) the understanding of the physico-chemical interactions between fungi and soil particles to guide the development of  models describing the effects of fungi fiber on soil engineering behaviors; 3) the assessment of the effects of fungi on soil macroscopic performance properties, such as the soil aggregation, fiber reinforcement, soil water characteristics, and transport properties and how these improve the soil erosion resistance. The research will generate foundational knowledge on fungi-soil interactions and quantify their impacts on the soil engineering properties. It will break new ground in biomediated geotechnical engineering for sustainable soil improvement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Eyewitnesses can provide crucial evidence in criminal cases, but eyewitness identifications are not always accurate.  Eyewitnesses can make two kinds of mistakes.  They can fail to identify guilty individuals from lineups and they can falsely identify innocent people from lineups.  Both types of errors present a threat to public safety because they contribute to perpetrators being free to commit additional crimes.  In addition, mistaken identifications risk the liberty of innocent suspects. For these reasons, it is important to better understand the situations and procedures that are associated with accurate eyewitness identifications.<br/><br/>One important factor that may be used to predict eyewitness accuracy is the witness?s confidence at the time of the identification.  A number of studies have found that when a witness identifies a suspect with high confidence that the witness is quite likely to be correct. This is particularly true when ideal procedures are used by police to obtain the identification.  However, more recently, some studies have found that there are situations where, even when ideal procedures are used, highly confident witnesses are not always highly accurate. The researchers have proposed a series of studies using virtual reality recreations of crimes to help understand when highly confident witnesses are likely to be highly accurate and when they are likely to be less accurate.  Use of virtual reality can create more lifelike and emotionally engaging events than have traditionally been used by eyewitness researchers.  The research focuses on testing two ideas.  The first idea is that some witnesses might have a better understanding of how their own memory and perception works than other witnesses.  Witnesses who are more in tune with how their memory and perception works are likely to only say they are confident when the probability of being correct is high.  Witnesses who have a poor understanding of how their memory and perception works, may mistakenly say they are confident, even when the odds of being correct are lower.  The second idea is that there may be witnessing conditions that are so poor (e.g., poor lighting, very long distance) that even the best witnesses are unlikely to be very accurate and witnesses may not fully take into account how poor the witnessing conditions are when making their confidence judgments. These hypotheses will be tested through a series of experiments testing both child and adult witnesses and will provide a better understanding of how eyewitness confidence and accuracy are related.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This extinction crisis has important implications for how ecosystems function. In particular, loss of species may lead to loss of biological buffers that have been in place for thousands of years. The loss of these buffers could make systems more vulnerable to stressors such as drought. Understanding how biodiversity helps buffer our ecosystems from environmental stressors is an essential next step to predicting the consequences of future extinctions. This understanding will also help us understand how ecosystems can possibly retain function with fewer species. This project examines how different species of plants can modify the microclimate around them, such as decreased temperatures, increased humidity and increased soil moisture. The modification of microclimate may be one important mechanism allowing many species to coexist, which is a key to biodiversity. This project also provides research opportunities and education to graduate students and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project tests the role of microclimate modification effects in determining relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function. The approach is to design a series of biodiversity microclimate humidification experiments both in a greenhouse setting and in a network of sites across Los Angeles County, California. Several species of grasses native to California are used in the experiments because they are very sensitive to changing moisture conditions. This project examines microclimate modification effects in three important ways: (1) using a biodiversity experiment to examine the strength of microclimate amelioration and whether it can explain positive biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships under natural drought conditions, (2) using careful physiological measurements to assess whether microclimate amelioration is driven by plant functional traits (e.g. rooting depth or water use efficiency), whole community structure (e.g. canopy complexity and boundary layer conditions), or merely creating a physical shade barrier, and (3) examining the role of microclimate amelioration in higher plant diversity communities in an urban arid ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Standard machine learning methods can easily fail in this regard, e.g. by optimizing for majority populations represented within their training data at the expense of worse performance on minority populations. A large literature on ""algorithmic fairness"" has arisen to address this widespread problem. However, at a technical level, this literature has viewed various technical notions of ""fairness"" as constraints, and has therefore viewed ""fair learning"" through the lens of constrained optimization. Although this has been a productive viewpoint from the perspective of algorithm design, it has led to tradeoffs being centered as the central object of study in ""fair machine learning"". In the standard framing, adding new protected populations, or quantitatively strengthening fairness constraints, necessarily leads to decreased accuracy overall and within each group. This has the effect of pitting the interests of different stakeholders against one another, and making it difficult to build consensus around ""fair machine learning"" techniques. The over-arching goal of this project is to break through this ""fairness/accuracy tradeoff"" paradigm. <br/><br/>Specifically, we will draw on ideas from learning theory and uncertainty estimation to introduce notions of fairness that can be satisfied in ways that are monotonically error improving. For example, if it is discovered that a deployed model has error that is unacceptably high on some population, our aim will be to find ways to decrease the error on that population without increasing the error on any other population. We also aim to find methods that do not require identifying which groups might be disadvantaged by a particular application of machine learning ahead of time, since this can be very hard to predict. Instead, we will develop methods to dynamically update models as it is discovered that they are performing poorly on populations of interest. Finally, rather than talking about ""fairness"" of predictive models in the abstract, we will aim to formulate and implement notions of fairness that have meaning in the context of particular downstream applications, and find methods of training upstream predictive methods that will guarantee these kinds of fairness when the predictive models are deployed in these downstream use case. In addition to research papers and software, this project will develop human capital by training PhD students to be leading researchers in trustworthy machine learning. It will also develop educational materials aimed at researchers, students, and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use a variety of tools to engage four- to eight-year-old children and their families. First, the project will create a five-episode STEM media series for the Public Broadcasting System. The series will include diverse STEM professionals, including astronauts and engineers, reading STEM picture books from space, Earth and sea. The picture books will be complemented by related media that shows diverse children engaging in STEM activities in their homes and communities. Next, 10 family-friendly, low-cost STEM activity kits that are aligned to the PBS series will be created. To continue STEM learning at home, these kits will be shared with a national network of libraries that serve diverse, low-income communities. To support STEM learning in their local library, librarians will engage in professional development. The innovative combination of digital media and libraries as hubs for STEM learning and sharing take-home kits is expected to support young children?s interest in STEM, their confidence for pursuing their STEM interests and their early literacy skills.  The project is a partnership among Twin Cities Public Television, T2 Science and Math Education, American University?s School of Education, and the Space Science Institute.<br/><br/>Reading aloud to children increases their literacy. In turn, literacy skills are strongly linked to STEM success. However, the literature on read-alouds is based largely on reading in person. Less is known about how digital media read-alouds support children?s STEM and literacy learning. This 30-month Developing and Testing Innovations project will explore the extent to which digital media read-alouds impact children?s STEM content learning, STEM-aligned literacy skills and children?s interest in and awareness of STEM careers. It aims to increase the quantity and quality of digital STEM media read-alouds and STEM library programs for children and families of color and from low-income communities. All media and hands-on STEM activities will be shaped by: 1) Established curriculum frameworks, including the Next Generation Science Standards and Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy and Mathematics; 2) A diverse project team and advisory board; 3) Evidence-based research on the use of effective read-aloud strategies, best practices in children?s media production, and STEM activities; and 4) Evaluation that includes parents and librarians? voices from the communities this project will serve. The mixed-methods project will use quantitative data, in the form of pre- and post-surveys around children?s STEM and literacy skills, knowledge and interest to assess change over time. Qualitative data in the form of interviews and observations will investigate children?s use of STEM and literacy skills and interest in STEM careers. Themes around these constructs will be developed through constant comparison of interview data and triangulation. Data collection sampling will occur at the library level through a simple randomized sampling of children within the targeted age range. Formative evaluation with parents and librarians will provide feedback on the new media and aligned activities. An independent evaluation will examine librarians? professional development and program implementation, seeking to understand how library educators engage and motivate children and parents/caregivers around STEM topics and career pathways. The project involves eight research sites and 21 outreach sites across the country with the goal of engaging 42 librarians working with over 200 children and over 400 parents/caregivers.  More broadly, the STEM Tales media will appear across multiple national PBS digital platforms where it will reach an estimated two million viewers (including children, librarians, educators, and parents) over a seven-year rights period. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project envisions visual analytics systems that sense the user and her goals to actively support her analysis by providing the right information at the right time. The work will produce: (1) a theoretical understanding of how individual differences impact analytic workflows and which traits are most predictive; (2) algorithms for analyzing a user?s interactions with visualizations to infer their cognitive profile and analysis goals; and (3) techniques and theory for using those inferences to give more personalized suggestions.

Learning what happened when climate changed in the past can help predict what could happen over the next 50 years: Which species will become extinct, and why? Is there anything that can be done to protect Arctic species from the impacts of climate change? The goal of this project is to understand what caused the extinctions of giant, ice-age animals like woolly mammoth around the time that the last ice age ended. Some people think they were killed off by people; others say they died because of rapid changes in climate. No one knows for certain, but everyone argues about it. It is not even known when, exactly, these extinctions occurred: Was it 12,000 years ago, or 4000 years ago? This project aims at pin-pointing when the last mammoth, the last steppe bison, and the last tundra lion lived in Alaska. Once it is known for certain when they became extinct, it will be possible to eliminate some of the proposed explanations. For example, it may turn out that herds of mammoths still roamed across Alaska 4000 years ago. Because it is already known that the first people arrived in Alaska around 14,000 years ago, if this project shows that mammoths and people coexisted for 10,000 years, it makes it unlikely that people drove them to extinction. The research proposed here will obtain more precise dates on when the last ice-age mammals lived in Alaska using new methods based on the DNA that is preserved in frozen ground where these animals once lived. All animals (people included) continually shed DNA into the environment in their skin fragments, hair, feces, and urine. Some of these tissue fragments are buried and preserved in the ground. This is especially true in the Arctic where decay is slowed by cold temperatures. The plan is to extract tissue fragments (think: fur and dandruff) from the ground, and then use the DNA it contains to identify which animal species it came from. Next, the soil layer containing this DNA will be dated, and these new dates will be used to test ideas about what caused this species? extinction. By better understanding the causes of extinctions in the past, the Arctic mammals that still survive can be better protected, species like polar bears, musk oxen, and caribou. A major goal of this study is to educate students and high school teachers about climate change, DNA, and ice-age ecology. A particular effort will be made to involve students who are Alaskan Natives. All data will be shared in archives that everyone has free access to, and new discoveries will be shared through scientific publications, newspaper articles, and public lectures. <br/><br/>Arctic ecosystems now lie on the front lines of global change. There is an urgent need to better understand how rapid changes in temperature, sea-ice extent, and land use could impact large-bodied Arctic mammals like musk oxen, polar bears, and caribou. The geological record preserves many examples of what happened to animals and plants when climate changed rapidly during prehistory. Extinctions are of particular interest, because understanding what caused extinctions in the past can help us conserve the planet?s remaining megafauna, many of which are now endangered. A wave of extinctions occurred in the Arctic around the end of the last ice age, 14,000 to 10,000 years ago. This is when most scientists believe that giant ice-age mammals like woolly mammoth, steppe bison, tundra horses, and tundra lions disappeared from mainland Siberia and Alaska; however, no one is sure what caused these extinctions, and many explanations have been proposed. One reason for this debate is that a key piece of information is still missing, namely: When did these species actually go extinct? Unless it is known with precision when an extinction occurred, the various hypotheses about causation cannot be tested. Present understanding of when these extinctions occurred is based on a few hundred radiocarbon dates scattered across the northern continents, and there is a real possibility that the bones of the last woolly mammoth will never be discovered. But now there is a new and better way to detect the presence of now-extinct animals. All animals shed DNA into the environment in their skin fragments, hair, feces, and urine. Some of this DNA is buried and preserved in the ground, especially in the Arctic, where things decay slowly because it is cold. The aim of this project is to extract the ancient DNA of extinct mammals, use it to identify which species it belonged to, and then to date the soil layer where it came from. These new dates can then be used to test ideas about what caused this species? extinction. In this study, emphasis will be placed on educating students and high school teachers about climate change, DNA, and ice-age ecology. A particular effort will be made to involve students who are Alaskan Natives.

The Civil and Voting Rights Acts of the 1960?s made racially exclusionary practices illegal; nevertheless, they did not automatically enforce rights. Whites subsequently adapted and deployed new methods of political exclusion. The contemporary social and political context is different, but the ambiguity and indeterminacy of voting rights are not. State voter ID laws, limits on early voting, restrictions on registration, voter roll purges, disenfranchisement, and gerrymandering have become ordinary yet systemic barriers to minority participation. Voting rights are again being challenged and new de jure and de facto voter suppression techniques are again on the rise. Yet so too are the number of political organizations attempting to build, sustain, and employ the strategic capacity necessary for successful legal mobilization. Understanding how the Alabama Democratic Conference developed, sustained, and employed statewide strategic capacity and effectively capitalized on the support structure for legal mobilization for over twenty years will inform our understanding of social movement theory and provide insights that can be adapted to fit the needs of rights advocacy groups across the United States and in other western-style democracies. This research project will create a repository of research materials on minority political organizations and their legal campaigns. A short documentary will be created and disseminated to a wide audience, from local to national civic and political organizations and from secondary schools to graduate seminars. Lastly, this research project will incorporate underrepresented students at all stages of the research, increasing their sense of belonging, which is highly correlated with academic outcomes, and imparting research and job readiness skills.<br/><br/>This CAREER award focuses on collecting and analyzing data on how a minority political organization sustained a statewide legal campaign for over twenty years (1965-1989) culminating in the most successful political usage of law to enforce voting rights in American history. To guide examination of the ADC, this project relies on prior social movement research under two theoretical headings: the support structure for legal mobilization and strategic capacity. This research project will employ grounded theory, an interpretative analytic approach, and snowball sampling as a complimentary research strategy. This project will provide insight into unresolved questions about how different elements of the support structure for legal mobilization are correlated with successful insurgency at both the state and federal levels. This analysis will advance our understanding of the mechanisms through which strategic capacity is created and our understanding of leadership and organizational structures as sources of strategic capacity. Finally, this research will advance our understanding of how different aspects of strategic capacity interact with the different elements of the support structure for legal mobilization at the state and federal level. In truth, we do not know much about the legal campaigns of minority voting rights organizations. This research project will fill this crucial gap in the socio-legal research literature and answer key questions regarding the political use of law for political purposes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bees play an important role in maintaining tropical diversity by pollinating plants, which can then grow seeds and fruits that animals eat. Tropical bees help provide humans with vanilla, avocados, cashews, passion fruit and coffee, to name a few. In fact, tropical bees are one of the most essential organisms on the planet for their central role in crop production and biodiversity maintenance. This project will test a restoration strategy to recover and protect tropical bees. It features a big experiment and observations of bees pollinating plants at many sites along the side of a mountain range in Costa Rica. Researchers will determine which species of bees visit which species of flowers, allowing them to create a detailed map (or ?network?) of interactions. Another goal is to raise public awareness of tropical bees and their importance. Through targeted outreach, students and the public will learn about the many different services provided by native species of stingless bees.<br/> <br/>Network theory is a useful tool to achieve a greater understanding of the connections between communities and ecosystem function. This project will quantify bee-plant network properties along a tropical elevational gradient and relate those network-level metrics to pollination success in an economically important crop species. A primary goal is to quantify the degree of vulnerability of pollination services among elevations in tropical ecosystems. Network theory will be used to select plant species for use in a restoration experiment. This is important because plant species differ by orders of magnitude in the number of interactions they can support and in the tropics, restoration and conservation practitioners have thousands of plant species to choose among. Plant species determined to be highly connected (based on empirical bee-plant networks) will be tested for their role in restoring bee communities and ecosystem function. If network theory is supported, this study will provide guidelines to land managers and practitioners on best practices to accelerate tropical forest restoration broadly. Locally, the results will be used to inform restoration within the Bellbird Biological Corridor, an internationally recognized model corridor project.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Population and Community Ecology program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to establish how bird biology and human social organization together influenced human-bird interactions and to use this information to understand when and why birds were kept in captivity. Captive birds represent an understudied, gray area in between wild and domestic?sometimes referred to as low-intensity management.

It will broaden understanding of the role of captive animals in the past and explore the role specific avian attributes and societal structure play in shaping animal management decisions. Further, by improving  understanding of specific forms of past animal management, the research will make an important contribution to broader areas of anthropological inquiry including domestication processes, human and non-human agency, and the variable nature of human-animal relationships. Finally, the use of existing collections to address new questions respects the finite nature of the archaeological record and the need to conserve it.<br/><br/>The dissertation student will conduct her doctoral dissertation research on bird bones from two archaeological sites.

An understanding of how plant chemistry responds to extreme drought could help in understanding plants in these larger systems. This CAREER award will improve understanding of (a) how plant chemistry changes in response to drought at the scales of individual plants and of plant communities, and (b) the relationship of these changes to changes in plant-animal interactions and decomposition. The project is based in the Great Basin Desert on the border between Nevada and California, where extreme drought is now commonplace. The award will test the hypothesis that extreme drought reduces environmental variation, with consequences for system function. The project includes training and research participation of first generation students, outdoor science experience for grade school students, and research opportunities for community scientists in Nevada.<br/><br/>Drought imposes acute stress on plant metabolism, which may reduce the strength of feedbacks between trophic interactions and soil carbon dynamics, simplifying ecological communities. To test this hypothesis, the award will support drought experiments on focal plant individuals and on plant communities. Using outdoor gardens of western milkweed, the research will assess how the amount and variability of water impacts plant-herbivore-predator interactions, as well as how plant tissues from different watering treatments influence decomposition and soil respiration. Using drought shelters and rainfall additions in plant communities in sagebrush ecosystems, the research will assess how drought affects plant chemistry at the plot scale, including changes in the chemistry of individuals and changes due to differential survival and recruitment in the community. These measurements will then be related to changes in arthropod communities and in soil carbon dynamics in a spatially explicit design. Plant chemistry will be assessed using untargeted metabolomics approaches that consider the composition and diversity of compounds as well as their concentrations. The complexity of plant-animal interactions will be also manipulated in the milkweed gardens using factorial combinations of herbivores and their predators to test the importance of such trophic feedbacks. The work will provide insight into the dynamics of future ecosystems in the American West and the extent to which we can predict those dynamics through an understanding of plant chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in Engineering (BRITE) Synergy project conceptualizes a novel direction in engineering resilient housing to explore how women?s and other residents? knowledge, priorities and perceptions can shape engineering problem solving for resilient housing at the individual, community and building code level. It focuses in particular on women because of their traditional bond with and responsibilities for home in our society, and their continued underrepresentation in engineering, architecture, and construction professions. This project will explore the sources of expertise that are missed when women residents, women students and women building industry professionals in engineering resilient housing are not included. Due to the large number of homes being built, remodeled or rebuilt after disasters in this country, there is a major opportunity to address vulnerabilities in future disasters, with a potentially significant payoff in reducing community disruption. The project also attends to the need to diversify the talent ecosystem in engineering, showing how a more diverse ecosystem enhances engineering outcomes. <br/><br/>The project?s hypothesis is that the inclusion of women?s knowledge, priorities and perceptions yields changes, for housing, in both the agenda set for engineering research and technology development, and the engineering solutions developed. This hypothesis will be tested by examining engineering problem solving in two research thrusts. The study of liquefaction remediation (Thrust 1) will develop new probabilistic engineering assessments of the risks of liquefaction-induced building damage at the home and community level, considering both repair costs (i.e., the threat to owners? and households? financial security) and habitability (i.e., the threat of losing the home). It will also quantify how the currently available liquefaction remediation techniques alter these risks. The project will produce a housing-driven engineering research and technology development agenda for liquefaction remediation techniques that incorporates community knowledge, co-created through a series of facilitated focus groups with community members from communities along the Los Angeles River. The study of retrofit in Thrust 2 will engage with the unique opportunity presented by the ongoing evaluation and mitigation of vulnerable reinforced concrete buildings in response to the City of Los Angeles? mandatory seismic retrofit ordinance. The engineering assessment will quantify the risk posed by the existing (unretrofit) buildings, in terms of probable repair costs and loss of housing, and the positive and negative impacts of retrofit (and demolition) engineering solutions. The process and design space of engineering solutions will be developed through solicitation of women?s and residents? knowledge, priorities and perceptions, through semi-structured interviews and surveys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The analysis of biological data has long been accomplished using standard (parametric) statistical methods. However, these tools lack solutions for many complex questions. As an alternative, resampling of data using computers provides a general procedure that can replace traditional methods in cases where they are insufficient. These new methods have the potential to provide a tool for biologists that is less restrictive than traditional tests. A full-length book will be produced and made freely available providing broad impacts. Web-based tutorials demonstrating all topics in the book will also be provided. Both products will leverage existing software the investigators have developed and distributed freely to the scientific community.<br/><br/>By synthesizing 25 years of permutation-based analytics they have developed, the investigators will arrive at an entirely new philosophy for performing data analysis in the biological sciences. This new paradigm results from the union of their methods in four interrelated areas: 1) Resampling of Residuals in a Permutation Procedure (RRPP), 2) permutation-based effect sizes, 3) permutation-based pairwise comparisons, and 4) permutation-based evaluation of independent or correlated datasets. The result will be a biometric perspective that emphasizes both hypothesis testing and biological signal strength determination, where the generation of empirical sampling distributions enables both components simultaneously. The approach is both univariate and multivariate, and can be used to evaluate trends in independent, or correlated observations. When complete the synthesis will provide a comprehensive learning platform, that combines thorough explanation of permutational analytics, and integrates this emerging statistical perspective with hands-on tutorials that utilize existing software for implementation. This advance has the potential to transform how biologists conduct their research, as the RRPP synthetic paradigm provides analytical tools that are capable of addressing hypotheses that parametric procedures cannot.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there are still important questions that have not been answered conclusively.  This award will address processes that are related to the development and maintenance of strong near-ground rotation though the use of sophisticated numerical models.  The downstream impact of the work is related to improving the ability of weather forecasters to provide more accurate warnings of tornadic activity.  The award also provides funding for the training of a postdoctoral researcher and outreach to enhance public understanding of science.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to analyze the various mechanisms that lead to tornado intensification and maintenance.  The research team plan to develop an improved theory for tornadogenesis and demonstrate a direct link between the ambient wind profile and the rotation of a tornado.  The research pursues two objectives. The first is related to the intensification of the vortex during the transition of the near-ground vorticity dynamics recently discovered by the research team?s group, while the second explores the possibility of ambient vorticity being utilized directly by the tornado.  The project will be modelling-based, using the CM1 numerical model at 50m resolution for tornado simulations and 100m resolution for supercell simulations.  Six hypotheses would be addressed, 4 related to tornado intensification and 2 regarding the environmental source of vorticity:<br/><br/>? The transition toward the in-and-up mechanism results in rapid intensification of the vortex.<br/>? This transition is accompanied by a feedback loop at the scale of the vortex.<br/>? Whether or not the transition occurs depends on the strength of the initial vortex patch.<br/>? Once the in-and-up mechanism is active, the influx of vertical vorticity is no longer required (but not harmful) for vortex maintenance. However, continued influx of vertical vorticity may influence the diameter and intensity of the vortex.<br/>?

Most earthquakes are thought to result from this process, yet the underlying causes remain unclear. Earthquake triggering results in clustered ""families"" of earthquakes, with foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks. Foreshocks may provide information about possible upcoming, larger-magnitude mainshocks, and mainshock size and location may be used to forecast aftershocks. Still, there is much to learn, for example, what is it about a fault that makes it likely to be triggered by another earthquake, and can we use this knowledge to improve earthquake forecasts? Using newly-available instruments, Goebel and his group will record tiny earthquakes during abrupt fault slip between blocks of rock in their laboratory. They will see earthquake triggering as it happens in the lab, test conditions that make triggering more or less likely to occur, and apply this knowledge to real-world earthquakes. This research will contribute directly to improvements in assessing seismic hazard and forecasting aftershocks in real time.<br/><br/>Earthquake triggering is ubiquitous throughout different tectonic and stress regimes. Triggering processes involve static and dynamic stress transfer, post-seismic creep, poroelastic effects, sub-critical crack growth and rate- and state-dependent friction; however primary mechanisms and conditions that amplify aftershock triggering remain largely unresolved. Is triggering solely controlled by mainshock characteristics or also by local conditions such as fault stress and damage, and are there specific crustal properties that enhance triggering? What controls changes in triggering time-scales and are such changes indicative of stress state and proximity to large failure events? To address these questions, this study will concentrate on a multi-scale investigation of stress relaxation and triggering in lab and nature. Only a few studies have focused on seismic triggering in controlled frictional-sliding experiments that mimic earthquake behavior. Full waveforms of sub-millimeter lab-fractures and slip can now be recorded using high-speed, broad-band seismic instrumentation. Based on such records, this work will advance the ability to detect triggering during natural stress relaxation in the lab and test the hypothesis that triggering is not only a function of source characteristics but also of fault stress and damage state. The proposed research addresses three primary questions: 1) What conditions and mechanisms amplify earthquake triggering? 2) Are triggering time scales indicative of fault stress state and proximity to large failure events? 3) Which laboratory processes are scale-invariant and thus help advance the understanding of fault constitutive behavior? To address these questions, a series of triaxial and direct-shear tests on lab-generated faults at mid-crustal stresses will be conducted. These tests will assess the roles of i) fault roughness; ii) normal stress, iii) fault damage, iv) pore fluid pressure and v) stiffness in enhancing or inhibiting triggering. This research aims to unravel how these components are linked and how lab results can be transferred to the natural system. The results are expected to help identify key factors that govern triggering and their implications for earthquake predictability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of AI's many subfields, natural language processing (NLP) is one of the fastest growing. NLP focuses on how to automatically understand spoken or textual data, and billions of these textual or spoken exchanges are recorded online every day. Historically, using NLP required extensive coding expertise and a deep understanding of machine learning, but recent advances and work by the project team have laid the foundation for bringing authentic, situated NLP learning into middle school classrooms. The project foregrounds how to teach NLP with ethics and ethical reasoning applied to relevant local issues and will investigate how to integrate AI learning through NLP into middle school science on weather systems and cycles through problem-based learning. The research team will carry out participatory co-design with teachers and will provide potentially transformative experiences to twelve teachers and over one thousand students, leveraging existing partnerships within a multi-district, two-state effort in Florida, and Indiana in diverse schools with approximately 50% African-American students and the majority of students eligible for free or reduced lunch. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>Researchers will investigate the ways in which teacher professional development and participatory co-design can be tailored to support teachers' competencies and sense of preparedness to bring authentic, problem-based NLP experiences into science classrooms. For students, the project?s hypothesis is that these innovative experiences will foster competencies and attitudes toward STEM careers. The project is guided by the following research questions. (1) (a) What aspects of participatory co-design are helpful for supporting science teachers' development of AI education and NLP proficiencies? (b) In what ways can existing professional development strategies support AI-integrated science learning? (c) What new strategies emerge throughout the process? (2) (a) What kinds of AI-integrated science learning activities emerge from participatory co-design with teachers? (b) What specific adaptations are necessary to ensure activities are personally, locally, and culturally relevant for students? (3) How does integrated NLP and science support learner competencies (knowledge and skills in NLP and science) and ethical reasoning?; and (4) How does integrated NLP and science support students in establishing high quality engagement and fostering positive attitudes toward STEM careers (interest, identity, and intention to persist)? The project will investigate these questions using a mixed-methods design: qualitative data from teachers and students will include narrative accounts, observations of teaching practices, and interviews with teachers about their preparedness and self-efficacy for teaching AI-integrated science; quantitative data will include knowledge and skills assessments for AI-integrated science administered to both teachers and students. The project's deliverables will include (1) empirical findings from the above research questions and (2) an innovative NLP curriculum integrated into NGSS standards-aligned middle school science. The curriculum will be the outcome of iterative refinement over three years of the project through co-design with teachers. This curriculum, accompanying materials, and learning environment will be made publicly and freely available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Major societal challenges can benefit from large, coordinated solutions that leverage interdisciplinary teams with collaborations from academia, government, industry, and other stakeholders. However, many college and university faculty have limited experience, tools, and support to successfully engage in teams that extend beyond their department, much less their institution. The goal of this project is to create and sustain inter-institutional teams composed of junior and senior faculty members with broad STEM perspectives and methodologies focusing on pressing regional issues such as coastal challenges. This statewide research intervention project will be developed and supported by research development professionals embedded in higher education institutions across Florida. Broader impacts will accrue from instantiation of interdisciplinary, inter-institutional research teams who develop research projects capable of successfully addressing societal challenges. Success in this project will provide a template for replication and scaling by states and other sizable networks focused on addressing intractable problems with team-based solutions that cross disciplinary boundaries.<br/><br/>This project directly addresses gaps in researcher professional development, networking, and support by creating and guiding inter-institutional teams formed around important societal needs and informed by key community stakeholders. It involves a two-stage research intervention that commences with a collaborative learning and ideation event and continues with supported team and project development. The facilitators of these activities will be Research Development (RD) staff from Florida colleges and universities, under the guidance of a faculty expert in team science. These RD professionals are members of FloRDA, a statewide network of research staff from a set of 21 member institutions, including undergraduate and minority-serving institutions. During this program, RD professionals will serve as the ?glue? to form and facilitate faculty teams, as connective boundary spanners with institutional knowledge as well as broader knowledge encompassing opportunities for strategic growth, existing community partnerships, and statewide policy and funding initiatives. These facilitators will nurture newly formed research teams into stable groups with aligned goals and defined member roles, leveraging activities designed to enhance knowledge integration and create a shared transdisciplinary framework.

The demand for ultra-fast mobile and wireless systems has led the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to open four unlicensed bands above 95 GHz with a total of 21.2 GHz of bandwidth. These bands offer plentiful bandwidth for ultra-high-speed data transmission. However, most existing efforts involve enabling THz connectivity in the backhaul and fixed access. Indeed, different propagation characteristics, wide bandwidth, directionality, and lack of real-time adaptation prevent today?s THz wireless technologies to easily scale up and to support mobile users. This project will tackle the fundamental barriers of mobile THz communication and sensing. In particular, the project will design and build practical, scalable, mobile THz wireless technologies for next-generation communications systems. Developing new knowledge in these bands is strategically important for setting the stage for U.S. leadership in 6G and has implications for scientific and economic competitiveness. This project also advances education and diversity through developing new curricula, contributing to the training of underrepresented minorities, engaging with high-school students, and broadening access to THz testbeds. <br/><br/>The proposal will enable agile, adaptable, and scalable wireless terahertz networks via a fundamentally new cross-layer architecture and control plane design. The proposed research includes three inter-connected thrusts: (i) It will provide an underlying building block for creating and steering custom 3D directional beams to overcome the high path loss. It introduces a first-of-its-kind multi-slit antenna structure to electronically steer a THz beam via the unique property of coupling frequency, steering angle, and slit geometry. (ii) It aims to provide uninterrupted directional communication even in the presence of nodal and environmental mobility through demonstrating an architecture with versatile stand-alone control-plane functions, including path tracking and THz link diagnostics. (iii) It will introduce transformational capabilities for joint sensing and communication above 100 GHz. Namely, repurposing a wideband data-modulated signal emitted from the proposed multi-slit antenna architecture to infer the location of the receiver and the surrounding objects in the medium. These capabilities can open up entirely new realms of possibility for the design of next-generation networks.

Collagen is a key structural protein in living organisms.  It is essential to the function of soft tissues and load-bearing organs. Collagen is sensitive to mechanical loads.  Even microscopic damage can significantly undermine health or lead to disease. For example, the commercial collagen market will soon exceed $6B annually as people seek supplements and treatments for anti-aging and health of joints, skin, bone, and muscle. The ability to reconstruct native collagen or to engineer collagen with functional specifications would fulfill unmet needs across a range of applications. Demand is enormous, but the knowledge required to meet it remains limited. Our objective is to determine, for the first time, how mechanical loading prompts cells to produce the building blocks of collagen (precursors) as well as to produce collagen itself. The project will provide fundamental new insight into how cells convert mechanical stimuli into biological responses. This new knowledge will advance production of collagen and transform tissue engineering, providing practical design principles for using mechanical loading (e.g. compression) to drive the production of collagen in a laboratory setting. This work will enable novel therapies for collagen-related morbidities and advance clinical treatment for patients with soft-tissue injuries, disease, and deformities, thus advancing the national health.  A comprehensive outreach plan will disseminate results to both scientists and to the general public.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to (1) establish the roles of mechanical strains and stresses in driving metabolic production of the amino acid precursors that precede production of collagen and (2) establish and validate design principles for load-induced production of collagen to unlock fundamental understanding and functional tissue engineering. The application of precise, cyclic mechanical loadings to cell-seeded agarose specimens will achieve homogeneous stimulation from distinct principal strains, and separately, stresses. Combining these experiments with metabolomic flux and statistical analyses will establish relationships between principal strains and production of precursors. Computational modeling will establish relationships between principal stresses and metabolomic responses. This work will measure production of type VI collagen under different applied strains/stresses to quantify and validate design principles that enable the in vitro synthesis of collagen with specified mechanical properties. The significance of this knowledge is twofold: it will (1) contribute original, foundational knowledge on the relationships between mechanical stimuli and collagen production; and (2) provide tools for tissue engineers to produce advanced cell-based materials for functional replication of soft tissues. By establishing how specific stresses and strains drive mechanotransduction, this work will transform a range of fields and translational applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a range is primarily determined by the ecological niche of the species, which represents the environmental conditions (such as temperature, precipitation, or vegetation) that are suitable for the species and allow it to survive and reproduce. For example, the ecological niche of the Indian tiger is represented by high temperature, high precipitation, and dense vegetation. Sometimes, similar species have very different ecological niches. The ecological niche of the snow leopard is very different from that of the tiger, even though the two species are closely related. When ecological niches differ between two related species, it can be said that these ecological niches have diverged. But how much and in what ways do ecological niches diverge between two similar species? Here, the researcher will explore niche divergence among more than 150 species of grasshoppers from throughout North America. The knowledge and tools gained from this project will be applicable to a broad variety of questions related to important topics, such as species diversity (why are there so many species in the tropics?), species conservation (how much change in environmental conditions can a species endure?), or human health (can a tropical disease spread to areas with moderate climates?). The project will provide research and educational opportunities in state-of-the-art methods in ecology and evolution at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.<br/><br/>Despite the importance of understanding niche divergence in the fields of ecology and evolution, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of niche divergence and the mechanisms that drive their evolution have not been explored in a comprehensive way. This research will address knowledge gaps via a new theoretical and analytical framework to classify and quantify ecological niche divergence between taxa. This new classification system 1) promises to enhance understanding of different types of niche divergence; 2) can be applied to any ecosystem or group of organisms; and 3) can be used to address a broad variety of ecological and evolutionary questions. The framework will be used to explore the evolutionary, environmental, and biotic factors driving niche divergence in grasshoppers in the subfamily Oedipodinae, as a model system. Specific educational goals include advancing bioinformatics literacy necessary for success in STEM fields, providing applied skills to work with a variety of big data, and training students in interdisciplinary, integrative approaches for understanding patterns of biodiversity and advancing conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many different types of zooplankton have elongated spines, horns, or hairs. These structures are thought of as predator deterrents or sensory antennae. This project examines other ecologically important functions that spines might impact: feeding, swimming, sinking, and dislodgement from surfaces.  These functions depend on how animals interact with the water around them. This study investigates how spines work to alter the movement of the surrounding water and how that water movement varies in the early development of the ?nauplius? larval stage of different species of barnacles. Barnacles are a type of crustacean, a group that includes the commercially important crabs, shrimp, and lobsters. Since all crustaceans have a nauplius larval stage, this research will shed light on how this common body form operates, providing information about functional tradeoffs between different behaviors and body shapes. This project -- a collaboration between a small, liberal arts undergraduate college and a big research university -- brings together students and faculty from both to conduct the research and to train undergraduates. In addition, this project crosses disciplinary boundaries between biology and engineering, so students from different fields will learn how to communicate and collaborate. Principles discovered from this study can inform bio-inspired design of aquatic microrobots. The types of experiments designed will also be used to develop new science curricula.  <br/><br/>Diverse zooplankters bear spines with functions that are poorly understood. This study of the hydrodynamics of different species of barnacle larvae will determine (1) functional consequences of the presence, location, and morphology of spines on hydrodynamic forces and torques; (2) functional consequences of spines and appendage kinematics on the forces and torques generated, and on swimming, sinking, and feeding performance; and (3) hydrodynamic consequences of the change in body design from the planktonic nauplius to the settling cyprid form.  Kinematics and flow fields of larvae with distinctive morphologies and ecology are measured using micro-videography and high-speed particle image velocimetry. This comparative study on live organisms is coupled with experiments using dynamically scaled physical models to determine mechanisms by which specific features control forces and torques on, and flow fields around, larvae. Physical models allow parameters ? spine size and shape;  body size and shape; limb morphology; and kinematics -- to be varied in ways not possible with living organisms. In addition to elucidating general principles about the hydrodynamic consequences of spines at the poorly understood size and speed range of zooplankton ? the domain of intermediate Reynolds numbers -- the project will advance understanding of how tradeoffs between ecological functions impose biomechanical constraints that can shape the evolution of form. Collaboration between a PUI college and R1 university integrates research and undergraduate education at both. The question-driven, experience-based learning approach involves research teams of undergraduates from physical and biological sciences to develop their skills at interdisciplinary collaboration. Novel interdisciplinary course materials will be developed with context-rich modules for teaching quantitative skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bicycling has long been an important mobility mode for its environmental, health, and economic benefits. Nonetheless, bicycling is still largely underutilized in the U.S. The perceived danger of bicycling in motorized traffic has deterred many from considering it as a viable mobility option. This NSF grant will fill the knowledge gap to better understand how drivers and bicyclists interact with each other in the context of real-world roadway designs, and the key factors that shape their behaviors. The outcome of this research will support engineers and practitioners, city planners, and policymakers and legislators by providing data-driven insights to design safer road infrastructures, bicycle facilities, traffic laws and regulations, training and education programs, and safety technologies. The research activities are integrated with educational activities to foster local K-12 students' interests in STEM fields and train the next generation of scientists and engineers to work towards the urban future in which sustainable and active mobility will play a key role. The outreach to the local communities and dissemination of the online free educational materials on bicycling safety will promote active mobility modes to the general public nationwide.<br/><br/>The main research questions of this project are (a) how do drivers and bicyclists interact with each other in the context of roadways designs, (b) what are the key factors and underlying mechanisms for driver-bicyclist crashes and conflicts, and (c) how can researchers systematically generate data-driven insights in active mobility safety research? To this end, this grant will develop a bicycling safety research framework that incorporates a variety of complementary methodologies and technologies, including (1) observational studies in real-world natural settings from complementary perspectives using naturalistic driving, cycling, and drone data; (2) laboratory experiments in a safe, controlled, and replicable environment using high-fidelity virtual reality cycling and driving simulators; (3) crash data analysis of bicyclist fatalities and injuries; and (4) computational modeling and simulation. A number of common and dangerous driver-bicyclist interaction types will be examined, including overtaking bicyclists and intersection-related conflicts. A wide range of factors involving driver and vehicle, bicyclist, and road infrastructure will be examined for their effects on bicycling safety measured by surrogate safety measures. This research also integrates many tools including big data, causal inference, human factors, virtual reality, lidar sensing, and computational human modeling.

Direct resistance-heated thermal energy storage (DRH-ETS) technology stores electricity from the grid, which can either be directly utilized for high-temperature industrial heat or efficiently converted back to electricity. This directly addresses the global decarbonization challenges of (1) balancing supply and demand on an electrical grid with a high penetration of renewables, and (2) reducing industrial dependence of fossil fuels for producing high-temperature industrial heat. In 2021, combustion of fossil fuels for the production of heat in heavy industrial applications such as cement and steel-making accounted for 10% of all global emissions. Yet, the options for decarbonizing industrial heat inputs remain very limited, with most being cost-prohibitive at large scale. Traditional thermal energy storage technologies utilizing indirect metallic heating elements have been recognized as among the most cost-effective heating options but cannot achieve high enough temperatures to suit most carbon-intensive processes. DRH-ETS will overcome these limitations by using electricity to directly heat conductive thermal storage materials.<br/><br/>The proposed project will screen and develop materials that optimize the performance of DRH-ETS systems. While refractory oxide materials have good oxidation resistance and can be doped for electrical conductivity, most simple binary oxides are unable to satisfy the combination of required chemical, thermal, and electrical properties. As such, the number of known bulk-dopant material combinations that would be feasible for DRH-ETS applications is extremely limited. Here, mixed metal oxides are promising, but the relevant properties of most higher order mixtures are not readily known. To address this challenge, this project will perform computational screening of materials for single-phase stability over a large temperature range, small resistivity temperature derivative, and dopability. The screening will employ a combination of thermochemical modeling, electronic band structure calculations, and ab initio defect analysis to downselect from large multicomponent compositional spaces. This will result in improved understanding of composition-structure-property relationships in doped multinary metal oxides, which will inform system design and operation. This screening will be combined with fabrication and testing to identify and develop new candidate materials for achieving low cost and optimal performance in a DRH-ETS system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research findings will also enhance undergraduate and graduate education with exciting examples and demonstrations of real-world systems at the intersection of distributed computing, cloud computing, and deep learning.<br/><br/>The project will develop a novel serverless computing platform with a hybrid CPU/GPU architecture that will provide DL applications with native GPU performance. Two core components constitute the hybrid serverless computing architecture, a shim virtualized GPU (vGPU) layer and a refactored container subsystem. The shim vGPU layer enables high-performance GPU sharing for concurrent serverless functions with low latency and high scalability. This layer provides fine-grained GPU resource provisioning and performance isolation by intercepting GPU calls from serverless functions using API remoting techniques. The vGPU layer optimizes GPU performance in serverless computing via GPU context caching and locality-aware scheduling to mitigate cold-starts and unnecessary data movement. The container subsystem accelerates the entire DL lifecycle by exploiting DL model structures and pipelined model loading to parallelize CPU-to-GPU memory copy and model execution. The subsystem exploits model partitioning techniques to accelerate the hybrid CPU/GPU architecture by dynamically distributing the DL model partitions to CPU and GPU. The scientific knowledge and tools designed and implemented from this research project will provide and enable innovations for next-generation cloud computing and deep learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These questions are of particular salience where the overarching historical narrative portrays the interactions as controlled and dominated by Europeans, and emphasizes stereotyped depictions of the Indigenous groups living on the islands at contact. Scientists will conduct research to examine early colonial European-Indigenous interactions. A site, exposed by storm surge from Hurricane Maria in 2017, was an informal European trading complex established by colonial European settlers. It is situated along a protected bay on the Atlantic coastline and was one of the first sheltered anchorages for vessels voyaging from Africa and Europe. It was was one of few territories which continued for a significant time after contact to be controlled by Indigenous inhabitants. To ensure this work has broader impact beyond academia, the team will work collaboratively with the contemporary local community. Community members and residents will participate in excavations, and engage in frequent meetings on the interpretation of findings. To build local capacity for heritage protection, the team will hold a one-week archaeology ?camp"" and hire local research assistants to learn archaeological methods. In addition, with the support of local collaborator the project will contribute to the development of a museum and exhibits on the local colonial history.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to characterize the nature of the relationship between the indigenous inhabitants and European settlers, and examine the political, economic, and socioecological realities of an informal trading encampment at a colonial frontier. The project team will conduct remote sensing, geophysical and sub-surface survey coring for environmental and geomorphological data, and excavation of archaeological and geological features. Through the application of these methods, this project investigates the development of the trading complex and surrounding enclave. This research connects with questions of how European settlers and Indigenous groups were entangled within the broader processes of colonialism and ecological transformations, exploring themes of Indigenous resilience and agency in the face of conquest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Medical electronic devices cover a spectrum of equipment implementations, ranging from large diagnostic imaging machines to small mobile devices that patients carry with them. The digitized nature of modern computing platforms used in healthcare systems and their increased connectivity to computer networks have led into the growth of cybersecurity vulnerabilities making such systems a unique target for sophisticated cyber-attacks. The proposed project aims at developing effective and adaptive solutions for emerging healthcare cybersecurity challenges for securing biomedical computing platforms against potential malicious cyber-attacks. In addition, it will result in integrated engineering research projects and educational materials to mentor and train undergraduate and graduate students in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for security analysis and biomedical hardware-assisted cybersecurity. The proposed engineering research and educational activities are planned to provide students from varied engineering backgrounds such as computer engineering, computer science, and biomedical engineering majors with the necessary knowledge and skills to be competitive in the demanding job market where highly specialized hardware designers, AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and cybersecurity specialist are needed to develop new efficient methods for securing modern computing systems. <br/><br/>Traditionally, integrity of data being processed in computing systems has been safeguarded at the software level with the assumption that the underlying hardware is secure against potential attacks. However, biomedical devices have some unique features such as specific security requirements, implementation cost and design trade-offs characteristics, and limited resources and computational power that undermine their security protocols. In addition, strict regulations make it difficult to conduct basic software updates on medical computers and adopting off-the-shelf Anti-Virus (AV) protection is also insufficient for preventing emerging cyber-attacks such as malware. To overcome the performance overhead and inefficiency of conventional software-based solutions, the security in modern biomedical devices should be delegated to the underlying hardware, building a bottom-up solution for securing computing devices rather than treating it as an afterthought. In this project, we will leverage effective AI/ML techniques to develop accurate, low-cost, and adaptive techniques and build a multi-tiered intelligent framework for hardware-assisted cybersecurity in emerging biomedical devices. We will utilize the patterns of low-level hardware features captured by microprocessors? hardware components in biomedical devices to build novel intelligent techniques for recognizing and classifying emerging cyber-attacks (e.g., malware, side-channel attacks, stealthy attacks, zero-day attacks, etc.) with high accuracy and low computational overheads. The proposed research project targets five major objectives: 1) Comprehensive data collection, benchmarking, and feature analysis of emerging hardware-driven cyber-attacks in biomedical devices? processors, 2) Developing various standard and advanced machine learning techniques for intelligent hardware-assisted cybersecurity countermeasures using the hardware-related features, 3) Exploring hardware implementation results and on-device trade-off analysis of the intelligent hardware-assisted countermeasures, 4) Developing a reinforcement learning-based decision-maker for adaptive selection of the accurate and cost-efficient detector to facilitate online detection of the cyber-attacks, and 5) Developing a system-level ontology-based cybersecurity analysis framework for an effective automated knowledge reasoning in IoMT devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This increase means we need more sophisticated and automated approaches to infer patterns and structures from these datasets. The cell's three-dimensional (3D) chromosome and genome organization structure is one of the vital structures deducible in our data-rich society. Reconstructing the 3D organization of the genome is a complicated and challenging task. Nevertheless, it is necessary to understand many cellular activities, such as gene expression, gene stability, and regulation. To improve the understanding of chromosome organization within a cell, genomic technologies based on chromosome conformation capture techniques, particularly Hi-C, were developed. This development greatly improved cellular study and led to the development of multiple 3D chromosome structure reconstruction methods over the years. Although many 3D chromosome structure reconstruction methods have been proposed, detailed insight into the structural architecture of the chromosome and genome at a high resolution (<=5kb) is lacking. This project aims to develop an advanced and scalable algorithm for high-resolution 3D genome reconstruction from Hi-C data that provides enough detail to explain biological activities such as gene-gene interaction at a refined scale. This project will be developed as open-source tools and software. Also, the multidisciplinary nature of this project provides a mechanism for training and providing hands-on learning and mentoring opportunities in teaching and research to students at both undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>Specifically, the ultimate objective of this project is to develop computational and machine learning-based frameworks to elucidate the interplay between the hierarchical organization within the genome and its functions through high-resolution(<=5kb) 3D structure reconstruction. This project is expected to develop algorithms and computational tools to advance 3D genome organization research in the following aspects. First, a robust, reliable, and flexible high-resolution 3D chromosome and genome structure reconstruction algorithm will be developed. This algorithm will use graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) as the core method for spatial structure reconstruction. Second, it will develop a novel noninstance-based approach for 3D structure reconstruction capable of high-resolution 3D genome structure model prediction using a generalization approach, where a trained model can be used to reconstruct multiple chromosomes or used for prediction across resolutions. The proposed noninstance-based approach for 3D structure utilizes a node embedding algorithm for the graph node feature representation corresponding to each chromosomal locus. These features are trained with a GCNN to generate predictions for chromosome and genome 3D structure coordinates corresponding to each chromosomal locus. Overall, this project will investigate the GCNN complexity and model depth questions to provide a new approach for chromosome and genome 3D structure reconstruction at a high resolution. The successful implementation of this project will give a unique insight into the 3D organization of chromosomes and genomes and motivate the future development of noninstance-based methods for chromosome 3D structure prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While computers have enabled increasingly sophisticated methods for automation across all US manufacturing sectors, there are many cases where these algorithms become computationally prohibitive, making it impossible to maximize system performance. An open question is whether the emerging field of quantum computing can provide a solution to these computational constraints; however, because of the unique way quantum computers carry out their computations, the safety and performance implications for control systems incorporating quantum computers currently are unknown. This research program will develop the theory and computational tools needed to implement control systems on quantum computers. The work will provide the first comprehensive treatment of this topic with the goal of elucidating what types of algorithms quantum computer scientists should explore to create the next generation of automatic control systems. The research will define the utility and theory of controllers implemented on quantum computers, examining the interpretability of potentially non-deterministic controller outputs, privacy issues when implementing the controllers on a quantum Cloud architecture, and computation time reduction techniques for the controllers that are specific to the quantum environment. In addition, this project will initiate a unique outreach program based on tutorials and entertaining films for teaching science through stories. This program will engage undergraduate students across the nation and across disciplines in creating animated shorts and will involve high school students and undergraduate students in hands-on coding experiences that will serve to automate the animation development process.<br/><br/>This project constitutes the first comprehensive exploration of control system theory, design, and implementation using quantum computers. The research focuses on identifying the properties quantum computing algorithms must have to enable computing control actions for chemical processes. The goals of the work are to: 1) develop algorithmic implementations of current controllers (e.g., PID, Model Predictive Control) for quantum computers, with the control-theoretic conditions under which properties of a controller, such as safety/stability and performance, are maintained at acceptable levels when quantum computing algorithms are used to compute control actions; 2) develop chemical process-relevant interpretability metrics for control implemented on classical computers, and extend these to a quantum computing framework; 3) assess computation time reduction methods unique to the quantum computing context; 4) develop privacy and stability guarantees for encrypted control on quantum Cloud computers; and 5) simulate chemical processes under control actions computed by classical computers and quantum simulators (including noise). This project will also initiate a unique outreach program, launching a ?crowdsourcing? effort for tutorial and film creation that will form the foundation of the Principal Investigator's long-term outreach plan. This plan will involve undergraduates and high school students in the creation of animated shorts and codes for automating aspects of the animated short creation. These computational tools will aid the next generation of engineers in participating in exciting the community about STEM via stories that convey aspects of engineering and present a diverse group of characters who are scientists and engineers as role models for younger students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies report that drought stress alone yields up to 21% and 40% of global reductions in wheat and maize productions, respectively. In addition, agriculture accounts for 55 to 60% of methane emissions and 21 to 25% of carbon-di-oxide emissions globally, thus poorly planned and unsustainable agriculture practices contribute substantially to global warming. Lack of real-time monitoring capabilities of crop health remains one of the central limiting factors for simultaneously mitigating productivity losses and adverse environmental impacts of agriculture practices. There has been a significant thrust in the development of wearable medical devices. However, their applications remain heavily unexplored in plants. Toward this end, this project will develop new crop-wearable technologies that can monitor the levels of plant hormones (which denote a plant?s first response to its environment), as well as record plant tissue remodeling under environmental stressors (e.g., drought, heat, and salinity stresses). This technology could be a pivotal tool in precision farming enabling real-time tracking of the fitness of plants, with direct benefit to the agricultural society. The findings from this project will aid in engineering higher-performing, stress-tolerant crop cultivars and setting up on-demand irrigation schedules in the long run, thus preventing the over-application of nonrenewable agrochemicals while simultaneously increasing the production. This project will also train students from minority backgrounds and the producer community on the productivity advantages of sensors-driven precision farming.<br/><br/>This research aims to design, fabricate, and validate integrated, in-situ plant sensors for catalyzing the next generation of crop engineering and precision farming. Real-time monitoring of crop parameters is crucial for implementing immediate interventions to mitigate productivity losses and adverse environmental impacts. Sensors for precision farming applications are limited to indirectly estimating crop needs and health issues from weather conditions, soil properties, or aerial imagery that do not provide chemical profiling in plants, thereby lacking information on the onset and progression of crop health conditions. Hence, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding precisely and directly quantifying plant needs and their responses to environmental conditions. This research proposes a holistic solution to this problem by developing an integrated, multiplexed stem sensor for in-situ and quantitative profiling of four key phytohormones/secondary metabolites, which denote a plant?s first response to its environment. The device is comprised of an array of electrochemical sensors, integral microfluidics, and data processing in an embedded platform for in-situ collection and monitoring of phytohormones in sap. The sensor will be validated with maize grown under abiotic stress conditions to (1) analyze the sensor?s sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, and impact on plant growth, (2) elucidate the dynamic correlations between the phytohormones under environmental stress conditions through multiplexed sensing, and (3) harness these data streams to differentiate the impact of heat/drought/salinity stresses on plants. The second thrust of this research is to design and simulate a photonic crystal-based fiber-optic bundle for use in real-time root endoscopy and spectroscopy in living plants. This first-of-its-kind fiber bundle will be pivotal in imaging root zone and monitoring root exudate metabolites in real-time. The combined analysis of tissue-specific (shoot versus root) metabolites and deciphering the dynamic tissue remodeling will enhance our fundamental understanding of metabolite gradients across the whole plant, real-time adaptation of roots to stressors (questions that remain unexplored in previous studies) and illuminate a pathway for new crop breeding strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of AI's many subfields, natural language processing (NLP) is one of the fastest growing. NLP focuses on how to automatically understand spoken or textual data, and billions of these textual or spoken exchanges are recorded online every day. Historically, using NLP required extensive coding expertise and a deep understanding of machine learning, but recent advances and work by the project team have laid the foundation for bringing authentic, situated NLP learning into middle school classrooms. The project foregrounds how to teach NLP with ethics and ethical reasoning applied to relevant local issues and will investigate how to integrate AI learning through NLP into middle school science on weather systems and cycles through problem-based learning. The research team will carry out participatory co-design with teachers and will provide potentially transformative experiences to twelve teachers and over one thousand students, leveraging existing partnerships within a multi-district, two-state effort in Florida, and Indiana in diverse schools with approximately 50% African-American students and the majority of students eligible for free or reduced lunch. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>Researchers will investigate the ways in which teacher professional development and participatory co-design can be tailored to support teachers' competencies and sense of preparedness to bring authentic, problem-based NLP experiences into science classrooms. For students, the project?s hypothesis is that these innovative experiences will foster competencies and attitudes toward STEM careers. The project is guided by the following research questions. (1) (a) What aspects of participatory co-design are helpful for supporting science teachers' development of AI education and NLP proficiencies? (b) In what ways can existing professional development strategies support AI-integrated science learning? (c) What new strategies emerge throughout the process? (2) (a) What kinds of AI-integrated science learning activities emerge from participatory co-design with teachers? (b) What specific adaptations are necessary to ensure activities are personally, locally, and culturally relevant for students? (3) How does integrated NLP and science support learner competencies (knowledge and skills in NLP and science) and ethical reasoning?; and (4) How does integrated NLP and science support students in establishing high quality engagement and fostering positive attitudes toward STEM careers (interest, identity, and intention to persist)? The project will investigate these questions using a mixed-methods design: qualitative data from teachers and students will include narrative accounts, observations of teaching practices, and interviews with teachers about their preparedness and self-efficacy for teaching AI-integrated science; quantitative data will include knowledge and skills assessments for AI-integrated science administered to both teachers and students. The project's deliverables will include (1) empirical findings from the above research questions and (2) an innovative NLP curriculum integrated into NGSS standards-aligned middle school science. The curriculum will be the outcome of iterative refinement over three years of the project through co-design with teachers.

The expansion of deoxygenation has significant ecological consequences and impacts global climate through biologically-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling changes. Understanding the survival strategies and biogeochemical contributions of organisms that tolerate very low-oxygen environments is thus critical. This project investigates the strategies that free-floating foraminifera, an important group of eukaryotic single-celled organisms, use to survive within the OMZ. A particular focus is whether foraminifera in the water column can respire nitrogen like foraminifera species within the ocean floor and contribute significantly to global nitrogen cycling. This project supports two early-career female scientists, including one from an underrepresented group in geosciences, and at sea and laboratory training for one graduate student and several undergraduates at North Carolina State University. In addition, science outreach includes a Science-through-Art exhibition in collaboration with a professor at the University of Iowa and a multimedia multi-sensory teaching module for freshman high school students in Falmouth, MA, to share aspects of the project about marine species living in deoxygenated settings.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the biological strategies planktic foraminifera use to thrive in dysoxic and anoxic environments in the pelagic ocean. The project tests three interrelated hypotheses: 1. OMZ-dwelling planktic foraminifera are capable of performing denitrification; 2. Denitrification is widespread among planktic foraminifera, within and beyond OMZ-affiliated taxa; 3. Planktic foraminifera capable of nitrate respiration do so regardless of macroenvironmental oxygen concentrations. Samples from depth-stratified net tows (MOCNESS) along a north-south transect above and within the Northeastern Pacific OMZ are used to quantify the abundance and distribution of planktic foraminifera across oxygen gradients and to understand how planktic foraminifera tolerate low-oxygen environments. Metatranscriptomic analyses of foraminifera species thought to live in variable oxygen environments are used to test for the presence of denitrification pathways. Additional shipboard incubations of individuals allow direct testing for denitrification. These analyses are assessing how widespread denitrification potential is among planktic foraminifera and under what oxygen concentrations foraminifera may actively denitrify. Additionally, analysis of preserved foraminifera are determining cytoplasm nitrate and nitrogen isotope content and cytological studies to elucidate ultrastructure to reveal other potential survival strategies (i.e., symbiosis).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With accelerated climate change, it is essential that mechanisms diversifying crop genomes be understood and applied to feed future generations. Most plant and animal genomes are derived from transposable elements (TEs), mobile fragments of DNA that often increase in copy number as they transpose from one genomic locus to another. The ability of TEs to insert near genes and alter their regulation and to promote genomic rearrangements and epigenetic changes has recently been recognized as a significant contributor to adaptive evolution. Stated simply, TEs can shake up otherwise (structurally) conservative genomes. This project exploits long read DNA sequencing technology and single cell epigenetic analyses to reveal how the rapidly amplifying TE called mPing alters, in real time, the rice genome, while avoiding host (epigenetic) silencing and mutagenic insertions. With respect to broader impacts, this project also addresses a crisis in the agricultural workforce, which is the oldest and least diverse among the sciences, by introducing undergraduates at a Hispanic Serving Institution to the excitement of plant genomics through authentic research experiences for up to 2000 incoming students/year.  <br/><br/>The research goals of this project are two-fold.

Based on prior results, it is anticipated that at least 50,000 additional mPing insertion sites [with ~15% in accessible chromatin regions (ACRs)] and numerous structural variants (SVs) including copy number and presence absence variants and inversions will be identified. The second goal is to determine the consequences of a subset of these lesions on epigenetic regulation and reproductive isolation by generating a rice single cell cis-regulatory atlas and assessing the impact of mPing inserts in targeted RI lines. While the vast majority of the ~50,000 de novo mPing insertions may be neutral or eliminated by selection over evolutionary time, in the short term they will provide an invaluable tool to evaluate the function of ACRs more quickly and for far less cost than any other method currently available. Results of this project will reveal the potential of rapid TE amplification to reshape the epigenome, lead to reproductive isolation, and, for SVs, to rapidly generate the genomic variation that underlies pangenomes. All data generated by this project will be made available through deposition at established long-term sequence repositories such as the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The expansion of deoxygenation has significant ecological consequences and impacts global climate through biologically-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling changes. Understanding the survival strategies and biogeochemical contributions of organisms that tolerate very low-oxygen environments is thus critical. This project investigates the strategies that free-floating foraminifera, an important group of eukaryotic single-celled organisms, use to survive within the OMZ. A particular focus is whether foraminifera in the water column can respire nitrogen like foraminifera species within the ocean floor and contribute significantly to global nitrogen cycling. This project supports two early-career female scientists, including one from an underrepresented group in geosciences, and at sea and laboratory training for one graduate student and several undergraduates at North Carolina State University. In addition, science outreach includes a Science-through-Art exhibition in collaboration with a professor at the University of Iowa and a multimedia multi-sensory teaching module for freshman high school students in Falmouth, MA, to share aspects of the project about marine species living in deoxygenated settings.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the biological strategies planktic foraminifera use to thrive in dysoxic and anoxic environments in the pelagic ocean. The project tests three interrelated hypotheses: 1. OMZ-dwelling planktic foraminifera are capable of performing denitrification; 2. Denitrification is widespread among planktic foraminifera, within and beyond OMZ-affiliated taxa; 3. Planktic foraminifera capable of nitrate respiration do so regardless of macroenvironmental oxygen concentrations. Samples from depth-stratified net tows (MOCNESS) along a north-south transect above and within the Northeastern Pacific OMZ are used to quantify the abundance and distribution of planktic foraminifera across oxygen gradients and to understand how planktic foraminifera tolerate low-oxygen environments. Metatranscriptomic analyses of foraminifera species thought to live in variable oxygen environments are used to test for the presence of denitrification pathways. Additional shipboard incubations of individuals allow direct testing for denitrification. These analyses are assessing how widespread denitrification potential is among planktic foraminifera and under what oxygen concentrations foraminifera may actively denitrify. Additionally, analysis of preserved foraminifera are determining cytoplasm nitrate and nitrogen isotope content and cytological studies to elucidate ultrastructure to reveal other potential survival strategies (i.e., symbiosis).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These questions are of particular salience where the overarching historical narrative portrays the interactions as controlled and dominated by Europeans, and emphasizes stereotyped depictions of the Indigenous groups living on the islands at contact. Scientists will conduct research to examine early colonial European-Indigenous interactions. A site, exposed by storm surge from Hurricane Maria in 2017, was an informal European trading complex established by colonial European settlers. It is situated along a protected bay on the Atlantic coastline and was one of the first sheltered anchorages for vessels voyaging from Africa and Europe. It was was one of few territories which continued for a significant time after contact to be controlled by Indigenous inhabitants. To ensure this work has broader impact beyond academia, the team will work collaboratively with the contemporary local community. Community members and residents will participate in excavations, and engage in frequent meetings on the interpretation of findings. To build local capacity for heritage protection, the team will hold a one-week archaeology ?camp"" and hire local research assistants to learn archaeological methods. In addition, with the support of local collaborator the project will contribute to the development of a museum and exhibits on the local colonial history.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to characterize the nature of the relationship between the indigenous inhabitants and European settlers, and examine the political, economic, and socioecological realities of an informal trading encampment at a colonial frontier. The project team will conduct remote sensing, geophysical and sub-surface survey coring for environmental and geomorphological data, and excavation of archaeological and geological features. Through the application of these methods, this project investigates the development of the trading complex and surrounding enclave.

In a time of increasing migration and environmental instability worldwide, archaeological research that centers networks of people linked by material culture and practice reveals how people contend with the universal challenges of negotiating physical and cultural borders. Anthropological approaches such as this, grounded in archaeological data, contribute resilient strategies for a changing world. This project will emphasize the participation and training of first-generation and Indigenous students in archaeological research.

This region presents a new context for investigating increasing social complexity in coastal environments, and among people who did not rely on agriculture to provide the food surplus that typically underpins complex societies.

Winds generated from thunderstorms (i.e., thunderstorm winds) are responsible for a significant proportion of windstorm losses. Buildings and other structures are designed based on full-scale measurements in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow. The limited wind speed data collected on thunderstorm winds near the ground show they possess different properties than the ABL, which in turn influences wind loading on structures. Due to the lack of full-scale wind speed data, the results of numerical and experimental simulations are difficult to validate. This research will obtain comprehensive field measurements that will fill critical gaps in spatial and temporal scales and include joint measurements of wind speed and wind loading. These measurements will be assimilated into new and updated engineering models and frameworks for thunderstorms. To increase broader knowledge of thunderstorm importance, collaboration with the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) wind engineering facilities at Florida International University and the University of Florida will commence to stimulate research in computational and experimental wind engineering where field measurements are a critical need for simulation. Engaging and educating the public will take place through citizen science, K-12 outreach programs on wind hazards, and local media interviews. This award will contribute to the NSF role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Project data will be archived in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org).<br/><br/>There is currently no ABL analog for thunderstorm winds, due in part to the large variability observed in characteristics relevant to engineering such as vertical profiles of the wind. This project will focus on collocated and 4-D measurements of wind speed and wind loading near the ground at high spatiotemporal resolution that places engineering as the central focus. Specifically, the first task of the project will be to measure wind and wind loading characteristics of thunderstorm winds at a fixed site in Illinois, which will include widely and densely distributed sensors. This objective will be complemented by the second task, which is the measurement of wind and wind-induced loading through field deployments using mobile instrumentation, and the third task, which is the inference of thunderstorm wind characteristics from post-event damage surveys. The fourth task will build new empirical functions and thunderstorm wind field models based on the data collected. These functions and models will incorporate different thunderstorm wind types (e.g., derecho and isolated downburst) and will improve understanding of observed variability. Collection of new and unique datasets will promote new and fundamental discoveries for thunderstorm winds. This research aims toward a comprehensive engineering-based thunderstorm model similar to those developed for tropical cyclones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeology is uniquely positioned to investigate the history of such marginal environments, which have been largely dismissed in the recent past as unsuitable for human habitation. Previous research has already revealed a rich (if non-continuous) history of use on many such islands. The current project will provide an expanded and comprehensive study of small-island environments in order to investigate the correlation between island size and risk of settlement and exploitation, based on size, environmental diversity, and locational affordances of marginality and connectivity. Survey archaeology has traditionally focused on the history of settlement across a continuous landscape. This project provides also a history of non-settlement, of incidental use, across a particular type of maritime setting. The research will produce a series of individual cases studies and a large-scale, comparative framework analysis of cycles of use and abandonment in an under-researched type of island environment.<br/><br/>Two seasons of fieldwork will provide systematic archaeological surveys of 30 uninhabited islands. A geomorphological study will be conducted alongside the archaeological survey, in order to provide a fully interdisciplinary analysis of  individual island landscapes, as well as a new study of the dynamic human and natural history. As an RUI proposal, this project provides unique research opportunities to undergraduate students in the archaeology program (and related fields).

However, uncontrolled EV to power grid integration, particularly in smaller-scale power systems such as microgrids, brings significant problems, e.g., power flow fluctuation and unacceptable load peaks reducing power network reliability and power quality. In this project we develop a framework to use the flexible energy capacity of EVs to provide services for microgrids. This method increases EV owners? engagements and will enhance social welfare for all shareholders of the vehicle to microgrid (V2M) connection including EV owners, intelligent charging stations (ICSs), and microgrids. Considering the vast amount of data required for managing a large number of EVs in a microgrid, the project will employ advanced machine learning techniques and analytical approaches to reduce the computational complexity of the problem. The proposed framework will provide an understanding of the characteristics and requirements for future cyberinfrastructure design, particularly in integrated large-scale ecosystems. This work represents a broad, novel contribution to literature, education, outreach, and diversity; as such, the project aligns with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science and to advance prosperity and welfare. <br/><br/>The overall aim of the project is to develop a (near) real-time low computational cost framework for V2M integration. The research incorporates concepts of load prediction and game theory advancing V2M technology to use the flexible energy capacity of EVs in microgrids according to the needs of both. Traditional clustering and forecasting methods cannot be directly applied to microgrids due to their high volatility load profile caused by coupling various distributed energy resources. The technical contribution of the project is threefold: 1) to design an innovative machine learning-enabled algorithm for short-term load forecasting in microgrids that consists of robust data preprocessing, feature extraction, and a selection algorithm, followed by a weighted advanced long short-term memory (WA-LSTM) model. The selected features have high relevance and minimum redundancy reducing the computational cost significantly for the proposed WA-LSTM to predict the load profile; 2) to develop a cooperative game to capture interactions among EVs and their corresponding ICSs that outlines (dis)charging profiles for EVs considering vehicle parameters and constraints. A Nash bargaining game with relaxed constraints and a new penalty distribution policy is proposed to maximize the profits of all players in the coalition while satisfying the microgrids' requirements as the global goal; 3) to evaluate the proposed methods in experimental testbeds using hardware in the loop (HIL) setups to provide both analytic and experimental evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In exploring such a question, this research examines how imprisoned people and the people with whom they share close ties manage to build affective networks, bonds of mutuality, and reciprocity within and across prison borders. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the project strives to enrich the public's understanding of science and the scientific method by sharing its findings through public-facing venues and organizational dissemination. The project also broadens the participation of historically underrepresented groups in the production of scientific knowledge. <br/><br/>A core hypothesis of this research is that incarceration impacts the strength of social bonds among imprisoned people and their social networks in ways that parallel the systematicity of chattel slavery. The doctoral student tests this hypothesis through an in-depth, rigorous analysis of archival sources from historical and contemporary epochs. The researcher will complement these data with twelve months of participant observation and approximately seventy-five semi-structured interviews with interlocutors in two organizations that facilitate communications with incarcerated individuals. Thus, while many generative studies insinuate a link between enslavement and imprisonment in the United States, the present study will be one of the first to test a hypothesis about the link with a scientific and ethnographic eye. In so doing, this doctoral dissertation project advances the ascendant, interdisciplinary scholarship that seeks to uncover a usable carceral past in order to better comprehend the scope and scale of the contemporary prison system. The project integrates analysis of archival, sociolegal, and ethnographic data to improve scientific understanding of how people navigate institutional bureaucracies and spatial challenges to forge and maintain affective and kin-based relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is estimated that at least 5.2 GHz bandwidth is required for just eHealth Care IoT if spectrum is accessed exclusively, or 1.3 GHz even with dynamic sharing strategy. It is clear that shortage of spectrum resources is a major bottleneck for the success of IoT popularity. On the other hand, current IoT devices use standards such as Bluetooth, LoRA, Sigfox, narrow-band IoT (NB-IoT), or Zigbee, which require power-hungry active radio frequency components like oscillators and converters. Battery-driven IoT devices can hardly sustain years of life-cycle goal even with infrequent transmission and optimized low-power protocols. Thus, sustainable energy consumption is another challenge.

This research seeks to improve SE and EE performance while providing guaranteed quality of service (QoS) for IoTs at large-scale, thereby providing a feasible and practical connectivity solution in massive IoT era. Outcomes from this project can bring following impacts: 1) a hybrid and cooperative communication architect for IoTs, which combines benefits from both active and passive mode; 2) integration of research and curriculum design, capstone projects to both undergraduate and graduate students; 3) cutting-edge research experiences to a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI). <br/><br/>The core approach is to enable IoT device with a wireless-powered hybrid communication structure that can not only minimize energy footprint with energy harvesting from ambient signals, but also integrate coordinated passive and active communication to support versatile QoS needs with efficient spectrum utilization through user cooperation.

Optimization problems for SE and EE metrics are introduced from PHY resource allocation perspective. 2) The co-designed MAC layer protocol to ensure proper user and resource coordination. Two protocols will be introduced, one for maximum performance and the other for lower complexity. 3) System validation with software and hardware implementations.

The goal of this project is to create and sustain inter-institutional teams composed of junior and senior faculty members with broad STEM perspectives and methodologies focusing on pressing regional issues such as coastal challenges. This statewide research intervention project will be developed and supported by research development professionals embedded in higher education institutions across Florida. Broader impacts will accrue from instantiation of interdisciplinary, inter-institutional research teams who develop research projects capable of successfully addressing societal challenges. Success in this project will provide a template for replication and scaling by states and other sizable networks focused on addressing intractable problems with team-based solutions that cross disciplinary boundaries.<br/><br/>This project directly addresses gaps in researcher professional development, networking, and support by creating and guiding inter-institutional teams formed around important societal needs and informed by key community stakeholders. It involves a two-stage research intervention that commences with a collaborative learning and ideation event and continues with supported team and project development. The facilitators of these activities will be Research Development (RD) staff from Florida colleges and universities, under the guidance of a faculty expert in team science. These RD professionals are members of FloRDA, a statewide network of research staff from a set of 21 member institutions, including undergraduate and minority-serving institutions. During this program, RD professionals will serve as the ?glue? to form and facilitate faculty teams, as connective boundary spanners with institutional knowledge as well as broader knowledge encompassing opportunities for strategic growth, existing community partnerships, and statewide policy and funding initiatives. These facilitators will nurture newly formed research teams into stable groups with aligned goals and defined member roles, leveraging activities designed to enhance knowledge integration and create a shared transdisciplinary framework. Success in this project may enhance understanding of how to implement team science approaches in geographically dispersed groups. It will also be important for charting a path through which RD professionals can foster and support team science spanning multiple partner organizations.<br/><br/>""""""<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This risk assessment score is then used by juvenile justice practitioners to inform how to intervene with a youth to prevent reoffending (e.g., referring youth to a community-based program vs. placing a youth in a juvenile correctional center). Unfortunately, most risk assessment systems lack transparency and often the reasons why a youth received a particular score are unclear. Moreover, how these scores are used in the decision making process is sometimes not well understood by families and youth affected by such decisions.  This possibility is problematic because it can hinder individuals? buy-in to the intervention recommended by the risk assessment as well as mask potential bias in those scores (e.g., if youth of a particular race or gender have risk scores driven by a particular item on the assessment). To address this issue, project researchers will develop automated, computer-generated explanations for these risk scores aimed at explaining how these scores were produced.  Investigators will then test whether these better-explained risk scores help youth and juvenile justice decision makers understand the risk score a youth is given. In addition, the team of researchers will investigate whether these risk scores are working equally well for different groups of youth (for example, equally well for boys and for girls) and identify any potential biases in how they are being used in an effort to understand how equitable the decision making process is for demographic groups based on race and gender.   The project is embedded within the juvenile justice system and aims to evaluate how real stakeholders understand how the risk scores are generated and used within that system based on actual juvenile justice system data.  <br/><br/>More specifically, this project aims to understand how risk assessment scores are currently being used in the juvenile justice system and how interpretable machine learning methods can be used to make black-box risk assessment algorithms more transparent (without reverse engineering them given that most assessments are proprietary).  The team of researchers endeavor to understand the way that juvenile justice risk scores are being used through the analysis of quantitative data from the juvenile justice system (which details the risk scores and justice system decisions) and through qualitative data collected via key informant interviews. In the second phase of the work, the team of researchers will train various interpretable machine learning algorithms to predict youth?s risk scores (which are currently generated by a proprietary, black-box algorithm).  The team will also predict the sentencing dispositions for youth based on these risk scores and other pertinent data collected by the juvenile justice system.   The project team will then test and measure how understandable a series of the automated explanations derived from these machine learning methods are to youth, families, judges and probation officers.   The goal of this step will be to identify algorithms that are highly predictive of the risk score and dispositions, respectively and then to identify methods that provide clear, human-interpretable explanations of the risk and dispositions to key stakeholders throughout the process.  This step will also allow researchers to optimize methods for explaining outcomes by possibly identifying one method that is more understandable for explaining risk scores to youth compared to another method that is more understandable for their families or probation officers, for example.    Finally, the project team will also explore the potential for bias throughout the process (from risk scoring to the use of the scores) and ways in which these interpretable algorithms can be used to help identify, quantify and mitigate biases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many different types of zooplankton have elongated spines, horns, or hairs. These structures are thought of as predator deterrents or sensory antennae. This project examines other ecologically important functions that spines might impact: feeding, swimming, sinking, and dislodgement from surfaces.  These functions depend on how animals interact with the water around them. This study investigates how spines work to alter the movement of the surrounding water and how that water movement varies in the early development of the ?nauplius? larval stage of different species of barnacles. Barnacles are a type of crustacean, a group that includes the commercially important crabs, shrimp, and lobsters. Since all crustaceans have a nauplius larval stage, this research will shed light on how this common body form operates, providing information about functional tradeoffs between different behaviors and body shapes. This project -- a collaboration between a small, liberal arts undergraduate college and a big research university -- brings together students and faculty from both to conduct the research and to train undergraduates. In addition, this project crosses disciplinary boundaries between biology and engineering, so students from different fields will learn how to communicate and collaborate. Principles discovered from this study can inform bio-inspired design of aquatic microrobots. The types of experiments designed will also be used to develop new science curricula.  <br/>Diverse zooplankters bear spines with functions that are poorly understood. This study of the hydrodynamics of different species of barnacle larvae will determine (1) functional consequences of the presence, location, and morphology of spines on hydrodynamic forces and torques; (2) functional consequences of spines and appendage kinematics on the forces and torques generated, and on swimming, sinking, and feeding performance; and (3) hydrodynamic consequences of the change in body design from the planktonic nauplius to the settling cyprid form.  Kinematics and flow fields of larvae with distinctive morphologies and ecology are measured using micro-videography and high-speed particle image velocimetry. This comparative study on live organisms is coupled with experiments using dynamically scaled physical models to determine mechanisms by which specific features control forces and torques on, and flow fields around, larvae. Physical models allow parameters ? spine size and shape;  body size and shape; limb morphology; and kinematics -- to be varied in ways not possible with living organisms. In addition to elucidating general principles about the hydrodynamic consequences of spines at the poorly understood size and speed range of zooplankton ? the domain of intermediate Reynolds numbers -- the project will advance understanding of how tradeoffs between ecological functions impose biomechanical constraints that can shape the evolution of form. Collaboration between a PUI college and R1 university integrates research and undergraduate education at both. The question-driven, experience-based learning approach involves research teams of undergraduates from physical and biological sciences to develop their skills at interdisciplinary collaboration. Novel interdisciplinary course materials will be developed with context-rich modules for teaching quantitative skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Movement disorders are considered one of the first signs of ASD, and probably precede social or linguistic abnormalities.  But differences in motor movement quality are also associated with other conditions, such as Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Coordination Disorder, so while early motor deficits are not in themselves diagnostic of ASD they are risk indicators.  This research will directly aid in early identification of motor deficits in infants, thereby enabling early treatment resulting in better quality of life as well as reduced healthcare and education costs.  Additional broad impact will derive from inclusion of an underserved, low-income population with health disparities from Puerto Rico, which will help ameliorate a critical public health research gap (since prior studies have focused overwhelmingly on White, high socio-economic status samples, with only limited relevance to historically marginalized and at-risk communities).

Cephalopods like squid and octopus are ecologically important, as both predator and prey, and economically important for the U.S. fisheries industry. This project will investigate patterns of evolution and extinction in fossil relatives of modern squid and octopus, the ammonoids. Between 90 and 100 million years ago, Earth experienced multiple episodes of cooling and warming. By investigating the traits that helped some ammonoid species survive these events, the project will identify key factors that control extinction risk in cephalopods. The project will also include training for undergraduate and graduate students at two universities, contribute to publicly available databases and computer- and internet-based research tools, and develop educational materials for children and the general public on how climate change affects marine animals and ecosystems.<br/><br/>The Cenomanian-Turonian interval of the early Late Cretaceous witnessed three substantial climate shifts, cooling and sea level falls in the middle Cenomanian and middle Turonian and warming, widespread anoxia, and elevated sea level over the latest Cenomanian and earliest Turonian. This project will include the use of both Bayesian phylogenetic analyses and ecomorphospace analyses of the ammonoid cephalopod superfamily Acanthoceratoidea to tease apart the extent to which these environmental perturbations affected acanthoceratoid diversity dynamics as a whole and how those perturbations affected different morphotypes associated with different basic ammonoid ecological habits. The project team will test hypotheses related to phylogenetic and ecomorphological selectivity across each of these three events and assess alternative extinction and origination models across Acanthoceratoidea. The phylogenetic analyses represent the first use of Bayesian phylogenetic methods for ammonoids and also contribute to advancements for simultaneously assessing macroevolutionary models and phylogenetic relationships via Bayesian methods. Thus, the final results will both be informative about how particular climate shifts affected ammonoid extinction rates and provide a model for similar assessments of other taxonomic groups during other critical intervals of Earth system evolution. Ultimately, the proposed research will identify key factors that drive diversity dynamics and extinction risk for mid-level predators, an important but often overlooked marine ecologic guild.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite progress in establishing the neural basis of timing on the scale of milliseconds and circadian timing over hours, many fundamental questions remain about time encoding on the intermediate scale of interval timing (i.e. second to tens of minutes). To investigate how interval time is represented in the brain we will develop a novel behavioral paradigm that will be used in concert with imaging methods we have developed to monitor and manipulate thousands of brain cells in medial entorhinal cortex. This work will provide a basis for understanding how the brain performs complex functions that depend upon encoding of time on the scale of seconds to minutes. The research also has the potential to guide our understanding of disease and provide targeted therapies for several prevalent neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, this grant will support broader impacts through a science-communication workshop that is designed to support senior-level neuroscience graduate students, with a strong emphasis on supporting students from under-represented backgrounds. <br/><br/>This proposal will address fundamental questions regarding the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interval timing. Prior work suggests that medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) could play a selective role only during the initial learning phase of interval timing behavior. However, an intriguing hypothesis is that MEC might be necessary for interval timing before and/or after learning, depending on whether the particular timing behavior is amendable to striatal-based procedural learning, rather than playing selective role only during the initial learning phase of interval timing behavior. In this view, timing behavior that require temporal information to be flexibly represented or rapidly learned might continuously require MEC. On the other hand, simple timing behaviors with task parameters that remain constant might only require MEC during initial learning and could be solved later on through brain circuits that serve procedural learning, such as the dorsal striatum. This proposal will apply a novel interval timing paradigm to test the hypothesis that MEC is necessary for interval timing before and/or after learning, depending on the constraints imposed by the particular timing behavior to be learned. In order to test this hypothesis we will leverage several methodological approaches that we have recently developed for large-scale cellular resolution functional imaging in MEC in behaving mice. By combining these methods with a series of causal neural manipulations we will determine which brain circuits are differentially involved in interval timing behavior across tasks that require rapid, flexible timing versus static, repetitive timing. Further, we will determine the neural dynamics in MEC that underlie learning of rapid, flexible timing behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the sentence ""The dog with the very shiny and healthy black fur doesn?t usually bark"" requires the listener or reader to associate the dog with bark, even though those words are quite far apart. To do this, language users need to rely on memory to link words and concepts. However, human memory is famously prone to error: Humans routinely forget, misremember, and conflate aspects of their experience. In the context of language understanding, these memory failures can lead to incorrect interpretations of sentences. This project aims to understand how and why memory can distort reading and language comprehension by looking at how memory errors impact users of two very different languages, English and Hebrew. English and Hebrew differ in how they organize the words within sentences and whether they assign gender to nouns; Hebrew assigns masculine and feminine genders to nouns, similar to languages like Spanish and French but unlike English. The researchers will study how these linguistic differences between Hebrew and English influence when interpretation errors will arise in users of these two languages. In doing so, the researchers will try to uncover characteristics of memory errors that have the same effect on understanding across languages and those that are language-specific. The results of this project will be used to understand how human memory systems support real-time language comprehension.<br/><br/>Research on this question suggests that two kinds of processes can disrupt language comprehension when a sentence requires the reader to hold multiple words in memory. One process occurs when the features of more recent words accidentally overwrite parts of earlier words. This type of ?encoding error? means that the reader erroneously perceives a word that recombines the features of two different words. For example, in a sentence like ?The road to the mountains was blocked,? they may misremember ""road"" as ""roads"" by combining the singular ?road? with the plural feature of ?mountains.? Another type of error can arise when trying to retrieve a particular word from memory. For example, a reader or listener might pick out the wrong word from memory at the critical moment in understanding a sentence, thinking that the mountains were blocked in the sentence above, rather than the road (a ?retrieval? error). Language comprehension can in principle be disrupted by either or both of these processes. The investigators will track eye movements of people while they are reading in English and Hebrew and collect speeded acceptability judgments. Together these measures should reflect the relative contribution of encoding and retrieval errors in both languages. The particular pattern of comprehension errors that arises in reading will then be tested against computational models of human working memory in language processing. The combination of these two research methods will help account for how people understand sentences so easily most of the time, and why misinterpretations can and do arise at other times. Understanding how and when interpretation errors arise can also help us better understand various atypical language and reading patterns, such as shown in dyslexia. This project will advance collaboration between American and Israeli language researchers and will involve advanced STEM training for researchers at different career stages, from undergraduates to post-doctoral scholars.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by PAC, Linguistics, and EHR Core Research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, existing computer-aided design (CAD) tools that allow authoring and editing of 3D models are not accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired due to the lack of widely available low-cost high resolution tactile displays for presenting 3D information to members of this community, and the scarcity of research and guidelines on multi-modal interaction with such displays.  This work will address these issues through the development of fundamental technology supporting the creation of 2.5D refreshable and scalable tactile displays, and rigorous investigation of their use by the intended audience in the context of perception, interaction, and learning, thereby providing access to essential tools for STEM education and employment.  Project outcomes will contribute to the fields of accessible user interfaces and haptic technology.  Additional broad impact will derive from the resulting understanding of how better to design 3D user interfaces in general to enable wide scale use of such systems.<br/><br/>To achieve the stated goals, this project will investigate four key research questions: (1) How can low-cost, high resolution 2.5D tactile displays be developed? (2) What interaction techniques are necessary to understand and interact with 3D information using such displays? (3) How can 3D authoring and making best be supported for members of the target community? (4) How does access to 3D printing in the wild change this community's self-efficacy of making and their opinions of STEM?  To these ends, the project will focus on the following synergistic research aims: using electrostatic adhesive inchworm motor arrays to enable low-cost, high resolution 2.5D tactile displays; supporting direct manipulation and multi-modal interaction for shape understanding and authoring for makers who are blind or visually impaired; and long-term deployment of a mixed-initiative system for supporting 3D understanding and authoring, to validate the tool and its effect on self-efficacy and learning. The research agenda will be tightly integrated with a meaningful education plan, including development of informal STEM learning materials for the target audience and deployment of those materials at community workshops, as well as course development in the area of accessible user interfaces and technology, with specific attention to touch and audio interaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cephalopods like squid and octopus are ecologically important, as both predator and prey, and economically important for the U.S. fisheries industry. This project will investigate patterns of evolution and extinction in fossil relatives of modern squid and octopus, the ammonoids. Between 90 and 100 million years ago, Earth experienced multiple episodes of cooling and warming. By investigating the traits that helped some ammonoid species survive these events, the project will identify key factors that control extinction risk in cephalopods. The project will also include training for undergraduate and graduate students at two universities, contribute to publicly available databases and computer- and internet-based research tools, and develop educational materials for children and the general public on how climate change affects marine animals and ecosystems.<br/><br/>The Cenomanian-Turonian interval of the early Late Cretaceous witnessed three substantial climate shifts, cooling and sea level falls in the middle Cenomanian and middle Turonian and warming, widespread anoxia, and elevated sea level over the latest Cenomanian and earliest Turonian. This project will include the use of both Bayesian phylogenetic analyses and ecomorphospace analyses of the ammonoid cephalopod superfamily Acanthoceratoidea to tease apart the extent to which these environmental perturbations affected acanthoceratoid diversity dynamics as a whole and how those perturbations affected different morphotypes associated with different basic ammonoid ecological habits. The project team will test hypotheses related to phylogenetic and ecomorphological selectivity across each of these three events and assess alternative extinction and origination models across Acanthoceratoidea. The phylogenetic analyses represent the first use of Bayesian phylogenetic methods for ammonoids and also contribute to advancements for simultaneously assessing macroevolutionary models and phylogenetic relationships via Bayesian methods. Thus, the final results will both be informative about how particular climate shifts affected ammonoid extinction rates and provide a model for similar assessments of other taxonomic groups during other critical intervals of Earth system evolution. Ultimately, the proposed research will identify key factors that drive diversity dynamics and extinction risk for mid-level predators, an important but often overlooked marine ecologic guild.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The shortage of licensed STEM teachers, particularly teachers representing the demographic backgrounds of most students in high-need schools, is a serious problem that affects southeastern Minnesota as well as the nation. Saint Mary?s University of Minnesota will address this problem by recruiting more high-achieving students, including those from diverse backgrounds, into its STEM+Education dual degree program and Master of Arts in Teaching program. These 24 prospective teachers will be prepared to teach in high-need schools in a state with a growing STEM teacher shortage and significant racial disparity between teachers and students. It is anticipated that ISTEP Scholars? preparation and mentorship in STEM teaching will improve their future secondary students? STEM achievement and readiness for post-secondary learning and careers in STEM.<br/><br/>This project at Saint Mary?s University of Minnesota is in partnership with Winona Area Public School District, a high-need school district and the Rochester STEM Academy, which serves students from high-need communities. Over the five year project, project goals will include: (1) increasing the number of secondary STEM teachers from diverse backgrounds committed to teaching in high-need local education agencies (LEAs) in southeastern Minnesota; (2) strengthening the pipeline of secondary STEM teachers from diverse backgrounds committed to teaching in high-need LEAs in southeastern Minnesota by institutionalizing the key ISTEP project components of recruiting, preparing, and supporting retention of diverse, high-quality secondary STEM teachers in high-need LEA schools; and (3) contributing to the knowledge base related to recruitment, preparation, and retention of secondary STEM teachers from diverse backgrounds. The project's 24 high-achieving prospective teachers (13 undergraduates and 11 at the master?s degree level) will either (1) obtain dual degrees, with one degree being a baccalaureate degree in biology, chemistry, or mathematics, and the other in secondary education (referred to as STEM+Education); or (2) will already possess a baccalaureate degree in a STEM discipline and will earn a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT). ISTEP Scholar recruitment will include a diverse set of strategies for both undergraduates and STEM professionals.  Scholar mentoring will be implemented within a Cognitive Coaching framework. An external evaluator will assist the ISTEP management team in advancing the frontiers of knowledge in recruitment, preparation, and retention of secondary STEM teachers from diverse backgrounds. Improving the quality of science education at the secondary level by preparing teachers of diverse backgrounds licensed in STEM fields will ultimately contribute to a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.

Reducing global carbon emissions will therefore require developing countries to use more renewable energy instead of fossil energy. There is no prior model for such growth. Many of the institutions being used to promote a green energy transition in developed countries?like broad energy markets driven by private investment, or market-based environmental regulation?either do not exist or are relatively new in developing countries. This CAREER project will study how institutions for green growth are working in developing countries and how they could be made stronger. The study will  identify policy tools that can lower the cost of energy for the poor and promote green economic growth that causes less pollution. The results of this CAREER research will improve efficiency in energy markets, improve policies for carbon abatement globally, contributions to graduate and undergraduate student training, and data collection and dissemination.  The results of this research project will also establish the US as a global leader in ?clean? energy research and policy.<br/><br/>This research project will study the efficacy of several institutions for carbon abatement in developing countries. The program has three parts: (i) institutions to support private investment in renewable energy, (ii) market-based environmental regulation and (iii) international carbon offsets. The first part will study how institutions to help enforce contracts have helped to bring down renewable energy prices in low income countries using data on the entire history of solar power industry. The empirical analysis will measure the effect of contractual risk, which is widespread in developing countries, on the price of green energy adoption. The second part will use data from a large, novel experiment introducing emissions trading for local air pollution to estimate a model of the gains from market-based regulation. The third part will study how the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the largest such transfer program in the world to date, has affected greenhouse gas emissions in low income countries, especially the largest and fastest growing emitters.  The main mechanisms for these transfers, including offset mechanisms, have not been well studied for their efficacy or costs. Looking across these several institutions, the project as a whole will study second-best environmental and energy policy in practice and recommend policy changes that can work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Miniaturization of these devices are important for mobile, wearable, medical (e.g., endoscope), and automobile applications. Nanostructures designed to tailor the flow of light can substantially bring down the size, weight, and cost of such devices, but a paradigm shift is necessary to come up with designs that impart the appropriate modulation for not just one but all of the incident angles of interest. This research program will build the analytical and numerical tools for designing photonic devices with all-angle control of light, as well as exploring new designs that can enable compact cameras with large field of view and high-speed spatial light modulators. The computational tools developed will be made open source. Knowledge created from this research program will be incorporated into a new graduate course on applied physics at USC. These activities are further integrated with teaching and outreach activities including high school and undergraduate students in the research program, creating STEM projects for high school students, and introducing interactive optics demos to K-12 classrooms.<br/><br/>Optical metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for spatially-resolved modulation of the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light while being amendable to large-scale fabrication. However, the widely adopted unit-cell-based locally periodic approximation is inaccurate and suboptimal for large-angle operations, and local phase-shift profiles cannot describe angle-multiplexed responses which are fundamentally nonlocal. While designs based on full-wave simulations can in principle overcome these limitations, they are extremely time consuming given the large sizes of metasurfaces and the numerous input and output states involved. This research program will develop new numerical methods that are orders-of-magnitude more efficient in computing the transmission matrices of large-area metasurfaces, introduce new perfectly matched layers that can significantly reduce the computation domain of metasurface simulations, establish fundamental thickness bounds for nonlocal metasurfaces with a large field of view, and design and realize new classes of nonlocal metasurfaces that are enabled by the preceding tools including compact wide-field-of-view imaging systems that reach the fundamental bounds and high-speed metasurface spatial light modulators. Beyond metasurfaces, these studies will also improve the fundamental understanding of multi-mode optical systems and create numerical tools for the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researchers also plan to contribute to public understanding of science through various outreach mechanisms, and will train multiple graduate students.<br/><br/>This project focuses on a range of questions related to supercell thunderstorms, from initiation to tornado formation.  The tornado-related research is guided by three core questions: 1) How important is baroclinically generated vorticity to the development of tornadoes, 2) Is the underlying surface a critical vorticity source for tornadoes, and 3) Why do supercell storms in similar environments often behave so differently?  To address these questions, the research team will interrogate a number of well-observed tornadic storms from the VORTEX-II and TORUS field campaigns.  Diabatic Lagrangian analysis (DLA) techniques will be conducted on multi-Doppler radar data and combined with swarm-sonde thermodynamic observations to create 4D thermodynamic and velocity fields, which will then be used in material circuit analyses to demonstrate the baroclinic origins of low-level circulation.  Additionally, the material circuit analyses will be used on an existing 25-member ensemble of 75-m resolution numerical model simulations.  New simulations will be conducted with a more generalized non-equilibrium lower boundary condition, using the two-layer model concept from the engineering community to address the frictional component of the project.  New modeling simulations will also be conducted to address uncertainties related to convective initiation in shear and environmental controls on convective modes.  The research team plans to target the following questions for the convective initiation (CI) work:  1) What are the variety of ways that vertical wind shear inhibits or facilitates CI, 2) How does their relative importance depend on the altitude and depth of the shear, and on the characteristics of the airmass boundary involved in CI, and 3) To what extent do the characteristics of an airmass boundary, such as its horizontal temperature gradient, depth, and forward speed relative to the environmental winds above the boundary, influence the organization of convective storms?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project addresses this question and identifies ways to improve the efficacy of agricultural research and technology adoption. Although agricultural research centers are the main suppliers of agricultural technology, they often do not tailor new technologies to the needs of small-scale farmers. This constraint limits their ability to prioritize and target innovations. However, little is known about the impact of these supply-side constraints on technology adoption. This research will conduct a field experiment to estimate the effect of imperfect targeting on farmers? take-up of improved crop varieties. The results of this research will inform agricultural policy about the potential gains in reducing the mismatch between agricultural innovations and farmers? demand for new technology and how best to do so. The results of this research will improve the pace of  development and adoption of new agricultural technologies, increased agricultural yield and farmers? incomes, and in the process, increase economic growth.  <br/><br/>Research has identified factors that limit agricultural technology adoption by focusing primarily on farmers? failure to adopt. This research project expands the literature by testing an alternative explanation: the supply of agricultural technology has a limited ability to internalize farmers? heterogeneity in the absence of well-functioning input markets. This research will conduct a field  experiment that simulates counterfactuals to plant breeders? release decisions to study the impact of those decisions on farmers? purchases of new seeds. In the first stage of the experiment, on-farm trials will be used to estimate the performance of five new crop varieties and capture farmers? revealed preferences for these seeds. Results from the trials will inform the assignment into treatment in the second stage when a random group of farmers receives an offer to adopt the new variety recommended by breeders. For comparison, another group receives an offer for a new variety of their preference. Thus, in the experiment, each farmer effectively faces his or her own synthetic seed market. The researchers will measure differences in take-up rates between these groups and the impact of differential adoption on farming outcomes. Finally, the research will study farmers? responses to different levels and sources of information to understand how to improve breeders? recommendations.  The results of this research will improve the pace of  development and adoption of new agricultural technologies, increase agricultural yield and farmers? incomes, and in the process, increase economic growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since a chemical reaction can take place at a very fast rate and on a very small scale, sometimes too fast and small for equipment to directly measure, computer simulations, which follow the motions of atoms by solving equations of motion, play an essential role in seeking a thorough understanding of the nature of a chemical reaction. However, such simulations are computationally very demanding (e.g., require a large number of computers to run for a long period of time), thus severely limiting the scope of their applications. Rui Sun and his research group are developing a novel machine learning algorithm that utilizes the information gathered along the study of the chemical reaction to speed up simulations potentially by an order of magnitude or more. This algorithm, along with a specifically designed data storage and fetch system, will be open-source and implemented with state-of-the-art computational chemistry software. Simulations boosted by this machine learning algorithm have the potential to achieve unprecedented efficiency and accuracy, and thus to push the boundary of our knowledge on chemical reactions, perhaps the central element of the field of chemistry. By introducing computation as a different means for problem solving, Rui Sun will also develop educational programs to enhance the learning experience of students at the University of Hawaii, which hosts the largest population of Pacific islander students in America.<br/><br/>Rui Sun is developing an active machine learning protocol with the aim of increasing the efficiency of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of chemical reactions by at least one order of magnitude. This is to be achieved by replacing 90+% of the ab initio energy gradient calculations with a specifically designed machine learning algorithm, interpolating moving ridge regression (IMRR). IMRR is trained on data fetched from an indexed library containing all the ab initio energy gradients calculated in the previous simulations and updated on the fly as each trajectory progresses. Rui Sun and his research group will also develop an optimal molecular descriptor to efficiently identify ab initio training data that yields the smallest error in IMRR-predicted energy gradients. Each IMRR will provide a risk factor, indicating its probability of reproducing the ab initio energy gradient and maintaining a well-behaved trajectory. A high-risk factor will be used as a rejection criterion to refer back to ab initio calculation in order to protect the integrity of the simulation. Due to the expected dramatic boost in efficiency, the proposed active machine learning protocol has the potential to push the capability of AIMD to an unprecedented level and  to set a new standard for dynamics simulation of chemical reactions. Rui Sun will also develop computation modules to support current chemistry labs as well as the very first computational course for non-CS (Computer Science) STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) majors at the University of Hawaii at M?noa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation research project examines how experiences of adversity relate to resilience and well-being in urban environments, and what resources are leveraged in responding to adversity. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology and biocultural data collection and analysis, this project measures the role that resilience and sentiments of belonging play in influencing experiences of adversity in multicultural and urban environments. The project enhances public understanding of science and the scientific method by engaging its research communities in the scientific research process and broadly disseminating its findings beyond academic venues. It also broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>Using multidisciplinary methods, this project investigates resilience and well-being by examining the behavioral context of migrant decision-making, focusing specifically on how issues related to health, livelihood, and time management are prioritized. This project asks two main questions: 1) how do migrants make sense of and negotiate experiences of adversity? and 2) how do spaces of community both succeed and fail to manage the effects of adversity? Methods include participant observation, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and mapping workshops to explore the relationship between resilience and adversity. Data will be coded around themes of belonging, histories of migration, experiences of city-life, migration trade-offs, ideas of community, and notions of well-being. By scientifically investigating how migrants negotiate adversity and resilience in their daily lives, this project will contribute to research on community, resilience, and well-being in urban areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a wealth of information about objects, time, space, and events available to the organism. However, the storage capacity of the brain, and the volume of information that can be processed ? at once ? is limited. For this reason, there is a need for the brain to assign priority levels to environmental stimuli and select what is most applicable at a given time point. This mechanism and connections between the brain regions of the brain that controls it are still poorly understood. This research will investigate how two key brain regions concerned with novelty detection work together to continuously classify and prioritize the information to be stored in a continuously changing environment. This research will have a broad impact on society by increasing our knowledge and understanding of cognition in normal states. This research will further have broader impacts by elucidating the role of specific cell types in learning, and how their dysregulation can lead to neurological disorders. Lastly, this research is designed to increase participation in STEM by facilitating the training of students in cutting-edge techniques that can be applied broadly in biomedical science research and industries.<br/><br/>Reciprocal connection between the VTA and hippocampus (CA1) forms a loop that governs novelty detection. While the VTA contains dopamine, glutamate, and GABA neurons, the function of the loop has been primarily attributed to the VTA dopamine projections. The goal of this research is to dissect the functional significance of VTA glutamate projections to the hippocampus, and their role in novelty learning and context discrimination. To achieve this goal, neural recording will be combined with optogenetic modulation of VTA terminals in the CA1 of freely behaving mice. This method will create the premise to address two main objectives; (1) Determine the function of the VTA-CA1 tract in CA1 integration of working memory and context. (2) Ascertain the role of VTA presynaptic inputs in CA1 pyramidal cell-interneuron synchrony. This research will fill gaps in the knowledge and understanding of neural circuits that govern novelty learning and context discrimination behavior. Cutting-edge genetic and electronic tools will be deployed to target and modulate VTA terminals in the CA1 of mice during behavioral tasks. Performing these experiments will significantly increase the understanding of cell-specific projections within the VTA-hippocampus loop. It will also elucidate the function of cell-specific neural circuits that have been overlooked by a traditional focus on VTA dopamine projections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will advance a broadly applicable and computationally efficient approach through parallel computation leveraging cost-effective cloud-computing services, to address challenges such as very large input feature space dimensions and number of classes, as well as very large DNNs. Another challenge is to make the detector insensitive to the mechanism (e.g., additive, multiplicative) by which the backdoor pattern (BP) is incorporated into a sample across different application domains. In addition to ""static"" DNNs and image domains, the prototype will be able to: process recurrent DNNs; handle time series, point cloud, and document data domains; and defend AIs used for time-series prediction and regression.

The proposed work will focus on identifying genes and neurons responsible for neophilia.   This work will use novel arena exploration assays with varied and integrated genetic approaches.   In Drosophila melanogaster, mutant and transgenic lines will be used to determine the requirements of dopamine signaling within the brain to initiate neophilic exploration.   A new genetic mapping population generated from the sister species of Drosophila will also be used to map genetic variants involved in the differences in exploratory behaviors found between these two closely related species.

The goal of this proposal is to understand how neophilia is encoded in the Drosophila nervous system, including an identification of the molecules and neural circuits responsible for recognizing novel stimuli and inducing arousal in the animal.  Our central hypothesis is that during the evolution of food specialization in Drosophila species, genetic variants that reduced neophilia were selected for, resulting in a loss of specific exploration; dopamine signaling is also likely involved. Novel open field exploration of Drosophila species combined with varied genetic approaches will be used to identify the genetic variants responsible for differences in novelty-seeking behavior.  Novel open field arenas have long been used to measure trait and state-dependent changes in exploration in various laboratory species. Interestingly, Drosophila simulans, an ecological generalist, actively explores novel arenas, while its sister species and ecological specialist, Drosophila sechellia, does not.  A population of recombinant inbred lineages generated from these Drosophila sister species will be used to identify the quantitative trait loci responsible for the evolved differences in neophilia found between these species.  Moreover, a reverse genetic/transgenic approach will be used to dissect the role of specific dopaminergic circuits in novelty arousal using Drosophila melanogaster.  In this approach, the function of dopamine neural circuits and participating receptors required for the initiation of exploration will be identified.

For example, high-resolution live videos are used for daily (remote) learning, and videos streamed from road-side sensors are constantly analyzed to make our cities and roads safer. These changes lead to a higher need for network bandwidth to reach desired Quality of Experience (QoE). This is challenging, because to serve all these demands, today?s video delivery systems must either lower video quality or upgrade the network infrastructure (which can be slow and expensive). This project develops Perception-Driven Optimization (PDO), a new paradigm that improves user experience for today?s online videos without using more bandwidth. <br/><br/>The key insight is that in terms of how video quality impacts QoE, significant heterogeneities exist across videos, human users, and video analytic models, which are hard to capture by today?s offline QoE models. PDO takes a data-driven approach to automate online QoE modeling, by leveraging the large number of video sessions available to today?s video delivery systems. This research entails three thrusts: (a) for live video services, how to automate QoE modeling in live content with a minimal number of online sessions; (b) for on-demand videos, how to build per-user QoE models without impacting user experience; and (c) for video-analytics services, how to profile video quality?s impact on video-analytics mode. PDO also integrates online QoE modeling with today?s video-delivery systems to better adapt to changes in network conditions.<br/><br/>This project works with industry partners in online video services and edge video analytics, and local initiatives to deploy PDO and improve online video QoE, especially for users who suffer quality issues, and scale edge analytics to more sensor videos. It also creates new ways to tie system/networking education with everyday use of the Internet, such as new educational tools that visualize how network performance affects user-perceived video quality and video-based intelligent applications. The project also engages with students through Leadership Alliance which targets underrepresented populations, and the developed educational tools will be used for compileHer, a program that targets high school female students.<br/><br/>The software and research artifacts implemented as part of this project are released on a public website: https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/perception_driven_optimization. The site is regularly maintained and includes released data, source code, and reproduction instructions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thompson of University of Louisville is developing computational approaches to simulate excited state processes of relevance to metallo-photocatalysis. Metallo-photocatalysis combines transition metal catalysis and photoredox catalysis to enable new molecular synthesis approaches. However, several competing mechanisms for catalyst activation can potentially lead to different reaction products, and so computational modelling is beneficial to establish the rates of excited state processes and design catalytic systems that enhance the desired reactivity. For this, modeling challenges exist, including: (i) the size of the systems involved, (ii) the nature of the electronic structure of these systems as these are often not amenable to current approximations embodied in reduced-CPU (central processing unit) time methods, and (iii) theoretical formalisms requiring computation of terms that are difficult to extract from simulation. To resolve these difficulties, Dr. Thompson is developing computational methods that couple together low-cost approximations that each capture different features of the electronic structure. The aim is to develop a general computational platform of more accurate approaches that takes advantage of partitioning of the electronic interactions to reduce computational efforts. This project  also includes the development of an integrated education plan focusing on programming literacy and sustainable software development that aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of physical chemistry and computational science.  The principal investigator is also working to build a forum to engage stakeholders in the chemistry enterprise in Louisville, KY through the Derby lecture series. <br/><br/>This project on Resonant Hartree-Fock inspired descriptions of excited state processes consists of two main scientific goals. First, the Thompson research team  is developing algorithms that explore self-consistent field (SCF) solution space to understand how the SCF function landscape encodes different correlation mechanisms. The methods permit enumeration of SCF solutions from which a short determinant expansion can be chosen that spans relevant correlation mechanisms present in molecular systems. Additionally, the SCF solutions can be used as references for post-SCF methods. Second, models that optimize a different-orbitals-for-different-configurations wavefunction to account for interactions between the different correlation mechanisms are being designed and implemented. The resulting wavefunction is being used as a platform to recover remaining correlation energy at reduced computational cost. The new methods will be applied to the study of photo-induced electron transfer and excitation energy transfer rates in metallo-photocatalytic systems.  These tools, if successful, could have a significant impact on the design of new photoredox catalyst systems and processes, an area of great current interest in reaction development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project advances a new algae reactor to reduce biological nutrient pollution. This will improve health, potential loss of commercial fishing resources, water tourism, and property value decline.  The diversity of products that can be generated from algae cultivation improve the robustness of the global food chain and the security of domestic feedstocks, e.g. high nutrition feeds for livestock and aquaculture and a new source of chemicals and biofuels.  The proposed design for maximum resource efficiency in water and energy enables value extraction from marginal lands.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to reduce levels of biological nutrient pollutants in the effluent of wastewater treatment facilities?by the development of an industrial scale, algae photobioreactor, designed to operate in a high-volume, continuous flow process.  Anticipated advantages of the new technology are a reduction in capital and operating expense compared to existing nutrient removal methods and the capacity to generate, high-purity, algae coproducts with commercial value.  Research objectives include the following: (1) create a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reactor under various flow conditions; (2) perform dye tracer experiments in the reactor as validation of the modeling results; (3) install the reactor as part of an integrated nutrient removal system including ultrafiltration, product recycle stream, nutrient sensors and process feedback control; (4) evaluate the nutrient removal capabilities of the system using a live algae culture and effluent from an adjacent wastewater treatment facility; and (5) perform a technoeconomic analysis of the proposed process.  Results of the project will provide a better understanding of the effect of reactor design and operating parameters on the hydraulic and solids residence time distributions, how these influence the waste removal performance of the system, and what design parameters exert the most control over economic feasibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genes can differ in these expression levels between different tissues within the same organism or between species in the same tissue. Understanding how these levels change?and how they control the appearance and function of organisms?is a key challenge for current research. This project will develop new methods for understanding gene expression changes between tissues and species, as well as how these changes are coordinated. The research applies new statistical approaches to produce open-source software for carrying out the analyses. The software will allow all scientists to be able to use these new tools on multiple platforms, contributing to the national cyberinfrastructure. This work also will improve and accelerate research with multiple societal benefits, including enabling new biological discoveries. This project will support the training of a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students, and undergraduates from groups that are underrepresented in science and technology careers. A classroom lesson plan and computer lab on understanding evolutionary trees will be developed and distributed to partner institutions.<br/><br/>Changes in gene expression have been shown to be responsible for many differences between species, and recent technological advances mean that such data are easy to collect, even in non-model organisms. By measuring expression levels of the same gene in multiple species, we can begin to understand the history of changes in gene expression across organisms. By measuring expression in thousands of genes, we can further understand the mechanisms and modes by which gene expression evolves. This research develops a new software package (CAGEE) for studying gene expression evolution across a phylogenetic tree. The statistical approach developed here also makes it possible to study multiple tissues or sexes in a single framework, allowing us to make statistically rigorous inferences about differences in the rates of evolution among samples. Integrating these tools into a single software package available on multiple platforms enables these methods to be applied by a wide group of users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The event will take place April 11-15 2022.  The minimal representations topics discussed at the conference have played a central and unifying role in mathematics for over fifty years, where they find applications to quantum mechanics and communication theory, and within mathematics to number theory.  Theta correspondences use minimal representations to connect disparate mathematical objects.  Work on theta correspondences has accelerated recently, with the full proof of Howe's Duality Conjecture published just a few years ago. The award will allow U.S. scholars to continue working on minimal representations and theta correspondences on the global stage, with an international community of researchers, as well as introduce a new generation of mathematicians to the material.<br/><br/>Minimal representations have applications to automorphic forms, harmonic analysis, for example, the Fourier transforms on basic affine spaces, and mathematical physics, for example, scattering amplitudes in string theory.  They originate in the Weil representation of the metaplectic group, where they are connected to Schrödinger's formulation of quantum mechanics via wave functions.  Within mathematics, the most profound applications of minimal representations are through theta correspondences -- a generalization of Howe's duality correspondence.  Newer ""exceptional"" theta correspondences have been vital in the Langlands program and arithmetic.  This conference is a timely event, bringing participants up-to-date on recent breakthroughs on minimal representations and theta correspondences.  The ESI workshop will bring together the top scholars from around the world to showcase the latest progress in this field of mathematics and the grant will allow U.S. scholars to travel to Austria and attend this important event.

Core facilities are often seen as places where scientists share knowledge with each other around common tools, advancing fields and sparking interdisciplinary collaborations. We know, however, that scientists often hesitate to share knowledge about ongoing work? particularly with close peers or competitors? because they seek credit for their own work and want to be the first to publish findings. While prior research has considered how scientists navigate tensions between openness and secrecy in their work, this research has largely overlooked the role that scientific support staff? those who maintain and develop scientific instrumentation and technique? play in diffusing valuable technical knowledge among scientists. This study examines the role of scientific support staff in two core facilities through a fifteen-month ethnographic study. By documenting how scientific support staff in core facilities create and disseminate knowledge among potentially competing researchers, we hope to inform decision makers who seek to increase the productivity of shared research infrastructures. By explicating the various tasks, skills, competencies, and specialties that characterize scientific support staff?s work, our study should also suggest how universities and core facilities might implement better reward structures and careers for scientific staff, thereby strengthening the nation?s STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This study examines the role of scientific support staff in core facilities through an ethnographic study of two university nanofabrication facilities, facilities that provide cleanrooms and semiconductor fabrication equipment to a regional community of researchers. Our goals are: (1) to explore in depth the kind of knowledge that scientific support staff in core facilities possess, (2) to document the ways in which (and the points at which) the contributions of staff facilitate the progress of users? research projects, (3) to explore whether, and if so how and how frequently, support staff disseminate knowledge in ways that counter the deleterious effects of secrecy among users, and (4) to document whether and how knowledge developed by support staff in one core facility is disseminated to other core facilities. Our overall aim is to develop a deeper understanding of how science benefits from shared resources in core facilities by better understanding the role of scientific support staff in creating and disseminating knowledge within and across core facilities. The research will contribute to several fields including science studies, organization studies, public policy and the sociology of work and occupations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dominican University is a liberal arts and sciences university which is also a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 16 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in Biology, Biology-Chemistry, and Chemistry. First-year students will receive four-year scholarships. The project will include academic support with collaborative faculty-student teaching, known as Peer-led team learning support, a cohort experience through common courses, a four-year learning community-style course, faculty mentoring, and supported research experiences. A unique feature of this project will be a combination of academic and sociocultural supports, such as activities designed to improve science identity and feelings of connection and inclusion in the field of science. Dominican University has a large population of students who are female, Hispanic/Latinx, and are from low-income families, and supporting these students will diversify the science workforce. The findings of this project will be of interest to universities with similarly diverse student populations.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. In addition to supporting a cohort of students in successfully earning STEM degrees, a second project goal is to support entry of graduating students into the STEM workforce or graduate/professional programs. Other project goals include increasing knowledge of how interventions can increase student persistence through academic support, improved science identity, and improved science efficacy as well as increased institutional capacity in supporting students with financial need. While there is growing evidence that certain forms of academic support can improve persistence and student success, less is known about how academic support combined with psychosocial interventions can improve science identity, science efficacy, which in turn can improve degree completion and entry into scientific careers. The research design and implementation of this project is grounded in constructivist and sociocultural    theories of learning. The expected outcomes, based on theory and previous empirical results, are that course-based interventions, trained faculty mentoring, and academic support through Peer-led Team Learning will improve student persistence by improving those students? science identity. The project will be evaluated through several forms of evidence, including analysis of student transcripts, student career choices, faculty data, and student interview data. The project results will be disseminated by presentation at regional and national academic conferences such as the Chicago Math and Science Symposium series and the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research Annual Conference. Additionally, project results will be published in science discipline-based education research journals, such as the journal CBE ? Life Sciences Education and The Journal of Microbiology and Biology Education. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, despite this progress, there are still fundamental questions about tornado formation and the initiation of storms in environments that are conducive for tornadoes.  This project will use new observations and new analysis techniques to uncover answers about the origin of tornado rotation and whether surface friction is an important factor, and how wind changes with altitude affect the initial development of thunderstorms.  The results of the research may provide forecasters with more clues to why some storms form tornadoes while others do not within the same environment.  The researchers also plan to contribute to public understanding of science through various outreach mechanisms, and will train multiple graduate students.<br/><br/>This project focuses on a range of questions related to supercell thunderstorms, from initiation to tornado formation.  The tornado-related research is guided by three core questions: 1) How important is baroclinically generated vorticity to the development of tornadoes, 2) Is the underlying surface a critical vorticity source for tornadoes, and 3) Why do supercell storms in similar environments often behave so differently?  To address these questions, the research team will interrogate a number of well-observed tornadic storms from the VORTEX-II and TORUS field campaigns.  Diabatic Lagrangian analysis (DLA) techniques will be conducted on multi-Doppler radar data and combined with swarm-sonde thermodynamic observations to create 4D thermodynamic and velocity fields, which will then be used in material circuit analyses to demonstrate the baroclinic origins of low-level circulation.  Additionally, the material circuit analyses will be used on an existing 25-member ensemble of 75-m resolution numerical model simulations.  New simulations will be conducted with a more generalized non-equilibrium lower boundary condition, using the two-layer model concept from the engineering community to address the frictional component of the project.  New modeling simulations will also be conducted to address uncertainties related to convective initiation in shear and environmental controls on convective modes.  The research team plans to target the following questions for the convective initiation (CI) work:  1) What are the variety of ways that vertical wind shear inhibits or facilitates CI, 2) How does their relative importance depend on the altitude and depth of the shear, and on the characteristics of the airmass boundary involved in CI, and 3) To what extent do the characteristics of an airmass boundary, such as its horizontal temperature gradient, depth, and forward speed relative to the environmental winds above the boundary, influence the organization of convective storms?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Partnerships between organizations may provide a variety of benefits. Through partnerships, organizations can share expertise and resources. Organizations can also take advantage of other gains made possible by working together. To encourage formation of partnerships among organizations, governments may implement policies that seek to increase awareness of the potential benefits of partnerships; that facilitate partnership formation; that remove barriers to partnership formation; and/or that incentivize partnerships. The extent to which such policies lead to partnership formation will depend on whether the policies address the primary factors inhibiting partnership formation. As organizations differ in the barriers they face and the benefits they might derive from partnerships, the effects of state policies may vary across organizations. To improve understandings of how policies influence partnership formation, this research evaluates a range of policy approaches for encouraging partnership formation as well as how multiple concurrent policies interact with one another. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research examines the response of small community water systems in the USA to policies seeking to steer development of water system partnerships. Most states in the USA have adopted one or more policies to encourage partnership formation by water systems. Those policies vary in whether their approach is enabling, authority-based, information-based, or incentive-based. The research analyzes the effects of these state policies, as well as how those effects and the critical barriers to partnership formation vary with the institutional structures of small community water systems (e.g., municipal, special district, community-owned, private) and with the forms of partnership that may be developed (e.g., informal, contracting, joint powers, consolidation). A mixed-methods approach is utilized: data collection entails both a survey of small community water systems across the USA and interviews with water system representatives and state-primacy agencies. Results from the research will provide insights regarding the points of intervention that serve to catalyze differing forms of partnerships and the impacts of linking multiple concurrent policies. Results will also illuminate how the effects of policies vary across a diversity of organizational structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project explores potential barriers to women speaking up in work teams including social and psychological consequences, as well the key role social anxiety may play in exacerbating these negative experiences. This project directly and positively impacts participants, their organizations, and the overall workforce by creating clear suggestions on how to facilitate women?s participation in work teams, and ultimately increase their career success.<br/> <br/>This project fosters an understanding of why women are less likely to speak up and emerge as leaders in work teams by testing potential mechanisms across two studies. Study 1 is a two-week field study of approximately 150 employed adults using experience sampling methodology, capturing daily anticipated and actual experiences with speaking in work teams as well as their psychosocial consequences. Study 2 takes a more granular focus, using an observational laboratory study in which approximately 125 teams come together for one-time meetings. During these meetings, audio and video recordings of interactions and individual heartrate variability, galvanic skin response, and respiration rate are recorded. By studying the momentary physiological changes leading up to, and following speaking in a team, this study teases apart stress processes, cognitive processing, and their resolutions. Overall, this research project evaluates the how the experience of speaking up in work teams differentially unfolds over moments and days for men versus women, and the role social anxiety plays in this process.

The Sun?s magnetic field consists of closed and open field lines that interact, snap, and reconnect, affecting the motion of plasma leaving the Sun in coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and through the solar wind. The solar wind can be accelerated to high speed through coronal holes (CHs), or regions with open field lines. Active regions (ARs) are regions of strong closed magnetic field lines that launch eruptive events such as CMEs and solar flares. Understanding these phenomena are crucial to predicting and preparing for harmful space weather effects on Earth. This project will perform a statistical study over four full solar cycles. Two early-career female scientists will be supported and three undergraduate students will be mentored through this research. <br/><br/>The project is a detailed study of the role of coronal hole ? active region interactions in the generation of intense geomagnetic storms (IGS). Two science questions will be addressed: (1) Can the evolution of CH location and size be used as a proxy to understand IGS occurrence and timing? (2) How does the interaction between HSSs and CMEs affect the strength of geomagnetic storms? In the past, limited studies have hinted at the possibility that the number of geomagnetic storms in even cycles increases with increasing number of close CH-AR pairs and decreases with increasing number of close CH-AR pairs in odd cycles. It is still not well understood how location, size and CH-AR interactions could influence the potential for an eruption to be geo-effective. Therefore, this project will make a statistical observational study covering four complete solar cycles (21-24). They will provide an overview of the solar wind conditions related to all IGS events (265) and a detailed list of their characteristics (mean values of speed, magnetic field, density, temperature, flow and magnetic pressures, components of the magnetic field, minimum Dst index values) including their association with active regions, coronal holes, high speed streams, and CMEs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project offers a comprehensive understanding of how different visual elements may influence users? perceived credibility of images and videos. The results help platforms and fact-checking agencies to detect visual misinformation, curb its diffusion, identify vulnerable user groups, and develop corrective interventions.<br/><br/>Drawing broadly from literature in computer science, advertising, marketing, cognitive science, and communication, and using computer vision analysis, qualitative interviews, large-scale human annotation, and experiments, this research project aims to: 1) identify the specific visual features and mechanisms which may influence people?s credibility perceptions, 2) examine how these visual features interact with non-visual features (source, virality, etc) and user characteristics (partisanship, digital media literacy, etc), and 3) examine how these visual features can be effectively leveraged in misinformation correction efforts. The research team is compiling a large-scale open dataset of visual posts with human annotations. While existing misinformation datasets have largely focused on the veracity of messages, this dataset provides credibility perceptions along with other relevant outcomes such as attention, emotional reactions and aesthetic appeal. In addition, the research team is creating a website with accessible information to educate the general public about misinformation presented in images and videos, so that the public can be aware of their vulnerabilities and be more vigilant towards certain types of visual information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An environmental chamber will be used to quantify the formation of secondary organic aerosol from selenium (Se)-containing organic compounds and determine the major gas and aerosol products generated using a suite of online and offline instrumentation. The results obtained from this project will improve the understanding of how long-term exposure to organic Se compounds, especially in areas with Se-rich soils and sediments such as agricultural valleys in the western US, might negatively influence public health.<br/><br/>Systematic studies of gas and aqueous phase oxidation of several methylated Se compounds will be conducted under variable nitrogen oxide levels using various oxidants (OH, NO3 and O3) and oxidation time scales. The objectives of this research are to develop an improved understanding of secondary aerosol formation from gas and aqueous phase oxidation of selected methylated Se species and improve knowledge about the chemical and microphysical properties of the resulting aerosols that control the impacts on human health and environmental chemistry. The hypotheses include the following: (1) Photooxidation and nitrate radical oxidation of the selected organoselenium compounds lead to significant secondary aerosol formation and the formation yields are NOx-dependent; The yield of the nitrate oxidation pathway is expected to be like that of photooxidation in the presence of high NOx; (2) Long oxidation times lead to significant fragmentation of the products and, therefore, a reduction in secondary aerosol mass; and (3) Aqueous phase oxidation of methylated Se intermediate oxidation products under low NOx conditions leads to formation of Se-containing secondary aerosol species and a higher concentration of hydroperoxides, which results in the increased production of reactive oxygen species.<br/><br/>This effort involves the training and mentoring of several graduate and undergraduate students and includes outreach and educational activities at local high schools and middle schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organic pollutants are continuously released to the environment by industrial and agricultural activities and use of pharmaceuticals. These pollutants can alter environmental processes and have far-reaching effects on humans and wildlife. Upon their release, organic pollutants partition with natural and anthropogenic substrates in the environment, establishing complex multiphasic equilibria that affect their chemical behavior. This research focuses on characterizing the molecular interactions that drive these partition equilibria. This research has the potential to improve understanding of the transport, distribution, and fate of organic pollutants in the environment and biota. The Gionfriddo team uses micro-extraction methodologies to probe the distribution of organic pollutants in heterogeneous systems. Of particular interest are emerging classes of organic pollutants, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and perfluoroalkyl substances  and their degradation products, and how they partition and interact under naturally occurring environmental conditions. These research objectives are integrated with efforts to promote public engagement in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Summer research activities will introduce members of underrepresented minority groups to scientific research and career opportunities through mentoring and hands-on experimentation.<br/><br/>Emanuela Gionfriddo and coworkers will study the molecular behavior of organic pollutants partitioning onto natural polymers using task-specific micro-extraction devices. This will  improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of organic pollutants and microplastics interactions under naturally occurring environmental conditions.

The use of tunable micro-extraction methodologies is expected to enable precise assessment of the dynamics of partitioning processes in multicomponent systems without disturbing the equilibria under investigation.

This award develops knowledge that increases women?s representation in STEM fields, focusing on information technology (IT). The research is organized around two projects. Project 1 examines the characteristics of IT jobs, as described in job advertisements, that increase women?s likelihood of applying. Project 2 examines whether legislation requiring medium-term, employer-paid maternity leave changes women?s likelihood of applying to jobs and companies? likelihood of interviewing them. The findings inform companies regarding the job descriptions that attract female applicants and policymakers regarding the design of parental-leave policies. <br/><br/>This award includes two projects aimed at promoting women?s representation in STEM fields. It uses large scale data from an e-recruiting platform?including ~6 million applications to ~20,000 IT job advertisements posted by ~13,000 companies?that allows tracking of women?s progress through the hiring funnel. Project 1 identifies characteristics of job advertisements that increase the likelihood of women applying, using natural language processing and machine learning. Findings from this project expand the literature on women?s workforce participation, specifically regarding the job descriptions that appeal to women. Since prior work uses a deductive approach, it has necessarily considered only a small set of potentially relevant characteristics. This award instead uses an inductive approach to build theory, leveraging ?big? data to uncover relationships that are hard to hypothesize a priori.

Direct control of provincial zones is a common imperial strategy that archaeologists have documented globally, and often involves either resettling local populations to new localities or installing an elite from the capital to oversee the new territory. Some documented cases offer an alternative structure, in which provincial regions retained more autonomy provided they adopted the state ideology and exported substantial local resources to the core. Archaeological research in provincial regions can document long-term change through time and address the nature of imperial control by focusing on impacts of state policies on the everyday lives of people. Where documentary evidence is available, the archaeological record can also provide a counterpoint to the state propaganda that these documentary records offer. In this project researchers will work with international colleagues to investigate habitation at a provincial center and its dynamic relationship with the Angkor empire. Their field-based investigations weave capacity-building and student training into the research project, and community engagement will involve multiple activities that include the co-production of a comic book describing the project. <br/><br/>The team will focus their field-based investigations within site occupation areas to understand the amount of state control versus local autonomy at a household level. In doing so, their work will facilitate a deeper understanding of the nature and structure of state power. Research will take place in an empire's outlying region. This region was of perennial interest to the state, having some of the region's most arable land. Yet how this provincial area articulated with the capital remains unclear. The team will conduct field investigations at the site to determine its scope and occupational history, attending to changes in material culture, diet, and the local environmental through time.

Various transformative materials feature electron-phonon coupling strengths exceeding those seen for commonly-used semiconductors, enabling radically new functionalities, but also prompting the need for new predictive theoretical methodologies that combine accuracy with scalability. Tempelaar and his team aim to address this need by developing methods where electrons are described quantum-mechanically while nuclei are described classically. By adopting a momentum representation of the involved coordinates, materials of exceedingly large sizes can be simulated. This opens ways to quantitatively understand and control material behaviors, with implications for the efficient harvesting of solar energy and the use of quantum states for energy-efficient and secure information technologies. This research is integrated with an educational component addressing code illiteracy among economically-disadvantaged nearby highschoolers. This component aims to foster coding exposure beyond a classroom environment by constructing an engaging sequence of coding exercises based on abundant smartphone technology.<br/><br/>In various emerging classes of crystalline semiconductors, including metal-halide perovskites and transition-metal dichalcogenides, electron-phonon couplings are stronger than typically found for inorganic materials. While such couplings strengths give rise to unique photophysical properties, they pose the need for non-perturbative modeling in order to unravel their mechanistic principles. Tempelaar and his team seek to address this need by reformulating quantum-classical dynamical methods in terms of Bloch states commonly used to describe crystal excitations. Within the Bloch representation, basis truncations can be performed that will significantly reduce the cost of simulations. This should enable the team to address the evolution of photo-excitations, the photophysics emerging from chiral phonon modes, and the dynamics of coupled spin-momentum states in hexagonal lattices under realistic conditions.

The chemical and physical processes that occur at the electrode surface of a battery contacting the electrolyte has a significant impact on the overall observed performance of the system. Understanding the mechanisms of the chemistry and physics at the electrode?s interface with the battery electrolyte has been an ongoing challenge due to the complexity of the materials chemistry, morphology, and coupling of electrochemical processes. Predictive modeling of these electrochemical interfaces is a grand challenge, with potentially revolutionary scientific and technological applications. This project will develop a first principles, physics based, computational platform for elucidating the complex physics, structure, and dynamics of electrolytic solutions next to ?realistic? electrodes, i.e., those with non-uniform surface geometries, chemistries, and morphologies. The successful completion of the project will lead to an improved understanding of the complex processes at the electrode, leading to new strategies for optimizing high energy density batteries, fuel cells, and other electrochemical systems. The project includes research opportunities for high school, community college, undergraduate, and graduate students. An example educational effort is development of a Immersive Material Discovery Platform to enable enriched hands-on, active learning for the teaching of computational electrochemistry that will use virtual reality, sound, and haptic feedback.<br/><br/>Determining the properties of the nanoscale region at the electrode/electrolyte interface is of importance because near a polarizable metal interface, and in contrast to the bulk, symmetry breaking results in unique quantum mechanical effects that in turn gives rise to modified electrolyte structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics, which ultimately determines device function. This project?s computational framework addresses an approach that is capable of describing solvent dynamics, and charge transfer and reorganization physics at the electrode and in the electric double layer, while fully capturing the response due to a change in electrode potential. The project?s computational framework addresses the fundamental question of how changes in the electrode electron density affects the solvation dynamics and charge fluctuations of nearby ionic species. The project includes extensive computer simulations with several novel algorithmic and theoretical advances. The first objective of the project will describe the critical electrostatics using an interface sensitive, fluctuating charge model that will allow the modelling of Lithium in its metallic, semi-metallic and ionic states within the same simulation cell. The second objective will develop an approach for simulating applied voltage bias, based on self-consistently adjusting the electrochemical potential of the dynamically varying electrode atoms. Both advances will enable simulations of the charge/discharge process in a full-cell battery setup. The third research objective will relate changes in the interfacial atomic structure to the QM electronic structure by simulated X-ray spectroscopy. These spectra will be directly comparable to recent interface sensitive X-ray measurements, providing a feedback loop for both validating and improving the theory. The successful completion of the project is expected to address a critical knowledge gap concerning role of charge renormalization and transfer at model electrodes, due to electrolyte dynamics. Research outcomes will enable predictive design and nanoscale engineering optimization strategies for new high energy density battery systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory based on this wave-mean flow framework has been successful in explaining many aspects of the general circulation including the evolution of frontal weather systems and the effect of mountains on the upper-tropospheric flow.  The Prpincipal Investigator (PI) has contributed to this theory by developing a measure of waviness which captures a trade-off in which wave activity increases at the expense of mean jet speed and vice versa, a consequence of the fluid analog of angular momentum conservation known as Kelvin's circulation theorem. The measure is called Finite Amplitude Wave Activity (FAWA), where finite amplitude refers to the fact that the measure can be used even when the waves distort the flow enough to create large circulation features which break off from the prevailing flow.  FAWA represents the bulk wave activity around a latitude circle, and the PI has developed a related quantity called Local Wave Activity (LWA) to express waviness at each longitude along a latitude circle.  Previous work by the PI's team has used the FAWA/LWA framework to explain the breakdown of the polar vortex during Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) and the formation of blocking anticyclones (see AGS-1909522).<br/><br/>The application of FAWA and LWA to problems like SSWs and blocking relies on their ability to capture interactions between waves and the eastward mean flow, which can be understood without knowing how the waves are generated or what eventually happens to them. But the generation and dissipation of wave activity are also represented in the evolution equations for FAWA and LWA, and the equations can be used to study wave sources and sinks and their role in atmospheric circulation.  For example the dissipation of wave activity through diffusive mixing matters for the strength of the low-latitude meridional overturning cells (the Hadley cells), thus analysis of the sink term could offer insights into the expansion of the cells and the associated aridification seen in climate change simulations.  <br/><br/>Analysis of sources and sinks is promising but also challenging due to the need for intricate calculations involving small spatial scales and quantities which are hard to observe.  Work under this award takes up the challenge, using a variety of techniques applied to idealized models, archived climate model output, and observational datasets (the ERA5 reanalysis in particular).  Topics to be addressed through source/sink analysis include the seasonal cycle of wave activity, the role of the atmospheric boundary layer in generating and damping wave activity, and the generation of wave activity by condensational heating in convective clouds.<br/><br/>The work has societal value due to the connection between upper-tropospheric waviness and surface weather, for instance blocking events are associated with extreme precipitation and SSWs can lead to severe cold air outbreaks.  The software used to generate FAWA, LWA, and source/sink terms will be made openly available to the public via github, along with documentation on their use.  Education and outreach are conducted through a biennial summer school and a local community science center. In addition, the project supports two graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, thereby fostering the next generation of scientists in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While currently drawing from a broad range of disciplines and institutions, EMC is looking to broaden participation of scientists and engineers from minority serving institutions (MSIs), including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).  This proposal aims to broaden participation in the Electronic Materials Conference by forging close, sustainable ties with MSIs, through the NSF Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program, in order to build a more diverse EMC.<br/><br/>The project is designed to broaden participation in EMC by building a sustainable relationship between EMC and PREM, as well as electronic materials research groups at MSIs. The proposed effort will: (i) increase the breadth of research presented at EMC, providing opportunities for dissemination of research results from MSIs at an impactful forum for electronic materials research, (ii) offer opportunities for networking and the building of collaborative research efforts between MSI researchers and EMC attendees, fostering new research efforts and directions, and (iii) strengthen the EMC by broadening participation in the elected EMC organizing committee and pool of invited organizers. The proposed effort will focus on bringing researchers from MSIs into the EMC fold, both as attendees and presenters, but also as invited organizers and members of the organizing committee.  There will also be a focus on reaching out to undergraduate researchers at MSIs, in order to expose these students to a broad range of cutting-edge materials research, inspire these students to continue their education at the graduate level, and thus strengthen the STEM pipeline for under-represented populations.  The program will reimburse EMC registration fees for attendees and participants from MSIs and PREM institutions and will look to support travel and lodging expenses for ?teams? of EMC attendees from these institutions.  Success will be measured by tracking attendance and participation by MSI and PREM attendees, as well as with a post-conference survey to determine adjustments to EMC that will further help to broaden participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this work seeks to (a) quantify the participation of people of color and members of historically marginalized populations in the production of science, (b) elucidate their role in propelling intellectual innovations, and (c) understand how the distribution of labor and composition of scientific teams creates barriers and pathways to their scientific success. The project will support the mission of open science, by making the algorithms and publications openly available to propel this area of research. Finally, the PI team will recruit a cohort of a dozen student Fellows from a variety of disciplines and countries to discuss the ways in which they incorporate their lived experiences into research design and the challenges and barriers to this process. Priority will be given to doctoral students of color, or who identify as a member of a historically marginalized population within their country of affiliation. The goal of the fellowship is to empower students to navigate academic spaces by suggesting new topical directions with advisors, to cultivate change in terms of how authors are distributed in scientific publications, and to examine what and how science is conducted. Our research aims to empirically examine the degree to which diversity in the scientific workforce creates a more innovative and robust scientific system. The research has strong implications for all sectors of society.<br/><br/>This research builds upon previous quantitative analyses to construct more robust and equitable algorithms that take into consideration contextual factors that influence the performance of the algorithm.  To address our primary aim we use articles? abstract, title, and keywords to train a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to infer the topics within a corpus of papers and the distribution of topics within each article. Data sources include millions of articles and distinct authors indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) database.  To address our primary aim we will use articles? abstract, title, and keywords to train a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and to extend our work on intersecting race, ethnicity, and gender inequalities in the US research landscape to citation and collaboration patterns, the role of institutional affiliation and changes over time; infer the topics within a corpus of papers, and the distribution of topics within each article.  Our second aim is to determine if variation by race, ethnicity and gender identified in the US context translates to other national contexts. To address this second aim we will replicate and expand our methodology to two other scientifically productive, diverse societies. Comparison across all three nation states will allow for the identification of potentially generalizable characteristics, mechanisms that can be used to improve equity in science across the globe, and knowledge of how topicality of research in different countries is affected by the racial composition of teams.

Early, high-quality STEM learning experiences are also an essential way to attract more students to STEM course work and STEM careers. Currently however, the number of high-quality STEM education resources and materials available to preschool educators is limited. This 3-year project addresses this gap in teachers? capacity to support young children?s STEM content knowledge by developing (1) a play-based computer science and pre-engineering education program for pre-K children, (2) a web-based, early childhood teacher workforce development program, and (3) accompanying child and early childhood educator assessments. In designing these elements, the project will follow four principles of early learning: (1) technology-mediated learning and pre-engineering is a natural and critical part of children?s early learning; (2) children?s curiosity about the world around them abounds and their engagement with technology is a powerful catalyst for children?s play; (3) with appropriate guidance and equity in access, children?s natural curiosity becomes the foundation for beginning to use technology-mediated inquiry skills and early problem-solving to explore the surrounding world; and (4) early exploration can be a rich context in which children use and develop important early computer science and pre-engineering skills, including programming, working as a team, communication using ?pre-engineering? vocabulary, applied mathematics, and design thinking. Project partners include the University of Southern California?s STEM faculty and four Los Angeles community colleges, all of which are Hispanic-Serving Institutions. A set of Los Angeles-area preschools that serve linguistically and culturally diverse communities will serve as research sites. A total of 30 early childhood education teachers with their 600+ children will participate in the implementation research; matched numbers of children will be recruited for the control condition (1200 children total).<br/><br/>The project?s research questions include: (1) In what ways does the project?s infusing of play-based early computer science and pre-engineering into child development programs impact young children?s early computer science and pre-engineering knowledge, and their knowledge of and early interest in STEM careers? (2) What is the relationship between the project?s teacher professional development model and participating teachers? content knowledge of early computer science and pre-engineering and instructional performance? and (3) What impact does the teachers? cyber-safety focused professional development have on the cyber-safe practices of participating preschool teachers and their young students? The project will use a modular, web-based, teacher professional development program that allows preschool educators and university STEM faculty to co-create materials and engage in teacher professional development together. In years two and three, the project will test the development, feasibility, and fidelity of its approach using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The RCT will be scaled annually, beginning with two pilot test sites, and continuing with testing across six large sites by the project's final year. Data to be collected include observation of classroom teaching and children?s behaviors, teacher interviews, teacher focus groups, and parent and teacher surveys. During the 2-year RCT, multivariate analyses will be used to examine whether teachers and children in the intervention group have significantly higher post-test scores than their peers in the control group. The team will regress the post-test scores on a set of control variables (race, gender, socioeconomic status), pre/baseline-test scores, and a variable representing intervention versus control to further examine whether teachers and children in the intervention group have significantly higher post-test scores than teachers and children in the control group. Cross group comparisons will be made. At the end of the project, multilevel hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) will be employed comparing teachers and children in Year 3 of the RCT. The project aims to produce a fully tested set of bilingual, bicultural products for national dissemination. Products would include a fully exportable, web-based, modular early childhood educator STEM workforce training and professional development model which focuses on ?junior computer science and pre-engineering? through play.

To achieve this goal, this project will employ a combination of molecular, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches. The knowledge gained from this project may facilitate the development of RNA-based technologies for basic research as well as applications in biomedicine and agriculture, thus benefiting society in the long term. This project will also serve as a vehicle for training undergraduate and graduate students. Particularly, undergraduate students from Delta State University, located in one of the least affluent regions in the US and lacking the necessary facility for research training, will participate in summer research annually to gain research experience and to be prepared for STEM-related careers.<br/><br/>Supported by published and preliminary data, a testable hypothesis is that potato spindle tuber viroid recruits RNA-specific transcription factor(s), thereby enhancing the efficiency of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-catalyzed RNA-templated transcription. The RNA promoter region is defined by the binding region of a recently identified RNA-specific transcription factor, TFIIIA-7ZF. This project will map and characterize the molecular basis/structure of RNA promoters within both sense and antisense genomes of potato spindle tuber viroid and its relatives, using a combination of selective 2?-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis, functional mutagenesis, Pol II-based in vitro transcription assay, RNA footprinting assays, etc. The outcomes from this project will help better understand the nature of RNA promoters and potentially exploit RNA promoters for usage in basic science and its applications in agriculture.

Fiber optics, the workhorse of digital communication, lags in incorporating emerging device structures into the global communication network. Growing energy demands in computing across diverse data processing platforms will require more efficient long-haul communication links capable of translating data effectively across those computing platforms. Imparting efficient data transduction and transformation capabilities into fiber optics requires integrating photonic and optoelectronic devices and systems into the fiber itself. Standard fiber manufacturing approaches, such as thermal draw, rely on pulling the fiber from a melt. Modification of the fiber by melt-shaping of glass is prone to complex, hard to control fluid dynamics making the process difficult to control. This research determine the limitations of molten-phase multimaterial fiber processing in achieving the desired solid-state outcomes, aiming to embed active optical circuitry in fiber-optics with submicron precision and tight material control. The research supports enhanced fiber-optics manufacturing processes aimed at developing efficient interconnects for emerging computation platforms and educating the workforce, assisting in preserving the US technological and economic dominance in the global information space. <br/><br/>This award supports research into development of a manufacturing methodology for fiber-embedded architectures by defining a fiber cross-section through a thermal draw of a 3D printed preform, followed by the axial patterning of fiber cores with a spatially coherent material selective capillary breakup and resolidification. The geometry and temperature of fiber-encapsulated melts at every stage of the fabrication process dictates the balance of forces and thus fully define the fluid dynamics within the melt. Experimental studies investigate the liquid reshaping kinematics in locally molten fiber under engineered and controlled spatiotemporal heating conditions. Understanding and control over the underlying physical mechanisms guide the liquid-phase reshaping of in-fiber materials towards self-assembly into ordered solid-state architectures. The award will generate knowledge in the material science of 3D printed glass and its thermal reflow, fluid mechanics of molten multimaterial threads, and solid-liquid phase transition science in confined melts. The research provides a basis for scalable in-fiber manufacturing of photonic and optoelectronic circuitry, aimed a general interconnect for the large-scale networks needed for computational platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work will quantify the impact of subinertial variability on (1) cross-ridge volume transports to and from the deep ocean basins on either side of the GSR; (2) cross-frontal water mass exchange; and (3) cross-shelfbreak volume transport on and off the shallow continental shelves. The first GSR-wide estimates of volume, heat, and salt fluxes across continental shelfbreaks along the ridge (the Greenland, Iceland, Faroe, and Scottish shelves) will be provided, including their spatial and temporal variability. Project outcomes will provide fundamental understanding of the nature and importance of GSR variability, which plays a key role in the global climate system and inform potential observing strategies. Further broader impacts include support of an early-career female PI and train an undergraduate student to gain practical research experience. <br/><br/>Hypotheses that subinertial variability exceeds seasonal and superinertial variability in channels, along the GSR, and around the Iceland and the Faroes (excepting tides close to coastal margins) and that it may dominate the time-mean flow in some places on the GSR will be tested by addressing several objectives. These include characterizing subinertial current, sea surface height and isopycnal displacement variability; quantifying how such variability impacts the cross-ridge volume transport; characterizing the spatial structures and scales associated with high-transport events, and how water mass properties are modified due to cross-frontal heat and salt fluxes; and quantifying how subinertial variability impacts the cross-shelfbreak volume transport. Based on these findings, an observational strategy will be recommended to capture the subinertial variability where it is important to the mean flow. Tools to be used include three existing one-year-long hydrostatic simulations  from regional ocean-sea ice configurations of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm), which have been shown to realistically represent the regional ocean properties and dynamics. An offline particle tracking tool for Lagrangian analyses (developed by the PIs) will be used, which employs a trapezoidal solver with a predictor-corrector scheme, and uses the full four-dimensional velocity fields to calculate particle trajectories. Publicly-available data sets will be used for a model-data comparison. Goals are to quantify the realism of the numerical simulations and estimate bias, and to elucidate the complementary information in sparse, intermittent observations and inaccurate simulations. Products to be used include hydrographic profiles, mooring timeseries, glider datasets , and gridded and along-track altimetry data products. If quality-controlled high resolution satellite altimetry from the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission are released within the duration of this project, they will also be utilized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will further mature a technique to accurately observe low-mode internal tides using satellite altimetry. It will not only improve our understanding of internal tide activities, but also develop a new technique for monitoring ocean stratification, providing an independent long-term, low-cost, environmentally-friendly observing system.

Digital technologies have substantially changed the landscape of the industry, with online delivery becoming an essential revenue source for restaurants. Delivery platforms collect customer orders via a mobile app and have drivers pick up the food and deliver it to customers. These platforms, however, have had an uneasy partnership with restaurants. Delivery platforms possess strong power over independent restaurants and set platform fees as high as 30% to extract most of the surplus created on their platforms. Although there are heated debates on whether and how to regulate delivery platforms, the lack of empirical studies hinders the progress towards effective policymaking. This project investigates the impact of delivery platforms on restaurants and the implications for policymakers. The findings from this project advance our knowledge on how on-demand platforms and other powerful platforms create value for businesses, organizations, and our society. This project also enhances our knowledge about how to regulate powerful platforms.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project has three objectives: 1) Investigating the Realities of On-Demand Delivery. Whether restaurants benefit from delivery platforms, or what types of restaurants are more likely to benefit (e.g., independent vs. chain) are fundamental questions of importance to restaurant owners and policymakers; 2) Investigating the Effectiveness of Current Regulatory Policies. More than a dozen of cities and states have recently imposed regulations that cap the commissions that delivery platforms can charge. This project investigates if such regulatory policies are effective, and the promises and perils of implementing such regulations; 3) Designing Optimal Regulatory Policies. Building on the findings from 1) and 2), this project seeks to design optimal regulatory policies that improve total social welfare, balancing restaurant revenue, consumer surplus, and the sustainability of the on-demand delivery business.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Higher levels of neophilia are believed to lead to greater behavioral flexibility, effecting an animal?s ability to adapt to changes in their environments and to invade new ecosystems successfully.  The proposed work will focus on identifying genes and neurons responsible for neophilia.   This work will use novel arena exploration assays with varied and integrated genetic approaches.   In Drosophila melanogaster, mutant and transgenic lines will be used to determine the requirements of dopamine signaling within the brain to initiate neophilic exploration.   A new genetic mapping population generated from the sister species of Drosophila will also be used to map genetic variants involved in the differences in exploratory behaviors found between these two closely related species.  These two approaches will help explain why enormous differences in neophilic exploration are found in insect species.  This understanding will likely transcend insects and shed light on neophilia in other species.  The work will further generate several lasting societal benefits, including the generation of a novel mapping population that can be used to identify important genetic variants controlling many complex physiology and behavior responses.  These lineages will be broadly distributed to investigators.  The proposed experiments are highly accessible to undergraduate researchers and will be used to train students at both the University of Mississippi and the University of Houston Downtown, many from underserved groups, in scientific inquiry and in the genetic approaches to neuroscience and behavior.     <br/><br/>Understanding the molecular and neural basis for neophilia is required to explain the broad inter- and intraspecific variation in this behavioral trait.  The goal of this proposal is to understand how neophilia is encoded in the Drosophila nervous system, including an identification of the molecules and neural circuits responsible for recognizing novel stimuli and inducing arousal in the animal.  Our central hypothesis is that during the evolution of food specialization in Drosophila species, genetic variants that reduced neophilia were selected for, resulting in a loss of specific exploration; dopamine signaling is also likely involved. Novel open field exploration of Drosophila species combined with varied genetic approaches will be used to identify the genetic variants responsible for differences in novelty-seeking behavior.  Novel open field arenas have long been used to measure trait and state-dependent changes in exploration in various laboratory species. Interestingly, Drosophila simulans, an ecological generalist, actively explores novel arenas, while its sister species and ecological specialist, Drosophila sechellia, does not.  A population of recombinant inbred lineages generated from these Drosophila sister species will be used to identify the quantitative trait loci responsible for the evolved differences in neophilia found between these species.  Moreover, a reverse genetic/transgenic approach will be used to dissect the role of specific dopaminergic circuits in novelty arousal using Drosophila melanogaster.  In this approach, the function of dopamine neural circuits and participating receptors required for the initiation of exploration will be identified.

This effort will address a long-standing problem in which most fluorescent molecules, which work perfectly in solution, lose their brightness when turned into the solid forms needed for making robust consumer products. This project will attempt to solve this problem by using the brightest fluorescent materials ever discovered, which were created by members of this project team and their collaborators. The materials are called small-molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). They are easily made by mixing two chemicals together; one is a dye that generates the ability to manipulate energy in the form of light and the other is a structure-making compound, called cyanostar, that helps organize the dyes into a checker-board lattice of positive and negative ions. The significance of this project stems from the importance of optical materials in modern technologies such as 3D displays, and for clean energy technologies such as the harvesting of low-energy solar radiation. The project will benefit society by training graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral coworkers in research, communication, data science and multi-disciplinary collaboration. Outreach will be conducted with museum exhibits and web-based materials for careers in STEM. Technology transfer will be undertaken with start-up, Halophore, Inc. Open-source software and databases will be generated. This project aligns with the Materials Genome Initiative by developing a data-backed computing and experimental workflow for making materials twice as fast or even faster, with a target of also reducing cost.<br/><br/>In this project, the research team will design a materials creation workflow relying on data extraction, quantum chemical calculations, and rule-based screening for selecting optimal candidates to use in the discovery and development of optical materials. The rules governing how molecular building blocks assemble into SMILES materials, and the rules dictating how the resulting structures control the optical properties, will be derived by experimental verification and used iteratively to improve the screening. The project has three Aims. Aim 1 seeks to establish the cyberinfrastructure, database, and quantum chemistry methods for a materials creation workflow capable of predicting the optical properties of SMILES-based materials. Aim 2 seeks to expand the classes of dyes that can be used to make SMILES materials and to establish the crystal engineering rules for assembling dyes with different shapes, charges, and redox properties into optical materials.

An essential component in the fight against malaria is the control of disease vectors through the use of contact insecticides for indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated nets. Contact insecticides are powders of organic crystalline materials. As mosquitoes rest on the powder particles, they absorb the active substance through their tarsi (feet) to lethal effect. New York University investigators previously demonstrated that the efficacy of contact insecticides strongly depends on the identity of their crystalline forms, otherwise known as polymorphs, which have identical molecular compositions but different crystal structures. The more active polymorphs must also exhibit a high stability against transformation to less active polymorphs for the duration of their application. The central objective of this project is a knowledge-guided design, through computation and experiment, of metastable crystalline forms with superior properties for their target application. In the context of contact insecticides, this will allow less toxicant to be used, reduce environmental impact, and, thereby, meet key sustainability goals on multiple fronts. Various workshops, including Computer Crystals for Kids, Machine Learning for Kids, and Crystal Kaleidoscope, will convey the science of the project to K-12 students. Special attention will be provided to engage Black, Latino, and Native American students through the Collegiate Science Technology Entry Program.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The application of metastable polymorphs of molecular crystals in the management of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever through innovations in contact insecticide formulations represents a new and sustainable target of opportunity. Accelerated discovery of such metastable polymorphs with low thermodynamic yet high kinetic stability constitutes a key challenge that can only be met using a tightly integrated computational and experimental workflow. Starting with twelve known contact insecticides approved by the World Health Organization for indoor residual spraying (including pyrethroids, organophosphates, carbamates, and neonicotinoids), the project will explore innovative approaches to crystal polymorphs that meet the aforementioned criteria, which are essential to insecticide efficacy that relies on physical contact between insect tarsi and crystal surfaces in indoor residual spraying applications and insecticide-treated nets.  Experimentally, these metastable polymorphs can be obtained from melt or solution, by (cross-)nucleation, phase transformations, or growth under nanoconfinement. The experimental work will be complemented by the development of a theoretical framework focused on the formation of energetically accessible polymorphs ? driven by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors ? as well as the transformation between different polymorphs and their surface properties. These tasks are beyond the reach of standard computational tools, requiring the development of new theoretical methodologies that combine the strength of enhanced molecular simulations and machine learning. Initial computational results will be validated by experimental data to improve the theoretical framework. Similarly, theoretical predictions will be used to guide and refine experimental protocols. This iterative loop of mutual feedback will eventually converge toward comprehensive and reliable workflows that will accelerate the discovery and development of metastable polymorphs with exceptional properties, in accord with the goals of the Materials Genome Initiative. Various workshops, including Computer Crystals for Kids, Machine Learning for Kids, and Crystal Kaleidoscope, will convey the science of the project to K-12 students.

While there are many treatments available, there are no proven therapies to mitigate the long-term effects of these injuries. The results of this work will ultimately lead to new treatments.  This work will look specifically at astrocytes, which are a specific cell type in the brain and spinal cord.  Astrocytes are responsible for many critical supportive functions. Astrocyte dysfunction occurs in conditions as Alzheimer?s disease and cancer.  The role of astrocytes in responding to mechanical injury is not well understood. This project will use engineered three-dimensional model brain tissues to better understand the contribution of specific cell types to brain injury response. These models provide a realistic view of how the brain cells respond to injuries such as blast trauma. This work will revel how astrocytes sense and respond to mechanical trauma.  The results  may lead to new ways to determine patient susceptibility to damage, or improve patient outcomes following injury to the brain. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will also include educational outreach opportunities for a diverse group of students in rural southwestern Virginia.  <br/><br/>Astrocytes play a vital role in brain tissue homeostasis through modulation of metabolites, inflammation, and the extracellular microenvironment. They are also the major effector cells in both prolonging and resolving pathologic processes following brain trauma. Mechanobiology studies of brain development and function have been limited to analysis of how mechanotransduction mediates neuronal signaling and plasticity. The few studies that have examined astrocyte mechanobiology have not focused on the cellular effects following traumatic brain injury. This project will incorporate aspects of tissue engineering and cellular mechanobiology to understand how force transduction via cell-matrix interactions may contribute to complex sequelae that occur after high-rate insults associated with brain trauma secondary injury cascades. This work may ultimately reveal novel therapeutic avenues to interrupt the cell-microenvironment mechanical interaction feedback loops that amplify secondary damage mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These alarming percentages represent a reversal of educational trends, which indicate that, for bachelor?s degree attainment, across all disciplines and ethnic groups, Black women are the most educated group compared to their male counterparts. From an asset-based standpoint, Black women who persist in engineering: (1) had representation in the form of mentors and role models, (2) had access to inclusive formal and/or informal STEM education and, (3) were in supportive organizational and institutional climates. Although research in these areas has increased, it has primarily been within formal settings. With children spending about 81.5% of their waking hours outside of formal education and underrepresented minorities (URMs) representing 61% of those students (24% of whom are Black), it?s imperative to further explore their experiences in these settings, especially longitudinally and, specifically within informal engineering educational settings. Given growing STEM workforce demands, national-level broadening participation efforts and the need to further understand the formation of Black women as engineers, this project will consist of the development of a longitudinal database with profiles of Black women who have completed engineering degrees and participated within an informal engineering program. Throughout this five-year CAREER proposal, Black women?s participation within the Summer Engineering Experience for Kids (SEEK) program, hosted by the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and other experiences related to their educational journey, will be studied. Since 2017, over 5,000 mentor teachers and 20,000 students across the U.S. cities have participated in SEEK. <br/><br/>In collaboration with NSBE, a three phased approach will be conducted. Phase I: development of a database with participant profiles using longitudinal demographic and survey data results. Phase II: qualitative interviews will be conducted with results added to participant profiles.  Phase III: data from previous phases will be examined and validated through the support and guidance of external experts. Results will be shared with K-12, higher education and industry stakeholders through the education professional development. Using intersectionality, social and cultural capital, and anti-deficit achievement as theoretical frameworks, the following research questions will be answered: (RQ1) To what extent does participation within informal and formal engineering education develop over time to impact Black women?s formation as engineers towards degree completion? (RQ2) How do individual, institutional, and cultural factors within the interchange of informal and formal engineering education contribute to Black women?s formation as engineers and persistence in engineering degree programs? This project is transformative in that it will acknowledge the non-monolithic state of Black women (i.e. specific engineering degree obtained, cultural differences, age at degree completion, institution type attended, etc.) and experiences along their journeys. Second, in terms of the methods, leveraging large data sets from coeducational and single-sex, informal engineering sites to develop participant profiles within a single database and analyzing them longitudinally is a strategy that has not been done. Third, the theoretical framing with intersectionality as a base and with social and cultural capital through an asset-based approach is novel and transformative. Through the educational professional development, best practices found will advance research efforts and provide K-12, university and industry stakeholders with in-depth knowledge of tools that can be implemented through their programmatic efforts. Results will impact efforts to increase interest in, recruitment of and support for the persistence of Black women and girls in engineering education. Four dissemination workshops will allow asset-based results to be shared with an even broader, more diverse audience including organizations such as ASEE, SHPE, SWE, ACA, WEPAN, ACLU and professional engineering societies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While previous research has demonstrated that variation in social responsiveness among individuals in a group influences ways in which the whole group behaves, this research has been through work in laboratories or using computer simulations. In order to better understand this phenomenon and how it relates to the evolution of social behavior, this doctoral dissertation research project examines these relationships in natural settings. The investigators use new tracking technologies and advance the field of biological anthropology by introducing non-invasive, image-based techniques for tracking nonhuman primate movements and interactions in the wild. Through this project the investigators create opportunities for both masters? and undergraduate thesis projects and develop new educational modules on collective animal behavior targeted toward middle-school students. <br/><br/>Collective behavior researchers have proposed that socially responsive individuals follow cues given by neighbors to make inferences about environmental conditions and resource locations, while unresponsive individuals gather information privately through independent investigation of the environment. Theory predicts that the extent of within-group variation in social responsiveness produces group-level traits, such as cohesion and collective decision-making regimes, which in turn have consequences for individual fitness. This project has three specific objectives: (1) identify the contexts in which wild female savannah baboons are socially responsive; (2) examine if variation in social responsiveness affects collective behavior; and (3) test if group composition affects individual fitness according to its expected effects on collective movement. To achieve these objectives, novel data are collected in the field using 3D stereo videography and GPS-accelerometer collars. Long-term demographic and behavioral data collected over five decades of population monitoring are used to contextualize results.  Furthermore, by considering the simultaneous ?bottom-up? effects of individual variation on collective behavior and the ?top-down? effects of collective behavior on individual fitness in a highly social primate, this project offers novel insight into the adaptive value of social responsiveness and its role in patterning group-level phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This problem arises partly because of inability to create the capacity to enforce taxes effectively, thus leading to increased tax evasion.  Reducing tax evasion  requires a detailed understanding of the drivers of tax evasion and the optimal allocation of scarce tax enforcement resources. This research combines new theory and other innovative research methodologies  to provide new insights into tax evasion by firms, the strength of enforcement spillovers through production networks, and how best to target enforcement activities. Working in partnership with  tax authority, the project will help to increase the capacity to reduce tax evasion and to generate and use evidence on policies? impacts. The results of this research project will inform policies to improve tax administration in the US to make it fair, efficient, reduce the deficit, and improve the allocation of resources. The lessons from this research can then serve as evidence to inform decisions in other countries. <br/> <br/>This project has two parts.  In the first part extends the canonical model of tax evasion: firms make reports of their sales to, and purchases from, other firms in a production network, creating reporting spillovers. We derive the optimal targeting rules the government should use to minimize total tax evasion. The second part of the project leverages rich administrative tax return data on tax liabilities and production networks to perform two RCTs in collaboration with tax administrations.  The first experiment will randomly deploy electronic invoicing and desk audits focused on discrepancies between trading partners' reports to learn the strength of their direct effects on targeted firms and their indirect effects on targeted firms' suppliers and clients. The project then takes these estimates and use them to calibrate the model and the second experiment tests the model?s optimal targeting rule against the status quo and random targeting. The results of this research project will inform policies to improve tax administration in the US to make it fair, efficient, reduce the deficit, and improve the allocation of resources.

These technologies have the potential to fundamentally alter family structure and family wellbeing.  However, because these technologies  are expensive, their arrival may introduce new health inequities, which underscores the role of public policies that regulate their accessibility and affordability. Understanding the consequences of ARTs and prenatal screening technologies for family decisions, family outcomes, and inequality is essential for informing public fertility-related policies, and thereby advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare. This CAREER research program combines population-wide administrative data, with uniquely detailed information on individual-level use of these technologies, and experimental and theoretical research methods to better understand their effects on families. The research project will study how ARTs and prenatal screening technologies affect family reproductive decisions, as well as whether these technologies affect inequalities across families. This proposal's education plan focuses on training students in how to access and use big administrative data for research - knowledge that is often passed through personal connections - to help level the playing field in the profession for the next generation of researchers. The results of this research project will have major influence on the conduct of public fertility policy, and health care policy generally.  The results could help improve the health of Americans as well as help establish the US a global leader in reproductive health care policy.<br/><br/>This CAREER research project has four components. The first project is motivated by sharp differences in utilization of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) across socioeconomic groups.  It exploits age thresholds in public health insurance coverage of ARTs to investigate the role of affordability in driving this inequality; further, it examines the long-run consequences of ARTs uptake on the health and well-being of women who use them and their families. The second project will study the arrival of a new and superior - but expensive - screening technology for identifying chromosomal abnormalities. It will combine reduced-form evidence leveraging insurance eligibility thresholds with a theoretical model of parents' prenatal testing decisions to examine the implications of the superior technology on parents' testing choices, birth outcomes, and measures of aggregate population health. The third project focuses on a particular type of ARTs, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). The project is based on the observation that IVF with donated gametes (sperm and oocytes) decouples a baby's environment in utero from the baby's genetic material. Using data containing information about IVF children born with donated gametes, this project will bring novel evidence to the debate on the importance of ""nature"" versus ""nurture"" in the association between parents' socioeconomic standing and children's health. The fourth component is a mentoring workshop that aims to reduce inequality among students in access to information about the use of large-scale administrative data in research.

The world is in the middle of two major transitions to cleaner sources of electricity generation: first from coal to natural gas and from natural gas to renewable energy. These transitions are occurring in a highly regulated environment, raising the question of how regulation affects energy transitions and for the distribution of pollution (environmental justice). This project studies the effect of rate-of-return regulation on previous energy transitions and evaluates how changes in this regulatory structure may influence ongoing transitions. In addition, this project evaluates how environmental regulatory agencies incorporate environmental justice into their Clean Air Act Amendment enforcement decisions, and how alternative enforcement decisions impact community well-being.  The results of this project will provide inputs into electricity regulation policies in order to hasten the transition to clean energy as well as improve environmental justice.<br/><br/>To evaluate the role of rate-of-return regulation in energy transitions, this project develops and structurally estimates a model where utilities invest in and retire generation capacity in the long run and make usage decisions in the short run. In this model, the regulator attempts to incentivize utilities to minimize costs while meeting electricity needs by offering a fair rate-of-return on generators that are deemed ?used and useful.? Further, this project estimates how environmental justice enters regulators' preferences over enforcement. The model allows regulators to incorporate both communities? and electricity generators? welfare in enforcement decisions.

Using the same methods, measured in populations thousands of miles apart at the same elevation thousands of feet above sea level, the project takes a new approach by measuring how high-altitude adaptations work in people during physical activity. The results of the research build on a large body of previous research on this topic and provide important information about how the high-altitude adaptations in both populations have contributed to their survival over time in low-oxygen environments. The project investigators provide scientific outreach among a local community and incorporate feedback and ideas from study participants into the project. This project also provides training for undergraduate and graduate students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Some highland populations have resided in hypoxic environments for thousands of years, promoting stable evolutionary changes in aspects of their biology related to oxygen transport and delivery. Though exposed to the same selective pressure, these populations exhibit some distinct physiological adaptations, suggesting that certain historical contingencies have shaped different trajectories of trait evolution across geographic space and time. The overall objective of this project is to compare the mechanisms of improved oxygen delivery at high altitude. The central hypothesis that this study tests is that one population improves oxygen delivery primarily through increased blood oxygen content, while the other improves oxygen delivery primarily through increased blood flow. Using refined and carefully matched protocols, this project employs exercise testing, respiratory gas analysis, and hematological measurements in 70 individuals from each population to test this hypothesis. The results of this research contribute to a large body of research on human biological variation in relationship to environmental stressors, importantly through the added perspective of oxygen delivery during the stress of physical activity at high-altitude.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Steroid hormones are a class of chemical compounds that are naturally produced in all vertebrate animals that affect every cell type and physiological system from embryonic development through advanced age. The brain is the preeminent coordinator of these chemical signals to regulate everything from molecular processes within the cell to behavioral outcomes. As an example, brain-dependent elevation of the steroid hormone cortisol increases blood glucose levels to support the cellular energy needed to increase heart rate and muscle function when an individual needs to escape from immediate danger. The conference is strongly committed to inclusion and diversity in science and will encourage participation from scientists and trainees from all genders, ethnicities, cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds.<br/><br/>The conference originated in 1993 and has provided an important forum for established scientists and their trainees with the common goal to further understanding of the neuroendocrine processes regulating physiology and behavior. The limited attendance of approximately 100 researches facilitates deeper interactions among the participants compared to other scientific conferences. This year sessions will span topics that include the emerging fields of neuroimmune signaling, neural circuits, environmental influences on brain and behavior, hormone effects on the aging brain, genetics of sex differences, and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis regulation and stress-related behaviors. The meeting will host a dedicated Young Investigator Symposium where talented early career researchers will showcase their work and receive valuable scientific input from established researchers.

This doctoral dissertation project investigates the relationship between early life environment and aspects of microscopic brain anatomy in two nonhuman primate species. The research leverages existing primate brain collections to advance knowledge about early life stressors, brain, and behavior, and provides broader comparative context for research on similar processes in humans. The project supports graduate research and training in STEM and provides laboratory training and mentoring opportunities to undergraduate students who will have an active role in the research. The investigators plan to share these results with broad audiences via publications, conference talks, and science engagement activities with the public.<br/><br/>In early life, young individuals of many species rely on their mothers or caregivers to provide emotional support and to teach them the skills needed to thrive. Past research has indicated that adult animals who experienced separation from their mothers or caregivers at a young age exhibit anatomical differences in their brains such as significant increases in the size of some brain areas and tracts that connect these structures. Notably, the parts of the brain that are most affected make up the reward circuit, which functions to promote learning and motivate behaviors. Consequently, these anatomical differences in the brain could contribute to the development of social and cognitive deficits associated with early social adversity. The main objective of this project is to investigate at the microscopic level how rearing environment in early life can result in long-term structural changes of the reward circuit. The investigators use existing primate brain collections to compare individuals with different rearing histories across two species that are thought to vary in terms of neural plasticity. In each of these brains, the investigators perform analyses to visualize and quantify 1. connections made between neurons, 2. morphology of neurons, and 3. receptor expression of neurons. With these data, the investigators can begin to describe the mechanisms behind changes in brain structure as a result of early social adversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scientific importance of this project lies in providing a comparative backdrop of mammalian evolution to better understand the ecological setting for major adaptations in the ape and human lineage. More broadly, this project can have significant impacts for science and society by expanding participation in science through graduate training and research opportunities for undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM research. A relational database of paleontological data assembled through this project is planned for public distribution to scientists and educators via the Data Repository at the University of Minnesota (DRUM). Other results will be made available through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and public outreach opportunities aimed at providing scientific engagement at public schools and museums. <br/><br/>The early divergence of ape lineages, during which several major adaptive characteristics of the ape-human clade were established, is primarily recorded in the early Miocene (ca. 23-16 Ma). Although fossil apes from this time have been the subject of intense study, little work has been done to properly situate the diversity of these species within the broader context of mammalian community evolution. This project asks the central question: how did environment, time, and geographic distance influence the structure of early Miocene mammalian communities? Using large fossil assemblages, this project pursues four specific questions: 1) do fossil assemblages from major collecting areas represent differences in mammalian community structure? 2) do changes in mammalian community structure track environmental differences inferred from associated paleoecological proxies? 3) are mammalian community structures most similar among assemblages that are closest in age? and 4) does similarity in mammalian community structure decrease with increasing geographic distance between assemblages? These questions are addressed by analyzing the mammalian community structure across 13 fossil localities that are already well-characterized in terms of age and paleoenvironment. By situating mammalian community succession within temporal, geographic, and environmental contexts, this project can inform our understanding of how these factors influenced changes among mammal species, thereby clarifying the ecological parameters within which major adaptations in the ape and human lineage arose.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Primarily plant-eating primates must reach nutritional requirements while coping with noxious plant compounds (plant secondary metabolites: PSMs) that are often produced in plants. Although these compounds are thought to be a strong selective force on primates, and even responsible for technological innovations in food processing and domestication in humans, we lack a clear idea of how these compounds influence the foraging, health, and digestive adaptations of wild primates. This doctoral dissertation research project examines the behavioral and physiological strategies that a wild primate species uses to cope with PSMs while reaching nutritional goals. This research will promote the conservation of a critically endangered species by maintaining a research presence on productive conservation land and providing local field assistants with alternative livelihoods to logging. The investigators will also provide training in laboratory and field methods to underrepresented students in STEM.<br/><br/>While it has become clear that the foraging behavior and health status of wild primates is linked to the nutrient composition of their foods, PSMs should also be a primary determinant of primate diets and health because of the negative effects that they can have, including reduced nutrient intake, toxicity, or even reduced reproductive success. This study uses a model system to explore how both nutrients and tannins, a common class of PSM, guide food selection through variable periods of preferred food availability and nutritional status, and throughout the course of development. Tannins are thought to be detrimental to consumers because they bind and reduce dietary protein, and the primates studied in this project depend on protein-derived energy to meet energetic demands during periods of preferred food scarcity. Tannins may thus be particularly detrimental to their health, and they may therefore have behavioral or physiological strategies to deal with them. The investigators use data on food availability, feeding behavior, nutrient composition of plant foods, and results from a qualitative assay of the effectiveness of tannins in food, to test how tannins and nutrients affect food selection and preference. The investigators also measure biomarkers of health in urine samples, including C-peptide of insulin and creatinine, to see if health status is related to intake of tannin-rich foods. Finally, they quantify tannin-binding proteins in saliva, which are thought to be produced as an adaptation to cope with dietary tannins. Overall, the results of this project provide important knowledge regarding food availability, preferences and nutritional and health related consequences in primates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, our understanding of human evolution depends on reconstructing how and why bipedalism evolved. This doctoral dissertation research project uses information about the ?family tree? of extinct human species to reconstruct how, when, and why skeletal features that are critical for bipedalism evolved. This reconstruction allows the project investigators to test key hypotheses about human origins, including those concerning the role that environmental factors may have played in shaping our evolutionary history. This study investigates how ecological conditions have influenced human evolution, a line of inquiry that is particularly important in the context of global climate change. This project also supports the research of an early career female scientist from an historically underrepresented group in STEM and contributes to the diversity of scholarship in Biological Anthropology.<br/><br/>This research tests two hypotheses relating patterns of character evolution to the ecological, temporal, and geographical contexts in which skeletal traits related to hominin bipedalism evolved. The first hypothesis addresses the patterns and processes by which bipedalism originated and subsequently evolved, as well as the selective history that may have shaped its evolution. The second hypothesis concerns whether the evolution of derived locomotor traits is temporally correlated with paleoenvironmental change and whether incorporating available paleoenvironmental data improves evolutionary models. Patterns of character evolution are analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Random and non-random evolutionary models are tested to examine which model is the most appropriate for explaining the evolution of hominin locomotor anatomy. The project helps answer several fundamental questions in paleoanthropology: How does phylogeny inform our understanding of the evolution of postcranial traits that function mechanically during bipedalism? What does the pattern of evolution for these traits tell us about how, why, and when bipedalism evolved during human evolution? What are the evolutionary forces driving the evolution of these characters? What are the magnitude and direction of changes in morphological characters that enhance bipedalism? How might changes in bipedal features relate to changes in the environment? Answers to these questions substantially inform our understanding of the evolution of one of the first and most fundamental hominin adaptations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This clumping can occur because of patterns of warm and cool ocean surface temperatures or because of spontaneous interactions between the clouds and their surrounding environment, among other factors. This project will study how the clumping of tropical clouds affects the water cycle and Earth?s energy budget ? the balance between heating from the sun and the energy that flows from Earth back to space. The proposed tasks will investigate how heavy rainfall events and the amount of cloudiness change in a warming climate, and how changes in the properties of clouds and how they clump together affect how much Earth will warm in the future. The investigator will use results from many different weather and climate models set up in a simplified framework to address these questions. The models simulate tropical clouds over an imaginary tropical ocean. This data set of model simulations is unique because it includes a wide range of model types set up in a consistent manner. The investigator will also lead a group of scientists around the world to perform new simulations with the different models that use a specific pattern of warm and cool ocean surface temperatures to control where the thunderstorm clouds clump together. The current group of simple simulations and the new simulations will be used in combination to achieve the overall goal of understanding tropical cloud clustering and its importance for climate. The investigator will also develop a training program for university students to do K-12 outreach and a suite of educational activities integrated with the research themes of tropical thunderstorm clouds, weather, and climate for school visits. These activities will be incorporated into an established summer program at Florida State University for high school students.<br/><br/>This project addresses some of the most important questions in climate science, about the role of tropical cloud systems in the water cycle and climate and how cloud systems interact with wind patterns and Earth?s energy budget. It will improve understanding of how tropical clouds change in a warmer climate, which is the biggest source of uncertainty in how much Earth warms in response to an increase in greenhouse gases. The project supports teaching and training in science across multiple populations.

Today, people in some regions may carry protective mutations in a key enzyme that metabolizes arsenic in the liver. However, several aspects remain unclear about the evolutionary history and genetic basis of arsenic tolerance. This doctoral dissertation research project therefore examines the genetic history, modes of subsistence, and gene regulatory mechanisms in ancient and modern DNA samples from populations exposed to arsenic. The findings can expand our understanding of biocultural processes through which humans are able to adapt to their environment. The project also supports student mentorship and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, opportunities for international research collaborations, and science dissemination through conferences and social media.<br/><br/>This project is centered on the understanding of the cultural and biological diversity of ancient and modern populations living in an arsenic rich region. Specifically, three main questions are addressed: (1) what are the genetic history and relationships among ancient and modern populations? (2) how did the transition to agriculture impact diet and oral health? and (3) what role/function do the mutations associated with arsenic tolerance play in the expression of the AS3MT gene? The researcher reconstructs the genetic prehistory of the region using ancient DNA and modern genomic data. In addition, oral microbiome data from ancient dental calculus are used to characterize the prehistoric diet, oral health and environmental exposures among pre-agricultural and agricultural populations. Third, genetic sequences carrying protective mutations are used to assess experimentally whether they alter/regulate the expression of the AS3MT gene in vitro.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many settings, however, projected future flood risks are sufficiently great that infrastructural mitigation strategies are limited. In such settings, how do residents and other stakeholders adapt to the prospect of rapid coastal change? This dissertation research examines the social, political, and material effects of planning for flood events and climate change for coastal urban waterways. Using a complement of anthropological methods, the project investigates the varied questions and possibilities around flooding faced by governments and communities as they consider adjusting life in places that are already challenged by toxic waters, constrained infrastructure, and concretized landscapes. In attending to concerns around urban flood risk management, this project also contributes to a greater understanding of the promises and challenges of infrastructure development and expansion. The research supports the training of a graduate student in methods of empirical data collection and analysis, and results are disseminated widely through academic and non-academic avenues, including to organizations concerned with environmental politics and policies.<br/><br/>This research brings together scholarship in anthropologies of the environment and infrastructure, critical indigenous and settler colonial studies, and anthropologies of climate change and crisis, to examine how people imagine, anticipate, and call upon diverse possibilities in remaking coastal landscapes. The researcher examines how water and infrastructure are understood, managed, and acted upon as part of these challenges and the ethics, politics, and knowledge that are revealed as the multifaceted threats of climate change confront the present formation and continued existence of coastal landscapes. The research design includes the use of participant observation, interviews, life histories, discourse analysis, and archival research to examine processes of change and efforts to respond in anticipation of possible catastrophes. The resulting findings allow for greater understandings of social and economic adaptations to coastal flood risks in urban settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Less well studied are the impacts of the human-altered environment on marine mammal populations. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the transmission of a human pathogen into marine mammal populations, uses preserved microorganisms on historical marine mammal remains as a unique resource to measure human-animal pathogen transmission, and explores the impact of human alterations on the marine environment.

In addition, a hypervirulent strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp), has been documented along the Pacific Rim. However, the origin of this transmission event is unknown. This project studies the introduction of Klebsiella pneumoniae into the California sea lion population using museum collections. Museum collections can provide a timeline for studying environmental alterations as well as pathogen emergence. The investigators use metagenomic sequencing on California sea lion dental calculus to reconstruct the microbial community and link changes in microbial diversity to human activity. The investigators also perform in-solution DNA capture on specimens with Klebsiella pneumoniae to determine which strains are present.

These transitions are occurring in a highly regulated environment, raising the question of how regulation affects energy transitions and for the distribution of pollution (environmental justice). This project studies the effect of rate-of-return regulation on previous energy transitions and evaluates how changes in this regulatory structure may influence ongoing transitions. In addition, this project evaluates how environmental regulatory agencies incorporate environmental justice into their Clean Air Act Amendment enforcement decisions, and how alternative enforcement decisions impact community well-being.

That is, instead of coercing others using physical intimidation, prestigious human leaders attract followers through admiration. Our closest living relatives provide crucial comparisons for understanding how the transition to prestige-based leadership happened in human evolutionary history. In some species, individuals maintain hierarchies that are defined by aggression but also show relatively extensive cooperation, which has been proposed to underlie human prestige. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates whether wild nonhuman primates exhibit some features of prestige-based leadership while at the same time keeping the dominance-based leadership seen in other animals.

To do so, they develop a novel statistical method to assess whether longitudinal stability of stress physiology is indicative of individual variation in temperament. Next, they examine whether consistently moderate stress responses and non-reactive temperaments that distinguish prestigious human leaders also predict tolerant, prosocial behavioral strategies in nonhuman primates. Finally, they probe how behavioral strategies contribute to leadership pathways rooted in dominance versus prestige, specifically asking whether prosociality incurs benefits via social attractiveness independently of conventional dominance rank.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Access to sufficient clean water is especially important for maintaining hydration in lactating mammalian mothers. Many primate mothers produce a dilute milk over an extended period, which may present challenges to maintaining water balance in lactating females. This doctoral dissertation research project explores hydration status and water consumption behaviors in wild female primates and provides a comprehensive look at the multiple variables that can influence their water balance. This study also documents water quality, availability, and location in the context of frequent human-animal interactions and therefore has important implications for public health. Understanding hydration, how it varies based on ecological contexts, as well as how primates meet their water requirements has implications for the conservation of endangered populations that face changing environments. This project provides numerous training opportunities and supports capacity building. Results are shared through scientific journals, social media, and educational efforts in multiple settings.<br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that lactating female primates are more water stressed than other individuals in their group and alter their behavior to increase their water intake. It also tests the hypothesis that high-ranking females are buffered from lactation-related water stress due to their increased access to better quality food and water compared to low-ranking females. This project maps spatiotemporal variation in water availability and quality, both in food and free-standing water, across the primates? habitat. Using behavioral observations and nutritional data, the researchers estimate water intake by lactating females. Using the collected physiological and behavioral data, the results clarify how water balance varies in females based on their reproductive state, dominance rank, and the water quality and availability in their home range. This project integrates new behavioral, physiological, ecological, spatiotemporal, and nutritional data to explore water balance and behavioral adaptations to hydration stress in an endangered primate species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the ongoing threat of emerging infectious disease, understanding the ways in which humans and pathogens impacted one another in the past can inform infectious disease research in the present. This doctoral dissertation project examines the origins and evolution of the disease pathogen responsible for the deadliest form of human malaria (P. falciparum). This pathogen is thought to have evolved through the transfer of a gorilla parasite to humans, but the timing and anthropological context for this event and malaria?s subsequent global spread remain poorly understood. The project traces malaria?s evolutionary history through analysis of both ancient P. falciparum genomes and related great ape parasites.

How the gut microbiome is established early in life, what causes it to change throughout life, and how it influences biology, health and behavior are topics of great interest across many realms of research. Studies on humans and animals support the influence of these microorganisms on behavior, but we have little knowledge of this relationship in wild nonhuman primates. By understanding links between products of the gut microbiome and behaviors, and how these vary across individuals in highly social species, this research provides insight and comparative context for investigating these links in humans. The project provides training and research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher, engages school-aged children with educational opportunities, and integrates local researchers into the project?s activities. <br/><br/>Variation in gut microbial diversity has been connected to poor memory and depression, and the relative amounts of specific microbes, such as Lactobacillus, has been associated with mood and behavioral variation. This previous work has shown that gut microbes that can biosynthesize and/or metabolize neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, are associated with the behavior of the host who harbors those microbes. While this evidence has been generated from human and lab animal studies, we have little knowledge of these relationships in wild animal populations in their natural habitats. This study addresses several questions in a wild and social nonhuman primate, including: 1) Is gut microbiome diversity associated with behavioral traits? 2) Are certain microbial functional genes associated with behavioral traits? 3) What is the association between gut microbiome diversity and individual dominance rank? and 4) Are social networks associated with inter-individual variation in gut microbiome diversity? The research team analyzes behavioral and fecal samples to address these questions. Behavioral data are used to quantify the behavioral traits of individuals as well as the emergent social network of the groups, and gut microbiomes are quantified through genomic sequencing of fecal samples using the 16S rRNA gene to quantify the taxonomic diversity of microbes. Functional genes of the microbes are quantified via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. A comprehensive set of bioinformatic and statistical methods are used to examine the potential relationships among these datasets, and to inform future studies in other species including humans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Small transparent nematodes offer an opportunity to directly visualize bacterial infection and dissemination in the context of a live animal, allowing for the discovery of novel mechanisms that may be too difficult to visualize in more complex animals like mammals. This proposal uses wild-isolated, microscopic nematodes and their associated microbiota to uncover novel host-microbe interactions. It focuses on dissecting the mechanisms governing a new paradigm for intracellular bacterial spreading between host cells, which was directly observed in a bacteria-infected wild nematode. The results from this project will serve as a technical roadmap for determining whether this paradigm for cell-cell spreading and the genetic pathway that controls it are conserved among other bacteria, which could provide novel strategies for treating bacterial infections and controlling environmental bacteria. Early-stage undergraduates will conduct discovery-based research for this proposal and then create research-based STEM curriculum to teach at local high schools. This will create a cycle of research awareness among these undergraduates to help eliminate persistent psychological barriers about the accessibility of STEM research, especially among first-generation college students and those from low income areas. <br/><br/>This project focuses on a new intracellular bacterial pathogen, Bordetella atropi, that was observed in vivo to use a novel mechanism for cell-to-cell spreading in its host nematode Oscheius tipulae.

Filamentation by B. atropi requires the glucolipid pathway, a conserved glucose-sensing pathway used by bacteria to detect a nutrient-rich environment. This proposal will investigate the hypothesis that B. atropi uses nutrient sensing to detect host cell invasion, inhibit septation, and trigger filamentation for spreading to neighboring intestinal cells. The specific aims are to (1) dissect the role of the glucolipid pathway in controlling filamentation through gene expression analysis, metabolite analysis, and cell biology; (2)  understand the infection process of B. atropi by determining the fate of the lateral host membranes and identify host factors that promote filamentation, and (3) create a lab-based workshop that uses wild nematode sampling to discover other bacteria that filament in rich conditions and new intracellular bacterial pathogens of nematodes.

For instance, plants with continuously enhanced defense frequently have compromised growth and vice versa. This growth-defense tradeoff is largely due to limited resources, which are used to produce costly defense metabolites. This issue has become more pressing in recent years with ongoing climate change, which accelerates pathogen infection and pest infestation. However, our understanding of how plants simultaneously coordinate defense and growth remains scarce. This proposed research will reveal mechanisms underlying growth regulation governed by a class of stress compounds called aldoximes. Aldoximes are linked to both plant defense - they are precursors of defense compounds and are induced by stresses - and growth - they affect the production of the plant growth hormone auxins as well as phenylpropanoids such as lignin. This project will elucidate how auxins are made from aldoximes and how aldoximes impede phenylpropanoid production in plants. Completion of this project will provide fundamental understanding of plant metabolic networks coordinating hormones, defense compounds, and lignin under stress conditions. The outcome of this project will provide opportunities to enhance levels of phenylpropanoids such as anthocyanins in crops, and will help foster a competitive and successful agriculture workforce. This project also includes a K-12 educational activity called Phyto-Detective, which will develop a series of videos aimed to raise awareness of phytochemicals for a young student audience. <br/><br/>Aldoximes are stress-inducive compounds and are precursors of defense compounds. In addition, they affect plant growth through modulating the production of plant growth hormone auxins and phenylpropanoids. The accumulation of aldoximes represses phenylpropanoid biosynthesis partially through the transcriptional activation of the F-box genes that function in the degradation of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). Since PAL functions at the entry point of the phenylpropanoid pathway, aldoxime accumulation shuts down the entire phenylpropanoid pathway. Various species produce two major natural auxins, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and phenyl acetic acid (PAA), from their respective aldoximes, indicating the significance of aldoxime metabolism in a multitude of different plants. Although the aldoxime-mediated metabolic network plays a crucial role in stress-triggered growth regulation in plants, molecular mechanisms underlying aldoxime-mediated phenylpropanoid repression and aldoxime-derived auxin production remain elusive. This project will elucidate this hidden metabolic network using two model systems, Arabidopsis and tomato. Using omics and genetics approaches, this project will identify the metabolic route of aldoxime-derived auxin production, determine mechanisms of aldoxime-mediated phenylpropanoid repression, and elucidate the roles of aldoxime metabolism in plant stress adaptation. The educational goal is to foster the next generation of the agriculture workforce and increase public awareness of plants and plant-based compounds. The production and dissemination of educational videos for young students through summer undergraduate interns and a K-12 teacher conference, respectively, will provide educational tools to raise awareness of phytochemicals to the public. In addition, graduate students and postdoctoral associates will receive comprehensive research training while participating in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will undertake research on climate change, and the nature of human responses to that change, during the Last Glacial Period. The Last Glacial is characterized by profound shifts in climate, culminating in the Last Glacial Maximum during which sea levels dropped to 130 m below the modern coastline. On a human scale, the phase witnessed significant biological, cultural and technological changes. Within the region studied, this includes the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans and the transition from Middle to Upper Paleolithic technologies and culture. The Last Glacial also encompasses much of the Epipaleolithic, a period of key importance to our understanding of the transition from foraging bands to sedentary farming societies. There has been considerable debate about the role played by climate change in these transitions, fueled in part by a lack of high resolution, culturally linked environmental data. By combining high resolution paleoclimate and zooarchaeological data, this project will provide insight into human-environmental interactions during a key period in the later stages of human development. The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduates at a majority-minority institution, as well as supporting graduate student training at a second university. Given the importance of deep-time perspectives to current discussions about climate change, results will be disseminated to the public via popular science articles and by public lectures.<br/><br/>With deposits spanning from the Middle Paleolithic through the Epipaleolithic (~71-21,000 years ago), this research examines caves that serves as an ideal natural laboratory for exploring questions relating to human-environmental interaction in the strategic region that facilitated inter-continental human and cultural exchanges. The project will combine traditional zooarchaeological analysis with the isotopic analysis of key prey species (gazelle and fallow deer) and plant waxes (n-alkanes) deriving from archaeological sediments. The combined datasets will provide a high-resolution reconstruction of paleoclimatic conditions. The data also provide a unique opportunity to document shifts in human subsistence behavior and landscape use throughout the Last Glacial. This will facilitate the evaluation of hypotheses about behavioral differences between Neanderthals and modern humans, while also providing new insights into the nature of human responses to the Last Glacial Maximum, a particularly active and challenging period of climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A serial robot is like a human arm. It consists of a series of rigid rod-like objects (analogous to human upper arm and forearm) and consecutively interconnected through joints (like an elbow).  Serial robots are relatively compact in size and are easy to operate. Thus, serial robots are widely used in industrial automation, space exploration, medical services and many other applications. However, use of serial robots is quite limited in settings with restricted space to move and harsh environmental conditions. Space limitations dictate that robotic structures must be small, compact, and strong at the same time. These requirements are difficult to achieve with current robotics designs containing motors at their joints. While harsh conditions, such as heat or chemical exposure, can damage the electronic components and actuators directly installed on robotic joints. The fully cable-driven robot considered in this project will provide a potential solution to these two challenges. This design will situate electronic components and motors/actuators far away from any harsh elements and utilize cables/wires to transmit the power. However, the joints of a cable-driven serial robot are coupled by the cable transmission, and as such, the rotation of one robotic joint affects the motion of the other joints, making precise position control extremely challenging.  This award supports fundamental research that will identify solutions for overcoming motion coupling issues in cable-driven serial robots, modeling the unique dynamics, and building a controller suitable for enabling this dynamic modeling. The knowledge acquired through this research will significantly enhance fundamental understanding of the control dynamics in complex coupling mechanisms and support more widespread use of cable-driven serial robots.  The research team?s partnership with medical equipment industry will expand societal benefits of this work to medical robotics, thus advancing US economic prosperity and well-being. This robotics research will also help to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research, positively impact engineering education, and prepare students with industrial workforce skills.<br/><br/>The knowledge gained through this research will improve the understanding of cable-driven actuation in serial robots, generate a method to realize the self-decoupling of the cable transmission, and create a paradigm for modeling and controlling cable-driven serial robots. In particular, the work (1) will evaluate the hypothesis that coupling can counter coupling to realize motion decoupling, and develop an advanced self-decoupling mechanism based on this hypothesis; (2) will model the robotic dynamics and build a force-position integrated controller for high-performance control; and (3) will prototype a robot based on this research to perform evaluation analysis. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, Mo alloys have several inherent drawbacks such as low ductility and a tendency of oxidation and cracking, which are adversely augmented when they are produced by additive manufacturing, due to non-equilibrium processing phenomena. This results in several complex technical blockades that hinder a broader adoption of additive manufacturing of Mo alloys in the industry. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims at fundamental research of wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) for Mo alloy structures, and will explore and elucidate the root causes of processing defects and their effects on part thermomechanical performance. If successful, the research will directly impact the Nation?s economic welfare and energy security. For example, the energy efficiency of land-based power plants could be improved and their carbon footprint decreased by using Mo alloys for turbine blades. In addition, the project will enhance the existing manufacturing curricula with data analytics components, provide undergraduate/graduate student with internship opportunities at national laboratories, and run hands-on manufacturing experiences for K-12 students. The outreach activities will enhance the education and training of next-generation STEM leaders in advanced manufacturing and foster inclusions of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The overarching research goal of this CAREER award is to understand the underlying mechanisms of process-induced residual stresses as well as pore generation and investigate thermomechanical performances of WAAM processed Mo-alloy structures, focusing on titanium-zirconium-molybdenum alloys. The core research challenges lie on the lack of data in the physicochemical properties and complex defects development from non-equilibrium thermal cycles in layer-by-layer stacking. A combination of computational and physics-informed, data-driven models will be pursued for process understanding with experimental verifications and validations, including multi-scale material characterizations, process imaging and fatigue testing, etc. The research is expected to gain fundamental knowledge of the residual stress development and pore formation while considering the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, and elucidate the deformation behaviors and thermomechanical performances from room to elevated temperatures, as correlated with heterogeneous microstructures, pores and oxidation. In addition, the project intends to establish a quantitative relationship between the process, signature, microstructure, property and performance, called the ?design rule,? for WAAM that will ensure satisfactory fabrications of refractory alloy structures. The linkage may serve as an effective tool to potentially tailor microstructures and properties of WAAM structures with controlled and improved thermomechanical performance of final products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project will leverage big data and computer models to develop a new wildfire evacuation planning approach that can incorporate part-time residents and transient populations and take into account different evacuation scenarios. Research outputs will be shared with community stakeholders to improve local wildfire evacuation plans. The knowledge generated in this project will help evacuation researchers and practitioners better use big data and the newest wildfire evacuation modeling techniques to improve wildfire public safety.

Since the 1980s, researchers who study streams have developed theories about how stream ecosystems work.  Each theory is different, but they all focus on a single physical aspect of streams that is thought to best explain how stream ecosystem structure and function vary from one place to another. Physical factors that have been considered include stream size, floods, and climate. However, the body of work informing the development of these theories, and the body of work supporting them, is based on research from streams that flow continuously, or ""perennial streams."" Given that half of the Earth's streams are intermittent, there is a need to develop a new theory for streams that explains how drying acts as a control on stream ecosystem structure and function, how intermittent and perennial streams are different, and how those differences vary from region to region. This project uses macrosystems ecology as a foundation to develop and test such a theory that can be applied to all the Earth's streams. A smartphone app will map wet and dry stream reaches in conjunction with international research partners (1000 Intermittent Rivers Project), and citizen science organizers, and educational partners to create new teaching tools.  The research may help inform decisions on water use where streams and intermittent and human populations are increasing.  Seven graduate student will be included on the diverse research team.  <br/><br/>This research project is comprised of three components. The first is a three-year field study of intermittent and continuously flowing streams in 10 different regions across the southern, central, and western US led by researchers at five different US universities that will collect streamflow and biological data. The field study will be focused on investigating how macroinvertebrate communities in intermittent and perennial streams differ in species composition and abundance, and how these differences vary according to climate. In 9 of the 10 regions, the researchers will use National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) collected data, and sampling will follow NEON sampling protocols to generate NEON-compatible data. The second component will develop fine-scale hydrological models of the study watersheds using the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model. These models will predict where and when streams dry in these watersheds, and researchers will model streamflow patterns under different scenarios related to sea surface temperature oscillations and other changes. The third component of the project will generate spatial models that integrate the empirically collected ecological data in the field with the hydrological model outputs. This part of the project will investigate how large-scale climate oscillations (e.g. El Nino Southern Oscillation) influence regional drying patterns differently, and how shifts in spatial drying patterns influence stream ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For select cancer patients, immunotherapies can serve as a cure by reactivating their natural immune systems to fight against their cancers. Unfortunately, cancers are often mutated to evade the small library of currently approved immunotherapies. Many promising experimental small molecule immunotherapies cannot be used because they cannot effectively accumulate in cancer sites at high enough concentrations and often cause severe side effects through off-target damage to healthy organs. Antibodies can be used to help shuttle drugs directly to cancer sites but are currently limited. This project advances a novel technology that increases antibody drug loading over an order of magnitude, up to 100 drugs per antibody. These novel Antibody Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs) will enable immunotherapies to treat notoriously immunotherapy resistant cancers, such as colorectal cancer.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the next-generation of Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) immunotherapies through the research and development of Antibody-Brush polymer Conjugates (ABCs). Due to limited chemical handles, ADCs have low drug loadings that force the use of cytotoxic drug payloads like auristatins that cause severe adverse events in patients. This project will develop conjugation techniques that will lead to ABCs with drug-antibody ratios as high as 100. Brush polymers, through a combination of PEG shielding and targeted drug release, enable this higher drug loading that will lead to both greater efficacy against low expression antigen targets in cancer and application of drugs with more diverse mechanisms of action. Specifically, this project will create libraries of ABCs loaded with immunostimulating molecules like TLR and STING agonists that, despite significant preclinical promise, have stagnated in clinical development due to narrow therapeutic windows and limited targetability. Optimized immunostimulatory ABCs will be evaluated in vivo for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, efficacy, and curative potential in traditionally immunotherapy-resistant colorectal cancer animal models. This SBIR Phase I research will enable further development of the novel immunotherapies into clinical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent networking research has focused on the potential of distributing ML tasks across these increasingly powerful devices. For example, consider smartphones aiming to learn an image recognition capability: rather than centralizing the images in the cloud, the smartphones may each learn local versions of the ML model on their individual images, and the cloud can periodically synchronize these models. However, devices at the network edge often exhibit considerable heterogeneity in their communication and computation capabilities, as well as in the statistical properties across their local datasets, which can lead to significant variations in decision-making quality. The goal of this project is to establish fog learning, a new paradigm that will enable efficient model learning at scale by integrating ML with the orchestration of ?fog? networking resources from the edge to cloud. The findings of this project will be incorporated into an education plan emphasizing the role of ML in shaping future networks, including new undergraduate, graduate, and open online courses augmented with innovative educational technologies promoting student engagement and pathways to research. The investigator also pursues collaborations with industry and interdisciplinary researchers.<br/><br/>The proposed research has two main objectives: (1) establishing an understanding of how different heterogeneous network configurations affect ML performance, and (2) developing methodologies that orchestrate fog networking resources for jointly optimizing model learning and resource efficiency. Investigations are divided into three thrusts. Thrust 1 focuses on optimizing distributed learning across edge networks, by integrating federated model training with intelligent device sampling and data offloading. This will characterize the impact of partial device participation on learning convergence and develop the notion of local dataset diversification. Thrust 2 considers the design of model aggregation stages throughout the fog hierarchy to facilitate device cooperation at different timescales. This will codify the tradeoffs between different architectures for local synchronization, including those in Thrust 1, and lead to adaptive orchestration methodologies. Thrust 3 will investigate performance enhancements to Thrusts 1 and 2 from control over the wireless substrate. This includes cross-layer techniques that unify signal design with model training, and learning architectures for edge subnetwork partitioning. Each thrust will develop new theories and algorithms for optimizing ML over networks and consider innovative ML techniques for solving and enhancing these optimizations.

These eddies, or large ocean whirlpools which can be observed from space, can alter air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide in ways that are not yet fully understood. New observations from autonomous platforms measuring ocean carbon content suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in ocean carbon fluxes which can be linked to these dynamic eddy features. Due to computational and time limitations, ocean eddies are not explicitly represented in most global climate simulations, limiting our ability to understand the role eddies play in the ocean carbon cycle. This study will explore the impact of eddies on ocean carbon content and air-sea carbon dioxide fluxes in the Southern Ocean using both simulated- and observation-based strategies and the findings will improve our understanding of the ocean?s role in the carbon cycle and in global climate. While this work will primarily be focused on the Southern Ocean, the results will be globally applicable.

For the modeling component, the investigators will explore relationships between eddies, ocean carbon content, and air-sea CO2 fluxes within the 1/6-degree resolution Biogeochemical Southern Ocean State Estimate (B-SOSE). They investigators will produce high-resolution composites of the carbon content and physical structure within both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies by region, quantify the influence of these eddies on the overall simulated air-sea CO2 flux, and diagnose the physical mechanisms driving this influence.  For the observational component, the investigators will match eddies observed via satellite altimetry to ocean carbon observations and characterize observed relationships between eddies and ocean carbon content with a focus on Southern Ocean winter observations where light limits biological processes, allowing isolation of the contribution of physical processes.  This work will also provide motivation for higher resolution and better eddy parameterizations in climate models, more mesoscale biogeochemical observations, and integration of satellite sea surface height data into efforts to map air-sea fluxes of CO2.

The case to be examined in the Antarctica region is of global significance because the offshore flowing dense water forms Antarctic Bottom Water and thus affects the global meridional circulation, while the onshore heat transport induced by the return flow drives glacial ice melt and therefore contributes to sea level rise. These important processes will be investigated through a combined laboratory and numerical approach. The project will explore the leading order dynamics controlling the cross-shelf exchange of momentum, heat and tracers when dense water descends a canyon. Key locations to measure dense shelf water offshore transport and offshore water onshore transport will be identified to provide guidance to future field campaigns. This proposal will support the Ph.D. research of a graduate student, and other students will be involved through the PIs? active lab-groups. The experimental work will utilize the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at WHOI. In Years 1 and 3, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Open Week event will target undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, K-12 students. This event will host 10 hands-on demonstrations and displays. Material from this project will be used in educational activities by the Co-PIs. <br/><br/>Preliminary numerical modeling revealed two unexpected flows in the Antarctic coastal region. The first is a current on the continental shelf east of the canyon, which contributes to the cross-shelf exchange by transporting a third of dense water across the shelf-break upstream (from the perspective of the Kelvin wave propagation) of the canyon. The second is the onshore intrusion into the canyon of deep offshore water, some of which is able to reach the coast. The project will combine numerical modeling with laboratory tank experiments to test two hypotheses: first, that a substantial fraction of dense water generated on the shelf over the head of a canyon flows onto the upstream shelf and eventually moves offshore into the slope sea on the upstream side of the canyon; and second, dense water descending down a canyon induces an onshore return flow of deep offshore water in the canyon. It is also hypothesized that this onshore flow originates on the continental slope downstream of the canyon and exits the canyon onto the continental shelf upstream of the canyon. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) will be used to simulate the formation and subsequent transport of Dense Shelf Water (DSW) generated in a coastal region, as well as the motion of ambient water, in an idealized continental shelf and slope system. Idealized laboratory experiments using a rotating glass tank with a very similar set up as the numerical simulations will be used. These experiments will test whether the assumptions and parameterizations used in the numerical model are influencing the dynamics of interest. In addition, agreement between the laboratory and numerical results will provide confidence that the relevant dynamics are correctly captured in the laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the unique properties of nanocomposites, strain sensitivity (i.e., piezoresistive effect) has been commonly observed. High piezoresistive effect of nanocomposites can remarkably benefit strain sensing in SHM, wearable sensors, and robotics, among others. On the other hand, piezoresistive effect can also be undesirable and hinder the applications of nanocomposites as electronic components for flexible displays, energy harvesting, and multimodal sensors. Therefore, the piezoresistive effect of nanocomposites needs to be effectively designed and tuned to optimal ranges depending on target functionality. Current design approaches mostly focus on engineering the material components of nanocomposites, which generally entail empirical and inefficient processes due to the complex process-structure-property relationships of resulting material systems. To address this challenge, this research aims to establish an innovative design strategy based on topological design to engineer the piezoresistive behavior of nanocomposites in a predictable manner. This project will provide hands-on research opportunities to engage students, including first-generation college students, in developing nanomaterial-based electronics. In addition, a new course and several multidisciplinary capstone design projects will be developed based on this research project, which will enrich and improve engineering education. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the correlation between the piezoresistive effect of nanocomposites and topological design by focusing on three research thrusts. First, two main categories of topologies, including stress-concentrating and stress-releasing topologies, will be designed for altering the stress distribution in the material system. Their mechanical responses to external loads will be characterized via finite element analysis and load tests. Second, carbon nanotube-, graphene-, and silver nanowire-based piezoresistive nanocomposites will be fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques and be patterned to form the pre-designed topologies. Electromechanical experiments will be conducted to characterize and compare the piezoresistive response of the patterned nanocomposites. In addition, statistical analysis will be performed to investigate the correlation between the piezoresistive behavior and the topological design. Third, to better understand the piezoresistive performance of patterned nanocomposites, stochastic material models will be developed by statistically reconstructing the microstructures of nanocomposites based on microscopic images. Then, the material models will be used for simulating the electromechanical responses of different topologies. The simulation results will be compared with the experimental measurements. This research will generate new fundamental knowledge on the effects of topological design on the piezoresistive behavior of nanocomposites, which will enhance the design efficiency and performance of nanomaterial-based multifunctional electronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An example of a remarkable property of superfluid is the ability to move without friction, even through holes and channels which are near atomic size. During a series of recent experiments in which the research team studied the motion of superfluid helium through nanometer diameter holes in atomically thin sheets of carbon (graphene), they observed, unexpectedly, that when in the superfluid state, helium appears to be able to move through the carbon sheet even without holes.  The current project probes this observation more thoroughly through a series of experiments.  If they do validate the previous surprising outcome, their team expects this to lead to more advances in experiment and theory which may involve more exotic and as of yet undiscovered states of matter, such as super solids.  More broadly this work is expected to lead to technologically useful quantum devices using this unique quantum material.   This award will be enable the education of young scientists at all stages of education and professional development in the area of quantum devices and ultra-sensitive measurements, both which have been identified as areas of national importance.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Quantum devices based on superfluid helium-4 have not yet been thoroughly developed due to the absence of a low temperature Josephson junction structure.   The difficulty is due to the mass of the helium atom which inhibits quantum tunneling even through atomically thin membranes, and the low temperature coherence length of 0.3 nm which requires atomically sized pores to attenuate the quantum order parameter.  Recently, the Schwab research team performed experiments to probe the transport of superfluid helium through nanometer sized pores in a graphene sheet.  These graphene sheets covered a 2 micron diameter aperture in a silicon nitride membrane. Surprisingly, after a series of measurements, it appeared that graphene sheets were transparent to helium in the superfluid state.  This is contrary to the expectation that graphene should be extremely opaque to the transport of helium.  The current seed project will resolve this question with a series of control experiments.  If it is concluded that graphene is indeed transparent to superfluid helium this may indicate the formation of a super solid state on the first few layers of helium, a possibility which has been anticipated by a number of theorists, and a novel quantum state of matter which has not yet been observed.  If it is concluded that graphene is opaque as was originally expected, the experiments here will inform experiments to create a low temperature Josephson junction for superfluid helium, which is expected to lead to realization of novel quantum devices.

Yet, research on smart homes cannot achieve this vision: it does not investigate how the technology can support patient recovery, nor does it address the complex challenges that can arise when multiple people use a smart space as a workplace and a living space at the same time. Thus, hospital administrators and designers need guidance on what value this technology can provide in their hospital. This project explores how the design of smart hospitals can support (1) patient autonomy and recovery, and (2) the complex, interacting workflows of hospital employees from physicians to custodial staff. The team of researchers will study this by examining how patients, their visitors, and hospital employees currently use hospital rooms that are already equipped with smart home technology and will use those insights to guide the development of new software to improve the usefulness of smart patient rooms. For patients and their families this project will result in rooms that are more comfortable and easier to use and control; in particular, many patients have physical impairments that may amplify the value of these technologies. For hospital employees, it will lead to an improved work environment that better supports them in caring for patients and completing work tasks. For researchers and designers, this will lead to a new understanding of smart spaces beyond smart homes.<br/><br/>The research team will conduct extensive qualitative work including observations, interviews, and log data analysis in a user-centered process to study how the diverse set of stakeholders at this rehabilitation hospital interact with the technology that is deployed in the smart patient rooms, how they are affected by that technology, and how the technology can better support stakeholder needs. This work will also research how patients with physical impairments interact with smart devices as they adjust to their changed, and changing, abilities. The team will analyze this formative work with thematic analysis to develop descriptive models of the stakeholder roles, types of interactions, and value facilitated by the technology. Based on these models, the team will develop and evaluate new software to improve the usefulness of the patient rooms to stakeholders, including the potential to incorporate automation functions into hospital patient rooms and opportunities for the technology integrated into the rooms to better facilitate patient rehabilitation. The work also includes a series of workshops and research engagement activities to provide both research training and develop research capacity at the intersection of human-computer interaction, sensing and artificial intelligence, and accessibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The predominant viewpoints in this literature equates fairness with lack of bias or seeks to achieve some form of statistical parity between demographic groups. By contrast, this project pursues alternative approaches rooted in normative economics, the field that evaluates policies and programs by asking ""what should be"". The work is driven by two observations. First, fairness to individuals and groups can be realized according to people?s preferences represented in the form of utility functions. Second, traditional notions of algorithmic fairness may be at odds with welfare (the overall utility of groups), including the welfare of those groups the fairness criteria intend to protect.  The goal of this project is to establish normative economic approaches as a central tool in the study of fairness in AI. Towards this end the team pursues two research questions.  First, can the perspective of normative economics be reconciled with existing approaches to fairness in AI? Second, how can normative economics be drawn upon to rethink what fairness in AI should be? The project will integrate theoretical and algorithmic advances into real systems used to inform refugee resettlement decisions. The system will be examined from a fairness viewpoint, with the goal of ultimately ensuring fairness guarantees and welfare.<br/><br/>The research plan includes two main directions based on previous work has shown that classifiers incorporating parity-based fairness criteria can be Pareto inefficient.  That is, the welfare of all groups?including the protected group?would be higher under a classifier that is less fair. In the first direction, the project extends this observation to non-convex problems and then from in-processing to post-processing bias mitigation. The planned research will also study the interaction between multiple policy makers and its impact on social goals such as fairness and welfare.  In the second direction, the project develops a new conceptualization in which classifiers are viewed as public resources or goods.  This work then draws on ideas from fair division, a long-established branch of normative economics that defines and applies rigorous notions of fairness, and on the specific notion of the core. To put this idea into practice, there are several challenges that must be addressed: conditions for the existence of classifiers in the core, algorithms for their computation, and generalization from a training set.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet there is no easy or generally acceptable way of measuring preferences from data.  The proposed research develops a portable, scalable, and easy to measure preference revelation (elicitation) method called the Bayesian Adaptive Choice Experiment (BACE).  BACE improves upon existing preference elicitation approaches that are used in policy analysis, regulation, and litigation. The method will be applied to study important and policy-relevant questions:  (i) preferences for job amenities such as workplace flexibility, and firm provision of such amenities---important considerations in the face of global technical and organizational changes.  This is important as global technical and organizational changes have the potential to alter the structure of work as the costs of providing workplace amenities shift over time. (ii) in preferences for public policies, the research produces method of comparing the welfare benefits of various policies for different demographic groups. In addition to these applications, BACE shows the potential for a new generation of surveys and experimental methods to do much more in helping researchers and policymakers value non-market resources.  The results of this research will contribute significantly to improve economic analyses as well as improve the quality of public policies and business decisions and thus increase economic growth.  <br/><br/>BACE provides an efficient dynamic elicitation procedure for conducting choice experiments. It does so by generating the information-maximizing sequence of choice scenarios based on a prior that gets updated with previous answers to obtain individual-level Bayesian posterior estimates. The procedure allows for a higher precision of the parameter estimates with fewer choice scenarios presented to each subject while also overcoming systematic biases in estimating average preference parameters from commonly used static approaches. Applying the method to preferences for job amenities, the resulting individual-level preference data makes it possible to estimate a new model of compensating differentials that extends the classic Rosen (1986) framework.  Applying BACE to willingness to pay for public policies produces new evidence on the correlates of policy preferences and leads to novel estimates of the Marginal Value of Public Funds. The implementation of BACE in this research is a step forward in allowing such procedures to be widely adopted to measure important inputs for understanding a broad range of phenomena in social sciences.  The results of this research will contribute significantly to improve economic analyses as well as improve the quality of public policies and business decisions and thus increase economic growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While warming may lead to increased growth in forests limited by short, cold growing seasons, climate change could also lead to surprises. One example is a decoupling between temperature variability and annual growth rates in boreal forest trees that has been detected over the past few decades. This ?divergence problem? suggests that tree growth in some arctic forest systems is no longer limited by temperature. The causes are not well understood and can be hard to test due to other factors impacting growth, such as drought due to the warming climate. This project will test for divergence across the treeline forests of northern North America, especially in rapidly warming regions of Alaska and northwestern Canada. The investigators will use tree-ring records obtained from the wood of ancient trees, a combination of mathematical methods and modeling, and wood anatomy analysis, to better understand forest growth patterns related to divergence. Broader Impacts: New measurements are critical if we are to understand how boreal forests interact with the atmosphere and feedback with other features of the global environment. This project will contribute to this understanding by estimating relationships between climate and forest growth using tree rings at sites spanning many northern locations. The project provides funding for students, Native American citizens, and for teachers to take part in Arctic research.<br/><br/>The rapid warming of the Arctic is expected to impact profoundly northern forest systems. While warming may lead to greater productivity and growth in forests typically limited by short, cold growing seasons, the speed and magnitude of climate change could also lead to surprises. One example is a decoupling between temperature variability and annual growth rates in boreal forest trees that has been detected at forest sites since the middle of the twentieth century. This phenomenon, known as the ?divergence problem?, suggests that tree growth in some Arctic forest systems is no longer primarily limited by temperature. The causes are not well understood and have been difficult to test due to the co-varying biological, physiological, and environmental factors potentially impacting recent tree growth. One hypothesis is that once warming has surpassed a physiological threshold, drought stress limits growth.  Another hypothesis is  ?global dimming?, in which increased atmospheric aerosols decrease the amount of solar radiation available for photosynthesis. This project will assess current divergence hypotheses across the treeline forests of northern North America, emphasizing rapidly warming regions of Alaska and northwestern Canada, which appear to be key areas for divergence-type effects. The project will leverage a new, large compilation of tree-ring data (already in hand) and update key locations that have shown early evidence of unusual growth decline despite recent warming. Detection of recent changes in growth parameters will use a novel, integrated combination of statistical techniques, quantitative wood anatomy methods, and tree growth modeling to develop a detailed assessment of the extent, causes, and carbon cycle implications of divergence. Broader Impacts: New measurements of boreal forest dynamics are critical for understanding how boreal systems interact with the changing atmosphere and the feedbacks between coupled earth system domains. This project will contribute to this understanding by developing quantitative estimates of climate/growth interactions at daily to centennial time scales and spatial scales from cellular to continental, yielding valuable, novel data for modeling of environmental change and productivity in northern forests. The project provides three years of support for a graduate student, funding for high school curricular development and courses in native educational settings, and fieldwork-based opportunities for a teacher to take part in hands-on Arctic research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the flow of glacial ice at depth in the margins of fast-flowing ice, where the ice is near its pressure melting point, depends on the fraction of liquid water stored in the network of veins at ice-grain boundaries. It is therefore critical to understand the permeability of these systems. The goal of this project is to better understand controls on ice permeability through tests on laboratory ice and glacier ice. Experiments with laboratory ice will inform on how grain size and water content affect permeability, while experiments with glacier ice will examine how deformation of the ice affects permeability. Results of these experiments will provide a better understanding of permeability of ice near its pressure melting point as a function of grain size, water content, and deformation. The experiments are not intended to simulate interstitial water flow in a glacier. This project includes graduate and undergraduate participation and seeks to include a participant from the PolarTREC program to engage students in K-12 classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will measure for the first time the permeability of temperate ice as a function of its grain size, water content, and foliation. The team will use a falling-head permeameter designed and tested for this application. A disk of ice, 140 mm in diameter and up to 70 mm thick, is kept under pressure and at the pressure-melting temperature while chilled water transiently flows through the disk under a head that is allowed to decrease with time. The rate of head decrease provides the permeability value. Different water contents will be achieved by varying the salinity of the ice and will be measured with a calorimetric method used successfully in prior ice-deformation experiments. Chilled water introduced to ice disks will contain fluorescein dye to allow flow networks to be studied in thin-sections after experiments.  Experiments with glacier ice, collected from shallow cores at Athabasca Glacier, Alberta, will evaluate the effect of ice foliation style and orientation on permeability. These measurements may also point to differences between permeability of lab-made and glacier ice that are unrelated to structural anisotropy. Results of these experiments will provide the first test of permeability models based on Poiseuille flow of water though idealized vein networks. These untested models are the primary basis for estimating ice permeability in glacier flow models. New empirically-grounded permeability models resulting from this project will allow the water content of temperate portions of ice-stream shear margins to be estimated, thereby improving models of ice softening by water and associated ice-flow kinematics in shear margins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this project is to develop and apply new understanding of high-time-resolution Arctic records of methane and carbon monoxide. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and carbon monoxide is linked to the atmospheric lifetime of other greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide. Thus, developing reliable records of both gases is important for understanding past and future atmospheric chemistry and radiative forcing. High-depth-resolution records of carbon monoxide, and to a lesser extent methane,  in Arctic ice cores show evidence of non-atmospheric anomalies that are poorly understood. One potential source of such anomalies is biological activity within the ice. Microbes can be active at temperatures well below freezing, and ice cores are subjected to relatively warm temperatures after the ice is extracted from glaciers and ice sheets while they are stored or transported prior to measurement. Special sample handling protocols will be used to evaluate the effects of post-collection ice temperature on methane and carbon monoxide production, and potentially allow development of methane and carbon monoxide records over recent centuries that are free from any artifacts. Funding will support early career investigators, graduate students and undergraduate students who will be involved in field work, laboratory analysis, and data interpretation. The investigators will involve undergraduates from underrepresented groups to foster diversity in earth sciences. Public outreach will be achieved through public lectures, lab tours, and media interactions. <br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to (1) investigate the rate and timing of temperature-dependent in situ biological production of carbon monoxide and methane in an Arctic ice core, (2) develop records of atmospheric carbon monoxide and methane spanning recent centuries that are free of in situ production artifacts, and (3) determine the roles that ice impurity concentration and microbial community structure play in situ gas production. To accomplish these goals, a 150-meter ice core will be collected at Summit, Greenland using the large-diameter Blue Ice Drill. To address goal (1), successive measurements of carbon monoxide and methane will be made in the field on eight parallel longitudinal samples from a 12 meter-long section of the core, with the different samples consistently stored and monitored at temperatures ranging from well below the -31 °C ice sheet temperature at Summit to well above the -26 °C cell vitrification temperature where cellular metabolism is possible. For goal (2), measurements of these two gases will be made in the field on ice that has been kept consistently at -40 °C after extraction. For goal (3), a portion of the entire ice core will be returned to the U.S. for microbial analyses, measurements of a range of elements and chemical species using a well-established, NSF-funded continuous ice core analytical system, and continuous carbon monoxide and methane measurements to complement the field measurements. Microbiological analysis will be conducted on ice samples characterized by high and low in situ gas anomalies to determine what microbes are present that may be responsible for creating the observed gas artifacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot precisely control their exhaust after-treatment systems due to the lack of widely deployable sensors that can differentiate between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other species in the exhaust stream.  This project advances a novel on-board sensor for detecting NOx in diesel exhaust streams with sensitivities and molecular specificity unmatched by existing technologies. It can result in 10% greater fuel efficiency while matching new stringent NOx emissions standards. Fleet-wide fuel economy improvements and NOx emissions reductions enabled by this technology will lead to reduced carbon emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and acid rain.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project advances a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments, all while maintaining a form factor similar to those used in existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based NO sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cell architecture seeks to ensure safety while enabling a significant improvement in the energy density.  The teams also seeks to lower the costs of the lithium-ion batteries by eliminating extrinsic costs associated with thermal management and explosion containment.  Safe, easy-to-manufacture electrolytes may alter the rate of electrification of the global economy. The next generation of battery powered medical devices, a large proportion of which are manufactured in the United States, may also benefit from the adoption of the new solid electrolyte. In addition, the proposed composite solid electrolyte aims to enable new cell architectures with significantly higher energy densities than what has been possible in liquid electrolyte systems to date.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a non-flammable, high-conductivity composite, solid-state battery electrolytes that are compatible with mixed metal oxide cathode chemistries and cell manufacturing processes. The morphology of the composite electrolyte is such that it offsets disadvantages present in polymer electrolytes, as well as inorganic sulfide and oxide solid electrolytes, when they are used as monolithic materials. The unique heterostructures of the proposed solid electrolytes advance the current state-of-the-art by enabling faster diffusion of lithium ions through multiple pathways, while mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. The electrolyte's nonflammable nature makes it a potential replacement for conventional liquid electrolytes in reducing fire hazards and reducing the costs of reqired thermal protection systems in lithium-ion batteries. The compatibility with lithium metal presents a unique opportunity for improvement in the energy density over currently used silicon-graphite anodes, that translates to a lower cost per unit of stored energy ($/kWh). An additional advantage is that these batteries do not require special handling and they are compatible with both spiral wound and planar battery form factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships (through 4 cohorts of 6 students each) to twenty-four (24)  unique high-achieving, low-income undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, and environmental science at the University. The project will support students through a combination of financial assistance and curricular and co-curricular support. Scholars will be selected during their first academic year and will be financially supported throughout the three remaining years of their undergraduate education. Additional support will include opportunities for students to carry out team-based, student-driven research projects under the mentorship of faculty. The students also will participate in direct workforce experiences by engaging in the planning and execution of a service-learning project. The combination of these components will enable students to build self-efficacy in the STEM arena and to develop meaningful relationships and networks among peers, faculty, the community, and industry. <br/><br/>To increase retention, STEM degree completion, and workforce placement of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need, the project will pursue several goals. First is to implement evidence-based, high impact pedagogical techniques and innovative vocational components for supporting student personal growth, synergistic team building, and academic and career pathways to success. Second is to study through mixed-methods project evaluation the effectiveness of the combination of strategies. Third is to contribute to the knowledge base to help guide other colleges to implement similar programs successfully. Fourth is to integrate student research, service learning, and community partnerships to improve career preparation and job placement, directly filling needs in the region. To reach project goals, the investigators will embrace the theoretical basis that, regardless of race, gender, or income status, students need to feel a sense of belonging to have academic and career success within the STEM arena. In connection to this, the project will provide a supportive environment for scholarly growth and sense of belonging in the sciences to prepare students for success in their STEM careers. The intellectual merit of this unique combination of research and vocational skill development within a collaborative community in the sciences will provide a stronger STEM population and workforce, and will further increase STEM-based relationships throughout the broader community. This project will be evaluated through multiple mixed-methods measures that will be integrated at different points during the duration of this project. Student?s research and service-learning projects will be disseminated at various conferences and through publications. Insights and outcomes from emanating from project evaluation will generate new knowledge on which aspects of the project's support interventions, or combination of interventions, are most effective for retention, engagement, academic performance, and overall success of students.

At the same time, community colleges (CCs) as well as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have consistently graduated Black engineers at comparatively much higher rates. In addition, in previous studies, Black engineering undergraduates who initially enroll in CCs have reported positive experiences when transferring to HBCUs. This suggests that CC-to-HBCU pathways may be an overlooked opportunity for graduating more Black engineers. Building on this evidence, this CAREER project will assemble stakeholders from CCs and HBCUs to collaboratively develop a shared vision for maximizing the potential of these pathways. This project will: 1) Collect baseline data on the current state of trends, challenges, and opportunities in the CC-HBCU engineering infrastructure; 2) Document the steps that CCs and HBCUs undertake to move toward this shared vision; 3) Explore evolving processes as CCs and HBCUs develop and execute strategies to optimize these pathways. This project will result in a novel framework to help HBCUs, other minority-serving institutions, and PWIs partner with CCs to find innovative solutions for broadening participation in engineering. From an education perspective, the study will also produce modules developed from the framework that offer guidance on how four-year HBCUs and other four-year schools can better partner with CCs to improve Black engineering student pathways. In addition, the project will position faculty, staff, and administrators as leaders in improving these pathways by guiding them through workshops focused on collective impact and institutional change.<br/><br/>Despite the advancement in understanding the CC to four-year engineering college pathway for students, few scholars have explored the potential of CCs and four-year HBCUs to work together to maximize Black engineering student persistence, transfer, and graduation rates. This CAREER project addresses this gap by centering CCs and HBCUs as leaders in educating future Black engineers, and will leverage the collective strengths that each type of institution individually brings to broadening participation efforts. Participants will include faculty, staff, and/or administrators representing the 15 engineering degree-granting HBCUs, as well as their feeder CCs. Using an action research approach that is grounded in collective impact and Kezar?s theoretical frameworks on institutional change, my research objectives will involve the collection and analysis of: 1) Descriptive statistics that establish the current state of CC to HBCU engineering pathways, including trends, challenges, and opportunities in this space; 2) Focus group and observational data that document how participants collaborate to articulate and refine a shared vision for maximizing the potential of these pathways; 3) Focus group and observational data that document CC-HBCU collaborative efforts during interventions at select sites during this project. The educational objectives of this project are to: 1) Inform participants of promising practices drawn from other studies that focus on engineering CCs, transfer, and retention; 2) Introduce collective impact to faculty, staff, and administrators as a tool for maximizing collaborations in the CC-HBCU context; and 3) Develop an organizational framework that other engineering institutions, including other minority-serving institutions and predominately White institutions, can use in collaboration with CCs to increase Black engineering student enrollment and graduation. The long-term goal will be to test the capacity of this framework in future studies to increase the number of Black and other underrepresented students who first enroll in CCs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different types of pollution, however, can reduce water quality and harm the plants, animals, and people that depend on water to live. Specifically, recent wildfires across the U.S. may reduce water quality in several ways. For example, ash from wildfires can end up in lakes and rivers, potentially harming aquatic organisms and drinking water supplies. In this project, a group of researchers will study water quality of northern Minnesota lakes after the 2021 Greenwood Fire. This wildfire burned a large part of Superior National Forest in fall 2021, including areas near 28 lakes. The researchers expect that after spring snowmelt or rain, ash and large pieces of burned plants will wash into these lakes and reduce water quality. They will visit lakes five times from spring to late summer of 2022 to document any water quality changes following the Greenwood Fire. Results of this study will help water managers in Minnesota and elsewhere predict how water quality in lakes and reservoirs may change after future wildfires. This project will also help people who live near lakes understand how the water activities they care about, such as fishing and boating, may be affected by future wildfires.<br/><br/>Although wildfire activity is increasing across the U.S. and concern is mounting over fire effects on water resources, few studies have documented fire effects on lake ecosystems. At 10844 ha in size, the 2021 Greenwood Fire in Superior National Forest was the largest lightning-caused Minnesota wildfire in 10 years and covered all or parts of 28 lake watersheds through October 2021. This project assembled an integrative group of aquatic ecosystem, landscape, and fire ecologists to study the physical, chemical, and biological responses of northern Minnesota lakes to the Greenwood Fire. The researchers hypothesized that (1) lake responses will vary proportionally to the percent watershed burned and between drainage vs. isolated lakes and (2) post-fire temporal trajectories will vary according to major hydrologic events (e.g., snowmelt, precipitation). Both hypotheses are being tested using Bayesian approaches (i.e., information theoretic modeling and model choice procedures). Approximately 15 lakes are being sampled each in (1) burned and (2) unburned control watersheds beginning after spring snowmelt, a critical time for the delivery of nutrients and materials from the burned landscape to lakes, and throughout summer 2022.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Robb of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is advancing the understanding of the chemical reactivity of mechanophores embedded within long chain macromolecules or polymers.  Mechanophores are organic compounds that undergo chemical transformations in response to external mechanical force.  When incorporated into polymer chains, they can act as sensors and provide valuable information about the behavior of polymers under stress.  This characteristic of mechanophores is important in guiding future design of stimuli-responsive polymers with applications in a variety of areas including adhesives, sensors, drug delivery, and sustainability.  In this research, experimental and computational techniques will be used to systematically study the chemistry of mechanophores that change color when exposed to stress.  Reactivity will be analyzed and correlated with the chemical structure of the mechanophore to understand and control response when exposed to external stress.  The synthesized molecules will be incorporated into polymers to design unique responsive materials that change color under stress.  Several educational initiatives will be integrated with the research to broaden participation and enable training of undergraduate and graduate students in polymer chemistry, as well as physical and synthetic organic chemistry.  Summer research experiences will support the scientific development of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups majoring in chemistry.  In addition, a hands-on polymer mechanochemistry module will be integrated into K-12 outreach programs in collaboration with the Center for Learning, Teaching, and Outreach at Caltech.  This activity will engage numerous members of the Pasadena community each year and introduce important concepts related to polymers and materials chemistry.  Lastly, a webinar series will be developed to educate students about the different career paths available in chemistry to help to build the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This research will focus on the development of an improved mechanistic understanding of the mechanochemical reactivity of naphthopyran mechanophores. Comprehensive mechanistic and activity studies will be performed to determine the effect of substituents on the mechanochemical ring-opening reaction of naphthopyran by establishing linear free energy relationships.  These studies will be complemented by computation to provide detailed insights into the mechanism of merocyanine formation under force.  Additionally, the Robb team will work toward developing a detailed understanding of force-coupled merocyanine isomerization, which is a critical component of naphthopyran mechanochemistry.  An improved fundamental understanding of structure-reactivity relationships in these systems would serve to guide the development of bis-naphthopyran mechanophores that achieve distinct ring-opening reactions under varying mechanical loads in polymers, leading to different merocyanine states with uniquely coupled visual responses.

These eddies, or large ocean whirlpools which can be observed from space, can alter air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide in ways that are not yet fully understood. New observations from autonomous platforms measuring ocean carbon content suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in ocean carbon fluxes which can be linked to these dynamic eddy features. Due to computational and time limitations, ocean eddies are not explicitly represented in most global climate simulations, limiting our ability to understand the role eddies play in the ocean carbon cycle. This study will explore the impact of eddies on ocean carbon content and air-sea carbon dioxide fluxes in the Southern Ocean using both simulated- and observation-based strategies and the findings will improve our understanding of the ocean?s role in the carbon cycle and in global climate. While this work will primarily be focused on the Southern Ocean, the results will be globally applicable. The researchers will also broaden interest in physical and chemical oceanography among middle school-age girls in the University of South Florida?s Oceanography Camp for Girls by augmenting existing lessons with computational methods in oceanography. <br/><br/>This project aims to quantify the impacts of mesoscale eddy processes on ocean carbon content and air-sea carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes in the Southern Ocean. For the modeling component, the investigators will explore relationships between eddies, ocean carbon content, and air-sea CO2 fluxes within the 1/6-degree resolution Biogeochemical Southern Ocean State Estimate (B-SOSE). They investigators will produce high-resolution composites of the carbon content and physical structure within both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies by region, quantify the influence of these eddies on the overall simulated air-sea CO2 flux, and diagnose the physical mechanisms driving this influence.  For the observational component, the investigators will match eddies observed via satellite altimetry to ocean carbon observations and characterize observed relationships between eddies and ocean carbon content with a focus on Southern Ocean winter observations where light limits biological processes, allowing isolation of the contribution of physical processes.  This work will also provide motivation for higher resolution and better eddy parameterizations in climate models, more mesoscale biogeochemical observations, and integration of satellite sea surface height data into efforts to map air-sea fluxes of CO2.

Reference models of oceanic crust use the speed at which seismic waves travel through the Earth (i.e., seismic velocity) as their main parameter. However, current models use primarily compressional seismic waves (waves that vibrate in the same direction as they travel). This project will build a shear velocity (waves that vibrate at right angles to the direction of travel) reference model for oceanic crust and upper mantle. The model will be derived from data collected in 2012 across the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate offshore Oregon and Washington. Crustal ages in this region vary from 0 to 9 million years. This model will provide a reference framework to interpret ocean crust properties in terms of composition, modification by magmatic activity, and extent of deformation, alteration, and fracturing. The model can also be used to quantify the amount of water in oceanic crust entering deep-sea trenches that influence natural hazards such as megathrust earthquakes and arc volcanism at subduction zones. This project will support a postdoctoral investigator and a graduate student. By making use of existing seismic datasets, this project will also leverage previous investments in marine seismic acquisition.<br/><br/>The 2012 ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) dataset includes high-quality recordings of converted waves that can be exploited to constrain shear-wave (S) velocity structure through the sediments, crust, and uppermost mantle at a plate scale from the Juan de Fuca Ridge near-axis region to the Cascadia deformation front, encompassing crustal ages from 0 to ~9 Ma. This dataset will be used to: (1) Constrain S-wave velocity structure in the shallowmost igneous crust by modeling the amplitude vs. offset of compressional (P) and P-to-S reflections from the basement and performing advanced pseudo-1D nonlinear Bayesian waveform inversion of OBS data based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and time-domain elastic finite-difference simulation of P-Sv wave propagation. (2) Advanced processing of the OBS records using the theory of supervirtual refraction interferometry for improving the signal-to-noise ratio and detectability of mantle refracted S waves. (3) Conduct traveltime tomography modeling of the 2-D S-wave velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle along the Ridge-to-Trench transects using wide-angle crustal and mantle refracted/reflected P-to-S converted phases. (4) Investigate the azimuthal anisotropic character of the crustal and mantle S-wave velocity structure. The results will be interpreted in terms of hydrothermal alteration and porosity in-filling due to mineral precipitation within the crust and mantle as a function of age using effective medium theory. The final deliverable product of this project will be a reference model describing the shear-wave structure of oceanic crust and uppermost mantle for crustal ages of 0-9 Ma built from synthesizing the project?s results and integrating them with existing results from other seismic experiments in the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To answer this question, PI Stuart will study 20,000 years of evolution in a fossilized lineage of Three spine Stickleback fish (Gasterosteus doryssus). Stuart will measure characteristics of the early population and test whether that information allows one to predict the evolution observed by the end of the population?s trajectory. Being able to make predictions about evolution is highly relevant as it relates to pandemic forecasting, the design of medicines for infectious disease and cancer, as well as predicting how agriculture and agricultural pests will respond to human activity. As such, this project has relevance to national health, prosperity, and welfare. <br/><br/>Using a museum collection of fossil G. doryssus, Stuart will measure 19 anatomical traits from ~4,500 fish sampled at a continuity, resolution, and length of time rarely available in studies of living or extinct species. Because Stuart is observing evolution directly in a single lineage through time, the ancestral form is known. Thus, Stuart can better ask about rates of evolutionary change, how selection shaped evolutionary trends, how ancestral trait correlations constrained evolution, and whether a constraint itself evolved. This study organism has the added strength of being a stickleback and part of a family whose evolution, ecology, genetics, and development have been thoroughly studied in living populations. As such, Stuart can place observed change in G. doryssus into a broader biological context to better answer whether macroevolution is microevolution predictably writ large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of centromeres in genome inheritance has long been recognized, but their properties, organization, and variability have remained mysterious. Indeed, despite the ?complete sequencing? of the human genome more than a decade ago, it was only recently that the first assembly of a human centromere was completed. This advance is now allowing researchers to harness this sequence information to tackle fundamental questions on centromere properties and behavior. The proposed Gordon Research Seminar and Conference will stimulate discussions to consider how the field will need to build upon centromere DNA sequence information towards understanding the increasing complexity in structure and function. This conference will act as an important catalyst for the centromere field to generate a unique conceptual framework to address these questions, together with tools and technologies that combine genome, computational and bioinformatics approaches, and complementary functional biological studies at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. The Broader Impacts of effort include the intrinsic merit of the research as all eukaryotic cells rely on centromeres during cell division. In addition, training and networking opportunities will be provided for the next generation of researchers. <br/><br/>Proper centromere function requires a complex cascade of biochemical events to direct chromatin and kinetochore assembly and involves hundreds of different proteins. However, the precise mechanisms that integrate the genetic and biochemical events leading to functional centromeres are still largely unknown. Kinetochore formation during mitosis depends upon the specialized centromeric chromatin in which histone H3 nucleosomes are replaced with nucleosomes containing the centromeric histone Centromere Protein A (CENP-A). Failure to load CENP-A into centromeres each cell cycle ultimately leads to centromere loss, kinetochore failure, chromosome mis-segregation and cell death. Defects in centromere function and the resulting chromosome segregation errors lead to chromosome aneuploidy, a hallmark of many afflictions. Over the past decade, centromere researchers have identified some of the key factors that control centromere protein assembly and the epigenetic maintenance of centromeric chromatin. However, we lack a clear understanding of how these factors come together to generate centromeres at a specific locus through each cell division cycle and this conference and associated seminar will bring together researchers to discuss strategic directions that are needed to advance our understanding of this important region of the genome.<br/>This conference is co-sponsored by the Cellular Dynamics and Function together with the Genetic Mechanisms program, both within the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this lens, the exploitation of land is based on the exploitation of people, and the regeneration of land depends on the regeneration of people. BIPOC farmers and food system actors have formed regional urban and regional sustainability networks. These networks aim to reconnect farmers with rural land after generations of slavery, genocide, displacement, and exclusion, and are committed to feeding poor urban populations with healthy, fresh food with these efforts. While these networks have achieved a remarkable level of organizing and institution-building using a grassroots approach, they have not received either funding and/or other support types that have propelled other policy networks into higher levels of integration and organization. The activities of this planning grant will provide this support to secure these networks access to regional land for food, water, and energy innovation and give them the freedom to vision regeneration goals 25+ years into the future.<br/><br/>Partnering with the Northeast Farmers of Color Land Trust (NEFOC) and Black Farmer Fund (BFF), this research team will work collaboratively with stakeholders in the NEFOC service area to co-design and build a network and framework for a Collective Impact (CI) model. Methods include building on surveys completed by NEFOC and BFF, convening focus groups, and conducting interviews within the collective impact framework to create a common agenda for the networks using a structured form of collaboration. The goal is to develop new knowledge about the factors that support sustainable regional systems, understand the ways in which BIPOC policy networks foster those systems, and determine the key assets and gaps to creating more collective power in those systems for long-term sustainability. This project invests in BIPOC sustainability policy networks advancing a reparative socio-ecological framework to advance BIPOC networks into higher levels of integration and organization, increase their capacity for land sovereignty, and support long-term strategic planning for sustainable regional systems. In addition, these BIPOC networks pose novel, integrative visions, which incorporate ecology, culture, spirituality, history, and geography. Outcomes from the research will provide opportunities to address entrenched legacies of racial injustice and trauma, while repairing BIPOC relationships with the land and restoring regional ecosystems. Strengthening BIPOC sustainability policy networks is foundational to building healthy communities while improving strategies for protecting regional ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meiotic recombination is a process that determines how parental chromosomes pair up and generate crossovers during sexual reproduction in order to reciprocally exchange genetic material. This makes one individual different from another due to the new and unique combination of alleles. However, breeders rarely know which sex direction of artificial pollination to choose in order to obtain the alleles they need. In order to help breeders determine the direction of pollination that will most enhance their breeding, this project will compare the frequency of meiotic recombination between male and female in corn to understand whether and how meiotic recombination differs between the sexes. The data generated in this project will be used to develop two bioinformatics courses for undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in big data science and advanced plant science. To broaden project impact, a 5-day ?Bioinformatics in Plant Science? summer workshop with an emphasis on programming skills and cutting edge technologies will be held annually to train graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. Additionally, high school science teachers will be involved in this project to help them develop science projects for high school curriculum.<br/><br/>Recombination has been widely recognized for its role in promoting genetic diversity and largely impacts the efficiency of plant breeding. While enormous progress has been made to decipher the molecular mechanisms of meiotic recombination, how genetic and epigenetic factors are involved in this complicated process, and whether and how recombination differs between male and female meioses in maize are still poorly understood. This project seeks to investigate the meiotic recombination during male and female meioses by using the hybrids of parents of the maize nested association mapping (NAM) population with the reference line B73. These NAM lines were selected to compare male and female meioses because they maximize genetic diversity of the entire maize population. We will first identify the lines that show largest differences with respect to recombination frequency between sexes (Aim 1) and will generate high resolution recombination maps of these lines to compare crossovers between sexes at global and local scales (Aim 2). To determine the causes of such differences between sexes, we aim to elucidate genetic and epigenetic factors important for regulation and control of meiotic recombination (Aim 3). In addition to using the NAM hybrids, a mutant in a RNA directed DNA methylation pathway will be used to particularly dissect the roles of epigenetic modifications in meiotic recombination (Aim 3).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both research and teaching will be supported by mentors in our laboratory and in their classrooms, where most students come from underrepresented backgrounds. We will measure whether our program improves teacher confidence in using life science experiments in their classrooms, as well as student learning of key life science topics that are essential to careers in biotechnology.

Perhaps the greatest mystery ? why is adaptation so fast? ? provides the key advantage of our integrated research-education program. Researchers aged 12+ conduct evolution experiments with safe Pseudomonas bacteria to observe and study the processes of adaptation and ecological diversification within one week. Fitter mutants often produce unique colony morphologies caused by a single mutation. Yet it remains unknown why certain traits are selected so rapidly. Teachers will conduct experiments to study this problem with mentorship from a postdoctoral scholar, a PhD student, and 4 teacher-mentors experienced in our EvolvingSTEM laboratory curriculum. Teachers will test i) how adaptive phenotypes alter biofilm demography and subsequent evolution and, ii) how altered surface-sensing influences evolutionary dynamics. These experiments will advance understanding of Pseudomonas population biology. Following their summer program, teachers will incorporate these research questions in an established, effective classroom curriculum already in diverse schools. Teachers will be supported by our research team, curriculum coordinators, and community partners. We will assess whether our program improves teacher and student attitudes towards and knowledge of core life science topics and their relevance to applications in medicine and applied sciences.

Recent advances in single-cell technologies enable measuring different characteristics (multi-modal data) of thousands of individual cells in complex brains, such as gene expression patterns, cell shapes, and behaviors. However, integrating such complex multi-modal data and interpreting molecular mechanisms from the data for brain cell functions remains challenging.

Providing antibodies directly represents a possible solution because some of the broadest antibodies can subdue 97% or more of circulating strains.

Resistance to all remaining proteases will be engineered by targeted mutation, if the cleavage sites are known, and by comprehensive mutation, if the cleavage sites are unknown. High-throughput screening of mutants will be facilitated by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display. Second, Fc is stabilized in vivo by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).

Lunar extraction may reduce the cost of obtaining essential materials on the surface of the Moon by an order of magnitude, compared to supply from the Earth. Such a technology will have two key societal impacts. First, as human populations continue to expand, critical resources on Earth are becoming increasingly scarce and having another extra-terrestrial source may provide the resources needed on Earth. Second, the development of a space resource-use ecosystem may catalyze technical education, interest, and economic development in addition to fueling continued Gross National Product (GDP) growth.

The research involves the investigation of the subcomponents of the system to address expected capabilities which include: the ability to project a ?pencil beam? from a stand-off distance using a multi-reflector assembly, tolerance of the surface properties of the materials being treated, and electronic steering of the projected beam using phase shifting to improve focus. The research will start with simulations to lay the foundations for an autonomous and mobile microwave system with the listed capabilities. The project will develop, using simulation, the Bessel beam platform, perform the initial robotic designs, and source system integrators for the microwave and robotic components needed for subsequent development phases.

The existing efforts on grid uncertainty quantification have been limited due to the complexity of analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of power systems and large-scale historical data, particularly in near real-time. This project will fuse tools from cascading failure modeling, machine learning, and statistics to develop a scalable and efficient quantification framework to understand the interdependencies among generation and outage uncertainties and allow for near real-time analysis. For a more realistic quantification of the grid uncertainties, the data-driven models and physical power flow equations will inform each other to yield hybrid stochastic models.

As labor shortages stress supply chains, companies are rapidly adopting robotic solutions to try and reduce time delays in obtaining materials. Whereas robots of the past typically operated by themselves, the proposed robots work collaboratively with humans to perform complicated tasks. Human workers can then transition to higher-skill positions where they can assist in the more intricate aspects of a task, while robots perform the dull and monotonous operations. The new applications are enabled by close interactions between robots and humans. Where physical barriers were once used to guarantee separation and safety, sensors now detect people and ensure human-robot interactions are safe. Despite the broad use of 3D sensors in many other areas of robotics, low-resolution and processing requirements force most safety applications to use the same fundamental 2D sensor technology that have been employed for decades. Since 2D technology cannot provide 3D protection, safety buffers are added, and human-robot collaboration is limited. New safety-sensors that provide 3D coverage will enable improved collaboration and efficiency in robotic applications throughout global supply chains.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to commercialize 3D light curtain safety sensors that have potential for use in autonomous systems and human-robot interactions. The core technology is a software-defined 3D sensor that senses specific 3D surfaces upon request. Instead of sensing an entire 3D volume like most sensors on the market today, these sensors monitor a single requested 3D surface within the specified volume. For 3D safety sensing, this approach allows users to adaptively program specific 3D safety boundaries around robots and humans. This removes the complex 3D processing required by other sensors and replaces it with a simple detection task similar to how existing 2D safety-sensors work. The proposed research may advance the applicability of the 3D light curtain technology to tasks in agile manufacturing and co-bots, potentially improving safety and efficiency in factories. The objectives of this work are to improve detection capabilities, increase field-of-view, and advance product readiness with customer-guided testing. Research will include iterative simulation, prototyping, and characterization of potential optical and photonic configurations to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current project examines changes in U.S. Americans' gender attitudes following a highly anticipated Supreme Court case on reproductive health that has direct implications for state laws. <br/><br/>This research involves well-controlled, naturalistic studies that are informed by psychological theories of attitude change and political science research on the link between policy and public opinion. Two studies, one cross-sectional and one longitudinal, assess gender attitudes before and after an impending Supreme Court decision on reproductive health. The studies also account for geographic variations in policy implementation. Additionally, this project examines specific conditions and mechanisms that influence attitudinal response to changes in state laws and policies. Gender attitudes of respondents may be affected by: (1) the perceived legitimacy of state and federal policy-making bodies, (2) the gender norms that they perceive among others in general and others close to them, (3) their pre-existing support for reproductive rights policy, and (4) their belief that reproductive rights policy is a gender-relevant issue. Understanding how policies influence opinions ? pinpointing the specific causal mechanisms that transcend whether a person favors or opposes a policy change ? provides insight into the relationship between institutions and individuals in a democratic society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Gulf of California (GOC) is one of few places on earth where the sediment fill and volcanic products of a young ocean basin can be obtained through seafloor drilling. Then, the basin history can be studied from recovered sediment cores. The focus of this study is ~4 km of sediment cores recovered during recent drilling and exploration of the Guaymas Basin, Central GOC, Mexico. These will be analyzed and interpreted to find out what controlled the sediment composition, how the sediment was transported and deposited, and how to match the sedimentary layers among drill sites. This study helps to train women and underrepresented minorities in geoscience, supporting a research team of three master?s degree students mentored by two female professors. The work results will be communicated to the public through outreach activities in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.  This location is the largest urban park in the United States. The project team will create new geologic field-trip materials to help visitors learn about park geology.  The field-trip stops will include outcrops with marine sedimentary and volcanic rocks similar to those found in the Guaymas Basin. <br/><br/>Lithofacies and petrofacies analyses of International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 385 cores and integration with prior Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 64 drilling results are necessary steps for unraveling the patterns and controls of sediment delivery and accumulation in the Guaymas Basin. Integral to this basin analysis is the definition of potential datums, volcanic ashes and other sandy event (storm, seismic) beds, that can define packages of sediment that are linkable in time across the basin, to show patterns in sediment accumulation rates.  Ash and epiclastic volcanic sand-silt beds newly discovered on Expedition 385 will be fingerprinted using a variety of petrographic and imaging techniques, and their provenance further documented using analyses of their major and minor element geochemistry, and elemental composition of mineral phases. Sandy gravity-mass flow beds in the deep basin will show facies and detrital mode patterns indicative of their delivery mechanisms, for example: A) delta-front flood and mass-wasting; B) seismic-induced mass wasting along the continental slope; and C) tropical storm flushing of coastal sediment. This study, in combination with other Expedition 385 research, will make the Guaymas Basin arguably the best studied young ocean basin in the world and a model for the early sedimentary history of nascent ocean basins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanomanipulation enables the flexible maneuvering and precise positioning of nanostructures in both prototyping and assembling nanoscale devices. However, current nanomanipulation techniques are not well-suited for independently manipulating large numbers of nanoscale objects precisely and reliably. Overcoming existing barriers will allow the efficient manufacture of inexpensive functional nanodevices. This award will generate the fundamental knowledge, methodologies, and tools for large-volume manipulation of a broad class of micro- and nano-scale objects, by focusing on using coupled external electric fields to perform nanomanipulation in three-dimensional microfluidic environments. Additionally, this research will lead to efficient and inexpensive neuromorphic nanowire networks that mimic the behaviors exhibited by biological neurons. These advances could revolutionize neuromorphic computing as applied to next-generation artificial intelligence hardware, making the nation more competitive in the field of artificial intelligence. The research will be integrated with education at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and lifelong learning levels. The outreach activities will prime the STEM pipeline and inspire women and underrepresented minorities towards STEM careers.<br/><br/>The ability to move and control large numbers of micro- and nano-scale objects has important industrial and biomedical applications.

It is important to understand how the growing number of US children who are raised speaking Spanish at home come to acquire and use language as adults. The goal of this project is to explore the use of a variable grammatical form in bilingual adults who were raised in the US speaking Spanish at home and English in school; these bilingual adults are also known as ?heritage speakers?. Examining variable patterns leads to a more comprehensive understanding of bilingual language acquisition in the US context. Disseminating the findings from this project through both scientific and public channels helps researchers and educators to develop more effective educational strategies and improves speech-language pathologists' ability to assess language abilities in clinical settings. <br/><br/>Previous studies have shown that heritage speakers demonstrate significant variability in their use of grammatical forms. This variability can be traced to language-specific factors as well as aspects of an individual?s language experience. While variable grammatical patterns appear across languages and speech communities, these patterns are rarely studied in heritage speakers. This project uses a sentence repetition task with heritage language speakers and monolinguals to examine the trade-off between competing influences on the distribution of differential object marking (DOM), a phenomenon found in a number of languages where certain objects in a sentence are accompanied by a prefix/suffix, preposition, or other marker. The project addresses the following questions: (1) How do heritage speakers acquire variable grammatical patterns such as DOM? (2) What are the linguistic and extralinguistic factors that constrain heritage speakers? use of variable patterns? (3) How does variable usage change across generations of bilingual speakers? This novel approach combining the study of variation, language acquisition, and cross-generational heritage speakers has significant potential to contribute to our understanding of bilingualism and language acquisition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Controlling emitted and absorbed thermal radiation is of paramount importance for a range of energy technologies and the sources of heat they rely on. Beyond energy technologies, from sensing to imaging and detection in dark environments, thermal sources serve also serve as a foundational technology for our ability to perceive the world around us. This project seeks to enable the dynamic tuning of both the spectrum and directionality of thermal emission. The research will illuminate new mechanisms to tune heat flows from sources using a combination of nanophotonic design and unique material properties over infrared wavelengths. These findings will enable new, more compact sources and detectors for infrared imaging and sensing, as well as improved materials platform to control heat flows for energy and heat transfer applications. The key research aims are closely integrated with education and outreach activities that seek to engage students from the high-school through graduate level through online videos and updated courses, as well as actively engaging community members in heat-vulnerable communities. These activities will feed back into the core research aims by identifying key technical capabilities needed as well as opportunities for new applications of the research findings.<br/><br/>Thermal emission from conventional materials and devices is typically broad spectrum, isotropic and static in nature, with the emitted spectrum and intensity controlled by the emitter?s temperature. Due to these characteristics, dynamically controlling the spectral and directional characteristics of the emissivity of a thermal source is a challenging task, but of fundamental importance for infrared imaging and sensing, as well as heat transfer and energy applications. Typical approaches today involve using bulk optical elements, including spectral filters along with mechanical movement to move or re-orient a source, and alter its spectral characteristics to meet a target functionality. While recent progress has been made using photonic and metamaterials strategies to alter emissivity characteristics, dynamic control of both the spectrum and directionality of emitted thermal radiation remains an open challenge. This project will demonstrate gradient epsilon near zero-based thermal nanophotonic devices that can dynamically tune both their spectral and directional emissivity over long-wave infrared wavelengths. The PI will characterize graded doped semiconductor films and characterize their optical properties over infrared wavelengths. These films will then be configured into junction architectures to dynamically tune spectral and directional emission over large bandwidths and achieve strong electrical control of emissivity. Finally, the project will also demonstrate metasurfaces that can dynamically tune spectral, directional and polarization characteristics of emitted thermal radiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, weakening TCs can exact damages, owing to persistent rainfall and sustained winds. Various factors influence the decay rate of post-landfall TCs. Local effects (like land-surface and soil characteristics and geographical location) are important. However, less-studied effects like TC interactions with the extratropical circulation during or after landfall are also important and could become more relevant in a warming climate. This proposal addresses how the post-landfall TC decay rate and its impacts may change in a warming climate, emphasizing on the varying decay rate resulting from changes in landfall location and its proximity to the jet stream. This emphasis builds directly on the investigator?s recent work suggesting a poleward shift in the extratropical transition of TC activity in the North Atlantic basin with climate warming due to the strengthening of the TC-jet stream interactions.<br/> <br/>The tasks include conducting idealized and real-data case studies in pseudo-global warming scenarios and analyzing observations as well as TC-resolving global model simulations. Leveraging a hierarchy of analyses and modeling strategies, the work will assess the shifts in TC activity and landfall location, the changes in precipitation and the extent of damaging winds, and the frequency and strength of interaction with mid-latitude jets.

Users can thus achieve a high level of engagement by interacting with the augmented environment through the mobile user interface. Typical MAR apps require executing several compute-intensive tasks to render virtual objects and, using Artificial Intelligence (AI), analyze the environment. However, due to their relatively small form factor, mobile devices only have limited computing resources and energy available for the MAR app execution, which may lead to short battery life and poor user experience. To ensure the future success of MAR, it is thus important not only to conduct novel research on how to enable high energy efficiency in MAR apps but also to educate the future workforce in the best practices for energy efficient mobile software design. To achieve these goals, this project will propose an edge-assisted and energy-efficient framework for MAR apps. Specifically, the project designs runtime algorithms that (1), on each mobile device, control user-perceived performance and energy consumption by manipulating virtual object quality, AI-model complexity, and AI-task allocation on the heterogeneous computing resources, (2), on the supporting edge servers, ensure scalability by grouping similar virtual object decimation requests for minimized cross-user performance cost under limited edge computing and storage resources, and (3) will be implemented and tested on a physical testbed.<br/><br/>By providing a framework that makes MAR apps more energy-efficient, this project will help speed up the adoption of augmented reality in many different key sectors of modern society, such as education and workforce training, and will unlock the full potential of new technologies such as augmented remote meetings and augmented experiences in public places. The project will also result in the creation of new graduate-level courses to educate the future workforce on energy-efficient mobile resource management, new research opportunities for undergraduate students, and new summer camps for K12 students. The course material will be made available to other universities interested to introduce similar courses, projects, and summer camps. The results of this project will be disseminated through publications in top-tier conferences and journals.

Its concentration in seawater has been demonstrated to have remained roughly constant for many millions of years, and yet scientists have not yet been able to satisfactorily ?balance the budget? of nickel in the modern oceans. That is, the known sources of nickel to seawater are not balanced by the known removal processes. This project will examine the mechanisms by which nickel is removed to two major types of marine sediments, in order to answer key questions about the modern nickel budget. Beyond this specific contribution, the work will aid those who wish to reconstruct the ancient history of Ni cycling in the oceans. Dramatic shifts in the Ni budget have played crucial roles in the co-evolution of Earth and life, such as before the Great Oxidation Event 2.4 billion years ago and just before the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. In addition, recent studies have implied that most of the Ni inputs from rivers to estuaries and oceans today is from human activities. Results from the proposed work may help predict the fate of this new Ni once it enters the oceans. Two Ph.D. students and two undergraduates will be supported by this project, both directly in the research and through involvement in department-wide activities aimed at increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in geosciences. The students will invite some of the nation?s top geoscientist-activists to visit the Northern Arizona University campus, to speak about their research and their innovative contributions to DEI, and to appear as role models for members of the university community. <br/><br/>At present, published models of the Ni cycle either deviate from steady state in the extreme, which is implausible, or rest necessarily on speculative assumptions about Ni behavior in certain types of marine sediment. A few recent studies aimed to use Ni stable isotopes as an additional constraint for a balanced budget: just as source and sink fluxes should balance, the sum of flux-weighted isotopic compositions of sources to the ocean should equal the sum of flux-weighted isotopic compositions of sinks. Thus far, inadequate knowledge regarding two critical sedimentary outputs precludes a satisfactory solution: (1) Mn-rich, authigenic clay-rich sediments and (2) carbonates. In order to resolve apparent contradictions in the recent literature about these two outputs and to enable more accurate models of the Ni budget, the team will conduct systematic experiments to quantify Ni isotope fractionation during sorption of Ni on Mn oxyhydroxide (birnessite) and on smectite. To determine the Ni isotopic composition of pelagic sediment below the zone of Mn-reducing diagenesis and to learn whether Mn oxyhydroxide/smectite ratios control Ni isotope compositions in pelagic sediments, they will analyze selected samples from equatorial Pacific sediment cores (RV Sonne Expedition SO240). The research team will also collect the first Ni isotope data for well-characterized, young carbonate sediments, to assess fractionation during primary precipitation from seawater and during early diagenesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop is led by Dr. Neil Schweitzer of Northwestern University, with co-organizers Rajamani Gounder (Purdue University), and Robert Rioux (Penn State University).  Experts from academe, industry, U.S. funding agencies and national laboratories, and the international catalysis research community will convene in both virtual and in-person sessions to assess the state of catalysis research methodology and identify actionable opportunities for coordinating rigorous and reproducible practices across the broader catalysis research community.  Participants include an inclusive and diverse group of attendees including students, early-career researchers, and senior-level technical experts.   Both short- and long-term objectives will be addressed covering 5 topic areas: 1) Standardized reporting in literature/proposals, 2) Developing benchmarking standards, 3) Producing training media and workshops, 4) Establishing a database of experimental data, and 5) Forming a network of testing labs.  The workshop features a novel three-phase series of virtual sessions that will surround an in-person session of roughly 70 participants to be held at the Big Ten (B1G) Conference Center in Rosemont, Illinois (July 21 and July 22, 2022). Products and outcomes of the workshop will first consist of a workshop report followed by one or more journal articles summarizing best practices that researchers can use to benchmark, validate, and reproduce data in specific sub-fields of thermal catalysis.<br/><br/>Heterogeneous thermal catalysis has long served as the bedrock of fuels and chemicals manufacturing.  Complexity and variability spanning the entire breadth of catalyst materials properties, synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and evaluation procedures, has focused attention on the need to establish community-accepted practices for ensuring high-quality, benchmarked, and reproducible data.  In addition, urgency around the transition to clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction has incentivized interdisciplinary, convergent, and translational approaches to catalysis research in recent years.  Research engineers and scientists with expertise cutting broadly across materials, chemical synthesis, interfacial science, spectroscopic methods, and methods of data science and computational simulation, all bring welcome perspectives to catalysis research, but often with little awareness of the complexity of catalytic systems, especially in the working environment.  Thus, mechanisms are needed to improve rigor and reproducibility (R&R) in experimental measurements to ensure alignment of the broader research community with a common core of practices specific to the realization of high-quality catalysis research.  Similarly, the field is moving rapidly toward computational and data-science driven catalyst design, but successful implementation of such predictive tools hinges on model training and validation rooted in rigorously obtained and reproducible experimental data bases benchmarked to common specifications.    Following the in-person session, specific sub-groups of workshop leaders and participants will be formed to pursue additional projects, including the development of online training material and content reflecting the best practices in catalysis research to improve rigor and reproducibility, the creation and maintenance of a public database of catalysis data, and the implementation of testing laboratory facilities that can be used by researchers to benchmark or validate their data.

Medium-voltage (MV) to high-voltage (HV) dc power network is considered as a promising solution to enable high-efficient, high-reliable, and low-carbon-emission energy transmission and delivery. High-density power electronic systems which can provide MV/HV output are very critical to enabling such MV/HV dc network. However, the existing system still suffers the bulky volume, heavy weight, and low reliability. This NSF CAREER project aims to address several fundamental challenges and bring transformative solutions and technologies to improve the power-density of MV and HV power converters with over an order of magnitude. This will be achieved by use of MV and HV wide-band-gap power semiconductor devices and multiple miniaturized system integration solution and tools. The intellectual merits of the project include many new scientific knowledge of driving and protecting HV wide-band-gap power semiconductor switching unit, comprehensive design tools of HV insulation system for high-frequency power electronics, physics and numerical-based models for predicting partial-discharge (PD) behaviors. The broader impacts of the project include help drive the fast adoption of MV and HV high-frequency high-density power conversion by bridging the industry knowledge gaps for emerging applications and drive the energy eco-system toward zero-carbon emissions and promote the US dominance in wide-band-gap power semiconductor industry and gain the market leadership. <br/>To enable the order-of-magnitude power density improvement of MV/HV power converters, this proposal identifies three critical areas and scientific gaps as the starting point for the PI?s long-term career: 1) Characterization, modeling, and investigation of a comprehensive real-time dynamic voltage balancing approach for stacking SiC semiconductors to enable a MV/HV high-speed ?super-switch? as the basic building block for MV/HV converters. 2) Investigation of solid dielectric system and electric-field (E-field) shaping design methodologies for internal/external PD-free high-density power electronics integration; 3) Investigation of MV conductive EMI noise containment and EMI filter design. In the program, comprehensive real-time digital dynamic voltage balancing solutions for MV SiC MOSFETs in series will be explored. Characterization and design tools of HV converter integration considering E-field stress Management and PD mitigation will be developed. In the end, HV planar EMI filter with HV feed-through connector for high-frequency converter with integrated EM shielding solution will be developed. The proposed program will collaborate with the researchers with the expertise on power device physics, solid and gaseous dielectric materials and HV insulation, and EMI to create fundamental cross-domain knowledge, design tools, innovative solutions, and education materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The meeting brings<br/>together top scientists from around the world who have diverse backgrounds and expertise in order to provide an integrated program on marine microbial life, covering cutting edge research on viruses, Bacteria, Archaea and Eurkarya protists, spanning pelagic and benthic realms, trophic food web dynamics (photoautotrophy, chemoautotrophy, heterotrophy and mixotrophy) and their interactions and impact on biogeochemical cycles. Both the Seminar and Conference are organized in thematic sessions, with the goal of highlighting new methodological approaches and emerging questions in the field while stimulating rigorous discussion.  This award enables early career participants (postdoctoral researchers and graduate students in the marine microbiology research community with diverse backgrounds) to attend both the 2022 Gordon Research Seminar (May 28-29, 2022) and Gordon Research Conference (May 29- May 29, 2022) on Marine Microbes. The rationale is to facilitate the attendance and participation of postdocs and graduate students in the GRS so they have an opportunity to present their research among peer scientists and establish connections and confidence in this setting. The GRS exposes young, early-career scientists to cutting-edge research on marine microbes (ranging from computational to theoretical to experimental to observational, and spanning all relevant disciplines from ecology to biogeochemistry to evolution), provide opportunities to network among peers, and foster relationships that will hopefully lead to lifelong collaborations. It also provides career guidance and scientific mentoring through the participation of select senior-level research mentors and discussion leaders. The GRS increases student and postdoc participation in the subsequent GRC which has oral presentations from a diverse group of young and established scientists who play leading roles in marine microbial research. The 2022 meeting is of special importance since the 2020 meeting was postponed due to the global COVID- 19 pandemic. It is even more important now that researchers can reconnect and have vital discussions about novel research, in an environment that fosters networking and collaboration.<br/><br/>The respective themes of the 2022 Marine Microbes GRS and GRC are ?Integrated Microbial Oceanography? and ?Interconnected Microbial Ocean.? These themes highlight some of the pressing challenges and opportunities for innovation and collaboration in the field of marine microbiology. The ?Integrated Microbial Oceanography? GRS focuses on research at the nexus of approaches of study marine microbes that bridges across methods, experimental systems, and scales to form a more holistic understanding of the ocean microbiome. The complementary GRC is on the ?Interconnected Microbial Ocean,? and aims to highlight the vital functional roles of microorganisms, their ecological interactions, and their feedbacks on marine physiochemical environments. The Marine Microbes GRS/GRC are arguably the only meetings that coalesce such a diverse array of researchers (from career stages, disciplines, areas of expertise) related to marine microbes. The GRC meeting format emphasizes personal interactions, unpublished, cutting-edge research, and community-building. As such, these meetings continue to be an exceptional opportunity for the exchange of scientific ideas, developing new collaborations, gaining experience in presenting research (especially for early-career scientists), and are a crucial platform for addressing pressing challenges and opportunities for the field of marine microbiology. The meetings are highly interactive, stimulating environments that drive scientific conversations and community forward. A critical part of achieving our meeting goal is participation from a diverse array of scientists to the meeting site.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite US leadership, the industry is facing major problems, including, difficulties in developing newer molecules, high cost and lengthy time of bringing a new drug to market, lack of adequate and efficient regulatory science, consumer drug affordability, quality issues, and drug shortages. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated many of these challenges. These issues point to an acute need for innovative research and technical advances to develop high-quality drug products, achieve manufacturing efficiency, and support US-based pharmaceutical manufacturing. This IUCRC phase I project addresses such issues through establishing a joint two-university Center for Integrated Material Science and Engineering for Pharmaceutical Products (CIMSEPP), with NJIT as a Lead Site and Minnesota as a Partner Site. Its mission is to advance and promote fundamental understanding of the material properties, drug-additive interactions at molecular and particulate level, as well as manufacturing processes, on product quality and performance, at lower cost.<br/><br/>The CIMSEPP team will develop fundamental understanding of structure-function-performance of drug products and process engineering under three industry vetted Research Thrusts, which will, 1) promote predictive enhancement of key properties of drugs, their engineered counterparts, and their blends for improving product quality, and 2) significantly reduce time and cost of drug product development.  Key advances include, 1) identification of critical particle properties that impact fine particle behavior, 2) better understanding of their impact on cohesion and behaviors of powders, and 3) enabling accurate prediction of properties of blends as well as compacted tablets. That understanding combined with particle and crystal engineering, will enable development of mechanistic models and predictive tools required for enabling manufacturing decisions and better products.  NJIT?s expertise in particle engineering and contact-physics will enable development of predictive models for particle agglomeration, drug content uniformity, and tablet weight variation using dimensionless parameter(s) based on material sparing measurements of particle properties such as size, shape, and roughness. Compared to the data-driven approaches, such models and computer simulations for process modeling, will enable better understanding of traditional and emerging technologies, promoting efficient design of high-quality products and manufacturing processes, while reducing time and cost for product and scalable process development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By investigating human-environment interactions across diverse ecological settings and throughout time, archaeologists are able to identify and study precise ways in which human groups exhibit resilience in the face of change. In this project a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan, will collaborate with colleagues and local stakeholders to investigate the relationship between early humans and their prehistoric environments at a mountain - rainforest intersection. The results of this research will contribute important new information to scientists? understanding of how humans  and later developed native agricultural systems which remain important today.

Finally, by hiring from descendant communities and engaging in community outreach, the project will engage local indigenous groups in the preservation and caretaking of their own cultural heritage.<br/><br/>Although humans have come to occupy nearly every terrestrial habitat on the planet, archaeologists have long believed that some places are more attractive than others, particularly for prehistoric hunter-gatherers who drew their daily resources for survival directly from their surroundings. Places that present the most obstacles and afford the fewest opportunities are generally referred to as ?marginal,? and are epitomized by arctic tundra and tropical deserts. Archaeologists have long debated whether tropical rainforests belong in this group because much of the superabundant life there?the tremendous richness and diversity of plants and animals?is either inedible or inaccessible to humans. However, determining rainforests? actual suitability to humans is difficult because very few hunter-gatherer sites have been found in such regions. This project will address that shortfall by investigating potential hunter-gatherer sites in a  cloud forest,. Caves across two valleys will be excavated in order to locate sites of interest. By analyzing the stone tools, plant and animal remains, and other kinds of archaeological evidence uncovered, this project will evaluate whether this environment was as challenging to early humans as is widely believed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will undertake research on climate change, and the nature of human responses to that change, during the Last Glacial Period. The Last Glacial is characterized by profound shifts in climate, culminating in the Last Glacial Maximum during which sea levels dropped to 130 m below the modern coastline. On a human scale, the phase witnessed significant biological, cultural and technological changes. Within the region studied, this includes the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans and the transition from Middle to Upper Paleolithic technologies and culture. The Last Glacial also encompasses much of the Epipaleolithic, a period of key importance to our understanding of the transition from foraging bands to sedentary farming societies. There has been considerable debate about the role played by climate change in these transitions, fueled in part by a lack of high resolution, culturally linked environmental data. By combining high resolution paleoclimate and zooarchaeological data, this project will provide insight into human-environmental interactions during a key period in the later stages of human development. The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduates at a majority-minority institution, as well as supporting graduate student training at a second university. Given the importance of deep-time perspectives to current discussions about climate change, results will be disseminated to the public via popular science articles and by public lectures.<br/><br/>With deposits spanning from the Middle Paleolithic through the Epipaleolithic (~71-21,000 years ago), this research examines caves that serves as an ideal natural laboratory for exploring questions relating to human-environmental interaction in the strategic region that facilitated inter-continental human and cultural exchanges. The project will combine traditional zooarchaeological analysis with the isotopic analysis of key prey species (gazelle and fallow deer) and plant waxes (n-alkanes) deriving from archaeological sediments. The combined datasets will provide a high-resolution reconstruction of paleoclimatic conditions. The data also provide a unique opportunity to document shifts in human subsistence behavior and landscape use throughout the Last Glacial. This will facilitate the evaluation of hypotheses about behavioral differences between Neanderthals and modern humans, while also providing new insights into the nature of human responses to the Last Glacial Maximum, a particularly active and challenging period of climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The development of molecular catalysts that have the ability to accelerate complex chemical reactions involving many electrons remains a major challenge due to changes that often affect the durability and behavior of such species under harsh reaction conditions. Therefore, understanding and controlling the properties of these catalytic compounds is of fundamental importance, and relies on the ability to manipulate the evolution of transient species in solution. The polyoxovanadate-alkoxide clusters under study here will provide a useful platform better understand fundamental aspects of the synthesis, reactivity, and durability of metal oxide catalysts, in general, as well as the catalytic activation of small molecules. This work will contribute to the long-term goal of the Miró research group to use modern computational methodologies to discover new roadmaps for the nucleation of molecular mimics of catalytic metal-oxide materials. The project includes an educational outreach program involving hands-on workshops at neighboring tribal colleges, the engagement of tribal undergraduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research, and leading National Chemistry Week activities for students at K-12 schools. <br/><br/>Pere Miró and his research team will use high-level quantum chemical calculations and neural network algorithms to examine the nucleation mechanism of first-row functionalized polyoxovanadate-alkoxide clusters--up to the formation of hexameric species--as well as to better understand the impact of dynamic experimental conditions on the structure-redox relationships and multi-electron reactivity of the clusters. Specifically, a combination of density functional theory calculations benchmarked against domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster and second-order complete active space methodologies are being used to characterize nucleation intermediates and derive neural network potentials to streamline the exploration of the nucleation space. This research seeks to enrich the understanding of structure-function relationships that control nucleation and electrocatalytic properties. The scientific broader impacts of this work include transforming the way the organometallic chemistry community views function-oriented synthesis of these species using computational methodologies and to guide the discovery of new functionalities. The project also will provide advanced training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including directed training opportunities for students from groups that are underrepresented in the physical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Excessive snow, rain, wind and seismic activity create high structural loads that can lead to the collapse of buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure.  These loads can also destabilize geographical features such as water impoundments and hillsides.  Increasingly extreme climate impacts and aging infrastructure make these situations more common and unpredictable.  Weather events affect 5.9 million commercial buildings and 137,000 schools in the US.  Of the 600,000 highway bridges in the US, 45,000 are structurally deficient. Landslides result in $3.5 billion in repair costs due to physical damage and result in 25 to 50 deaths annually.  Since small structural movements often precede damage and even catastrophic failure, the ability to detect and monitor these motions at key locations and deliver warnings to any user with a cell phone or computer is of great societal benefit.  This project will lead to the development of a low cost, rapidly installed, and intuitive wireless system to measure and record movements within broad categories of infrastructure and geographic features.  Early warning of structural movements helps mitigate risk, prevent unnecessary damage, initiate evacuations, and keep occupants safe.<br/><br/> <br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I team will construct a series of sensors that measure commercial rooftop movement like that seen from high snow and wind loading.  Existing disaster forecasting systems are expensive, operationally complex, and/or provide limited data.  The sensors in this project will use precision radio receivers to create 3 axis centimeter-accurate movement data.  Sensors report movements to an application server where an algorithm will be created to analyze and display geo-located data.  When necessary, alerts are sent to users via Short Message System (SMS, i.e., text) and email, indicating the location and severity of the problem.  A key metric to success will be the ability for the sensors to operate accurately on structures such as metal-decked rooftops which can create challenges for radio frequency devices.  A compact design is necessary for commercial viability and to create a stable enclosure with low aerodynamic drag. Therefore, a novel hybrid energy supply will perform additional system functions and will be evaluated for output efficiency.

This project will result in improved robotic capability for exploration of difficult terrains such as those found during search and rescue, inspection, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The new robot capabilities will also benefit future extra-terrestrial missions. The project includes summer research opportunities for undergraduate students and educational outreach activities to K-12 students to support soft robotics education.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the theory and practice of soft robots by creating novel and hybrid (incorporating both stiff and soft elements) physical hardware designs to offset limitations of each individual technology. The research tasks are aimed at advancing the seamless integration and operation of non-collocated human-robot teams and are aligned in two thrusts. The first thrust considers modular design for extreme environments using low-degree-of freedom modules connected by reversible, completely sealed permanent magnet connectors. Modules communicate with each other via wireless protocols to enable distributed control algorithms. Dynamic modeling and simulation are used to discover a hybrid locomotion strategy based on a learning central pattern generator. The project also creates motion planning algorithms for bioinspired, topologically reconfigurable soft robots. The second thrust focuses on reliable non-collocated human robot collaboration, including high-level teleoperation, topological transformation strategies to mitigate module failures, automatic gait re-selection based on fault diagnosis techniques, and a consensus decision-making system to enable functional modules to disable nonfunctional ones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern teaching standards and best practices call for teachers not simply to reiterate facts, but rather to engage students in scientific processes. However, prospective teachers often have limited opportunities to immerse themselves in the types of authentic research experiences that best prepare them to meet these standards. This project addresses this limitation by providing a summer program at Loyola University of Chicago with authentic STEM research experiences for prospective science teachers who are pursuing a baccalaureate degree in biology, ecology, or environmental science. A research emphasis will be on biodiversity in an urban setting. Coupled with the research program will be a professional development summer program with a focus on introducing project participants to many ways in which research can be applied. At the same time, the program will help them determine how research and other inquiry-based experiences can be integrated into their future classrooms. The project has an underlying aim to mentor 8 new pre-service teachers each year of a 5-year project for a total of 40 unique participants who will have an authentic STEM research experience. In turn, these future teachers will be prepared to facilitate research activities in the K-12 setting. <br/><br/>This project at Loyola University of Chicago (LUC) will focus on several goals. First, the investigators seek to increase the number and diversity of pre-service teachers in the Chicago area who are STEM majors with a genuine STEM research experience. A second goal is to augment the summer research experiences with professional development opportunities. These opportunities will be aimed at enhancing STEM identities, increasing pedagogical and content knowledge, gaining experience with communication of science concepts and skills, and discussing teaching practices with special attention given to implementing research in the K-12 environment. A component of the professional development will be a workshop on employing data nuggets to empower the pre-service teachers to translate their research experience into their future careers as teachers. Third is to add to the knowledge base for pre-service teacher preparation. To accomplish this, the project will collect and analyze data about the short and long-term implications of pre-service teacher research and other professional development experiences on pedagogical and content knowledge, science and science teacher identities, and instructional practices. A final goal is to disseminate outcomes and findings on the LUC model, especially to other programs interested in using authentic STEM research experiences, coupled with teacher professional development, to enhance and improve pre-service science teacher preparation. Qualitative project evaluation of the stated program goals will rely on formative assessment, including mentor reflections, focus groups, and interviews. Also, a summative study of the depth and rigor of the research and professional development experiences will be incorporated.  Overall, evaluation is designed to contribute to understandings of how research experiences can be integrated into beginning science teachers? early preparation. The project has the potential to serve as a model for improving pre-service teacher preparation for which intensive research experiences would represent an important program component. This Noyce Research Experiences for Pre-service Teachers project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need districts. It also supports research on the retention and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the convergence of advanced additive manufacturing, stem cell biology, biomaterials, and biomechanics, biomanufacturing has the potential for creating three-dimensional biomimetic tissue constructs that can not only redefine the clinical capabilities of regenerative medicine but also transform the toolsets available for various applications such as disease modeling, pre-clinical drug screening, space exploratory and deep ocean studies with human-like tissues, and environmental health and safety studies using engineered human tissues. However, current biomanufacturing technologies have critical bottlenecks: a) they lack the resolution to resolve single cells and are too slow for fabricating a functional three-dimensional human tissues and organs, b) they are often conducted by trial and error, resulting in wasting expensive cells, biomaterials, and time, and c) the lack of systemic interactions with other tissues or organs at the human systemic level. This project aims to address fundamental research issues related to these bottlenecks. On the education side, a comprehensive equity, diversity, and inclusion plan will be developed. Graduate student researchers, undergraduate interns, and K-12 students from diverse backgrounds will have the opportunity to participate in this exciting research project and other outreach programs.

Leaf flatness is a key agronomic trait because it affects the extent of light interception and carbon dioxide intake which are required for photosynthesis. This is an interdisciplinary collaborative project bringing together a laboratory in France that studies biophysics and a laboratory in the US that studies plant cell biology to gain new insights into the mechanical interactions between cells that control of leaf shape.  This project will contribute to the interdisciplinary training of postdoctoral and undergraduate scientists.

How is flat shape achieved? This project addresses this question in Arabidopsis leaves, a system amenable to live-imaging of growth, biophysical experiments, and genetic manipulation. This project will test the hypothesis that differences between neighboring cells in their growth (heterogeneity) allows the cells to sense variations in leaf curvature and correct to maintain flatness as the leaf expands. Specifically, (i) the relationship between cell-to-cell differences in growth, cell mechanics, and leaf flatness will be characterized using mutants with curved, crinkly or wavy leaves. (ii) a theoretical framework to model a thin active growing sheet in 3D space will be built, and (iii) the combinatorial regulation of flatness will be characterized through model predictions and experimental tests.

When people walk normally, two factors largely determine their balance and forward progress: the location of each footstep, and how hard each leg in stance pushes on the ground. In general, when an exoskeleton produces forces that are slightly different from what the person wearing it expects or wants, it affects how the person takes their next step, which in turn affects the future exoskeleton response. The exoskeletons studied in this project supplement the natural muscular strength of their wearers by adding to the support forces during walking.  Systematically varying the exoskeleton force and measuring the response will reveal a map of the dynamics of balance and movement during walking, including how these change on uphill and downhill slopes. This new fundamental understanding of walking can then be used by the exoskeleton to adapt to individual characteristics of any user, and from there to stimulate desired walking patterns while decreasing the likelihood of a fall. This research will be complemented by educational outreach, including informing the broader public about robotics and human-robot interaction via science videos on social media, and engaging pre-college students with workshops on biomechanics and exoskeleton control.   <br/><br/>This project is centered on a new type of exoskeleton that uses a single prismatic actuator on each leg to apply force from the ground next to a planted foot, directly to the wearer's center of mass. The actuator can provide up to 80 percent of the unassisted ground reaction force during walking. The exoskeleton hip is unactuated and free to rotate, which allows the wearer to choose their footstep locations as though the exoskeleton was absent.  Human subject experiments will study how the human kinematics, muscle activity, metabolic cost, foot placement, and stability are affected by different forces on the person's center of mass under various conditions including varying speeds and slopes -- essentially accomplishing system identification of the coupled human-robot system.  These system identification results, together with the divergent component of motion (DCM) framework and machine learning, will define an exoskeleton controller to provide optimized walking assist forces based on the wearer's current state and expected future footstep locations.  The project will subsequently investigate the bi-directional adaptation between the human and exoskeleton: how humans adapt to the exoskeleton forces, how their subsequent footstep locations are affected by these forces, and how the exoskeleton can best adapt to an individual human and their personal locomotion patterns and footstep placements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Minerals with these components include those that make up the Earth and synthetic industrial analogues that are of technological importance. The hydrogen in Earth?s minerals account for the vast majority of our planet?s hydrogen and has a profound effect on the behavior of Earth?s interior. Similarly, hydrous components can significantly modify the material properties of synthetic materials, such as semiconductors. Despite the clear importance of hydrogen in these contexts, there remain two fundamental uncertainties: 1) where does the hydrogen incorporate into crystal structures and 2) at what concentrations hydrogen is present. This work will address both issues through a comprehensive approach of both laboratory experiments and computer simulations. This will include development of analytical techniques for hydrogen detection, detailed spectroscopic studies, and interpretation of experimental data from quantum mechanics calculations. In addition to continuing work on previously studied silicate minerals (the most abundant minerals in the earth), the research will also focus on binary oxide minerals. Binary oxides are not only geologically relevant, but also have extreme relevance in many established and emerging technologies, ranging from solar cells, to lasers, touch screens, pigments, semiconductors, and flat screen displays. Hydrogen impurities have been shown to play a key role in these settings. Thus, this research will not only be important for understanding the inner workings of our planet, but will also be significant for the development of new technologies.<br/><br/>It has long been understood that hydrous components (OH- and H2O) in nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) are of great importance in earth science. These phases, which include abundant mantle phases such as olivine, garnet, pyroxene and ringwoodite, are likely the largest reservoir for hydrogen in the Earth. The trace hydrogen in NAMs often has outsized effects on a wide range of their material properties, from melting points, to mechanical deformation, thermal and electrical conductivity, color, radiation stability. Despite the clear significance of hydrogen in NAMs, there persist two fundamental issues. First is the quantification of hydrogen concentrations in these phases. Numerous techniques have been attempted or utilized over the last few decades including nuclear profile analysis and SIMS measurements, but the technical challenges related to measuring trace hydrogen concentrations in NAMs have proven difficult to overcome. Second is the identification of specific hydrogen sites in NAMs. Although some defect sites have been identified in specific NAMs such as garnets, there is little recourse for establishing the detailed defect structures in most phases. Our proposed solution to these issues is a holistic approach that considers both established and emergent techniques for measuring trace hydrogen in minerals, and quantum mechanics (density functional theory) calculations. These research components will be linked through infrared spectroscopy of oriented crystals, a technique that has proven fundamental in the study of NAMs. Our work will initially focus on simple oxide minerals such as rutile and stishovite, a group of phases that has typically been underrepresented in research into NAMs, but whose study could greatly benefit the field as a whole, with additional benefits to the development of technological materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research is of fundamental and practical significance to the area of produced water treatment. The proposed approach seeks to remove 99% of NORM from produced waters effectively, an important advance for environmental treatment. This approach also is expected to reduce the cost of the treatment technology and the associated impact on cost per barrel of gas and oil. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to verify the effectiveness of new adsorbents waste water clean-up associated with fracking. The geologic formations containing oil and gas deposits contain Naturally Occurring Radionuclide Materials, referred to as NORM.  Oil and gas fracking brings NORM to the surface in a concentrated form, posing a radiation safety hazard. There is currently no commercial product on the market to remove NORM from concentrated produced and flow back water selectively.  By developing theory and computational methods with the Group Contribution method (GCM) and a novel optimization-based Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) framework, the teams seeks to generate better clay-based adsorbents than are currently commercially available for removal of produced water impurities. The modeling results need to be verified experimentally by synthesizing thenew adsorbents and comparing their adsorption behavior to the theoretically-predicted isotherms before commercializing them.  The research may result in efficient and cost-effective adsorbents customized for the type of water contamination encountered using the new CAMD frameworks and cutting-edge experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award will renew and expand support for the MathILy-EST (MathILy Early Scholarly Training) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The MathILy-EST REU will increase the depth of the mathematical workforce by providing training opportunities to students early in their mathematical careers, especially those who do not have other research opportunities and who are deeply but informally prepared to engage in significant mathematical work.  Past sessions have trained diverse cohorts, with significant participation by students belonging to groups underrepresented in mathematics; such students are especially encouraged to apply. The eight-week summer research program will train 9 early undergraduates in mathematics research each year and train one graduate student in research supervision each year.  The program targets exceptional first-year college students, with second-year and entering college students also considered for participation. In particular, the MathILy-EST REU will give participants early experience in active acquisition and creation of mathematical knowledge, which will in turn enable them to succeed in traditional mathematics classes. Training in software use, CV construction, presentation skills, and writing will give participants the informal knowledge and career skills needed to be competitive in the STEM workforce. All participants will therefore be well prepared to excel in the mathematical sciences throughout college and beyond. MathILy-EST will be run on the same campus as MathILy (serious Mathematics Infused with Levity), a 5-week very selective program of inquiry-based educational experiences for highly talented high-school students. The two programs will hold regular joint activities. There will be significant cross-pollination between MathILy-EST and MathILy, and specifically will provide MathILy-EST students with additional role models and mentors from the MathILy staff, will result in MathILy-EST participants acting as research role models to MathILy students, and will expand the near-peer networks of both groups. This creation of community will increase both MathILy-EST and MathILy participant persistence in acquiring further mathematical education and research experience.<br/><br/>MathILy-EST REU participants will work together to produce original research, present their results at conferences, and submit their work to undergraduate or research journals. They will attend presentations by visiting and staff mathematicians on mathematics topics, on mathematical career paths, and on choosing graduate schools. They will learn to read mathematics papers and texts. The mathematical focus of MathILy-EST will change each year. The projects will be drawn from the following topics according to mentor availability: combinatorial representation theory, arrangements of subspaces over finite fields, discrete and computational geometry of folding, and diagrammatic structure of the Thompson group. MathILy-EST REU students will present their research progress to each other on a regular basis, with feedback provided on their research methods and presentation skills. Students will be asked to record work in writing (in LaTeX) weekly, to provide practice in writing formally and fodder for paper drafts once research has progressed to the point of publication. At the end of the MathILy-EST REU program, the director will make plans with students, including sub-goals and timelines, for dissemination of their research results. This will include discussing potential local (MAA) and national (JMM) conference presentations and paper submissions.

The language displays a number of structural characteristics which are relatively unique within its language family;  deeper investigation into the origin of morphological agreement and verb classes has the potential to shed light on broader issues within theoretical linguistics such as the underlying representation of lexical items, while also furthering our understanding of the ways in which languages change and develop over time. In addition, this project aims to provide a solid empirical foundation for future research into variation across related languages, contributing to our knowledge of typological patterns found in and around the region. Finally, it is a goal of the project that the resulting data, processed in close collaboration with native speaker consultants and publicly archived, will be multifunctional and suitable for adaptation into community-facing literary, pedagogical, and reference material, facilitating local efforts at language maintenance and preservation.<br/><br/>The researcher will conduct on-site fieldwork with native speakers in order to thoroughly document and analyze grammatical structure with particular focus on the language's morphological systems and their interface with other syntactic and phonological phenomena from both a synchronic and diachronic perspective. In particular, this project is built around the hypothesis that there is a developing incipient inflection class system, wherein the choice of prefix shape with a particular set of verbs is no longer phonologically or semantically predictable. By closely investigating sub-systemic alternations in verb class, valency, voice, and serialization, this project aims to shed light on issues such as i) the structural status and historical origin of subject agreement and semi-idiosyncratic verb classes; ii) the distribution of pronominal elements and their intersection with the development of case and alignment; and iii) the grammaticalization of valency- and category-changing derivational morphology and their relationship to the abstract representation of lexical items. Thus, this work has the potential to contribute to our broader understanding of morphosyntactic theory cross-linguistically, while also bringing a novel diachronic perspective to the study of an understudied language family.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite US leadership, the industry is facing major problems, including, difficulties in developing newer molecules, high cost and lengthy time of bringing a new drug to market, lack of adequate and efficient regulatory science, consumer drug affordability, quality issues, and drug shortages. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated many of these challenges. These issues point to an acute need for innovative research and technical advances to develop high-quality drug products, achieve manufacturing efficiency, and support US-based pharmaceutical manufacturing. This IUCRC phase I project addresses such issues through establishing a joint two-university Center for Integrated Material Science and Engineering for Pharmaceutical Products (CIMSEPP), with New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) as the Lead Site and University of Minnesota (UMN) as a Partner Site. Its mission is to advance and promote fundamental understanding of the material properties, drug-additive interactions at molecular and particulate level, as well as manufacturing processes, on product quality and performance, at lower cost.<br/><br/>The CIMSEPP team will develop fundamental understanding of structure-function-performance of drug products and process engineering under three industry vetted Research Thrusts: A) Particle and Crystal Engineering, B) Model Predictive Understanding of Materials and Product Performance, and C) Bioavailability Enhancement and Stability.  Research at CIMSEPP will 1) promote predictive enhancement of key properties of drugs, their engineered counterparts, and their blends for improving product quality, and 2) significantly reduce time and cost of drug product development.  Key advances include, 1) identification of critical particle properties that impact fine particle behavior, 2) better understanding of their impact on cohesion and behaviors of powders, and 3) enabling accurate prediction of properties of blends as well as compacted tablets. That understanding will enable the development of mechanistic models and predictive tools required for efficient manufacturing of better products.  The UMN team?s expertise in powder characterization and property enhancement through integrated crystal engineering and particle design will 1) enable the development of both highly effective and easy-to-adopt strategies to solve manufacturing problems and 2) contribute to the fundamental understanding of structure ? property relationship through systematic research at length scales, ranging from molecular dimension to single crystal/particles, to powders, and to finished products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project advances a nutrient-dense crunchy ingredient platform based on legumes and having the ability to customize shape, texture, and nutritional profile to meet a broad variety of crunchy applications in disparate categories. Due to their neutral flavor, these crunchy ingredients can be flavored with various flavor systems, providing a low-calorie, high-fiber, and high-protein alternative to consumer favorites such as graham crackers, cereals, chips, granola, and cookies. Providing healthier alternatives to traditionally unhealthy consumer products has the potential to beneficially impact public health, preventing diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other related co-morbidities. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project focuses on the formulation and processing development necessary to expand a legume-based ingredient platform and overcome the significant technical hurdles in scaled manufacturing. The primary innovation lies in a novel method of structuring fibers and proteins into a crunchy and aerated matrix through both formulation and downstream processing. This project addresses the variation in product behavior and quality caused by batch size and manufacturing line configuration. The dough on which these ingredients are based differs highly in its rheological properties in comparison to the gluten-based doughs for which most manufacturing lines are configured. To compete with commodities, a variety of manufacturing lines with different drying technologies must be evaluated in their ability to maximize throughput while minimizing input costs and meeting product quality requirements. The major technical objectives of this Phase II project are: 1) Expand ingredient platform variants to achieve specific product characteristics to support customer claims, ingredient labeling, physiological impact, and costs; 2) Evaluate various manufacturing lines and their technoeconomic potential to scale ingredient production; 3) Develop ingredients to meet requirements necessary to respond to physical and environmental stressors in the supply chain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reinventing cathode materials of rechargeable batteries is an important because the cathode is the most expensive material in a battery and often performance limiting. Cathodes cost more than all the other battery materials combined. This new class of high performance, low-cost vanadium cathodes will be used in lithium ion batteries. Vanadium also benefits from high availability, domestic sourcing, and existing capacity for the recycling of spent vanadium to establish a circular battery ecosystem. The proposed batteries may benefit electrified vehicles by increasing range, enabling fast charging, improving safety, and reducing cost. More broadly, a wide range of applications in consumer electronics, medical electronics, military and defense systems, and energy storage are envisioned.<br/> <br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes to develop a high performance, multi-electron battery cathode. This lithium ion battery's cathode is a new tunnel structured vanadium based material. Commercially available battery chemistries are often limited to just one electron reaction per intercalation site and this limits performance. Lithium batteries that reversibly enable multi-electron intercalation of lithium ions are needed to improve gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Specifically, the proposed project will scale up the synthetic method to produce multi-electron vanadium based cathodes, evaluate multi-electron cathodes paired with lithium metal and/or silicon for electrochemical performance, and explore various battery components and surface modifications to mitigate oxidation of electrolyte and transition metal dissolution.  The project will also optimize battery performance based on a design of experiments approach.

Propellers and thrusters used by aerial and space vehicles to control their flight path are limited in the forces they can produce. If the vehicle?s flight control system requests forces that exceed such limits, a consequence may be undesirable flight performance that hinders the mission. To avoid this, engineers presently exploit over-sized thrusters at the expense of increased vehicle weight and cost. In contrast, the control methods developed in this project allow vehicles to be designed with smaller-sized actuators while safeguarding against unstable flight behavior. Applications include Martian landers and ascent vehicles that need to be lightweight in order to reduce costs of production and energy consumption, yet require flight control systems that can compensate for unpredictable environmental forces that otherwise prevent the vehicles from following a desired trajectory. Integrated research, teaching, and outreach activities will be carried out through affiliations with university institutes and external centers that foster multidisciplinary collaboration among engineering and other STEM departments, and through collaborations with scholarly organizations that serve currently underrepresented populations. Unique opportunities for broader impact will result from jointly organized workshops and cross-border mentorship of graduate students by researchers in the United States and the United Kingdom. Engagement with industry and federal research agencies will allow knowledge transfer and possible technology commercialization.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to the application of anti-windup compensation theory to nonlinear systems governed by rigid body dynamics, and to problems of actuator control allocation and actuator quantization that naturally arise in such systems. It achieves this outcome by purposely exploiting the particular nonlinear structure of rigid body dynamics and by enhancing anti-windup compensation design methods for linear systems in order to handle prolonged periods of actuator saturation. The outcomes from the research will yield new realistic control architectures that ensure stability across a wide range of flight conditions, with rigorous performance guarantees also when saturated control signals exist, even when nonlinear dynamics are prevalent.

Heritage language bilinguals speak as a first language a minority language that they have cultural ties to (e.g., Spanish), but, because of societal reasons, have become dominant in the majority language (e.g., American English). After English, Spanish is the most frequently spoken language in the United States. Many Spanish speakers in the U.S. are heritage speakers (i.e., children and descendants of immigrants), yet Spanish heritage speakers of Mexican descent are an underrepresented population in research. Conducting this project broadens the participation of Mexican Americans in research. <br/><br/>Prior research has shown that different experiences with language, such as the language exposure received in one's early years, as well as throughout one's life, affect a person's perceptual abilities. Heritage language bilinguals offer unique insight into this relationship as heritage language speakers exhibit significant variation in both experiences and attitudes. Although they are mainly exposed to their heritage language in their early lives, once they begin formal schooling, there is a shift to more majority language input and interactions, leading to a switch in dominance. Like many bilinguals, heritage speakers code-switch (i.e., use both of their languages in one sentence or conversation), and there is variation in code-switching practices based on experience and attitudes. The project consists of two experimental studies that examine how variation in language experience and attitudes affects Spanish heritage speakers' speech perception in both their languages. The first focuses on better understanding how heritage speakers' experience and attitudes with Spanish and English affects their speech perception when they interact with non-native vs. native talkers in each of their languages. The second investigates how heritage speakers' experiences and attitudes impacts perception of code-switched vs. single language speech. The results of these studies will advance the understanding of how social experiences and attitudes towards language influence speech perception, which in turn advance the understanding of language and cognition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The outer layer of our brains, the cortex, varies in thickness throughout its wrinkles and folds. This is partly determined by the forces generated during the process of cortical folding.  Because of this effect of folding on cortical thickness, it is difficult to make comparisons of thickness across different folding patterns. For example, differences during development in the womb or between different species.  In this project, the PI will investigate a new metric that removes the effect of folding on cortical thickness, called modified cortical thickness. This research will facilitate more precise and meaningful comparisons of cortical thickness. This is useful for the purposes of identifying evolutionary, developmental, and pathological changes in brain morphology.  This mechanics-informed analysis will complement other research on developmental and degenerative diseases and disorders of the brain. Thus, it has the potential to lead to new pathways for early diagnosis and effective treatment.

Such a technology has the potential to improve the clinical outcomes of surgical procedures for patients with post traumatic injuries and reduce societal costs associated with additional surgeries and rehabilitation among trauma surgery patients. In addition, it is anticipated that this drug-device combination will reduce surgery times, save money, and prevent complications among affected patients. During Phase I, the team proposes to demonstrate in vitro and in vivo feasibility towards altering the ectopic bone microenvironment with the aid of nanotechnology that will prevent ectopic bone development and progression.  The technology uses immunomodulatory nanoparticles loaded with the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Phylogenetic reconstruction is primarily accomplished through computational analysis of DNA and other biomolecular sequence data. Phylogenies and the evolutionary insights that they provide are essential to biology and other disciplines, as well as many applications: important examples include reconstructing and studying the Tree of Life - the evolutionary history of all life on Earth, understanding human origins, infectious disease epidemiology and discovery of new solutions to future pandemics, crop improvement and agriculture, and forensic science. One of the two key ingredients needed for phylogenetic studies has seen a major leap forward thanks to advances in biomolecular sequencing technology: the scale of available biomolecular data is now among the largest in any domain and, in 2025, biomolecular data velocity and storage is projected to be comparable to or larger than Twitter and YouTube. On the other hand, recent ""big data"" phylogenetic studies point to a critical gap regarding the second of the two key ingredients in phylogenetics: existing computational algorithms need to move beyond their traditional simplifying assumptions about biomolecular sequence evolution. Two of the most important assumptions are: (1) ""sequence-unaware"" methods that ignore the inherently sequential nature of biomolecular sequences, and (2) the pre hoc assumption that evolutionary relationships have a simple branching structure and are ""tree-like"" - i.e., can be accurately described by a tree or other simple representation. New computational approaches and infrastructure are needed to move beyond these traditional assumptions and unlock the study of ""future phylogenies"" and next-generation phylogenetics. This project will therefore create new pathbreaking models and algorithms for complex phylogenetic analyses of biomolecular sequence data. The project also addresses gaps in STEM education through new curriculum development and a collaboration with the Impression 5 Science Center, a children?s science museum in mid-Michigan. Project impacts will be broadened through open-source software distributions and open data resources, new scientific discoveries enabled by the developed software and data infrastructure, scientific outreach activities, and student training and mentoring with a strong emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).<br/><br/>This project will advance the field of computational phylogenetics along multiple frontiers. The first research objective is to develop new statistical resampling algorithms that move beyond ""uninformed"" analysis where biomolecular data are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and towards ""informed"" sequence-aware analysis; a central approach will be to make use of the latest advances in machine learning. The new algorithms will be used to better assess rigor and reproducibility during phylogenetic analyses and other critical-path analytical tasks. The second research objective is to create mathematical theory, statistical models, and computational algorithms to move beyond traditional phylogenetic representations (e.g., phylogenetic trees, etc.), and towards more general graph-theoretic models of complex genome evolution. The third research objective is to conduct comprehensive validation and performance assessment studies of the first two research objectives? computational frameworks. The studies will utilize both synthetic and empirical benchmarking datasets that capture a wide range of evolutionary conditions and dataset features. The project also includes two educational objectives: a new course on DEI topics in interdisciplinary computer science, and a new museum exhibit on technology and computer programming that will be exhibited at the Impression 5 Science Center. Open-source software and open data deliverables will drive future methodological research and enable otherwise inaccessible scientific discoveries, and scientific outreach will help seed and drive uptake of the project?s contributions. The project also includes student training and mentoring activities at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

The major challenge to continuous reliable BP measurements is motion artifacts due to movement, such as an arm gestures.  This project will advance development of a novel device for non-invasive beat-to-beat BP measurement in a cuff-less, wrist-wearable device.  Accurate 24-hour BP measurement at home and other settings will significantly improve outcomes for 1.5 billion people globally who suffer from chronic high BP or hypertension, a leading cause of stroke and heart attacks.

The actin cortex is a thin network of actin filaments and myosin motors coupled to the cell membrane, whose structure and organization regulate cell shape changes during migration, division, and morphogenesis. While the key molecular components of the cortex have been characterized, how they assemble and maintain diverse actin network organizations remain poorly understood. This collaborative project aims to understand the multi-scale dynamics of cortex assembly by integrating new multi-scale modeling tools with in vitro experimental techniques, which will benefit the communities of researchers studying cell biology, biophysics and mechanobiology. This collaboration will provide training in state-of-the-art simulation and experimental techniques to postdocs and students, in multidisciplinary and stimulating environments, where they will collaborate and develop international professional networks. Lessons learnt from this project will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate curriculum in Biophysics developed by the PI, to demonstrate how self-organized biological systems emerge from the interaction between molecular components.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new experimental approaches to manipulate the assembly, turnover, and force generation in reconstituted actin networks. In parallel, the researchers will build a multi-scale model for the cortex, integrating data at the molecular scale to generate predictions at the network scale that will be tested experimentally. Using these tools, the researchers aim to build cortex-like actomyosin networks that can dynamically morph into different organizations. The second aim is to determine how the mechanochemical properties of cortical actin networks can be tuned at the molecular scale to drive transitions between different force-generating actomyosin structures.

The generally northward flow through the strait is a key source of oceanic heat, freshwater, and nutrients for the Arctic, influencing the upper ~200m of roughly half of the Arctic Ocean. This provides both a stratified upper ocean layer, which protects sea-ice from deeper and warmer Atlantic origin waters, and a major source of nutrients which fuel Arctic ecosystems. Oceanic heat carried northward through the strait acts as a trigger for western Arctic sea-ice melt and is the best predictor of sea-ice retreat date in the Chukchi Sea, the highly productive, shallow sea immediately north of the strait. The freshness of the flow may influence ocean circulation as far away as the Atlantic Ocean. To understand and quantify how the climate and ecosystems of the Arctic Ocean and the Alaskan Arctic seas are changing, and how those changes relate to the rest of the globe, observations are needed to quantify the changing properties of the flow through the Bering Strait. Year-round oceanographic measurements in the strait (from moorings, i.e., instruments moored to the sea-floor) started in 1990 and show the flow is increasing in strength and temperature, and freshening dramatically in winter. These changes are believed to have significant effects on the Arctic and beyond. Additionally, satellite studies, which are indicating large increases at the base of the Arctic food chain, suggest an increased nutrient flux from the Pacific Ocean through the strait. However, to date, no year-round or interannual measurements of nutrient flow through the Bering Strait exist to test this idea. Since moorings are still the only viable way of measuring seasonal and interannual change in the Bering Strait, this project supports: four years of moorings, measuring physical properties such as flow, temperature, salinity, sea-ice; biogeochemical properties including nutrient content and measures of biological activity; and accompanying analysis and outreach efforts. The latter include making data products and results available to science, public, and industry communities as well as bringing Bering Strait and Arctic science to the general public, university students, and schools, including Bering Strait communities and public schools in the continental U.S.<br/><br/>From September 2022 to September 2026, three year-round moorings will be deployed in the US waters of the Bering Strait region, supported by annual ship-based servicing, and accompanying hydrographic surveys in the Bering Strait and southern Chukchi Sea. Hourly mooring measurements will be used to compute water properties, and fluxes of heat, freshwater, and nitrate into the Arctic. These in situ measurements will be combined with satellite data, numerical weather prediction model data, and verified Arctic model results to investigate causes of change in the throughflow, and to understand and quantify transformations in the Chukchi Sea, thus giving a better estimation of the forcings of the Bering Strait throughflow directly on the Arctic Ocean. The project aims to obtain the Bering Strait?s first year-round measurements of nitrate, the key limiting nutrient of the region, and, by extending the longest in situ physical instrument record from the Arctic Ocean, give a multidecadal measure of change in this key Arctic gateway.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the multi-billion-dollar cell therapy market is expanding rapidly in its race to develop the next generation of life-saving, cost-effective, lower toxicity cell therapy products there is a heightened requirement for safety risk management to monitor on-target, on-tumor delivery of cell products in patients.

More narrowly, hiPSC-derived in vitro organ models, termed organoids, have emerged as powerful tools to construct elaborate tissue-like architectures that can accurately mimic the morphology of numerous tissues or organs, such as the intestines, kidney, and brain. More recently, cardiac organoids were created from hiPSCs, but the spatial control of the specification and organization of multiple cardiac cells remain challenging. This CAREER project seeks to control the formation of organized cardiac organoids from hiPSCs using optogenetics, a biological technique to control the activity of cells or tissues with light, and then use these to study cardiac maturation and heart diseases. The educational mission will be integrated into this research program by engaging students at different levels into interdisciplinary stem cell research and community outreach activities, including interactive coursework, seminars, workshops, research experiences, and a public art exhibition at Purdue Galleries. <br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term career goal is to create a transformative, interdisciplinary research and education program that integrates excellence in the science and engineering of stem cell- and gene-based precision medicine with education of future scientists and engineers.  Towards this goal, this CAREER project will develop novel tools and standardized methodologies to precisely engineer human organoid morphogenesis with optogenetics for developmental studies and disease modeling. Engineering cardiogenesis in a manner mimicking native heart development will result in superior structural and functional properties of the cardiac organoids. The central hypothesis of this research is that the paracrine and juxtacrine signals induced by heterotypic cell-cell interactions within the three-dimensional (3D) cardiac organoids will enhance cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation and function. To test this hypothesis, three tasks are proposed: (1) establish a 3D optogenetic platform and validate its function in signaling patterning for multicellular morphogenesis; (2) generate cardiac organoids using optogenetics to facilitate and interrogate the maturation of hiPSC-derived CMs in 3D; and (3) investigate the influence of genetic defects on cellular composition, tissue structure and maturation of cardiac organoids. The proposed research will reveal critical factors to achieve maturation of the hiPSC-CMs and elucidate underlying mechanisms of progressive muscle weakness and death in diseased CMs. Since cell maturation is a key element of tissue engineering, this research will have broader ramifications in engineering other hiPSC-derived tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Laboratory experiments will be conducted in which cloud droplets will be exposed to radiative cooling, similar to what can happen in cloud-top generating cells in extra-tropical, cold-season cyclones or other storm systems. Cooling will be such as to induce homogeneous freezing of droplets. Changes in droplet size due to mass transfer (primarily growth via condensation) will be measured as well as temperature changes. An analytical model of the radiative cooling and condensation process will be developed. The common modeling assumptions of homogeneous (droplet-non-specific) supersaturation and droplet-non-specific radiation, which have recently been questioned, will be investigated and improved upon. Laboratory measurements will be used to develop and validate new modeling assumptions by comparing the measurements with analytical predictions. New theory will be developed for the effect of droplet-specific, non-homogeneous supersaturation. New basic scientific information about the state of homogeneously frozen droplets with solute will also be obtained.

However, there are many challenges for effective human-robot collaboration that impinge on this promise, such as communicating with human partners using natural language, providing information to an operator through a visual interface, or quickly providing information so that a person is able to offer assistance. The site will develop new autonomous robot capabilities and supporting network and data science technology to address real-world challenges of operating autonomous systems in hospital, clinic, home, and infrastructure environments.  Students will develop domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and interdisciplinary competency. The summer activities for undergraduates will provide hands-on science and engineering activities related to current research projects, and professional development with training sessions on writing a graduate school application and how to apply for fellowships to support graduate education. This REU site links projects together through the common objective of developing assistive technology that can be used in the field.<br/> <br/>The project team will mentor 10 undergraduates each summer, pursuing research directly impacting the following technical challenges: development of autonomous robot capabilities targeted for care environments, such as networked robotics devices cooperating with care professionals to perform complex tasks in support of aging in place; human command-and-control infrastructure for operations that utilize robots for technology support; and connectivity and security for a network of robots, computers, and embedded devices collectively used to address mission-critical goals while utilizing unused parts of the wireless spectrum. The site combines five projects related to these computing domains: socially appropriately navigating in public spaces; understanding user comfort through interactions; tightly-coupled collaborative human-robot teams; efficient collaboration with remotely-situated agents; and first-responder search and rescue operations with human-robot intertwined networks. Intellectual results may include discoveries about long-term human-robot interaction, wireless networking for challenging signal environments, autonomous robot capabilities for human-robot teaming, and data science tools for processing high volumes of data from real-world systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, batteries are bulky, expensive, high-maintenance, and not sustainable for the next trillion devices. Instead of relying on energy stored in a battery, an emerging class of computing devices harvests all energy needed for operation from sources such as the sun, motion, radio waves, and vibration. However, building sophisticated applications on these battery-free systems is challenging due to frequent power failures from fluctuations in energy harvesting. Programmers must figure out how to string together fragments of execution to meet application goals while dealing with novel software and hardware bugs that stem from power failures. Because of this, memory-intensive, inference-heavy, and user-facing applications have rarely materialized on battery-free devices. New general-purpose hardware platforms with accelerators and heterogeneous computing modules are needed to build these applications. However, hardware is not enough. With new hardware comes new challenges like scalability, dynamism, and memory-efficient checkpointing. This project explores intermittent computing systems and toolchain support for integrating diverse computing modules, like FPGAs, Accelerators, and Vector Processors, alongside traditional microcontrollers. The project weaves scalability across the intermittent computing system stack, leveraging these new modules to enable reactive, adaptive, and high-performance applications on this important new class of computing devices. This project will explore and prototype scalable hardware platforms, adaptive software systems, high-level programming languages, and energy introspection tools that enable even novice developers to quickly prototype sophisticated battery-free applications, despite power failures. These advancements will be demonstrated and evaluated in the context of real-world deployments in mobile health, habitat monitoring, and interactive devices.<br/><br/>Battery-free embedded systems offer a transformative and ecologically sustainable approach for building the next trillion computing devices. This project fills a gap for system designers who lack the hardware platforms, efficient runtime systems, and focused tools to build capable, data-intensive, reactive, and reliable applications with these devices. The results of this research will impact fields across scientific and industrial interests: including healthcare (wearable and body sensor networks), ecology, horticulture, infrastructure, conservation, and public utility monitoring, and many other areas where long-term, massive scale sensing is essential. The hardware, systems, and tools will speed up research and commercialization in critical sectors like smart cities and the Internet of Things. The project's demonstration applications, including smart health devices, interactive devices, and novice-focused programming environments, will provide proof of approach to encourage uptake of battery-free devices. The project includes outreach and education initiatives focused on increasing participation among Native Hawaiian youth in computing by introducing computing concepts via building sustainable and conservation-focused embedded systems applications in partnership with a Native Hawaiian serving public school and non-profit organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary aim of the symposium is using convergence science to catalyze active discussion between marine scientists and technologists and generate actionable ideas with a central focus on bringing computational and robotic intelligence to ocean observation. This will make connections for ideation to advance observation methods at various levels (national, international), during this UN Decade of the Oceans (UN 2021). This will hopefully help marine scientists understand and leverage advances in robotics and computer science and help technologists advance their science and problem solving methods to have a real societal impact with the ultimate goal of advancing the state of ocean science and our understanding of the world?s ocean. The symposium will bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds and career stages, who might not have any reason (or incentive) to interact outside their siloed environments. In other words, this effort is a form of persuasion to collaborate across disciplinary and geographic boundaries. While the latter continues to be a challenge, the anticipation is that methods in trans-national collaboration will be provided by agencies in the US and Europe during this UN Decade. The organizers expect to produce a manuscript with all participants as co-authors to expose the ideas and concepts discussed at the symposium to the larger ocean science, robotics and computer science communities.<br/><br/>Ocean science is a highly inter-disciplinary field. Yet it?s practice in the field, especially in the context of observational methods, continue to be hobbled by a mismatch between the spatial and temporal scales of observation and processes in a dynamic and harsh environment. The disconnect between the reality on the ground, the advances that have been made in the computational and robotic sciences, and the actual needs in ocean science are stark and at the heart of what the Azores Symposium aims to address. The principal focus of this meeting therefore is convergence science to address the gaps between the science needs and the available technologies. Since ocean science is a vast field, the core domain this symposium will focus on, is the upper water-column biogeochemistry and physics. The meeting will be highly transdisciplinary with leading experts from across Europe and the US. The meeting will have an atypical method of interaction that is augmented by more probing participation. The organizers intend to use a highly participatory approach used by the Cognitive Science community. Also, in this Decade of the Ocean, it provides a distinct foci for scientists and technologists to make a coherent thrust in working together to make concrete progress in observational methods. In large part this is doable, because of the maturity and advances in computational and robotic sciences, which leverage decades of funding in the US and Europe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will focus on developing a lightweight, easy-to-install, non-combustible insulation product which is also eco-friendly and non-toxic.  Structure fires represent 37% of all fires in the US. These fires caused $12.3 billion in property damage and 80% of civilian fire deaths.  Wildfires in the Western US, where >$220 billion in residential construction is in ?extreme? wildfire-prone areas, add to the urgency of this situation.  Mineral wool is the only non-combustible insulation product available today but requires personal protective equipment for installation and was recently classified as carcinogenic.  Fully non-combustible building insulation is a high growth market, and the broader market for all types of non-flammable insulation represents a significant opportunity.  This Phase II project seeks to cost-effectively increase the supply of energy-efficient, non-combustible buildings for both new and retrofit construction, while also addressing high-temperature industrial markets which have the most intensive energy use.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to scale up a novel nanocomposite insulation product using a proprietary foaming process for inorganic aerogel-based insulation that minimizes shrinkage (thus maximizing porosity for insulation performance and minimizing material and processing cost). This approach leverages readily available materials such as clay and silica, as well as potentially renewable cellulose biomass, to produce an environmentally friendly, high performance insulation product for non-combustible buildings which is easy to install, lightweight, and non-toxic.  Successfully scaling this approach on existing manufacturing equipment may solve a significant materials research challenge, creating organic-inorganic nanocomposites for thermal insulation with a competitive cost / performance ratio versus incumbent products such as fiberglass, mineral wool, and plastic foams.  The Phase II project may result in the first industrially-engineered composite material for thermal insulation which is fully non-combustible.  The integration of flexible polymers and radiation blocking additives would also enable use for high-temperature industrial pipe insulation, a critical energy-saving application where most existing products have significant limitations due to radiation loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These devices will have a large impact on ocean wave energy harvesters along the US coastline, a substantial source of potential green energy. Traditional approaches to wave-based energy harvesting have narrower operating conditions, while the energy harvesters developed in this project will have capability to produce higher energy with lower costs due to broader capabilities.  This PFI-TT project also lends itself to powering remote sensors in situations where batteries or powerlines are not easily installed, such as for civil infrastructure like bridges.

Operating at resonance enables more energy harvesting, which benefits sensing and power generation applications. The proposed project will first experimentally validate the computational model using a stationary table-top rig. During this validation, a basic, unoptimized prototype will be developed for sensing applications for self-powered sensors and the harvesting of energy in ocean waves.

Different types of pollution, however, can reduce water quality and harm the plants, animals, and people that depend on water to live. Specifically, recent wildfires across the U.S. may reduce water quality in several ways. For example, ash from wildfires can end up in lakes and rivers, potentially harming aquatic organisms and drinking water supplies. In this project, a group of researchers will study water quality of northern Minnesota lakes after the 2021 Greenwood Fire. This wildfire burned a large part of Superior National Forest in fall 2021, including areas near 28 lakes. The researchers expect that after spring snowmelt or rain, ash and large pieces of burned plants will wash into these lakes and reduce water quality. They will visit lakes five times from spring to late summer of 2022 to document any water quality changes following the Greenwood Fire. Results of this study will help water managers in Minnesota and elsewhere predict how water quality in lakes and reservoirs may change after future wildfires. This project will also help people who live near lakes understand how the water activities they care about, such as fishing and boating, may be affected by future wildfires.<br/><br/>Although wildfire activity is increasing across the U.S. and concern is mounting over fire effects on water resources, few studies have documented fire effects on lake ecosystems. At 10844 ha in size, the 2021 Greenwood Fire in Superior National Forest was the largest lightning-caused Minnesota wildfire in 10 years and covered all or parts of 28 lake watersheds through October 2021. This project assembled an integrative group of aquatic ecosystem, landscape, and fire ecologists to study the physical, chemical, and biological responses of northern Minnesota lakes to the Greenwood Fire. The researchers hypothesized that (1) lake responses will vary proportionally to the percent watershed burned and between drainage vs. isolated lakes and (2) post-fire temporal trajectories will vary according to major hydrologic events (e.g., snowmelt, precipitation). Both hypotheses are being tested using Bayesian approaches (i.e., information theoretic modeling and model choice procedures). Approximately 15 lakes are being sampled each in (1) burned and (2) unburned control watersheds beginning after spring snowmelt, a critical time for the delivery of nutrients and materials from the burned landscape to lakes, and throughout summer 2022.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concurrently, they have created significant and justified public concerns about privacy. Society is in the midst of crossing a new frontier where millions of devices ranging from simpler Internet-of-Things devices (sensing) to (semi) autonomous vehicles (cars, drones) are connected over networks. A natural question is whether and how one can leverage large-scale local data collection in this emerging ecosystem to collaboratively build distributed personalized learning systems. This motivates the central question of this project, namely, how to design personalized learning models with information-theoretic privacy and security guarantees. The research outcomes of this project will be broadly disseminated, through publications, involvement of the PI in teaching and interaction with industry.  <br/><br/>One would ideally like to design personalized systems that can leverage large-scale collaboration, maintain privacy of local data, and require trust only on one's own devices as opposed to other entities. This project therefore explores how to design privacy schemes which also give good personalized learning performance, and how to design robust collaborative schemes that give good personalized learning performance despite malicious participants. In particular, in the task on privacy for personalized learning, the project plans to explore designs of personalized privacy mechanisms that are robust to iterative interactions necessary for collaborative learning and analyze its privacy-performance trade-off using information-theoretic and statistical tools. In the task on security for personalized learning, the project leverages ideas from high-dimensional robust statistics and information theory to develop robust mechanisms with theoretical guarantees to enable personalized learning in the presence of malicious participating devices, including investigating when collaboration is beneficial.

But these signals vary from language to language. This project examines how children learn to identify the communicative acts of the people speaking to them while learning the surface signals associated with these acts. Specifically, this project investigates how children come to associate interrogatives (""Do you want a cookie?"") to questions. Mapping interrogatives to questions present interesting acquisition challenges. First, children need to figure out the form of interrogative clauses in their language: while all languages tend to have dedicated clauses for questions, the syntactic makeup of these interrogatives differ: in English, interrogatives usually differ from declaratives in word order (e.g. ""Do you want a cookie"" vs. ""I want a cookie""), but not in Mandarin. To figure out the form of their language?s interrogatives, children need to notice regularities in form. But how do children figure out which regularities matter, and how do they associate clause types with their canonical function? Second, children need to figure out when speakers are asking questions (vs. making assertions or requests). But how can they do so, if they can?t yet rely on the forms typically used for these acts? Previous research shows that, despite the complexity of the task, children understand interrogatives and their conventionalized function as questions before age three. To investigate how children solve this complex mapping problem, this project examines how questions are asked in speech to children, using what forms, comparing English and Mandarin: how much formal regularity is there in how parents ask questions? And are there extralinguistic cues in speakers? behavior that can give away questionhood (e.g., pauses in conversation or focus of attention)? <br/><br/>The project tests the hypothesis that children learn to identify speech act (question) and clause type (interrogative) in tandem and mutually informative ways: children learn to identify interrogatives by tracking formal regularities in conjunction with their growing knowledge of questionhood and its associated social cues; similarly, they identify questions by tracking social cues in conjunction with their growing understanding of interrogative syntax. The project will consist of two corpus studies and one computational model: Study 1 examines conversations between English-speaking parent-child dyads and Study 2 conversations between Mandarin parent-child dyads, where parent utterances will be annotated for pragmatic, prosodic, and syntactic features. The annotated data will then be used to test the viability of this pragmatic syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis via computational modeling (Study 3).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But a growing number of exonerations and an expanding body of literature point to troubling flaws in the informal and swift plea process. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of plea-bargaining decisions, including how race affects plea decisions, is critical if we are to preserve the fundamental rights of defendants and the integrity of our criminal justice system. Examining and identifying the role of defense attorneys ? who are realistically at the heart of the plea decisions ? and exploring how real-world circumstances affect their plea recommendations will guide the development of sound plea bargaining policies and will support practitioners in their pursuit of justice.<br/><br/>A series of four studies will isolate variables that frequently occur in the real world of defense attorneys and plea bargaining, and study attorneys? predictive accuracy (i.e. how accurately they predict jury verdicts) and plea recommendations. Attorneys will review a hypothetical criminal case file containing various pieces of evidence and will be asked to make plea recommendations based on the case file. Mock jurors will view a corresponding video of a mock trial containing the same evidence as the case file viewed by participating attorneys. However, the contents of the attorney case file will be manipulated to reflect real-world scenarios. The first study will manipulate evidence (pointing to guilt/innocence) and the defendant?s assertion of guilt/innocence, to better understand which carries more weight in the eyes of a defense attorney: evidence or a client?s assertion. The second study will examine how direct indications of guilt or innocence, in conjunction with a defendant?s assertion of guilt or innocence affects plea recommendations and attorneys? beliefs about guilt status. The third study will address the question of how incomplete access to case files affects plea recommendations. Since plea decisions are often made quickly, with a time limit, this study will aim to understand how defense attorneys decide whether to recommend a plea offer without having seen all the facts of a case. Finally, the fourth study will explore how inadmissible evidence influences attorneys? plea recommendations. This study will manipulate the presence of inadmissible evidence such as criminal history or hearsay testimony in case files to analyze how attorneys then differentially recommend pleas. Results from these studies will help inform the development of a more nuanced plea-bargaining research model than currently exists and will refine our understanding of how attorneys make plea recommendation when faced with the constraints of the plea process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With water covering 70 percent of the Earth, a large part of the economy, called ?Blue Economy? and valued to be at least US$24 trillion, relies on a healthy aquatic world, requiring its study and monitoring. Robots could automate these tasks. However, to date, aquatic robots deployed in practice are expensive (in the order of US$100k-US$1M). Current multi-robot exploration algorithms are not robust underwater, as the intrinsic limitations posed by the aquatic domain and inexpensive robot configuration are not explicitly considered ? such as absence of global localization and communication infrastructure (e.g., GPS and cellular network) and limited communication bandwidth (bits per seconds). This project will produce resilient cooperative exploration algorithms for teams of inexpensive Autonomous Surface and Underwater Vehicles, that explicitly consider those limitations. This project outcomes will advance the state of the art on low-cost mobile robot autonomy in extreme environments. More broadly, the project will contribute to lower the barrier to entry in aquatic robotics and catalyze a broader educational outreach and support tasks for a healthy aquatic world. This project integrates research activities with educational and outreach plans; example include targeting environmental monitoring tasks with real deployments, organizing a summer camp for K-12 students, and involving undergraduate/graduate students in research. <br/><br/>The project will intellectually contribute on novel algorithmic developments to three fundamental robotics research themes and on a comprehensive system integration with real low-cost robots in real aquatic environments: (1) resilient cooperative multirobot 3D exploration by probabilistic modeling of localization and communication constraints, optimizing multiple conflicting objectives, and reasoning in a probabilistic representation to find a safe optimal path; (2) resilient communication by tightly coupling state estimation and planning to calculate information value and designing an optimization framework to minimize the use of the low-bandwidth communication channel, but ensure situational awareness;  (3) graceful recovery by designing algorithms that calculate a non-myopic rendezvous trajectory based on explicit modeling of localization and communication and allow for adaptive coalition formation to avoid loss of the single robot and of the whole system; (4) integration of the algorithms with a team of inexpensive custom-made ASVs and AUVs, which will be rigorously tested in simulations, real pool and lake/ocean environments. The research expected outcomes are new algorithms for low-cost aquatic robots that will augment their exploration capabilities and allow simpler deployments.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to playing an important role during development and throughout aging, aberrations in DNA methylation have been discovered to cause disease, including cancer and neurological disorders. Yet much is still unknown regarding where DNA methylation changes occur and which genes they impact. This, coupled with its dynamic nature, which can vary across regions of the body, throughout the life cycle, and in response to the environment, makes accurately identifying the association of specific methylation patterns to biological phenomena of interest and interpreting their downstream impacts challenging. The project will result in a suite of new tools to enable analysis of methylation sites across experimental technologies, analyze methylation data in the context of different tissues and cell types, and predict the downstream impacts of methylation sites that are changing across conditions. These tools will enable researchers to better interpret their methylation data in light of existing knowledge, which can in turn result in improved understanding of fundamental biological processes (e.g., development, aging). In addition to making all methods available as open-source software, databases of predictions and interactive visualizations will be developed and accessible online. By doing so, biological researchers with no programming experience can use a query-based system to easily make and explore predictions in the context of their own data. This project also has a local outreach component to help increase the diversity and persistence of underrepresented minorities in STEM by engaging high school biology teachers and community college students with newly designed data driven curricula as well as research opportunities.<br/><br/>The research will adapt cutting edge deep learning methods used for imputation in other domains to increase the coverage of DNA methylation platforms that profile <10% of all sites, saving time and resources; use a hierarchical framework that mirrors natural tissue and cell type dependencies to find location-specific methylation hallmarks; and incorporate known protein-protein interactions to associate CpG sites with biological function, beyond existing methods which primarily capture proximal regulatory relationships. In addition to the methodological contributions of this work, the project is inherently interdisciplinary and will lay the groundwork for understanding fundamental biological questions such as how methylation regulates and maintains tissue specificity.

It has been found to be key for cellular responses to external stimuli from immune response in mammals to climate adaptation in plants, and it has been implicated in common diseases, from autoimmune (e.g. multiple sclerosis) to neurodegenerative (e.g., Alzheimer?s disease). Despite its importance, the tools to study AS have been limited by technological (short read) and conceptual problems. The former problem is now being addressed by the increasing availability and affordability of long read sequencing. However, the latter problem remains unaddressed. Long reads have been used to identify which alternatively spliced isoforms are present in cells, but not to statistically identify changes in AS or the specific splicing events involved. This research project is an attempt to fundamentally transform how AS is analyzed, into a unified framework making joint use of all available data (both long and short reads). Software tools will be developed under the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) criteria including open source sharing of code and package distribution. An annual three-day codeathon based at New York Genome Center (NYGC) specifically targeting women and underrepresented minorities (recruited from Barnard College and Hunter College respectively) will be organized. <br/><br/>This project proposes a new conceptual framework for AS analysis that 1) unifies local and isoform-level quantification, 2) accounts for uncertainty to enable powerful statistical testing, 3) enables exploratory data analysis of large-scale datasets, and 4) can jointly leverage short and/or long read RNA-seq data. This framework will use network flow algorithms to connect local splicing events with isoform usage rates, develop well-calibrated statistical tests, and convex dimensionality reduction techniques accounting for varying noise levels. These tools will be developed in the context of impactful real world applications (neurodevelopmental gene regulation, neurodegenerative disease progression, and spliceosomal mutant cancer) in close collaboration with colleagues at the NYGC, the non-profit research institute where the PI is co-affiliated.

Typical examples are emulsions and foams that are present in a range of consumer products such as food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products. Interfaces also play a central role in living systems such as cells and tissue. In soft, deformable materials, the interfaces can respond to relatively weak forces and this response can also be triggered by thermal fluctuations. Understanding the behavior of fluctuating soft interfaces is important not only for fundamental science but also for enhanced product formulations and the design of functional materials. However, computational modeling of complex interfaces remains challenging because a wide range of length and time scales have to be considered.

But how they do so, and how each shapes the organization and dynamics of the other, remains poorly understood. We will address this challenge in nematode worm embryos, combining advanced microscopy, genetic and biophysical manipulations and mathematical modeling.  In addition to providing new insight into mechanisms that govern the rapid remodeling of early embryos.

We will determine how the architecture of adhesion networks are shaped by actin network architecture, contractility and flow, and how in turn, patterns of contractility and flow are shaped by anchorage of contractile networks at cell-cell contacts. Finally, we will use physical theory and modeling, constrained by microscopic observations and biophysical measurements, to understand how physical coupling between these two networks controls the balance of frictional slippage and force transmission across contacts. This work will yield fundamental new insights into how early embryos can orchestrate rapid remodeling using the highly conserved molecular machinery that governs contractility and adhesion.

Nationally, STEM teaching positions are often hard to staff and retain, particularly in high-need, rural schools. This project will address this need by awarding scholarships to STEM students who will earn a bachelor?s degree in mathematics, chemistry, or biology while completing a secondary education minor and teacher licensure program. These STEM students will also complete their student teaching practicums in high-need schools and teach in high-need school districts for a minimum of four years after graduation. The project will provide a unique blend of short- and long-term field experiences, one-on-one and group mentoring and tutoring, and innovative new-teacher support.  The project has potential to contribute to knowledge on how to prepare and support teachers in predominantly rural high-need school districts. In turn, the project aims to increase the number of STEM graduates prepared to teach in high-need schools and address the STEM teacher shortage in Kansas and Missouri, and across the United States.<br/><br/>This project at the University of Saint Mary (USM) includes partnerships with Donnelly College, a two-year Hispanic Serving Institution, and the local education agencies (LEAs) of Leavenworth, Lansing, and Tonganoxie. Project goals are to: (1) recruit, retain, and graduate eighteen highly qualified STEM secondary teaching candidates; (2) increase opportunities for preservice clinical training in high-need partner schools; and (3) increase the retention rate of STEM teacher alumni in high-need schools. The project is based on the theoretical basis that with the support of three mentors (faculty, in-service teachers, and district-appointed) along with a total of 130 hours of field experience, the completers of the program will be more likely to become highly effective teachers who are retained in their positions in high-need LEAs. The project will contribute to the knowledge base regarding how the mentorship and in-service hours contribute to placing and retaining STEM teachers in these high-need LEAs. The project will be evaluated using a mixed-methods approach that includes process (formative) and outcome (summative) components. In collaboration with an external evaluator, the leadership team will disseminate results locally, regionally, and nationally through meetings with partners and organizations and submissions to scholarly journals and conferences.

For example, 'again' in 'I won again' suggests that it was already established that the speaker had won previously. A hallmark of presuppositions is the fact that they are preserved under logical operators like negation: a sentence like 'I didn?t win again' continues to suggest a prior victory. The issue of how presuppositions interact with their surrounding context ? how presuppositions project ? has been a central and hotly debated topic in the study of natural language meaning. This dissertation project aims to contribute to this debate by examining presupposition projection in sentences where theories diverge. The project approaches this empirical terrain from an innovative angle, turning to online processing and child language acquisition, which can shed new light on the logical and inferential systems that underlies human semantic competence. The project includes the training and mentoring of undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>The project will carry out a series of psycholinguistic experiments with adults and children, with the goal of distinguishing between two classes of theories: (i) theories that predict that the presuppositions of conditionals and conjunctions should vary based on the position of the presupposition-carrying expression, and (ii) ones that predict uniform presuppositions across the board. Study 1 probes adults' real-time processing of presupposition projection, with the goal of identifying behavioral signatures of presupposition projection. Study 2 turns to child language, where the influence of confounding pragmatic factors is minimized. Finally, Study 3 probes in more detail how other, non-linguistic factors influence judgments about presuppositions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the other hand, rigid robots offer many advantages in terms of precision and ease of control. The novel hybrid robot design considered in this project will combine these two technologies to provide the advantages of both. This grant supports research to produce new knowledge related to modular design and reliable human-robot collaboration using this hybrid design paradigm. The new modular robots will be able to adapt to new environments, move across varied terrains, and operate in a wide variety of environmental conditions. This project will result in improved robotic capability for exploration of difficult terrains such as those found during search and rescue, inspection, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The new robot capabilities will also benefit future extra-terrestrial missions. The project includes summer research opportunities for undergraduate students and educational outreach activities to K-12 students to support soft robotics education.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the theory and practice of soft robots by creating novel and hybrid (incorporating both stiff and soft elements) physical hardware designs to offset limitations of each individual technology. The research tasks are aimed at advancing the seamless integration and operation of non-collocated human-robot teams and are aligned in two thrusts. The first thrust considers modular design for extreme environments using low-degree-of freedom modules connected by reversible, completely sealed permanent magnet connectors. Modules communicate with each other via wireless protocols to enable distributed control algorithms. Dynamic modeling and simulation are used to discover a hybrid locomotion strategy based on a learning central pattern generator. The project also creates motion planning algorithms for bioinspired, topologically reconfigurable soft robots. The second thrust focuses on reliable non-collocated human robot collaboration, including high-level teleoperation, topological transformation strategies to mitigate module failures, automatic gait re-selection based on fault diagnosis techniques, and a consensus decision-making system to enable functional modules to disable nonfunctional ones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In each case, there is abundant text available to educators and researchers that could provide insight into how we form engineers. Unfortunately, while these texts have the potential to provide novel insights, traditional analytic techniques do not scale well. Time investments, bias, interrater reliability, and intrarater reliability each present significant challenges. To address this problem, we aim to develop and characterize approaches for human-in-the-loop (HITL) natural language processing (NLP) systems to augment human analysis, facilitating and enhancing the work of one person (or team). Such systems can help reduce the amount of time needed to analyze texts by grouping similar texts together. The human user can utilize these groupings for further analysis and identify meanings in ways only a human could. The system will also improve consistency by analyzing across the entire collection of texts simultaneously and grouping similar items together. This is in contrast with a single person or a team that would analyze responses sequentially, creating the potential for inconsistencies across time. <br/><br/>We will accomplish this work in three phases. In Phase 1, we will conduct a series of experiments to test potential system configurations. The goal will be to identify optimal components and parameter settings for four of the steps in the proposed pipeline. We will use datasets from (i) students? written responses to an instrument for assessing their systems thinking and (ii) students? responses to open-ended course feedback surveys. We will measure performance based on consistency of thematic clusters, using standard metrics for homogeneity in text clustering and classification tasks. In Phase 2, we will study system performance on a series of five datasets. These datasets will come from multiple sources: extant NSF-funded projects, longitudinal data from the Virginia Tech College of Engineering, current data in engineering courses, and freshly collected data from online outlets.  These represent important areas of the broader ecosystem that supports how we form future engineers. We will test the system for thematic clusters, employing similar metrics as in Phase 1 to identify potential inconsistencies in how different datasets are handled. We will specifically look for homogeneity of texts within a cluster and shared semantic meaning. We will also update the original system designs in the event of systematic differences (e.g., longer texts require a different system configuration). For Phase 3, we will study how it can affect human performance. Since we anticipate significant improvements in human efficiency and consistency, it is important to conduct analyses that can accurately assess the veracity of that proposition. These studies will assess the HITL aspect of this process since many relevant applications of the system will require additional interpretation of the raw output. To accomplish this, we will collect data on differences in human performance when analyzing 1,500 student responses with and without the system?s assistance. We will look at differences when (a) one person alone codes the data and when (b) a team of three researchers codes the data (i.e., we will have two studies: one person with vs one person without and team with vs team without). We will measure differences in coding (whether different themes emerge), reliability (how consistently similar texts are grouped together), time needed to code the data, and differential treatment of student responses associated with student group characteristics.  We will host all code on public repositories and notebooks for easy access, copying, and application by other engineering education researchers and teachers along with any new datasets, where appropriate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students? interest in science significantly relates to their science performance, but few list it as their most interesting subject. One way to promote interest in science and to make learning and teaching more enjoyable is to support students? curiosity. In addition to its importance to motivation and innovation in STEM areas, curiosity has been shown to lead to learning that more personally meaningful and better remembered. Curiosity can be momentary, including the recognition that there is something specific to be learned and the desire to seek that specific information at that particular time, but it can also be developed as a stable characteristic of comfort with uncertainty and a general inclination to seek out what is unknown and can be learned. This research project will study how curiosity develops, the ways that classroom learning experiences influence curiosity, and how curiosity can be taught so as to support STEM learning. It will include a series of lab experiments and classroom-based studies with 2nd grade students. The project will also involve an extensive education and teaching component in which undergraduate students will be mentored in research methods and K-12, university, and museum instructors will be mentored on what, according to research, are the best teaching practices for inspiring curiosity. The project is funded as a CAREER award from the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, with co-funding from the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK12) program, which supports applied research in STEM learning.<br/><br/>Few research studies on curiosity and information have been conducted with children and even fewer have been conducted in real-world school contexts. This research will entail a series of lab experiments and classroom-based studies exploring the influence of learning experiences on 2nd grade students? academic curiosity and the association between curiosity and engagement, motivation, and learning. The studies will address the following aims: 1) Understand how to create curiosity by assessing how learning experiences influence students? curiosity to learn; 2) Explore what curious classroom learning looks like by testing the associations between curiosity and engagement and motivation to learn in classrooms; and 3) Investigate learning from curiosity by testing whether learning when curious leads to more robust understanding and transfer. The work will build on on-going correlational research on curiosity and learning and attempt to draw causal links though a treatment condition design. The development and validation of measures of curiosity and of children?s preference for uncertainty for use in real-world settings promises to be of benefit to other researchers in the field. In addition, the project will involve an assessment of the alignment of findings about how to foster curiosity with university-level teaching practices, including studies of long-term impacts of curiosity in college students. The educational integration will be done in partnership with the university?s Center for Teaching Excellence, a local children?s museum, educators across domains, and student researchers.

Existing systems put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. Using only a single drop of blood, the proposed non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting for all patients and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by more than 3x.

The overarching goal of this project is to develop and apply new understanding of high-time-resolution Arctic records of methane and carbon monoxide. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and carbon monoxide is linked to the atmospheric lifetime of other greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide. Thus, developing reliable records of both gases is important for understanding past and future atmospheric chemistry and radiative forcing. High-depth-resolution records of carbon monoxide, and to a lesser extent methane,  in Arctic ice cores show evidence of non-atmospheric anomalies that are poorly understood. One potential source of such anomalies is biological activity within the ice. Microbes can be active at temperatures well below freezing, and ice cores are subjected to relatively warm temperatures after the ice is extracted from glaciers and ice sheets while they are stored or transported prior to measurement. Special sample handling protocols will be used to evaluate the effects of post-collection ice temperature on methane and carbon monoxide production, and potentially allow development of methane and carbon monoxide records over recent centuries that are free from any artifacts. Funding will support early career investigators, graduate students and undergraduate students who will be involved in field work, laboratory analysis, and data interpretation. The investigators will involve undergraduates from underrepresented groups to foster diversity in earth sciences. Public outreach will be achieved through public lectures, lab tours, and media interactions. <br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to (1) investigate the rate and timing of temperature-dependent in situ biological production of carbon monoxide and methane in an Arctic ice core, (2) develop records of atmospheric carbon monoxide and methane spanning recent centuries that are free of in situ production artifacts, and (3) determine the roles that ice impurity concentration and microbial community structure play in situ gas production. To accomplish these goals, a 150-meter ice core will be collected at Summit, Greenland using the large-diameter Blue Ice Drill. To address goal (1), successive measurements of carbon monoxide and methane will be made in the field on eight parallel longitudinal samples from a 12 meter-long section of the core, with the different samples consistently stored and monitored at temperatures ranging from well below the -31 °C ice sheet temperature at Summit to well above the -26 °C cell vitrification temperature where cellular metabolism is possible. For goal (2), measurements of these two gases will be made in the field on ice that has been kept consistently at -40 °C after extraction.

The proposed system seeks to progress visualization, sensor and algorithm technologies to semi-automate drainage procedures,  standardizing delivery of care and reducing the required clinical resources (personnel and required hospital equipment). Healthcare costs continue to increase in the United States (US). This trend, coupled with current and projected manpower shortages in the healthcare sector, is driving the relevant stakeholders to consider innovative solutions to appropriately manage healthcare costs while still providing high-quality healthcare to patients. While other sectors of the economy have greatly benefited from increased use of automation to improve efficiency and cost containment, for a variety of reasons, the healthcare sector is lagging in implementing these innovations in a systemic way. With this opportunity in mind, this Phase I STTR project aims to prove the feasibility of developing a unique, semi-autonomous robotic platform that will be adaptable to many medical procedures. As envisioned, the technology may lead to key advances, including improved patient outcomes and levels of care while increasing procedure/staff efficiencies, and reducing medical costs. <br/><br/>The objective of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate a proof of concept for an integrated procedural unit for semi-autonomously performing paracenteses. The prototype system to be completed during this stage is comprised of an ultrasound probe, motorized anesthetic syringe, scalpel, and aspiration needle, and can be integrated into standard, commercially available robotic units. The algorithm will be developed using Bayesian indexing  based on ultrasound images to execute ascites fluid removal in both virtual and mechanical simulations. Based on the preliminary work done by the multidisciplinary team of medical, robotic, and artificial intelligence (AI)) experts, the company plans to create and test a compact robotic device with the required sensory and driving components. This robotic device will have multiple subunits arranged in a compact and innovative way, capable of accurately imaging and controlling various instruments essential for anesthetizing and then driving the necessary cannulas for fluid aspiration. The project objectives include: (i) design and manufacture of the robotic system, (ii) development of AI-driven segmentation of ultrasound images and optimization of needle placement, and (iii) design and implementation of control algorithms for safe and robust operation of the surgical robot.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to increase research productivity by streamlining the administrative process for research while maintaining effective stewardship of and full accountability for federal funds. More specifically, FDP strives to maximize research performance per federal dollar by minimizing the monetary and time burdens associated with the administrative aspects of federally-sponsored research. Since its inception, the FDP has successfully worked to reduce administrative burden while accommodating continuous changes to the policies and regulations most significant to research administration. <br/><br/>Through the unique forum provided by the FDP, federal agency officials work collaboratively with administrative, faculty, and technical representatives from a broad range of academic research institutions to identify and assess unnecessary burden resulting from policies and processes that can be addressed only through cooperation. Targeted projects, pilots, surveys, and demonstrations are an important and defining component of the FDP. Once a new approach is successfully beta tested by a few willing institutions and agencies within the FDP, it is generally accepted by the FDP?s members and often by most research funding agencies and recipients.<br/><br/>Member agencies can, and routinely do, use the FDP as a sounding board for potential changes that they are considering and/or will soon be required to implement. Grants officers from research funding agencies report out to the FDP membership during the annual meetings held three times per year focused on impending changes in policies, timelines, and practices and openly solicit community feedback and reaction, both positive and negative. The opportunity for an open and free exchange of information and ideas is invaluable.

Yet there is no easy or generally acceptable way of measuring preferences from data.  The proposed research develops a portable, scalable, and easy to measure preference revelation (elicitation) method called the Bayesian Adaptive Choice Experiment (BACE).  BACE improves upon existing preference elicitation approaches that are used in policy analysis, regulation, and litigation. The method will be applied to study important and policy-relevant questions:  (i) preferences for job amenities such as workplace flexibility, and firm provision of such amenities---important considerations in the face of global technical and organizational changes.  This is important as global technical and organizational changes have the potential to alter the structure of work as the costs of providing workplace amenities shift over time. (ii) in preferences for public policies, the research produces method of comparing the welfare benefits of various policies for different demographic groups. In addition to these applications, BACE shows the potential for a new generation of surveys and experimental methods to do much more in helping researchers and policymakers value non-market resources.  The results of this research will contribute significantly to improve economic analyses as well as improve the quality of public policies and business decisions and thus increase economic growth.  <br/><br/>BACE provides an efficient dynamic elicitation procedure for conducting choice experiments. It does so by generating the information-maximizing sequence of choice scenarios based on a prior that gets updated with previous answers to obtain individual-level Bayesian posterior estimates. The procedure allows for a higher precision of the parameter estimates with fewer choice scenarios presented to each subject while also overcoming systematic biases in estimating average preference parameters from commonly used static approaches. Applying the method to preferences for job amenities, the resulting individual-level preference data makes it possible to estimate a new model of compensating differentials that extends the classic Rosen (1986) framework.  Applying BACE to willingness to pay for public policies produces new evidence on the correlates of policy preferences and leads to novel estimates of the Marginal Value of Public Funds. The implementation of BACE in this research is a step forward in allowing such procedures to be widely adopted to measure important inputs for understanding a broad range of phenomena in social sciences.

While warming may lead to increased growth in forests limited by short, cold growing seasons, climate change could also lead to surprises. One example is a decoupling between temperature variability and annual growth rates in boreal forest trees that has been detected over the past few decades. This ?divergence problem? suggests that tree growth in some arctic forest systems is no longer limited by temperature. The causes are not well understood and can be hard to test due to other factors impacting growth, such as drought due to the warming climate. This project will test for divergence across the treeline forests of northern North America, especially in rapidly warming regions of Alaska and northwestern Canada. The investigators will use tree-ring records obtained from the wood of ancient trees, a combination of mathematical methods and modeling, and wood anatomy analysis, to better understand forest growth patterns related to divergence. Broader Impacts: New measurements are critical if we are to understand how boreal forests interact with the atmosphere and feedback with other features of the global environment. This project will contribute to this understanding by estimating relationships between climate and forest growth using tree rings at sites spanning many northern locations. The project provides funding for students, Native American citizens, and for teachers to take part in Arctic research.<br/><br/>The rapid warming of the Arctic is expected to impact profoundly northern forest systems. While warming may lead to greater productivity and growth in forests typically limited by short, cold growing seasons, the speed and magnitude of climate change could also lead to surprises. One example is a decoupling between temperature variability and annual growth rates in boreal forest trees that has been detected at forest sites since the middle of the twentieth century. This phenomenon, known as the ?divergence problem?, suggests that tree growth in some Arctic forest systems is no longer primarily limited by temperature. The causes are not well understood and have been difficult to test due to the co-varying biological, physiological, and environmental factors potentially impacting recent tree growth. One hypothesis is that once warming has surpassed a physiological threshold, drought stress limits growth.  Another hypothesis is  ?global dimming?, in which increased atmospheric aerosols decrease the amount of solar radiation available for photosynthesis. This project will assess current divergence hypotheses across the treeline forests of northern North America, emphasizing rapidly warming regions of Alaska and northwestern Canada, which appear to be key areas for divergence-type effects. The project will leverage a new, large compilation of tree-ring data (already in hand) and update key locations that have shown early evidence of unusual growth decline despite recent warming. Detection of recent changes in growth parameters will use a novel, integrated combination of statistical techniques, quantitative wood anatomy methods, and tree growth modeling to develop a detailed assessment of the extent, causes, and carbon cycle implications of divergence. Broader Impacts: New measurements of boreal forest dynamics are critical for understanding how boreal systems interact with the changing atmosphere and the feedbacks between coupled earth system domains. This project will contribute to this understanding by developing quantitative estimates of climate/growth interactions at daily to centennial time scales and spatial scales from cellular to continental, yielding valuable, novel data for modeling of environmental change and productivity in northern forests. The project provides three years of support for a graduate student, funding for high school curricular development and courses in native educational settings, and fieldwork-based opportunities for a teacher to take part in hands-on Arctic research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indirectly through their energy use, buildings contribute about 35% of the total annual carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption in the U.S. There is a significant potential for reducing energy use of buildings and their associated environmental impact by using advanced control of HVAC systems. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Energy has initiated a national strategy on grid-interactive efficient buildings, that will help triple the energy efficiency and demand flexibility of buildings and improve the power grid efficiency and reliability. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a potential advanced building control technology to attain these goals. However, its transition to practice has been hampered by fundamental challenges, including the difficulty and high cost of developing accurate building models for control and the high engineering effort to implement MPC in buildings. This project will lay the scientific foundation for overcoming these fundamental challenges of MPC for buildings, integrating machine learning, control theory, optimization theory, and building science. It will develop novel methods and algorithms for data-driven learning and control of HVAC systems, and demonstrate them in experiments with real buildings. More broadly, this research will advance scientific knowledge in learning and control of complex physical systems, which will have far-reaching impacts in many other applications. It will integrate research efforts into education and outreach, including new research opportunities for undergraduate students and outreach activities to K-12 school students and the public to enrich public understanding of building energy efficiency and its technologies. These efforts are complemented by extensive recruitment and mentorship of underrepresented minorities in STEM.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a new framework, theory, and methods for effective and efficient data-driven modeling, learning, and control of building HVAC systems by bridging machine learning, dynamics, control, and optimization.

The feasibility and merits of these methods will be validated through extensive experimental verification on a variety of real buildings. This project provides a path towards autonomous, performant, and practical LB-MPC for buildings by establishing a holistic physics-informed data-driven modeling foundation and a suite of learning, control, and optimization methods for building HVAC systems. It will bridge the gap between black-box and gray-box modeling approaches to advance the state of the art on control-oriented building modeling by effectively incorporating appropriate domain insights into data-driven models, enabling reliable, sample-efficient, and accurate data-driven models. It also has the potential to transform the collection of training data for data-driven building modeling through active learning methods that find the optimal excitation trajectory for learning. Finally, it will overcome the computational challenges of data-driven control by formulating effective and tractable LB-MPC optimization problems and tailoring algorithms for solving these problems efficiently.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Psycholinguists often use their occasional mistakes as a way to understand the mechanisms that underlie this speed and ease. This project investigates two varieties of language comprehension errors, which reveal the underlying computations that allow language users to understand most sentences so successfully. The first of these errors involves the failure to notice anomalous word substitutions. For example, when asked ""what is the name of the holiday during which children dress up and go door to door giving candy?"", many people do not notice the substitution of ""giving"" for ""receiving"" and simply answer ""Halloween"". The failure to detect this type of word substitution can be thought of as a type of illusion - the comprehender imagines the sentence to be different from how it actually is. This project investigates what causes these illusions - for example, whether ""giving"" was simply mis-read, or if the meaning of the word was mis-remembered, or if attention was mis-directed toward other parts of the sentence. Identifying the processing mis-step that causes this particular error provides clues as to where comprehenders are vulnerable to misunderstanding more generally. The second case study concerns the processing of a special class of words known as negative polarity items or NPIs. These are words like ""ever"" and ""any"", which are generally appropriate in negative contexts (e.g. ""John doesn?t have any money."") but sound strange or ungrammatical in positive contexts (e.g. ""John has any money.""). Prior work has shown that an NPI in a positive context can seem, at first glance, to be appropriate if there is a negative context nearby, another type of linguistic illusion. This project investigates the specific circumstances under which this mistaken perception arises, in addition to asking what people think these ungrammatical sentences actually mean when they judge them to be grammatical.<br/><br/>This project uses a combination of speeded and unspeeded judgments, eye-tracking methods, and sentence repetition tasks to measure people?s responses to illusion sentences. Two initial experiments on word substitution illusions test how often mistakes occur when the substitution is in a declarative sentence instead of a question, and when the substituted word has been primed through previous exposure. Two independent experiments investigate the role of attention by measuring eye movements as comprehenders read sentences with various types of anomalies, including both word substitutions and spelling errors. Three additional experiments on NPI illusions investigate the causes and consequences of these errors. First, two experiments using speeded acceptability measures test the influence of broader conversational context and expectations on illusion rates, and the role of the precise timing of the appearance of the NPI. Finally, a sentence repetition experiment, in which subjects attempt to recall an NPI illusion sentence after a delay, reveals the inferred meaning of these sentences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, attacks such as Stuxnet, or the recent Colonial pipeline attack on industrial CPS have exposed major vulnerabilities, demonstrating the inadequacy of current security techniques to guarantee proper functioning of a CPS. An effective response against smart attackers by pro-actively modeling and responding to attacks on a complex CPS at an ongoing basis, especially with limited data on vulnerabilities in the CPS will be developed in this project.<br/><br/>Using the concept of hybrid attack graphs to capture discrete and domain-specific (physical) dynamics, a data-driven game-theoretic methodology for securing the cyber and physical components of a CPS is the focus of this project. Three closely integrated research thrusts will span the extent of this project: (1) automated strategies to characterize attacker intent using reinforcement learning (RL); (2) an integrated defense approach to guide the security strategies of the CPS using a novel combination of game theory, RL and Bayesian optimization; and (3) evaluation and validation via realistic simulations with emulated data from sensors and actuators of intelligent buildings.<br/><br/>Multiple applications including securing critical infrastructure and supply chains with significant societal impact on public safety will benefit from the project outcomes. Training opportunities for one PhD student and multiple undergraduate students participating in summer research programs, especially from underrepresented groups will be created. Several K-12 outreach and teacher training activities, including hands-on, interactive games and contests between a defender and attacker will be designed to motivate K-12 students to pursue science and engineering. The curriculum of the new graduate course on non-cooperative game theory at MSU will be enriched with new data-driven methods for solving games. <br/><br/>A project website has been created (https://github.com/sandeepbanik/Data-Driven-Resilient-Systems) to provide access to all data from this project. Each publication, thesis, or report will have associated with it a set of web pages for the data plots and tables contained therein. In turn, each of these pages will point to files containing the data itself, the metadata and, as relevant, all information needed to regenerate the data.

Next-generation personal wearable electronics, such as smartwatches and augmented-reality glasses, will have versatile, although miniature, display panels for communications, social media, navigation, imaging, health monitoring, eye tracking, gesture recognition, etc. The U.S. needs to regain leadership in handling data in diverse and rapidly changing display formats, all the more so because developments in numerous other technologies are affected and promoted by display technology. A 16-graduate-student cohort from the U.S. will visit two different Taiwanese institutions during two consecutive summers for intensive training through two Advanced Studies Institutes (ASI) in display technology and display manufacturing. Along with a cohort of 16 Taiwanese graduate students, the cohort from the U.S. will be immersed in a series of short courses and laboratory projects on various aspects of cutting edge display technologies, novel applications, and wearable devices/systems, as well as key display manufacturing knowledge. The selected students will become natural leaders as public transport systems, personalized vehicles, healthcare, food production, education, and other fields incorporate advanced display systems for monitoring data and controlling operations. <br/><br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to nucleate a scientific workforce to design and manufacture next-generation display products in the U.S. Advancement of future display technologies and technical capabilities has necessitated a collaborative effort between globally engaged researchers in both academia and industry. A cohort of 16 U.S. graduate-students will participate in a week-long Advanced Studies Institutes (ASIs) in Taiwan for two consecutive years devoted to disruptive techniques in display materials and device architectures. This will help to greatly improve American expertise for producing existing display products at reasonable cost as well as for conceiving novel display products for long-term benefits to industry and society in future. Taiwan is a global manufacturing leader in optics and electronics. The ASIs will be hosted by two Taiwanese universities, National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT) and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU). Grouped among the top three research institutions in photonics and electronics in Taiwan, and having produced industry leaders and entrepreneurs in display technologies, both hosting universities will leverage their manufacturing connections to organize industrial visits for the American students. The first-year ASI hosted by NTUT will cover innovative materials and structures for next-generation display technology, while the second year ASI hosted by NYCU will focus on advanced display devices and systems in the era of wearable electronics.

The ability to write research proposals is critical to early-career researchers? success, yet there is little formalized coaching in the technical writing skills necessary to craft a successful research proposal. Those that do exist tend to focus on content and editing, without discussing the rhetorical patterns that are common to award-winning applications. Rhetorical patterns are ways of organizing information. Successful proposal writing has its own rhetorical patterns.  The ?How to Write a CAREER: Deconstructing the Award? workshop will emphasize these rhetorical patterns and the importance of mentorship to gain mastery of them. First, NSF CAREER awards related to biomedical or bioengineering will be deconstructed by a communications science expert. Second, the identified common rhetorical elements will provide the foundation for workshop materials and participants will receive actionable and practical information. This proposal-writing workshop will coach early career faculty to be better proposal writers by identifying the language structure that is common across successful proposals and teaching them how to apply that structure to their own proposals. Participants, with priority given to those underrepresented in engineering, will be well positioned to submit competitive CAREER proposals, which has the potential for broadening participation.<br/><br/>This workshop will advance knowledge related to NSF CAREER proposal writing in bio- and biomedical engineering from the perspective of rhetorical patterns. Rhetorical patterns in scientific writing are also influenced by sociocultural variables. For instance, women are socialized to not brag, despite the importance of using rhetorical devices to add promotional value to one?s research articles to convince peers of its value. Novice and non-native English technical writers can make better rhetorical choices when informed of rhetorical patterns. Rhetorical patterns are ways of organizing and communicating information and are critical to the clear presentation of scientific information. When English adjectives deviate from the order ?opinion-size-age-shape-color-origin-material-purpose Noun,? a native English speaker will recognize that the sentence is odd but would likely be unable to articulate this list. Similarly, experienced proposal writers and reviewers understand correct rhetorical patterns in technical writing without necessarily being able to impart it to early career investigators. Just as incorrect word order reveals non-native English speakers, proposal writers who deviate from expected rhetorical patterns are identified as ?non-native proposal writers.? The rhetoric of science contends that the practice of science is persuasive?in proposal writing, the author must convince reviewers that their research is based on sound scientific method or engineering principles. The rhetorical patterns in such writing involve patterns called ?situation-problem-solution-evaluation? that showcase the researcher?s observational and experimental competence while demonstrating explanatory and predictive power. If these rhetorical patterns are not mastered, the likelihood of funding may be affected despite the competence of the researcher. Teaching proposal-writing by employing the most successful use of rhetorical patterns may lessen the impact of sociocultural differences in proposal review.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the project has the potential to overcome obstacles to widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption including battery capacity limitations, high battery cost, and supply chain issues.  EVs currently account for a significant majority of the lithium battery market and this market share will likely increase dramatically as deployment of EVs increases in coming years. The aforementioned issues with lithium battery technologies must be addressed for EVs to reach their envisioned potential. This STTR project seeks to advance a novel process for the production of a critical battery component ? the battery cathode. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to advance lithium sulfide (Li-S) battery viability using a novel approach to cathode production. Lithium sulfide  batteries can provide more than double the gravimetric energy density of current lithium batteries, but Li-S batteries suffer from a short cycle life due to the poor retention of polysulfide species which are formed at the cathode during cycling. If these polysulfide species are able to diffuse away from the cathode, they participate in several detrimental reactions and interactions with both the electrolyte and anode, and the battery is damaged. This project seeks to retain the sulfur and polysulfides within the cathode using encapsulation within a carbon scaffold. Specific research will include assessments of the maximum sulfur loading that can be achieved in the carbon scaffold, the extent to which the carbon scaffold can be rendered electrically conductive, construction of cathodes from the sulfur-loaded carbon scaffold, and tests of the performance of batteries constructed from these cathodes. In addition, a technoeconomic analysis of the cathode technology will be performed to assess its potential in the context of current lithium battery technology. Expected outcomes include demonstrated technical and economic viability of the cathode technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One common way people interact with the environment is through agriculture. Agricultural productivity is influenced by environmental factors like soil quality or rainfall, which can constrain what kinds or how many crops can be grown in certain locations. However, people also use strategies like irrigation or mulching to overcome these limits. Within this broader context, this doctoral dissertation research investigates how people grow crops in less-than-ideal landscapes and how different natural constraints and human decision-making influence agricultural productivity over time. This project will produce data on soil quality, soil development, and human landscape modifications in a marginal (dry) setting, providing valuable results for other research on ancient and modern agriculture. In addition, project data will be shared with community members in Hawai?i who are interested in developing a sustainable plan to promote long-term community and landscape resilience.<br/><br/>The researchers will examine this topic from the perspective of historical ecology. Historical ecology is a theoretical framework that helps archaeologists study human-environmental interactions complexly, taking into account the influence both of human decision-making and natural factors (rather than assuming that one tends to dominate the other). The study area for this project is an ancient agricultural field system in Hawaii.  It consists of an extensive network of field borders and a complex system of water management features (irrigation ditches, check dams) which were necessary in order to make agriculture possible in this dry landscape. The researchers will map the agricultural field system through an archaeological and remote sensing survey, collect soil samples in and outside of cultivated areas, and date archaeological features. Using these data, the researchers will test several potential models for which natural factors, human factors, or combination of factors contributed most to the study area?s agricultural productivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Technology is needed to remove these chemicals from water to render it safe for daily use in an efficient and cost-effective manner. High internal phase emulsion polymer foams (pHIPE) are materials that pull chemicals from the water and trap them in pores, resulting in cleaner, safer water. However, current methods for manufacturing pHIPE use chemicals that must be removed prior to use, resulting in an increase in material cost and a concern that residual contaminants in these materials may further pollute the water. This project addresses the national need for creating effective and safe pHIPE that pose no environmental risk while retaining a low manufacturing cost. In addition, the research team members will work directly with community stakeholders to understand knowledge and perception of water treatment and available treatment technologies to increase community adoption and ownership of the pHIPE technology.<br/><br/>High internal phase emulsion polymer foams (pHIPEs) are a form of water treatment technology needed to address urgent issues with community water treatment infrastructure. pHIPEs are adsorbents with a high internal surface area that originates from the initial solvent/monomer emulsion and the surfactant that stabilizes the solvent/monomer interface. Despite the reliance of pHIPE function on surfactants, little work has been done to understand the impact of surfactant structure on pHIPE performance or reduce the need to remove it post-polymerization. To meet this need, this project will determine structure-property relationships for reactive surfactants (surfmers) that demonstrate the impact of surfactant structure on the porous performance and bulk properties of pHIPEs. Surfmers will be synthesized and designed to stabilize the monomer/solvent interface and to participate in bulk polymerization, resulting in pHIPEs with tunable interfacial activity and porous morphology that do not leach and that conform to the principles of green chemistry. After synthesis, surfmer structure will be correlated to interfacial dynamics (e.g., interfacial tension, diffusion, and adsorption), foam performance (e.g., specific surface area and pore morphology), and polymerization (e.g, surfmer incorporation, conversion, and modulus). This work will also incorporate research to develop effective strategies for communicating with non-scientists about water quality issues, available technologies, and existing infrastructure in their community, with the goal of increasing scientific literacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These waves typically have a pattern that resembles a swell in the ocean, in that they are relatively broad and rolling. However, in certain circumstances, they can break, resembling closely the appearance of a wave breaking on a shoreline. When Rossby waves break in the atmosphere, they are frequently associated with high-impact weather phenomena like extended heat and cold waves, extreme precipitation, and atmospheric blocking that can significantly alter the path of the jet stream. These Rossby wave breaks can take on a variety of different shapes and sizes (i.e., flavors) which may determine where and how they modulate mid-latitude extreme weather. To date, a comprehensive analysis of the different wave breaking flavors has yet to be undertaken. The goal of this research is to understand the common flavors of Rossby wave breaking in the Northern Hemisphere in the present and future climate using machine learning. The investigators will assess the flavors of Rossby wave breaking in past observations and seek to identify how well climate models can represent such patterns and their associated impacts on the jet stream and weather. The proposed work will also explore how these Rossby wave break flavors, frequencies, and impacts may change over the 21st Century.<br/>  <br/>Given the close linkage between Rossby wave breaking, the jet stream, and high-impact weather, a better understanding of these events in the present and future is societally important. The exploration of how Rossby wave break patterns change over the next century should shed light on a critical area of interest to both the science community and the broader public. As part of proposed activities, the investigators will mentor a graduate student as well as two undergraduate students. One undergraduate researcher will help to develop a real-time Rossby wave break tracking tool for operational forecasters, while the second will explore the impacts of changes in Rossby wave breaking over the climate-sensitive Mediterranean region. This research will thus serve to improve our fundamental understanding of these high impact events, train the next generation of scientists in the intersectional study of weather and climate, and provide information that is of interest to members of the research community, operational forecasters, and policy/adaptation decision makers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current project examines changes in U.S. Americans' gender attitudes following a highly anticipated Supreme Court case on reproductive health that has direct implications for state laws. <br/><br/>This research involves well-controlled, naturalistic studies that are informed by psychological theories of attitude change and political science research on the link between policy and public opinion. Two studies, one cross-sectional and one longitudinal, assess gender attitudes before and after an impending Supreme Court decision on reproductive health. The studies also account for geographic variations in policy implementation. Additionally, this project examines specific conditions and mechanisms that influence attitudinal response to changes in state laws and policies. Gender attitudes of respondents may be affected by: (1) the perceived legitimacy of state and federal policy-making bodies, (2) the gender norms that they perceive among others in general and others close to them, (3) their pre-existing support for reproductive rights policy, and (4) their belief that reproductive rights policy is a gender-relevant issue.

If achieved, this would lead to astonishing energy savings, completely transform energy generation, and significantly improve medical imaging technology. So-called superconductors demonstrate this lossless transmission of electricity making them very important for novel technologies. Superconductors also offer the potential for fundamental scientific discovery. The mechanism by which superconductors enable this energy saving phenomenon is largely not well understood. Understanding this mechanism and creating better superconductors is essential for technological application, because currently superconductivity is largely a low-temperature phenomenon, with critical temperatures for superconductors being similar to the extremely low temperatures found on Mars or even in the coldest regions of outer space. Through this award, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry as well as the Condensed Matter Physics programs in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, Freedman's research team engages in a theory-inspired search for new superconductors of a specific type, which could enable fundamental insight into the mechanism of superconductivity. Her team uses high-pressure synthesis to access new compounds that have long eluded chemists. This work enables interdisciplinary training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, where they benefit from the scientific intersection of solid-state chemistry, physics and geophysics. Preparing graduate students to collaborate across fields strengthens the next generation of our scientifically engaged workforce.<br/><br/>Part 2: Technical summary: <br/>The realization of high temperature superconductivity would be a transformative advance, with implications across NSF directorates ranging from improved medical imaging to fault tolerant power transmission. Thus far, the vast majority of new superconductors have been found either by serendipity, modification of known superconducting systems, or through the investigation of theoretically unlikely candidates. In stark contrast, the targeted synthesis of new systems is underdeveloped, owing to the inherent difficulty of predicting new superconducting materials. To enable rational progress, a clear design strategy is needed, which necessitates knowing the operative superconducting mechanism in a given class of superconductors. Freedman proposes the synthesis of the notably missing subclass of Fe-Bi pnictide superconductors via high-pressure synthesis. This work is motivated by Freedman's recent discovery of the first Fe-Bi bond in the solid-state, achieved through the application of high pressure and stabilized by the formation of Bi-Bi interactions. Through this award, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry as well as the Condensed Matter Physics programs in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, Freedman's team characterizes novel materials both through in situ and bulk X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods. Materials are physically probed via magnetometry, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The aggregate of these data provides insight into the mechanism of superconductivity, and possible structure-function correlations. Creating and understanding different superconductors offers promise for true discovery within this complex field. The realization of a new class of superconductors would foster collaborations across the sciences and enable a deeper understanding of superconductivity. Superconductors also have tremendous potential for societal impact, ranging from MRI instrumentation to increased power transmission through the electric grid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manipulation of the human genome using CRISPR-Cas gene editors has been validated in early clinical trials to correct genetic diseases. However, application of this technology has been limited by the high degree of unintended 'off-target' editing events. This problem is particularly acute for in vivo therapies where the editing system will be delivered systemically or directly to the target organs, eliminating the ability to screen cells for unwanted editing outcomes. High precision gene editing technology must be developed to ensure the safety and efficacy of in vivo gene editing therapies.

Coastal Louisiana serves as an ideal model system to study climate change impacts as rates of environmental change are substantially greater than most coastal systems in the US and abroad. The goal of the LUMCON REU site is to provide stimulating, challenging, and lasting research experiences for a highly qualified, diverse cohort of undergraduate student participants interested in careers in coastal and marine science. Specific objectives of the LUMCON REU program are to 1) expose students to a variety of research settings and disciplines of coastal and marine science, 2) facilitate experiences that guide students through the planning, execution, analysis, interpretation, and presentation phases of an independent research project, 3) train students in oral and written communication of science, 4) expose participants to the diversity of scientific career paths and role models, 5) teach participants about the linkages between scientific research and ecosystem management, and 6) develop a cohort of future scientists through common research experiences and opportunities for both formal and informal exchange between students, mentors, other scientists, students, and educators. This program will prepare participants for a diversity of careers in science, ecosystem management and/or policy by focusing on coastal environmental problems in Louisiana with relevance to issues faced elsewhere in the United States and abroad. Through a series of skill-building workshops and other opportunities, REU interns will learn to effectively communicate science to diverse audiences and outlets?skills beneficial in any pursued career path. This program will continue to build on a strong history and growing network of contacts to attract diverse cohorts of REU participants, including students from underrepresented and underserved groups in STEM (e.g., underrepresented racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups as well as disabled and non-traditional students and those from non-research institutions). REU interns will be part of LUMCON?s summer community affording them networking opportunities with visiting high school, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as researchers.<br/><br/>The LUMCON REU program integrates research, education, and ecosystem management, a mission shared with LUMCON as an institution. The DeFelice Marine Center?s location on the upper end of Terrebonne Bay and its proximity to the Mississippi River and Atchafalaya River deltas, extensive estuaries and coastal wetlands, and coastal waters to the deep-water Gulf makes it an ideal venue for field and experimental based marine science. An emerging delta (Atchafalaya) and a degrading delta (Mississippi), combined with complex coastal processes (coastal erosion and wetland degradation), and continued nutrient inputs into the coastal zone provide diverse opportunities and challenges for both pure and applied research that have implications for coastal restoration, and flood control, and the vast living resources (oysters, shrimp, crabs, and fin fisheries) in the area. Focal areas of research currently include river/ocean interactions, delta formation and degradation, coastal loss and restoration, biodiversity, behavioral,general, and ecosystem ecology, biogenic systems, organic chemistry, geomicrobiology, biogeochemistry, and acute and chronic anthropogenic and environmental impacts including climate change, eutrophication/hypoxia, ocean acidification, and oil spills on coastal and marine systems. The combination of mentor research interests and expertise with the diversity of habitats in this region provides a unique opportunity for REU interns to participate in a scientific research and professional mentoring program that interfaces fundamental research questions in dynamic coastal and marine ecosystems with problems central to science-based policy and management activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

STEM research provides the foundation for many of the advances that are adopted by society. As there is a continuing and increasing need for a well-prepared STEM work force, students who learn the fundamental aspects of experimental design and problem solving while in high school science classes are more likely to consider careers in STEM fields. The project will engage and mentor prospective science teachers who will gain first-hand experience utilizing research methods through their work as members of STEM research laboratory teams. Prospective teachers who have such authentic research experiences will be better equipped to create lessons that enhance their students? appreciation for the value of basic research and will encourage their students to view employment in a STEM field as a viable career choice. Complementing the research, prospective teachers will participate in professional development activities to gain pedagogical content knowledge and to learn best practices for engaging secondary school students in authentic research experiences. <br/><br/>This project at Stony Brook University (SBU) includes partnerships with STEM research faculty at both SBU and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and with several school districts on Long Island, especially those that already house STEM research programs for their students. The three-year project will provide twenty-four (24) future secondary STEM teachers, 8 per year, with summer science laboratory research experiences at SBU and BNL. The project has four underlying goals. The first goal is for each of these future teachers to be engaged in an authentic research experience as a member of a STEM research laboratory team. Second is to incorporate a professional development program designed to furnish these perspective STEM teachers with the knowledge base to incorporate research experiences for students in their future classrooms. A corollary to this goal is to build cohorts of science teachers who will bring knowledge of authentic research into their secondary schools. Third is to evaluate the impact of project components on the project participants' maturating and preparation for conducting authentic research and bringing experiences to the classroom. Fourth is to disseminate project outcomes to other faculty, departments, and institutions with an interest in and passion for improving and enhancing STEM pre-service teacher preparation, especially via research experiences. Project evaluation is designed to provide useful insights into how the skills, knowledge, and cohort interactions that prospective science teachers gain through the project's research and professional development activities will influence their self-efficacy as well as their teaching. Findings will be disseminated through presentations at local, regional, and national meetings with the goal of informing science teacher educators about the value of including authentic STEM research experiences in science teacher preparation programs. This Noyce Research Experiences for Pre-Service Teachers project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teacher to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the retention and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particularly, in seemingly merit-based institutions, tracing these networks could reveal the unequal structures in which diverse populations experience systemic disparities. The American legal profession offers a useful site to track these processes of inequality because it remains unequal despite its increasing heterogeneity. Law students, like many professionals, are encouraged frequently to ?network,? but students from a range of diverse backgrounds ? including race, gender, sexual orientation, national status, and class ? may have access to differentially resourced social networks, or social capital. These ?network inequalities? may impact the value of legal education across differentially structured groups of students and ultimately shape differences in student experiences and career outcomes. Whereas research on the legal profession has highlighted the importance of social capital and relationships to promote careers, less attention has been paid to the nature of networks in early professional socialization. Particularly, while the research is rife with accounts about the racial, gendered, and nationality differences during law school and then, much later, during different career stages, not enough is known about the temporal experience of law school as it feeds into the transitional period between law school and the first years of professional careers. This period is important because it tracks the emergence of a path dependency that can serve diverse professionals differently and unequally even as it structurally seems equitable.<br/><br/>Following an earlier longitudinal network and interview study of a cohort of first-year law students across three law schools, the research aims to examine the same law students? social networks with a range of actors to evaluate the importance of social ties for the school-to-work transition in the legal profession. The project will investigate whether observed network inequalities can account for differential job market outcomes across diverse categories of students, as well as different outcomes at the end of students? law school careers. This innovative, longitudinal dataset will provide insight into the role that network inequalities play in shaping not only variation in experiences across different groups of students, but ultimately the role that these structural inequalities play in producing differential pathways into the legal profession. Further, given the timing of the data, it will also provide a unique opportunity to observe student experiences disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the focus of this project is inequality in law schools and early legal careers, the relevance of our findings may extend beyond the legal profession, as well, to organizations struggling with similar dynamics, including non-law professional organizations and educational organizations, for example. Specifically, these findings may provide opportunities to create meaningful interventions that may mitigate existing inequalities and facilitate more equal outcomes within the legal profession and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the social, economic, and innovation benefits of a diverse workforce in STEM fields, graduates in these fields do not reflect the inclusive community necessary for America to compete globally. Although 18% of the American population identifies as being non-white Hispanic, Bachelor?s degrees in STEM fields at baccalaureate-granting institutions are awarded at a dramatically lower rate to Hispanic students. Community colleges are in a position to address this disparity with 27% of all community college students identifying as Hispanic and over 200 community colleges that have been federally recognized as HSIs. This project, Transitions and Research Across Interfaces (TRAINS), will facilitate the transition of students at Rio Hondo College, an HSI community college, into future leaders in STEM fields through an intensive, 15-month classroom/research laboratory experience at Rio Hondo College and the University of Southern California. By providing career counseling, laboratory training, and direct mentoring, TRAINS will seek to reverse the loss of interest in STEM Fields amongst community college students and provide the opportunity for students to transfer to baccalaureate-granting institutions where they may graduate and pursue a career in a STEM field. Through data acquired through this program, TRAINS will eventually present a modular strategy that can be replicated at other population centers (that contain community colleges and research universities) and fundamentally redefine the role of community colleges as a strategic resource for America?s scientific and engineering workforce. <br/><br/>Beyond the primary aim of successfully increasing the rate at which Rio Hondo students transfer to baccalaureate-granting institution and eventually pursue a career in a STEM field, TRAINS will also develop a cohort of graduate students/postdoctoral fellows that can mentor non-traditional students and advance knowledge on supporting students to overcoming cultural barriers that lead to attrition in interest in STEM fields. These aims will be facilitated by program evaluation specialists at the Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships (CSEP) at the University of California, Santa Barbara and education research team at High Point University.  CSEP will ensure progress towards program objectives through timely feedback via focus groups and tracking surveys. The education research team will focus on testing novel strategies and refining best practices to increase the persistence for non-traditional students to maintain their interest in STEM fields. The results of this program will be disseminated through education research journals and promotion at regional/national conferences. Furthermore, with over 200,000 students that attend HSI community colleges within 15 miles of the University Park Campus at the University of Southern California, this program contains opportunities for expansion and can serve as a model by which other regions integrate community college students into research enriched programs.  The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs.

Due to their ubiquitous presence, mysids form a critical link in marine food webs, yet little is known about their ecology and interactions with their local surroundings. An interdisciplinary team of investigators will develop and deploy a novel in situ imaging system in coastal Maine over the span of two summers, conducting a comprehensive investigation of mysid behavior in their natural environment, including their interactions and distribution under varying local flow, food, and light conditions. The investigators will train two graduate students at the interface of fluid mechanics, instrumentation, and ecology. In addition, ten students from Florida Atlantic University and the University of Southern Maine will be invited to participate in annual workshops on ecological fluid mechanics, with first-generation college students or those from other underrepresented communities encouraged to apply. The cutting-edge instrumentation suite, including the imaging system being developed as part of this project, can be used to address different questions associated with spatial patterns and zooplankton or fish behavior in the future. Image datasets will be openly accessible to the scientific community and the public. Project results will be disseminated through public outreach lectures at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, Darling Marine Center, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.<br/><br/>Mysids have been historically understudied compared to other zooplankton groups (e.g., copepods, krill), despite their ubiquitous presence and importance to marine food webs. This project will investigate mysid behavior, feeding ecology, and swarm distributions in relation to prey availability, light levels, and background flow conditions, focusing on a single mysid species ? Neomysis americana. The investigators will use a state-of-the-art suite of instruments in the field, including two separate imaging systems and a high resolution Acoustic Doppler Profiler, to conduct field experiments at the Damariscotta River Estuary. This instrumentation suite will collect data to analyze mysid distributions and animal-fluid interactions in their natural environment, as well as ancillary data on benthic particle/plankton community composition and physical parameters (including currents, waves, temperature and depth). Multi-spectral analysis will find correlation patterns with water turbidity, flow conditions, bottom topography, mysid abundance, and food source concentrations. Mysid samples will be collected several times a week throughout the summer months to monitor changes in the mysid population abundance, sex ratio, and stage structure. The investigators will determine how seasonal changes in environmental variables and Neomysis population structure affect distribution within the estuary, as well as small-scale swimming and aggregation behavior. They will answer questions related to how swarm organization, aggregation, and swimming behavior differ under conditions of varying zooplankton abundance and swarm composition.

As a prime example of such attacks, one targeting the users? private keys used in hardware devices for authentication can be mentioned, where analyzing electromagnetic emanation, power consumption, and timing (often referred to as side-channel leakages) results in compromising the security of the device. Due to the effectiveness of such attacks leveraging side-channels, a great deal of attention has been paid to, particularly AI-assisted security verification. The involvement of standardization (e.g., National Institute of Standards and Technology) and certification bodies in the activities related to the development of tools for side-channel analysis further highlights the importance of this matter. In spite of the effort made in this respect, due to difficulties with regard to the constantly growing number of known side-channel attacks, evaluation of side-channel resiliency could be less practical. To tackle this and in line with the standardization activities, this project aims to address some of the fundamental shortcomings of the existing approaches relying on machine learning, specifically, deep learning, as a powerful tool to assess the security of devices against side-channel attacks. Hence, the results obtained through this project are expected to improve the security of millions of devices used across sensitive applications, including healthcare, intelligence, finance, transportation, and defense. Moreover, the research activities performed in this project are closely integrated with education and outreach efforts as both graduate, and undergraduate students will work on the project, thus gaining cutting-edge skills and expertise in hardware security. <br/><br/><br/>More technically, this project will answer these vital questions: 1) Which deep learning model can approximate the leakage properties of a cryptographic implementation with less complexity and high interpretability? 2) How can the generalization of the results achieved for one instance of the implementation to another be explained? 3) Besides deep learning, which other machine learning frameworks, preferably provable ones, can be applied to offer a guarantee that a cryptosystem is robust against machine learning-enhanced side-channel analysis? In doing so, the project creates a novel set of techniques relying on the theoretical foundations of deep learning to assess the security of cryptosystems and their respective embedded devices in practice. Furthermore, experimentation on real-world cryptographic implementations, namely unprotected and with countermeasures against side-channel analysis, will be conducted. Side-channel measurements from these systems will be made publicly available. This is indeed geared to the needs of the standardization and certification bodies, industry, and researchers focusing on security evaluation for cryptosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these issues, such as more severe weather, will require them to change how they farm.  Creating a protective layer over soil when growing field crops could help farmers better manage many issues at once. Covering soil with sheet plastic prevents weed growth, erosion, and moisture loss. But, using large amounts plastic creates waste, is not eco-friendly, and too costly for field crops.  New locally sourced types of bioplastics that fully break down into to safe by-products can be made.  These new materials could provide farmers with a green way to control weeds, fertilize crops, protect soil and water resources, and work with nature to better manage their fields. This National Science Foundation Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (NSF RII Track-2 FEC) award will be a new partnership called BioWRAP between Kansas State University, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and University of Nebraska.  This project will be focused on advancing farm use of bioplastics.

The overarching goal of this project is to reduce the use of conventional plastics, herbicides, and their associated environmental impacts in agricultural production. This goal will be accomplished through the following integrated thrust areas: (i) create a set of bio-based polymers that can be used in agricultural production; (ii) measure the agricultural effectiveness and associated environmental impacts of the technology; and (iii) estimate the potential social and economic impacts on communities and the agricultural economy of the proposed technology along with establishing a consortium for sustained collaborations among university partners in Kansas, South Dakota, and Nebraska in the field of spray-on biopolymer based films for agricultural production. The research will include: engineering biopolymers included functionalized PHA-based biopolymers, protein based sprayable biopolymers, and hybrid polymer systems; studying the impact of this technology on strengthening of agroecosystems by evaluation of biopolymer with respect to weed suppression and crop production efficiency, nutrient cycling, soil moisture retention and life cycle impacts along with environmental accounting; and assessing the broader impacts of the new BioWRAP technology using socio-economic analysis of product adoption and rural sustainability along with valuing ecosystem services provided by BioWRAP, ecosystem service market design and participation and its impact on socio-economics of participating EPSCoR states as well as overall sustainable data provision of the project. The research activities designed for the project enable industry engagement and potential career opportunities for students in industries. The program includes mentoring of five junior faculty and three post docs by senior faculty in advancing through their careers and guiding students at different stages of education (graduate, undergraduate, and high and middle school) and engaging with rural communities through field days, surveys, interviews, and educational outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To rapidly meet the ever-increasing storage performance and efficiency requirements, the entire storage hardware and software stack need to adapt instantly in a coordinated fashion. However, it is challenging to achieve this with current human-driven systems-building approaches. Recent advancements in machine learning techniques show that the learning-based approach is a promising method to solve system optimization problems. However, it remains unclear how the storage ecosystem should be advanced to embrace the learning techniques to facilitate its development, deployment, and optimizations across the full stack. <br/><br/>This project proposes to develop systems and architecture techniques to build a learning-based storage ecosystem. It has four major thrusts. First, the project proposes to enable the development of customized storage devices for specific application types with automated tuning of hardware specifications, therefore, we can enable developers to identify optimal device specifications with much less time and effort. Second, the project plans to develop elastic storage management for multi-tenant applications using reinforcement learning, thus, we can achieve both improved resource utilization and performance isolation. Third, the project proposes to integrate the storage hardware knowledge into the learning procedure to facilitate the development of learning-based storage software. Finally, the project will revisit the storage hardware architecture for building learning-based storage drives to further enhance the learning-based storage ecosystem. The project will facilitate the development of a new course that centers around memory and storage technologies. The project will also promote computer systems and architecture education to underrepresented and high school students through various research workshops and summer camps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The emphasis on the role of humans in developing a machine learning system raises significant challenges. Several arise because the data a machine learning model is trained on is, in many contexts, generated from repeated human-ML interactions over time.  For example, in a loan-application decision system-support system, after an initial decline a user may change their financial behavior to obtain a better result in future applications. Human behavior changes in response to the ML decisions change the distribution of data that the ML model is exposed to in training.  However the usual paradigms for training and use of ML systems often assumes static data distributions.  This requires us to revisit existing machine learning tools and our understanding of their established robustness and fairness properties. This project?s focus on robustness, fairness, and human-ML interaction dynamics will alert machine learning practitioners of the irreparable harm that may be caused by blindly trusting existing training data. The project and its future extensions will provide frameworks and tools to build healthy machine learning development and deployment approaches that will much better serve humans in their long-term well-being. <br/><br/>This project aims to provide fundamental understandings and algorithmic solutions to improving model robustness and fairness in a human-centered machine learning system. The project builds theoretical and computational frameworks to understand the changes in data induced by the deployment of machine learning models. Central to our intellectual inquiry is that in human-centered systems, humans are ""responding"" agents who will react to the algorithmic decisions or the interactive environments (e.g., a data collection system) they are subject to. These reactions often cause data distribution to shift between training and deployment, which substantially challenges the commonly made assumption that the training data represents the test ones. The results will help advance the state-of-the-art by providing a theoretically sound and computationally efficient framework for designing robust and fair machine learning solutions that consider distribution shifts triggered by human responses to the algorithms in real-world deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Science communication has undergone dramatic changes over the past decades. Online platforms such as social media sites, electronic news outlets, blogs, and wikis are now used by most scholars and the public for sharing scientific findings. A better understanding of the online circulation of scientific advances is imperative because these new channels of connecting with the public have brought novel challenges in dealing with the uncontrolled distortion of information. Additionally, it remains difficult to identify reliable knowledge, given the increase of sensationalist presentations of scientific results. This work will merge ideas, approaches, and technologies from information science, communication, and journalism to address numerous issues of significant social and economic impact: (1) contributing to the improvement of public serving science journalism; (2) providing practical and actionable early predictions of science dissemination from collective cues on social media; (3) enriching the online experience of people around the globe with a better understanding and tracking of real-world message distortion campaigns; (4) informing key current crises related to misinformation; and, (5) guiding science policy with novel knowledge about science communication in the ecosystem of digital media platforms.<br/><br/>While most research on information diffusion has focused on individual platforms, this project will develop a critical multi-platform analysis framework for science communication. A primary goal is to discover fundamental knowledge about: (1) typical trajectories in the cross-platform dissemination of scientific articles; (2) how these trajectories connect to the impact of the work, its novelty, as well as the reactions from scholars and the public; (3) predictions of eventual reactions from early coverage patterns; and, (4) effects of clickbait and information distortion on dissemination. This project will illuminate how scientific findings are shared, discussed, and distorted online and provide empirical evidence of how early signals deduced from social media cues can be harnessed computationally to predict the coverage of scientific articles. The design of an interactive tool will demonstrate how traces of collective reactions can be compellingly and usefully presented to science journalists in real reporting scenarios. The work will be fueled by and will further existing theoretical and empirical research on the use of new media in science dissemination, assess intentional and unintentional information distortion online, harness collective cues from Web-based platforms for early prediction, and design information interfaces for journalists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While warming may lead to increased growth in forests limited by short, cold growing seasons, climate change could also lead to surprises. One example is a decoupling between temperature variability and annual growth rates in boreal forest trees that has been detected over the past few decades. This ?divergence problem? suggests that tree growth in some arctic forest systems is no longer limited by temperature. The causes are not well understood and can be hard to test due to other factors impacting growth, such as drought due to the warming climate. This project will test for divergence across the treeline forests of northern North America, especially in rapidly warming regions of Alaska and northwestern Canada. The investigators will use tree-ring records obtained from the wood of ancient trees, a combination of mathematical methods and modeling, and wood anatomy analysis, to better understand forest growth patterns related to divergence. Broader Impacts: New measurements are critical if we are to understand how boreal forests interact with the atmosphere and feedback with other features of the global environment. This project will contribute to this understanding by estimating relationships between climate and forest growth using tree rings at sites spanning many northern locations. The project provides funding for students, Native American citizens, and for teachers to take part in Arctic research.<br/><br/>The rapid warming of the Arctic is expected to impact profoundly northern forest systems. While warming may lead to greater productivity and growth in forests typically limited by short, cold growing seasons, the speed and magnitude of climate change could also lead to surprises. One example is a decoupling between temperature variability and annual growth rates in boreal forest trees that has been detected at forest sites since the middle of the twentieth century. This phenomenon, known as the ?divergence problem?, suggests that tree growth in some Arctic forest systems is no longer primarily limited by temperature. The causes are not well understood and have been difficult to test due to the co-varying biological, physiological, and environmental factors potentially impacting recent tree growth. One hypothesis is that once warming has surpassed a physiological threshold, drought stress limits growth.  Another hypothesis is  ?global dimming?, in which increased atmospheric aerosols decrease the amount of solar radiation available for photosynthesis. This project will assess current divergence hypotheses across the treeline forests of northern North America, emphasizing rapidly warming regions of Alaska and northwestern Canada, which appear to be key areas for divergence-type effects. The project will leverage a new, large compilation of tree-ring data (already in hand) and update key locations that have shown early evidence of unusual growth decline despite recent warming. Detection of recent changes in growth parameters will use a novel, integrated combination of statistical techniques, quantitative wood anatomy methods, and tree growth modeling to develop a detailed assessment of the extent, causes, and carbon cycle implications of divergence. Broader Impacts: New measurements of boreal forest dynamics are critical for understanding how boreal systems interact with the changing atmosphere and the feedbacks between coupled earth system domains. This project will contribute to this understanding by developing quantitative estimates of climate/growth interactions at daily to centennial time scales and spatial scales from cellular to continental, yielding valuable, novel data for modeling of environmental change and productivity in northern forests. The project provides three years of support for a graduate student, funding for high school curricular development and courses in native educational settings, and fieldwork-based opportunities for a teacher to take part in hands-on Arctic research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Part of the class known as Fast and Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs), these events are significantly brighter than a supernova (SN), or exploding star, but brighten within a few days, much faster than the tens of days typical for supernovae.   They are believed to be powered by a newly-born black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS), which is a very compact type of star. A research team between Northwestern University and the University of Chicago will study these FBOTs with a combination of telescope observations and theoretical investigations.  The researchers expect to observe about five FBOTs per year from NSF-funded astronomical survey telescopes such as the Zwicky Transient Facility, enabling them to understand what kind of stars become FBOTs and how compact objects like neutron stars and black holes are formed.  The investigators will integrate their research with three educational programs: (i) providing summer research opportunities to under-represented minority and women undergraduates; (ii) work with Chicago-area high school teachers to develop curricular material on stellar explosions for their classes; and (iii) work with visually impaired scientists and professional musicians to translate astronomical measurements into sound. <br/><br/>Recent technological advances have revolutionized the investigative power of optical Astronomical Transient surveys (e.g. PanSTARRS and PTF), which allowed the exploration of uncharted territories of the parameter space, and led to the discovery of new types of transients.  As the research team showed in their recent study of the Astronomical Transient AT 2018cow, the large FBOT luminosities -- reaching peak luminosities of ~4 X 10^44 erg/s -- and extremely short rise-times of a few days - rule out traditional SN models powered by the radioactive decay of 56Ni , imply small ejecta masses of 0.1 to 0.5 solar masses, and point at the presence of a central engine in the form of a newly-born NS or BH powering the transient's display. The radio-to-X-ray emission from an FBOT provides an unparalleled opportunity to study BHs and NSs at the time of their formation, a phase of evolution that has been hidden to our eyes so far. The research program uniquely combines the strengths of panchromatic observations of FBOTs and a theoretical investigation of the non-thermal properties of the transients informed by ab-initio Particle-In-Cell simulations,  with the immediate goals to (i) shed light on the nature of FBOTs stellar progenitors; (ii) provide critical insight onto the process of formation of compact objects and their properties at the time of birth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this project is to develop and apply new understanding of high-time-resolution Arctic records of methane and carbon monoxide. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and carbon monoxide is linked to the atmospheric lifetime of other greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide. Thus, developing reliable records of both gases is important for understanding past and future atmospheric chemistry and radiative forcing. High-depth-resolution records of carbon monoxide, and to a lesser extent methane,  in Arctic ice cores show evidence of non-atmospheric anomalies that are poorly understood. One potential source of such anomalies is biological activity within the ice. Microbes can be active at temperatures well below freezing, and ice cores are subjected to relatively warm temperatures after the ice is extracted from glaciers and ice sheets while they are stored or transported prior to measurement. Special sample handling protocols will be used to evaluate the effects of post-collection ice temperature on methane and carbon monoxide production, and potentially allow development of methane and carbon monoxide records over recent centuries that are free from any artifacts. Funding will support early career investigators, graduate students and undergraduate students who will be involved in field work, laboratory analysis, and data interpretation. The investigators will involve undergraduates from underrepresented groups to foster diversity in earth sciences. Public outreach will be achieved through public lectures, lab tours, and media interactions. <br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to (1) investigate the rate and timing of temperature-dependent in situ biological production of carbon monoxide and methane in an Arctic ice core, (2) develop records of atmospheric carbon monoxide and methane spanning recent centuries that are free of in situ production artifacts, and (3) determine the roles that ice impurity concentration and microbial community structure play in situ gas production. To accomplish these goals, a 150-meter ice core will be collected at Summit, Greenland using the large-diameter Blue Ice Drill. To address goal (1), successive measurements of carbon monoxide and methane will be made in the field on eight parallel longitudinal samples from a 12 meter-long section of the core, with the different samples consistently stored and monitored at temperatures ranging from well below the -31 °C ice sheet temperature at Summit to well above the -26 °C cell vitrification temperature where cellular metabolism is possible. For goal (2), measurements of these two gases will be made in the field on ice that has been kept consistently at -40 °C after extraction. For goal (3), a portion of the entire ice core will be returned to the U.S. for microbial analyses, measurements of a range of elements and chemical species using a well-established, NSF-funded continuous ice core analytical system, and continuous carbon monoxide and methane measurements to complement the field measurements. Microbiological analysis will be conducted on ice samples characterized by high and low in situ gas anomalies to determine what microbes are present that may be responsible for creating the observed gas artifacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While machine translation technology is frequently used in these conditions, existing systems often make errors that can have severe consequences for a patient or a job applicant. Further, it is challenging for people to know when automatic translations might be wrong when they do not understand the source or target language for translation. This project addresses this issue by developing accessible and reliable machine translation for lay users. It will provide mechanisms to guide users to recognize and recover from translation errors, and help them make better decisions given imperfect translations. As a result, more people will be able to use machine translation reliably to communicate across language barriers, which can have far-reaching positive consequences on their lives.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project contributes advances in natural language processing and interaction design for a bot that can be added to any text-based conversation, where it can play a role similar to an interpreter. The bot will guide users to write appropriate inputs for machine translation, help users understand outputs, and intervene when it detects miscommunication and conversational breakdowns. The design of the bot will follow a human-centered design process, consisting of need-finding studies, iterative system development and deployment, and user evaluations via controlled experiments. On the back-end, the bot will rely on quality estimation models that automatically detect translation errors to produce useful guidance for end-users. The data, models, and design recommendations generated by this project will advance computational research in multiple ways. It will lead to new machine translation quality estimation techniques that take into account the impact of errors on end-users; it will expand the scope of explainable artificial intelligence research to encompass the considerable risks and harms caused by language generation tools, and it will generate new interface design that assists lay users' sense making of artificial intelligence systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aberrant localization of proteins may lead to harmful effects on cells, including poorly functional traits in plants, or disease in humans and animals. Protein localization is a complicated biological process controlled by many factors. Thus, for most proteins, their localization mechanisms are not well understood. Moreover, experimental methods for measuring the degree of protein localization are time- and labor-consuming. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop protein localization analysis methods. Current computational methods are often lacking in accuracy to quantify protein localization at the suborganelle level. In addition, most methods lack capacities to predict the effects of mutations on protein localization, or reveal target signals and provide information important for elucidating the mechanism of this process. This project will help address this gap in methos by developing an interpretable deep-learning approach and related informatics infrastructure for protein localization studies. The outcome will not only improve the protein localization prediction accuracy and resolution, but also shed light on localization mechanisms. Furthermore, the deep-learning framework can be applied to several other bioinformatics problems, such as mRNA localization prediction, enzyme classification and active site prediction, and protein function prediction. The project will also provide training and research experience in machine learning and real-world software development for various students, especially underrepresented minorities. Virtual workshops and community-wide competitions will be hosted annually to provide machine learning training for students with different backgrounds.<br/><br/>The project will develop a deep-learning framework that incorporates a sequence-based neural network and graph neural network for suborganellar protein localization prediction, together with applications of machine-learning attention mechanisms. The framework?s interpretability will enable studies of high-definition localization mechanisms, including potential novel targeting signal identification and prediction of mislocalization driven by mutation or regulatory alteration. In addition, the framework will be extended to study tissue-specific or cell-type-specific localization by incorporating single-cell data. An all-in-one web portal for protein localization prediction will be developed to provide a code-free environment for protein localization analysis. All the functionalities, and related data to be used and generated in this project will be provided on the platform. The web resource will also be an educational tool for AI learning and practices at various levels, such as high-school biology, together with many visualization and playground features. The prediction web services, as well as project progress and training materials will be provided at https://www.mu-loc.org/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These locations are often difficult or expensive to access, such as throughout a large farm for precision agriculture or within an operating factory. Ensuring the IoT devices are useful and productive long after they are deployed reduces their overall cost and increases their utility. However, many computing devices today are designed with short, fixed lifetimes, and hardware advances continuously render old devices obsolete. This project proposes the necessary developments to ensure deployed IoT devices remain usable, efficient, and secure decades after their initial commissioning. The result will be new self-powered energy-harvesting IoT devices that can adapt to changing environments, new application requirements, and updated security requirements without being removed and replaced. Enabling this are several foundational advancements, including (i) fine-grained hardware and compiler enforced software modularity that enables energy-efficient software updates, (ii) memory-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for long-term energy prediction and management, and (iii) transparent application offloading to support future software running on already deployed IoT device hardware. Ultimately, this will equip IoT devices with lifespans similar to the infrastructure they are attached to.<br/><br/>Pursuing data-driven approaches to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas production is essential for combating climate change. This project will develop long-lasting and scalable sensors to provide actionable data over multi-decade lifetimes. Ensuring long operational lifetimes will help avoid exacerbating a growing e-waste problem from billions of otherwise disposable IoT devices. The techniques from this project will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate courses, training new engineers who understand the intersection of IoT, cross-disciplinary applications, and ethics.

Science communication has undergone dramatic changes over the past decades. Online platforms such as social media sites, electronic news outlets, blogs, and wikis are now used by most scholars and the public for sharing scientific findings. A better understanding of the online circulation of scientific advances is imperative because these new channels of connecting with the public have brought novel challenges in dealing with the uncontrolled distortion of information. Additionally, it remains difficult to identify reliable knowledge, given the increase of sensationalist presentations of scientific results. This work will merge ideas, approaches, and technologies from information science, communication, and journalism to address numerous issues of significant social and economic impact: (1) contributing to the improvement of public serving science journalism; (2) providing practical and actionable early predictions of science dissemination from collective cues on social media; (3) enriching the online experience of people around the globe with a better understanding and tracking of real-world message distortion campaigns; (4) informing key current crises related to misinformation; and, (5) guiding science policy with novel knowledge about science communication in the ecosystem of digital media platforms.<br/><br/>While most research on information diffusion has focused on individual platforms, this project will develop a critical multi-platform analysis framework for science communication. A primary goal is to discover fundamental knowledge about: (1) typical trajectories in the cross-platform dissemination of scientific articles, (2) how these trajectories connect to the impact of the work, its novelty, as well as the reactions from scholars and the public, (3) predictions of eventual reactions from early coverage patterns; and, (4) effects of clickbait and information distortion on dissemination. This project will illuminate how scientific findings are shared, discussed, and distorted online and provide empirical evidence of how early signals deduced from social media cues can be harnessed computationally to predict the coverage of scientific articles. The design of an interactive tool will demonstrate how traces of collective reactions can be compellingly and usefully presented to science journalists in real reporting scenarios. The work will be fueled by and will further existing theoretical and empirical research on the use of new media in science dissemination, assess intentional and unintentional information distortion online, harness collective cues from Web-based platforms for early prediction, and design information interfaces for journalists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Having accurate masses will help establish mass/density vs. orbital radius relationships, and to identify rocky Earth-like planets in the habitable zone. These advances represent an important new avenue to understanding planetary formation processes. The work proposed here will mine the Kepler data and use new techniques to identify masses of planets in all 706 multi-transit (multi-planet) systems observed by the Kepler spacecraft. Right now, masses can be estimated for about 10% of this sample: the systems in which transit-time variations (TTVs) are observed. The results of this work will guide future observations and searches done for Earth-like planets, be they done with space-based telescopes, such as JWST, or ground-based telescopes, such as the future US-ELTs. Outreach and education efforts include the mentoring of at least five students from under-represented groups, the development of research-based education resources, the development of a library of animated gifs related to astronomy, and supporting development of a chapter on exoplanets in an OpenStax astronomy textbook.<br/><br/>The team will conduct an analysis of all 706 Kepler multi-transiting systems (MTSs) using their publicly-available PhotoDynamical Multi-planet Model (PhoDyMM). A photodynamical model includes the full n-body dynamical evolution of a planetary system, but fits directly to the Kepler photometric lightcurve itself. Until now, most analyses of MTSs have relied upon transit timing variations (TTVs) as the multiple planets tug each other around, slightly delaying or accelerating expected transits. Full photodynamical analysis has been applied to only 20 of the 706 known Kepler MTSs. This technique also makes use of the Kepler short cadence data, which traditional TTV analysis typically ignores. In addition to finding masses for many super-Earths and other larger planets, the team expects to make at least 50 new mass determinations of the smallest exoplanets, until now inaccessible to current methods. This method has the promise to detect new planets at the lower end of the mass distribution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is an enabler of many applications including automotive, manufacturing, and healthcare to smart city Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home. Many of the more advanced 5G/6G wireless use cases focus on connecting previously unconnected or under-connected communities and industries. As a building block of 5G/6G wireless technologies, the proposed advanced wireless technology may enable rapid and robust roll-out of the next generation network and play a role in increasing the pace of 5G technology penetration. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a high gain beamforming antenna system, as the core of a millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio frequency (RF) front-end technology for the next generation of multi-gigabit applications. With 10x higher availability of bandwidth compared to the legacy sub-6 GHz spectrum, mmWave enables faster connection speeds and is of significant focus in the telecommunication industry. These applications have recently motivated Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other international counterparts to open several frequency bands at mmWave spectrum for communication applications including 5G cellular, wireless infrastructure, etc. Despite these advantages, the existing commercially available mmWave front-end technologies are limited in their performance and are not suitable for the emerging fixed and mobile access use cases of 5G mmWave. To address this need, this project proposes a novel beamforming mmWave technology that supports an order of magnitude higher aggregated throughput compared to the existing mmWave wireless solutions and can serve as an enabler to a number of data-intensive applications. Integrated as a wireless solution for Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), this technology offers significant cost savings and revenue for network and service operators and providers. This project builds on the technical achievements of the Phase I effort and focuses on design implementation and prototyping of the high performance mmWave antenna technology. This technology provides a combination of power-efficient beamforming with high-gain multi-gigabit throughputs and is based on a novel architecture along with high-performance antenna systems and sub-systems that are fundamentally different from the existing state-of-the-art mmWave wireless technologies. To enable realization of this technology, the team is applying a set of unique design methodologies and technologies to tackle the challenges of the proposed complex mmWave front-end technology.

There is an urgent need for new modes of access, confidentiality protection, methodological approaches, and tools so that research using a variety of data types meets accepted scientific standards. The Research Data Ecosystem (RDE) will modernize the management of data to enable a new era of interconnected research for the social and behavioral sciences. The platform will improve the quality of data-driven social and behavioral science research over the entire data life cycle. RDE will enable researchers across disciplines to conduct their work more efficiently and to create, organize, archive, access, and analyze data in ways that they cannot with existing infrastructure. RDE will make social and behavioral data more usable outside of academia by making it more findable and accessible. The project will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and will broaden and diversify participation in the social and behavioral sciences by removing technical bottlenecks to research.

A camera captures an image by converting photons into an electrical signal at each pixel. A conventional camera needs hundreds or thousands of photons in each pixel to produce a high quality image. Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are an emerging sensor technology with the unique ability to detect individual photons with a time resolution down to picoseconds. SPADs are extremely sensitive light sensors. This enables them to capture scene information in challenging scenarios (e.g. high speed motion, extreme illumination, low signal power, and long distances) where conventional cameras struggle to form an image. Despite these exciting capabilities, SPAD cameras face a serious practical challenge that limits wider use --- the amount of raw data generated by high resolution SPAD cameras exceeds the bandwidths of existing data transfer buses by several orders of magnitude. As a result, most commercial SPAD cameras today can only support low resolution imaging. This project will develop bandwidth-efficient photon data capture and processing techniques that will enable megapixel and even higher resolution SPAD cameras in the future. This will have implications for myriad applications including consumer photography, fluorescence microscopy, biomedical imaging, and vision sensors for robotics and autonomous vehicles.<br/><br/>This project will span both the theory and practical implementation of bandwidth-efficient single-photon computational imaging algorithms towards realizing high spatial resolution SPAD cameras for both passive intensity imaging and active time-of-flight depth-sensing. Unfortunately, the data-bottleneck challenge with high resolution SPAD cameras cannot be solved through incremental improvements in the bandwidth of standard data transfer buses (such as USB, PCIe, or CameraLink). This proposal will address the data bandwidth challenge through hardware reconfigurability and algorithmic reconfigurability of a SPAD pixel array. The first thrust of hardware reconfiguratiblity will establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for various trade-offs involved in a SPAD camera image quality and output data-rate, under varying levels of scene illumination and pixel design specifications. The second thrust of algorithmic reconfigurability will design parsimonious, scene-adaptive statistical and data-driven compression techniques to summarize photon data streams into a minimal form. In the minimal form, the photon data will still carry all the information needed for high quality intensity and depth reconstructions, but with several orders of magnitude lower bandwidth requirements. Experimental prototypes designed with commercially available SPAD camera hardware will not only provide performance evaluation in terms of standard image quality metrics but also demonstrate practical feasibility of implementing these algorithms on-chip, for example, as a ""photon processing unit"" in future SPAD camera modules. The findings from this research will be disseminated via a conference workshop, a graduate level course, and STEM outreach activities for high-school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Still, perovskite PVs stakeholders would benefit from knowing more about how to manage the waste from perovskite solar modules (PSM) sustainably. If PSMs are eventually sent and crushed in landfills, harmful compounds carrying heavy metals could leach into the environment. Considering the current short lifespan of PSMs, society may face environmental problems due to the deployment of PSMs. This project aims to develop the tools for identifying design-for-recyclability (DfR) guidelines that may provide sustainable pathways for PSM and initiate long-term research avenues in sustainable end-of-life management (EoLM) of emerging technologies. The project aims to integrate three objectives synergistically: (1) Identify economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable EoLM scenarios (reuse, repurpose, remanufacture, etc.) for PSMs; (2) Optimize circular EoL options for providing more environmentally friendly secondary materials than extracting primary materials; and (3) Foster environmental sustainability for solar industry stakeholders by developing enviro-economic models, creating decision support tools, and offering workshops.<br/><br/>The project has two principal foci. First, PSM architecture will be designed with recyclability principles. The focal point of DfR is producing valuable products from recycling. This opportunity was missed for established PV technologies- e.g., for silicon PV, the typical outputs of the recycling process are low in economic value. Many PV recyclers do not want to accept waste PV or leave the EoLM cost to the end- users. However, it may be possible to open the glass-glass sandwich structures of PSM modules without crashing glass content. As a result, PV recyclers could generate valuable products (coated float glass, flat glass, Au or Ag chunks) at the EoL, producing viable products that can be remanufactured and reused or repurposed in PV and other industries. Second, the PI will assess potential processes involved in EoLM using sustainability-based tradeoff analyses. This approach resides at the crossroads of the abatement cost concept from  environmental economics and damage cost concept from sustainability engineering. The PI aims to apply these concepts to construct an EoLM scenario that maximizes net social benefits (including private cost and benefits and abatement costs). Considering that PSMs are an important niche market for the solar energy industry, it is appropriate to formulate enviro-economic models to assess the EoL phase of PSMs and inform PV stakeholders regarding the pathways for environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable solar energy. This project seeks to lead to environmentally sustainable and economically viable perovskite solar technology even in the EoL phase. The project team will work closely with US Manufacturing of Advanced Perovskite, leading American solar companies, and international not-for-profit associations of the energy industry. The project team will work closely with Rapid City?s Standing Committee for Sustainability, increasing awareness about environmentally friendly and feasible EoL management alternatives locally, and organizing events (e.g., Earth Week celebrations), developing outreach activities and screening documentaries, and holding public seminars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The biogeochemical reactions in this zone greatly impact beach ecology and determine the contribution of nutrients and contaminants to the coastal ocean. Salinity of the water is an important factor in these reactions, so understanding the distribution of salt is critical. It is typically assumed that the maximum salinity in the groundwater is equal to that of seawater. However, concentrations 3-6 times that of seawater have been observed. Evaporation interacting with waves may be an important mechanism that could change both salinity distributions and groundwater flowpaths, due to the influence of salt concentration on fluid density. The research will provide an intensive field and laboratory experience for two graduate students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds who will be recruited in collaboration with the Educational Opportunity Program that serves under-represented minority students at New Jersey Institute of Technology. The project will provide a unique learning experience for students.  <br/><br/>This research will generate new understanding in three primary areas. (1) Model development and upscaling will build on recent advances in modeling evaporation and wave dynamics in beach aquifers by combining these processes to account for water, vapor, and heat transport in the porous medium coupled to subsurface hydrodynamics that incorporate wave action. (2) Data collection will include a set of detailed measurements of beach salinity and hydrodynamics at three field sites in Delaware to better understand these coupled effects in real systems. (3) Site-specific and sensitivity analyses will generate new understanding of the primary controls on evaporation-induced salinity dynamics and the resulting effects on flow physics in intertidal mixing zones. By extending analysis over a range of climatic, hydrogeological, and oceanic conditions, results will capture the range of effects and pinpoint conditions under which it is most important to consider these processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamic network architectures, which include moving relays and flying drones, can support such requirements thanks to their adaptive nature. Maximizing data rate in such relay-assisted networks can be accomplished via 1) designing environment-aware and relay-based beamforming codebooks, 2) managing wireless interference that is caused by or towards relays, and 3) adaptive placement of relays. Unlike existing solutions for these problems, this project starts with a transformative modeling of the underlying data structures of wireless channels and network topologies over curved surfaces, known as Riemannian manifolds. The novel design of wireless networks through the lens of Riemannian manifolds leads to developing low-latency structure-aware (i.e., ?gray-box?) machine learning (ML) models and low-complexity optimized solutions for these three problems. This project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of foundational science of wireless communications and networks along with providing the research community nationwide with fast ML models and efficient optimization tools, which will have far-reaching impact on addressing many challenges in wireless networks and alike. Furthermore, this project equips engineering students nationwide with new mathematical tools and hands-on educational platforms that uniquely integrate Riemannian geometry into wireless networks. Multiple undergraduate and graduate students, including underrepresented minorities, are mentored through this project. Finally, this project gravitates high-school students, including students with disabilities such as autism spectrum disorder, towards STEM through active engagement in interdisciplinary activities of non-Euclidean geometry, engineering, and neuroscience. <br/><br/>This project aims to lay the foundations of utilizing Riemannian-geometric tools, particularly, geometric machine learning (G-ML) and conic geometric optimization (CGO), to advance the knowledge of designing dynamic networks with low latency, low complexity, and high data rate. Such goal is accomplished through synergistic integration of three components, which span multiple network layers (i.e., PHY, MAC, NET), as follows. First, environment-aware beamforming codebooks are developed using low-latency unsupervised G-ML models, thanks to representing the covariance matrices of spatially-correlated wireless channels over Riemannian manifolds. Second, wireless link scheduling and resource allocation mechanisms are developed using low-latency supervised G-ML models, which are based on jointly modeling the Riemannian-geometric and temporal structures of interference-aware network topologies over Riemannian manifolds. Finally, locations of relays are optimized for maximizing the network flow rate using low-complexity CGO, given the representation of relay-enhanced network topologies over Riemannian manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than half of all fractures occur in long bones like the femur. In the United States, 430,000 femur fractures occur annually; and globally, motor vehicle accidents cause an estimated 1-3 million femoral shaft fractures each year.  Surgery to manually align long bones is arduous and difficult due to the bone?s elongated anatomy and the opposing strength of the surrounding muscles, requiring the surgeon and medical staff to exert high traction forces during the procedure.  Poor alignment of the bone fragments is a potentially serious complication, and one-third of patients experiencing this require additional corrective surgery that increases costs and more complications. The proposed robot reduces healthcare costs by eliminating repeated operations and decreasing procedure times. This benefits patients, surgeons, and hospitals by improving patient outcomes and reduces the cost of care. <br/><br/>The proposed project develops an orthopedic surgical robotic system for long-bone fracture surgeries. A malrotation of 15° or more occurs in 28% of patients. Malalignment leads to leg-length discrepancies and abnormal gait. The proposed concept consists of a surgical robot, bone-gripping system, and force-feedback controller to manipulate the robot. This enables the surgeon to accurately apply large traction forces and precisely align the fractured bone. The proposed architecture consists of a 3-armed manipulator with two wide-open rings; it facilitates positioning the leg inside the robot, providing a large workspace for surgical maneuvers.  The objectives are to: (1) optimize the design to provide highly accurate alignment of bone segments and (2) develop a force-feedback controller to accurately align bone segments, coupled with software to predict muscle forces. To achieve these objectives, the research will employ mechanical design optimization, analytical modeling, computation, experimentation, and testing on cadavers. The outcome will be a robotic platform that can be further integrated with image-guided path-planning algorithms for anatomic alignment of long-bone fractures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In applications from health care, cyber security, banking, communications, defense and space exploration, ultra-fast data transfer is accomplished by encoding the data on photons. Whereas the need for faster data processing in fueled the innovations and advancements in microprocessor technology with progression towards smaller, ultrafast, and low-power electronics. Despite continuous progression aiming at developing efficient electronic devices; saturation in the microprocessor clock speed at about 5GHz has been observed over the past few years. This can be attributed to the losses associated with electronic interconnects and heat dissipation. All-optical analogues are increasingly becoming an attractive alternative to overcome the limitations associated with electronics. However, implementation of photonic processing device needs efficient mechanism to achieve photon-to-photon interactions at micro and nanoscale scale sizes. Here we propose a new data processing element, an all-optical switch, with potential to serve as an optical analogue of electronic devices with high data rates, while concurrently enabling device sizes that are considerably smaller than traditional photonic elements. A significant impact of this work will be to open avenues for the undergraduate students, including underrepresented groups, disabled veterans and low-income populous in the Alabama black belt region to participate in the cutting-edge research activities in the field of semiconductor photonics and computational optics, implementing a new teaching methodology and pursuing a broader outreach by engaging high school children and local community with fascinating topics in optics.<br/><br/>This proposal seeks to develop a new all-optical plasmonic switch, referred to as Thermal Assisted All Plasmonic Switch with operation based on thermo-opto-electronic control of propagating surface plasmon modes at metal-doped semiconductor interfaces by the localized surface plasmon modes excited at the plasmonic structures (or particles). Furthermore, a synergy between the analytical and computational approaches will be pursued to uncover the extreme light matter interactions, kinetic and thermal mechanisms facilitating the localized surface plasmon resonances and surface plasmon polaritons interactions with largely inhomogeneous and rapidly changing local dielectric environments of the Metal-Semiconductor interfaces. The gained understanding will be applied to design and test numerical prototypes of high-performance photonic elements such as all-optical switches, that can potentially provide high data rates at the nanoscopic and microscopic length scales. Numerical measurements, in conjunction with the theory, will establish the limitations and scaling laws governing the device 3dB bandwidth, determine device architectures for thermo-electro-optical signal modulation rates down to the picosecond time scale for signal modulation surpassing -10dB and mode sizes that are substantially smaller compared to present-day all-optical elements.

These economic and environmental impacts ripple through social systems as well, impacting public health due to impaired water and air quality, and mental health due to revenue losses and unemployment. Unfortunately, attempts to reduce multi-sectoral drought impacts through demand-side and supply-side management are poorly coordinated. Furthermore, drought management often is initiated too late, as water users pursue short-term economic gains while droughts slowly develop. Improved drought forecasts and better integration of early warnings into decision support systems for water management are critically needed to reduce these temporal tradeoffs. The goal of this project is to evaluate the potential gains of better coordinated, forecast-informed drought management of water systems and their institutional and physical infrastructure to simultaneously reduce community impacts of drought and facilitate sustainable economic growth. This research will support NSF?s mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare, as improved drought management can increase social, economic, and environmental benefits for agricultural and urban communities.<br/><br/>The project will focus on the drought-prone Upper Colorado River Basin, where decreased snowmelt runoff resulting from climate warming and rapid urban growth are intensifying water scarcity risks. Three scientific questions will be addressed: 1) What are the economic and environmental impacts of droughts on agricultural and urban communities under current water management practices and the system of prior appropriation? 2) How can integrating forecast-conditioned reservoir operations with water market strategies such as subsidized fallowing, farmer-to-farmer water rights trading, and urban-to-agricultural option contracts reduce these impacts, and what are the tradeoffs of alternative plans? 3) To what extent do such integrated plans reduce vulnerabilities to changing climate extremes, and where they are still insufficient, what forecast skill or additional adaptation mechanisms would be needed to attain satisfactory performance? These questions will be addressed through panel regression models and the development of a multi-objective optimization framework that jointly conditions the operations of critical reservoir infrastructure and water market transactions on seasonal climate forecasts.  The outcome of this research will be an integrated approach to developing alternative drought management policies that stakeholders could consider implementing to achieve more sustainable adaptation to changing drought extremes. The research team will work with agricultural and urban stakeholders in the basin throughout the project to facilitate the translation of this research into practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project utilizes electrochemistry to react nitrate compounds with hydrogen (derived sustainably from water) to manufacture NH3, while simultaneously decomposing the nitrate pollutants and restoring balance to the nitrogen cycle. Specifically, the research focuses on the discovery and design of catalysts that enable efficient nitrate-to-ammonia transformation driven by renewable electricity. Beyond the technical aspects, the project will train students from diverse groups at the interface of catalysis, chemistry, and engineering.  The research will be integrated with educational and outreach efforts to illustrate the importance of sustainability in daily life while stimulating excitement for STEM amongst K-12 youth, especially those from low-income families. <br/><br/>The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a potentially attractive distributed NH3 production route, because it utilizes nitrate pollutants as the N-source, thus circumventing activation of the strong N?N triple bond associated with the H-B process.

The project is built on the central hypothesis that surface doping of Cu nanocrystals with isolated metal atoms (for example, Pt, Pd, Rh, or Ru) creates well-defined sites that activate water molecules and generate H-atoms that spill over to the Cu. The H-atoms hydrogenate N-species at low overpotentials and selectively tailoring of the binding strength of NO3RR surface intermediates through narrowly distributed d-states of single atoms for high-rate production of NH3, can potentially go beyond adsorption-energy scaling limitations.

Bugs in cryptographic software lead to information leakage and opportunities for bad actors to have undue influence on computer systems.  Prior work by this research team began the Fiat Cryptography project, which generates fast and secure cryptographic code for intricate arithmetic algorithms, which previously had been painstakingly handcoded by experts.  The new code-generation method has a rigorous mathematical proof of correctness (in a theorem-proving software package called Coq), which contrasts with the fallibility of the humans who had written similar code before.  Today that tooling is used by all major web browsers.  This project develops extensions to allow for even more real-world adoption, by covering more kinds of cryptographic code and improving performance and trustworthiness.<br/><br/>The planned work has two main thrusts: expanding scope to higher-level code and lowering the system's guarantees to assembly instead of C.  The first thrust involves moving beyond Fiat Cryptography's original specialization to straightline code, adding support for loops, function calls, precomputed tables, and mutable data structures.  The intent is to retain the quality of starting from whiteboard-level purely functional programs and deriving fast imperative code from them automatically.  However, recognizing the likely lack of a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach for such a wider range of programs, an extensible proof-generating compiler will be built, to which new code-derivation rules can be added if they are proved in Coq.  The second project thrust studies how formal guarantees may be lowered to assembly code instead of C.  Many important optimizations have been beyond the ability of compilers like GCC to apply automatically, but it is still desirable to establish correctness of those optimizations formally.  To that end, a formally verified equivalence checker will be built, to certify that assembly programs compute the same mathematical functions as C-level programs generated by Fiat Cryptography.  A collaboration with experts in genetic search should allow Fiat Cryptography to retain its push-button nature while still producing performance-competitive assembly code.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An exciting target is engineering the immune system to treat solid cancer tumors which are difficult to treat with cellular immunotherapies. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop an LNP technology to engineer immune cells that can enter and kill solid tumors. This research goal is integrated with educational objectives to engage women, underrepresented, and first-generation STEM students in immunoengineering. The educational objectives of the project are to create immunoengineering modules for the NSF-funded International Summer School in Greece and the University of Pennsylvania Bioengineering course curriculum, develop K-12 immunoengineering demos with the Franklin Institute Science Museum of Philadelphia, and engage high school and undergraduate STEM students through research internships.<br/><br/>The specific goal of this project is to exploit a nanotechnology platform to engineer macrophages using mRNA and plasmid DNA (pDNA) as a new means to generate an immune response against solid tumors. Cellular immunotherapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have been successful at treating blood cancers, but have had limited success in infiltrating solid tumors. Macrophages are actively recruited and readily infiltrate solid tumors. Therefore, there is immense potential for engineering CAR macrophages to stimulate the immune system to treat solid tumors. A new LNP platform will be employed that safely and efficiently delivers mRNA and pDNA into macrophages, as a new means to engineer CAR macrophages and characterize their interactions with solid tumor cells. This project aims to determine how LNP physicochemical properties influence mRNA and pDNA delivery to macrophages, to engineer and characterize CAR macrophages using LNPs, to assess their ability to target and kill solid tumor cells, and to quantify the ability of mRNA and pDNA CAR macrophages to infiltrate solid tumors and elicit an antitumor response in mice. The proposed studies will have a transformative impact on the development of immunotherapies to treat solid tumors, and the nanotechnology developed will enable macrophage immunomodulation for a range of applications, including infectious diseases, implants, autoimmune disorders, and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Worldwide production of EO exceeds 27 billion kilograms, and the primary source involves selective reaction of the raw feedstock, ethylene, with oxygen over silver (Ag) catalysts. The Ag catalysts are promoted with complex combinations of five or more elements, each with different roles in catalysis.  Chlorine (Cl) is one of the main promoters used to enhance the selectivity of ethylene conversion to EO.  Although the EO selectivity of current industrial process technology is above 90%, opportunity exists to further increase the selectivity while simultaneously improving process efficiency and decreasing CO2 emissions.  Yet, the interactions by which Cl increases selectivity are not fully understood, thus limiting further improvements in selectivity.  The project combines advanced experimental, computational, and machine learning methods to better understand the catalytic mechanism of EO manufacture and the role played by the Cl promoter. The project will identify the steady-state active phase, surface structure, and surface intermediates present on Cl-promoted Ag nanoparticles at pressures and temperatures relevant for EO catalysis.  Deeper understanding of the operation and design principles for EO catalysts, and increases in EO selectivity, could lead to transformative advances in the U.S. chemicals industry while simultaneously decreasing carbon emissions. In addition, the project will enhance graduate and undergraduate student education at the partner institutions, through cross-training of students between theory and experimental research groups, K-12 outreach via mentorship programs, and integration with educational opportunities that target high school women in STEM.<br/> <br/>The project explores the likelihood that surface structures for active Ag catalysts in many prior studies do not represent catalysts operating at practical conditions. Consequently, the dominant reaction mechanisms and the ways in which Cl improves selectivity remain unclear, particularly at industrially relevant reaction conditions and Cl coverages. The requirement for Cl as a promoter has long been associated with either induced reactivity of surface oxygen atoms or the selective titration of oxygen vacancies responsible for combustion present on oxide surfaces, yet those explanations presume specific mechanistic pathways that are dependent on catalyst surface structure. This project will establish the mechanism and reaction pathways for epoxidation and combustion, and the ways by which those pathways involve specific oxygen intermediates and oxygen vacancies upon oxygen-induced surface reconstructions. Additional insight will be obtained regarding how adsorbed Cl atoms affect surface reconstructions, the distribution and coverages of reactive oxygen species and vacancies, and the associated changes in reaction barriers, kinetics and selectivity.  The inherent complexity of the catalytic system under reaction conditions is addressed through a combination of experimental (time-resolved in situ Raman spectroscopy) and computational methodologies (grand canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations employing machine learning-based potentials). More broadly, this project will provide opportunities for creating and validating methods (both experimental and computational) that address changes in surface structure during catalysis, a major challenge in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One effective way to increase engineering student recruitment and retention, particularly among underrepresented groups, is by incorporating humanitarian engineering themes and projects into curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities. Students are more likely to show interest in and persist in engineering if they are exposed to the application of engineering to improve the lives and livelihoods of people in marginalized, under-resourced, or at-risk communities. However, student participation in humanitarian engineering activities varies unevenly by discipline. While civil and mechanical engineering students may easily see their disciplines reflected in the more common humanitarian engineering activities such as clean water and shelter projects, electrical engineering students are less likely to see the connection of their discipline and serving humanity. An underutilized entry point for electrical engineering students to engage with humanitarian engineering is in the field of electricity access. Electricity access is concerned with providing electricity to the 800 million people presently without it. Unfortunately, the number of faculty active in this area is relatively small, and there is no venue, professional association or infrastructure dedicated to serving these educators. This limits the quality and quantity of humanitarian engineering experiences available to electrical engineering students, and stifles community building, academic exchange and opportunities for collaboration among the faculty. This project will create a first-of-its-kind workshop dedicated solely to enhancing and expanding undergraduate engineering education in electricity access.<br/><br/>The project will convene approximately 25 energy access educators and stakeholders from industry, government, and non-profit organizations for a two-day workshop. The workshop agenda includes targeted discussion, panel and networking sessions. In these sessions, participants will share best practices, lessons learned, and innovative ideas for curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities as well as identify gaps and challenges such as identifying educational materials, establishing local partnerships, and acquiring funding. Pre- and post-workshop surveys will be given to create a preliminary snapshot of the state of electricity access education, shape the workshop agenda, and assess the success of the workshop in meeting its aims. The key findings of the workshop will be synthesized and disseminated through publications and presentations. The workshop will lead to the development a roadmap of future activities and infrastructure, such as additional workshops, email lists, sharing of course materials and resources, and collaborative pedagogical or applied research. The workshop participants will be recruited from a variety of higher education institutions, with particular emphasis on Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is both a basic process in nature and a major problem in agriculture, resulting in crop losses and costly pesticide treatments. Plants defend themselves by producing natural chemicals that are toxic to insects, but insects have many ways to overcome these toxins. In addition to insects? own abilities, which are well studied, recent evidence suggests that bacteria living in the insect gut can help to break down plant toxins. When and how this happens, and its overall contribution to plant damage by insects, are poorly understood. The goal of this research is to identify which bacteria break down toxins from two common crop families (the tomato family and the cabbage family) and measure how much these bacteria help insects eat these plants. Understanding the different ways insects disable plant toxins will help us design more effective, targeted insect control strategies. Ultimately this could reduce crop losses and lessen the need for broad-spectrum pesticides. This project will also provide hands-on research experience for undergraduates at a Hispanic-serving institution, reaching a total of 120 students in the classroom and 30 students in the laboratory. Students will rear insects, infect them with different bacteria, measure the effects on the insects? health and plant consumption, and present their results in public and scientific venues. This will train both future members of our society and the next generation of STEM researchers in scientific thinking.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to predict the magnitude of detoxification assistance provided to insects by their gut microbiota, testing the hypothesis that host plant generalists will benefit more from microbial facilitation than specialists. Using beetles, grasshoppers and caterpillars feeding on Solanaceous and Brassicaceous plants, this research will: (1) Determine the abundance of allelochemical-degrading bacteria within wild insects? gut microbiota. Researchers will characterize gut microbial composition via 16S amplicon sequencing and simultaneously isolate live gut bacteria from the same insect individuals. The ability of these bacteria to degrade allelochemicals will be measured via culture-based assays. (2) Measure the magnitude of microbial detoxification in vivo. Researchers will inoculate generalist and specialist insects with toxin-degrading or non-degrading isolates and allow the insects to feed on plants. Concentrations of allelochemicals excreted in insect frass will be measured to determine how much microbial degradation occurred. (3) Quantify the impact of gut microbial facilitation on insect fitness and plant consumption. Generalist and specialist insects will be reared on their host plants, inoculated with an isolate that does or does not degrade one of the plant?s major toxins. Researchers will compare the insects? growth rate, development time to adulthood, survival, and total leaf area consumed. This work will quantify the overall importance ? or lack thereof ? of gut microbiota in insect herbivory and launch a career-long investigation of the role of gut microbiota in the plant-insect chemical arms race, a process that has generated much of Earth?s terrestrial biodiversity.<br/><br/>This award was jointly funded by the Symbiosis, Infection and Immunity Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and by the Population and Community Ecology Program in the Division of Environmental Biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the causes of these transitions remain poorly known, especially when animals use novel strategies that do not follow expectations that seem logical from their anatomy. By using new 3D technology to nondestructively visualize the bones and sensory systems of preserved specimens in natural history collections, this project will create a unified framework for understanding the relative importance of different anatomical traits that facilitate shifts to new habitats. These insights are especially important when organismal systems work together in a way that is more than the simple sum of their parts. The project then uses a student-centered ambassador model (?Project: MORPH!?) to leverage research products into 3D biodiversity education resources and experiences for the public and students at all levels. These components broaden participation in science through outreach programs and exhibits in a natural history museum that serves the Detroit metropolitan area, facilitating 1) experiential learning opportunities with innovative 3D technology and 2) the role of community scientists in providing foundational biodiversity data (?Story of the Specimen?). Additionally, this work provides advanced training in ?big data? analysis and science communication to prepare early-career scientists from diverse backgrounds for future research in biodiversity science.

Using non-invasive computed tomography (CT) scanning of soft tissue in museum specimens, this project tests a set of hypotheses for diversification across at least 60 independent invasions of subterranean, arboreal, and aquatic habitats. These tests are particularly important for understanding the processes underlying evolutionary convergence. Furthermore, tests of sensory evolution will fundamentally advance how classic locomotor and trophic traits are contextualized across ecological diversification in a major vertebrate radiation.

Integration of thin-film GaN on a heat-sink substrate may solve the intrinsic thermal management issues of GaN-based devices by efficiently dissipating the heat. Commercialization of proposed technology could decrease production costs of GaN-based devices by reusing the expensive parent substrate multiple times while maintain the material quality.

Remote epitaxy and 2DLT technologies utilize 2D materials inserted between the substrate and epilayer for the growth and lift-off of GaN thin-film. Combination of remote epitaxy and 2DLT processes allow for the production of high-quality GaN membranes with multiple reuses of costly GaN substrates.

Sudden cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 450,000 deaths annually and is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Of these deaths, ~350,000 occur outside of the hospital. Survival for OHCA in the U.S. is around 8%-10%, and despite considerable effort this statistic has changed little over the past three decades. The solution to improving OHCA outcomes is early and effective bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (e.g., chest compressions) and prompt defibrillation using an automated external defibrillator (AED). In locations with publicly-available AEDs, survival has increased 40%-70%. However, ~70% of OHCAs events occur in private residence, and public-access AEDs are not available for these patients. Drones can deliver AEDs to the scene of a cardiac arrest more quickly than a ground ambulance team, enabling early defibrillation by bystanders with the potential for substantive improvements in survival rates. The impact on EMS response times will likely be greatest for patients currently not well served by EMS systems such as individuals living in poor and minority neighborhoods. EMS drones can also address other health problems such as delivering naloxone for opioid overdoses and blood products for the pre-clinical treatment of hemorrhagic shock. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project addresses critical barriers to creating a 911-integrated drone service. First, it develops algorithms to optimize the spatial distribution of drones given performance parameters. Second, it integrates the emergency care drone response directly into the 911 dispatch process. The system uses state-of-the-art prediction and data integration solutions to provide real-time launch decision support and asset tracking capabilities to the 911 dispatcher. The result is a drone response system that is accurate, fast, and scalable. The project focuses on delivering automated external defibrillators to victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The decision support system and underlying algorithms developed in this work can be applied to other use cases integrating drone services into the 911 response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The latter process is referred to as glacial isostatic adjustment. A key parameter that determines the rate of this deformation is the viscosity of the deforming material. To date, the vast majority of global glacial isostatic adjustment models assume that Earth's viscosity structure varies with depth alone. However, there exists extensive geological and geophysical evidence for significant lateral variations in viscosity and for the existence of low viscosity regions in the Earths mantle below Antarctica that deform rapidly on decadal or faster time scales. This variability in viscosity causes regions of the solid mantle to deform differently and thus a model of three-dimensional viscosity structure is needed to better measure the changing weight of the Antarctic ice sheet, to accurately model ice sheet dynamics, and to better project future sea level changes in response to Antarctic ice melt. The research conducted here will construct a first-generation reference three-dimensional viscosity model for the solid Earth underlying Antarctica. The analysis will use horizontal and vertical deformations measured by the Global Navigation Satellite System over the last few decades at sites across Antarctica, a state-of-the-art seismic model of the Antarctic mantle, coupled simulations of glacial isostatic adjustment and ice sheet stability, and a novel, observationally driven and mathematically rigorous approach to calculating the glacial isostatic adjustment parameters that cannot be directly observed. This project supports two early-career researchers and two graduate students. Funding will be used to support the participation of U.S. graduate students and instructors in a glacial isostatic adjustment training school, which will be organized by the principal investigator and leadership of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research initiative Instabilities and Thresholds in Antarctica.<br/><br/>Quantifying the magnitude of modern ice mass loss from Antarctica is a key element in efforts to constrain future sea level change. Although satellite gravimetry and changes in ice surface elevation are used to estimate ice mass change, these observations cannot provide a direct estimate because they also record changes in the solid Earth. Similarly, modeling of past and future ice sheet dynamics and sea level change require an accurate model of solid earth deformation. Thus, the contribution from the ongoing response of the viscoelastic Earth to ice sheet evolution across the ice age and into the modern world, termed glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), must be accurately quantified. Although the signal from GIA is widely recognized as being a significant component of modern Antarctic deformation, our incomplete knowledge of earths three-dimensional viscosity structure and the appropriate rheological model for the solid Earth deformation leads to large uncertainties in estimates of present-day ice mass change and modeling of future ice dynamics and sea level change. Fortunately, direct observations of solid Earth deformation have been made over the last few decades by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations installed on bedrock across Antarctica. These observations have been used in forward modeling to infer regional one-dimensional viscosity structure, but they have not been directly used to image the continents three-dimensional viscosity structure. This will be addressed through four key tasks: (1) Inferring plausible steady-state diffusion creep viscosity models from the seismic shear wave speeds determined with the latest ANT-20 seismic tomography model using an inverse calibration scheme based on experimental results from mineral physics and a suite of geophysical constraints; (2) Determining ice histories that span from the Last Glacial Maximum to present from a coupled GIA/ice sheet model, which explores the range of inferred three-dimensional viscosity models and plausible parameters governing ice dynamics. These ice histories will be merged with modern estimates of ice mass change; (3) Exploring and characterizing the spatiotemporal sensitivities of vertical and horizontal GNSS deformation and relative sea level observations to the three-dimensional viscosity structure and ice history produced in tasks 1 and 2 using the adjoint method; and (4) Inverting observations of GNSS crustal deformation rates and relative sea level using the adjoint method to derive a new three-dimensional map of mantle viscosity below Antarctica. These inversions will use the models from task 1 and 2 and intuition gained from task 3 to further refine the three-dimensional viscosity structure and to explore whether observations include signals of transient or non-linear deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project advances our scientific understanding of how environmental stress impacts social conflict. Focusing on conflicts organized around lineage- (caste-clan) and religion-based identities, this project highlights the importance of attenuated manifestation of social conflict, such as denial of access to community resources, asset appropriations and public humiliation, particularly against marginalized socioeconomic groups. These attenuated manifestations received little attention in the existing literature, which almost exclusively focuses on accentuated manifestations of social conflict, such as insurgencies and civil wars, even though localized attenuated incidents can engender major accentuated violence, fueling instability in a geopolitically volatile region that is of vital importance to US national security and global peace. In addition to generating theoretical and empirical insights, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students, especially from under-represented groups, in a critical area of social science research. <br/><br/><br/>The PIs collect high resolution environmental stress and conflict data, leveraging discontinuities in historical and contemporary political institutions across carefully selected subdistrict, district and national boundaries, and deploying a range of methodological tools, including ethnographic work and a survey experiment to facilitate a strong causal inference. They will develop a theoretical framework that builds on the existing literature to offer a nuanced understanding of the role of historical and contemporary political institutions in moderating the effects of environmental stress and water access on social conflict. In theorizing a moderated and highly contextual relationship, this project challenges dominant narratives in both research and environmental stress and its impact on conflict and research on the role of colonial institutions while highlighting the importance of distinguishing between inter- and intra-ethnic divisions. The project develops an empirical framework that integrates three different levels of analysis ? the district, sub-district and individual ? within carefully controlled geographical settings. The sub-district level analysis focuses on selected clusters of geographically contiguous provinces in the two countries. For these analyses, the project will generate: a) large-scale, high-resolution data organized around religion- and lineage-based identities on the entire accentuated-attenuated social conflict spectrum; and, b) highly-localized longitudinal maps on water security and political institutions across the two countries. To validate the findings and clearly identify causal mechanisms, the PIs benchmark the results obtained from analyses of district and sub-district data against a forced-choice conjoint experiment deployed in 240 carefully selected primary census units in India combined with ethnographic work conducted in a subset of these communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Iowa State University Research Experience for Teachers (ISU BIORETS) program aims to help teachers and their students better understand how organisms adapt or fail to adapt to a changing environment by promoting scientific literacy and curiosity, which impacts attitudes towards public policy and its implementation. Never has there been a time where science, education, and action have been more critical in the stewardship of the planet. Teachers play a crucial role in enhancing scientific literacy, but studies show that many lack confidence when teaching how organisms adapt to changing environment and research processes in this area of science. The ISU BIORETS program addresses this issue by providing teachers, particularly those underrepresented in STEM fields and those who teach students from marginalized populations, with authentic, hands-on summer training in university research laboratories. Helping the educators develop their content knowledge and curriculum development skills will build their teaching proficiencies. In turn, their students will wrangle over real scientists' questions to convey the cumulative nature of science - that new data adds to a more complete understanding. In addition to summer training for teachers, the program will build innovative, on-going relationships among university researchers, teachers, and their students throughout the school year, offering teachers and students opportunities to make valuable scientific contributions towards solving real-world problems.  <br/><br/><br/>ISU will partner with four Iowa school districts and an area education agency to conduct an RET site based on investigating how organisms adapt to changing environments. Teachers will partner with host university faculty for six weeks in the summer to address major research questions regarding adaptability. Plant and animal study systems in the hosts' labs will advance fundamental biological concepts, while addressing the plant-awareness deficit. Conceptual integration across different biological levels will be developed and reinforced during weekly teacher/faculty meetings. Relationships between faculty mentors and teachers is year-long, with two day-long teacher-cohort activities during the school year, individual coaching, follow-up visits by faculty to high schools, and student visits to ISU. Biweekly professional development programming will help teachers translate research experiences into classroom practices and develop new curriculum that encourages student experimentation and dilemma-based learning. Where possible, deliverables will have options for both in-person and virtual activities. A focus on plant biology will engage and recruit diverse students into the plant sciences. Teachers and students will benefit through 1) increased content knowledge and curriculum development; 2) expanded educational and career opportunities for students, especially from underrepresented, economically disadvantaged, or rural populations in STEM disciplines; and 3) recruitment of teachers from school districts with high enrollment of underrepresented populations and students who receive free and reduced lunch.

They are present in the ambient air we breathe and can be generated from many different sources such as combustion of fossil fuels, wildfire smoke, and cigarette smoke. Ultrafine particles can potentially pose severe health risks to a human body. Inhalation of ultrafine particles can cause pulmonary inflammation, systemic inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases. In order to investigate and monitor the health risks caused by ultrafine particles, wearable sensors that can measure the sizes of ultrafine particles at points of interest are highly demanded. Such sensors should be economic, compact, low-power, and integrable into digital mobile devices and aerosol delivery devices. Out of various techniques for measuring airborne particles, optical particle sizers hold great promise for realizing such sensor platforms. An optical particle sizer measures the sizes of individual airborne particles by detecting the light scattered from particles when they travel across a focused laser beam. However, in existing optical particle sizers based on conventional optics and low-cost optoelectronic components, the smallest detectable particle size is about 300 nanometers while ultrafine particles, being smaller than 100 nanometers, cannot be measured because of too weak light scattering from them. Responding to these challenges and limitations, this research project proposes a novel scheme of optical particle sizer based on a nano-optical sensor structure which can drastically boost the optical signals induced by ultrafine particles. The proposed research is aimed at developing an optical sensor platform capable of measuring ultrafine particles present in the ambient air and cigarette smoke, which can have great impacts on the improvement of the public health. The proposed research activities will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in the field of optics, nanotechnology, and aerosol sensors, and will also encourage STEM participations for K-12 students through an outreach activity.<br/><br/>This research project will investigate the optical response of nano-optical structures when airborne ultrafine particles are located on the nanoscale hot spots of strongly focused light. Specifically, it will generate fundamental understanding on how to use subwavelength apertures in metal films to accurately measure the sizes of ultrafine particles flowing through the apertures. The project consists of three research objectives: 1) Model, fabricate, and characterize the subwavelength apertures. 2) Validate and calibrate the sensor's response to ultrafine particles. 3) Investigate the transport of ultrafine particles through subwavelength apertures. The project will evaluate the performance of the proposed sensor scheme including the smallest detectable particle size and detectable concentration, and study the effects of crucial factors such as the size of subwavelength apertures. The proposed research will lead to a breakthrough in optical particle sizers by extending the sensing capability into the desired ultrafine particle range. The proposed research will also advance the field of plasmonic sensors by enabling new applications in sensing airborne particles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, scientists have recognized that subduction megathrust faults undergo slip in episodic slow-motion earthquakes, or slow slip events lasting days to months. In some cases, slow slip events have been observed to precede (and possibly trigger) major subduction earthquakes, increasing the need to understand them. Slow slip events occurring close to Earth's surface (<5-15 km depth) exist at the Hikurangi subduction zone offshore New Zealand and are uniquely accessible to near-source investigations. In 2018, two observatories (penetrating up to 400 m below the seafloor) were installed during an International Ocean Discovery Program scientific drilling expedition at the Hikurangi subduction zone. Sensors in the observatories are now continuously measuring temporal changes in properties of Earth's crust near the source of slow slip events and will help reveal their causes, consequences, and relationship to destructive earthquakes. This project provides funding to analyze the data collected from the observatories, and to support another mission to the observatories to retrieve and replace the instrument strings at the observatories to enable their continued operation for another five years.  The project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Slow slip events (SSEs) involve transient aseismic slip on a fault (lasting weeks to months) at sliding velocities intermediate between plate boundary displacement rates and those required to generate seismic waves. The physical mechanisms leading to SSEs, their role in plate boundary strain accumulation and release, and their relationship to destructive seismic slip on subduction thrusts are poorly known, due in part to the fact that most well-studied subduction zone SSEs occur far too deep for near-field investigations. A notable exception to this is the northern Hikurangi subduction zone, New Zealand, where well-characterized SSEs occur within <5-15 km below the seafloor, and possibly propagate to the trench. In early 2018, as part of IODP Expedition 375, two borehole observatories were installed in the near field of northern Hikurangi SSEs to monitor deformation, thermal, hydrological, and geochemical responses through multiple SSE cycles. This project will: (1) recover and conduct analyses of data and samples recovered from the observatories; and (2) replace the geochemical sampling and temperature sensing instrument string in one of these boreholes, spanning an active thrust near the deformation front, during a proposed research cruise in early 2023. These data will be integrated with a network of seafloor sensors (absolute pressure gauges, seismometers, and fluid flowmeters) that were also recording along the drilling transect during a large slow slip event in 2019, offering an unprecedented opportunity to integrate multiple seafloor and subseafloor observations in the near-field of a large slow slip event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sea ice moderates the exchange of carbon dioxide and other gases between the atmosphere and ocean, supports global ocean circulation through salt drainage, acts as an insulator between the warm ocean and cold atmosphere, and plays a key role in polar food webs. Sea ice remains understudied despite its significance due to the difficulty of accessing and analyzing sea ice samples. The sea ice environment is dynamic and presents numerous hazards that require considerable expertise to mitigate; also, because ice is a solid, samples often require more complex preparation for biological and chemical measurements than for seawater. These challenges may be considerable barriers for new investigators, who typically learn how to overcome them through one-on-one training by a mentor, supervisor, and advisor. This award supports travel for US PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to attend an international sea ice field school hosted by the SCAR expert group Biogeochemical Exchange Processes at Sea Ice Interfaces (BEPSII) and SCOR working group Essential Climate Variables in Ice (ECVice).

The ultimate goal of this research is to exploit the photophysical properties of organic light harvesting systems to devise next generation organic photonic materials. These materials can be further derivatized to engineer not only high-efficiency photovoltaic devices but also materials for biological imaging. Professor Ayitou and his team use the tools of synthetic organic chemistry, computational modeling, advanced spectroscopy and crystallography in this project, which presents a mosaic of scientific techniques, educational and outreach activities that benefit the scientific community and students of all levels. To this end, Professor Ayitou mentors and provides training for students who participate in this research.

Professors Aaron Timperman from the University of Illinois and Boyd Edwards from Utah State University are investigating the fundamental mechanisms of a new separation method called microfluidic traveling-wave electrophoresis (TWE). TWE is a promising method for reducing the complexity of samples that may come from biological organisms or the environment. In the investigation of the mechanisms of TWE, the team is determining precisely how TWE works and on optimizing its performance. The unique characteristics of TWE separations make it well-suited for applications that cannot be achieved with other separation methods. The TWE separation is driven with very low voltages (+/-0.5 V) which are 1,000 to 10,000 times smaller than its nearest relative, microchannel electrophoresis. This low voltage requirement makes TWE highly compatible with fieldable sensing systems. TWE should prove helpful in applications such as detection of biomarkers in human medical, forensic, and drug testing, detection of toxic substances in the environment, and detection of threat agents for homeland defense. The team collaborates with the Illinois Academic Ambassadors to enhance exposure of middle school and high school students to STEM research.<br/><br/>A combined experimental and theoretical modeling approach is used to provide a thorough and quantitative description of the mechanisms of TWE. TWE is distinct as a low frequency AC electrophoretic separation in which a longitudinal electric field wave propagates through the microfluidic channel. The separation mechanisms of TWE are unique: TWE can rapidly switch between separative transport, non-separative transport, and immobilization simply by changing the frequency of the traveling wave; and both anions and cations move in the same direction. The goal of this work is to fully understand and quantitatively describe the fundamental mechanisms of traveling wave electrophoresis. The objectives are: 1) determining the mechanisms of zone migration, 2) determining the mechanisms of zone dispersion, and 3) defining the fundamental equations of separation efficiency, resolution, and peak capacity. The experimental results guide the development of the theoretical models, and the fundamental equations derived are experimentally verified. These fundamental equations provide a basis with which this separation method can be quantitatively compared with others and inform optimal device design. The experimental team includes both undergraduate and graduate students. This is an interdisciplinary project that exposes students to separations, theoretical modeling, and fabrication in Engineering. An outreach component is included that impacts middle and high school students, exposing them to STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, extreme-pressure combustion of carbon-free fuels, such as ammonia, is not well-understood. The main goal of this project is to better understand chemical reactions of high-pressure ammonia by measuring important combustion gases formed during controlled ignition experiments, and at fast enough measurement rates to capture the behavior of many short-lived gases. To perform these measurements, a new laser diagnostic technique will be developed to measure these gases at higher pressures and faster measurement rates than ever before. Successful execution of the project will provide (1) new diagnostic tools for measuring ammonia combustion gases at extreme pressures, with broader application to both energy and rocket propulsion systems, and (2) new understanding of pollution formation at high temperatures and pressures. It is envisioned that knowledge gained from this project will help accelerate development of carbon-free power generation technologies in the U.S. The project will also build state-of-the-art combustion research capability at UTSA, a Minority Serving Institution with close proximity to U.S. energy and aerospace industries, and complementary educational activities will enhance UTSA?s emerging aerospace curriculum with relevant laboratory research projects. <br/><br/>The research objective of this proposal is to exploit non-ideal spectroscopic phenomena for measurement of supercritical and detonation combustion flows of next-generation carbon-free fuels, most specifically ammonia. The proposed research combines advancements in low-cost compact mid-infrared photonics with physics-informed spectroscopic models to quantitatively interpret otherwise convoluted high-pressure absorbance spectra at measurement rates which sufficiently capture time-evolution of intermediate species in supercritical and detonation regimes. In this project, high-pressure absorption spectroscopy of ammonia combustion gases will be investigated using both a heated optical gas cell and high-enthalpy shock tube. Thermodynamically scalable models will be developed to predict absorbance spectra of these species for temperatures and pressures relevant to detonation and supercritical combustion. The models will subsequently be used to perform novel high-speed quantitative measurements of the target species during supercritical ignition and detonation combustion of ammonia mixtures in shock and detonation tubes at UTSA. Data collected during the project effort will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate engineering courses at UTSA to better prepare students for next-generation research and development in the engineering workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One effective way to increase engineering student recruitment and retention, particularly among underrepresented groups, is by incorporating humanitarian engineering themes and projects into curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities. Students are more likely to show interest in and persist in engineering if they are exposed to the application of engineering to improve the lives and livelihoods of people in marginalized, under-resourced, or at-risk communities. However, student participation in humanitarian engineering activities varies unevenly by discipline. While civil and mechanical engineering students may easily see their disciplines reflected in the more common humanitarian engineering activities such as clean water and shelter projects, electrical engineering students are less likely to see the connection of their discipline and serving humanity. An underutilized entry point for electrical engineering students to engage with humanitarian engineering is in the field of electricity access. Electricity access is concerned with providing electricity to the 800 million people presently without it. Unfortunately, the number of faculty active in this area is relatively small, and there is no venue, professional association or infrastructure dedicated to serving these educators. This limits the quality and quantity of humanitarian engineering experiences available to electrical engineering students, and stifles community building, academic exchange and opportunities for collaboration among the faculty. This project will create a first-of-its-kind workshop dedicated solely to enhancing and expanding undergraduate engineering education in electricity access.<br/><br/>The project will convene approximately 25 energy access educators and stakeholders from industry, government, and non-profit organizations for a two-day workshop. The workshop agenda includes targeted discussion, panel and networking sessions. In these sessions, participants will share best practices, lessons learned, and innovative ideas for curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities as well as identify gaps and challenges such as identifying educational materials, establishing local partnerships, and acquiring funding. Pre- and post-workshop surveys will be given to create a preliminary snapshot of the state of electricity access education, shape the workshop agenda, and assess the success of the workshop in meeting its aims. The key findings of the workshop will be synthesized and disseminated through publications and presentations. The workshop will lead to the development a roadmap of future activities and infrastructure, such as additional workshops, email lists, sharing of course materials and resources, and collaborative pedagogical or applied research. The workshop participants will be recruited from a variety of higher education institutions, with particular emphasis on Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ultimately, the study will propose whether sea-level variability can be described, and its predictability can be achieved, with oceanic and atmospheric processes. Appropriate representation of sea-level variability and predictability has fundamental implications for coastal communities worldwide. The principal investigator has ongoing efforts with government and private entities related to sea-level predictability.<br/><br/>This project will quantify the ability of models to simulate and predict annual to decadal sea-level variability at a global scale. The skill of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) will be determined with horizontal resolutions of 1 and 0.1 degrees, while combining model results with tide gauge data, altimetry measurements and atmospheric pressure reanalysis. A mechanistic understanding of sea-level variability will be achieved by partitioning of remote and local forcing, as well as via the propagation of sea-level anomalies throughout the ocean. Sea-level anomalies will be deconstructed into various components: static vs dynamic, externally forced and unforced, manometric vs steric, local vs remote forcing. Intercomparisons of model simulations will identify the effects of model errors and random variability on the predictive skill throughout Earth. The mechanistic analyses will increase reliability of predictions; recommend observational and model experiments; and suggest limitations of ocean and climate variability representations. In terms of broader impacts, the project will have impacts on economic, cultural and ecological resources. The project will represent a collaboration with NCAR, facilitating the model (CESM) implementation. As predictions of sea-level variability are essential for coastal planning, this project will contribute to assess errors of CESM at scales of annual to decadal and relate them to heat, momentum and freshwater fluxes, advection and wave propagation.

Specifically, questions from the areas of snow water resources, wildland fire management, and abandoned oil well monitoring will drive the research agenda. The scientific work is united by a common set of techniques for answering questions. Moreover, the common approach is to: 1) Use unmanned flying vehicles called drones to collect pictures and other measurements. While the information acquired by drones is high quality, it is also a large amount of complex data. 2) To aid in the data?s interpretation and address the science questions, we use machine learning methods that train computers to identify patterns in data. Collecting data using drones and the use of machine learning are critical skills for America?s future workforce. Our activities are aligned with career training through partnerships with local companies and internships for participating students. With the emphasis on internships, the focus will be retention, rather than recruitment of students.  Diversity and inclusion efforts will work in tandem with workforce development to ensure that Indigenous, low income, and rural members of our jurisdictions are integral to the efforts. <br/><br/>It is proposed to use machine learning (ML) to process imagery and other data acquired by autonomous aerial systems (UAS). Processed data will support scientific research in natural resource management by providing a clear means of testing hypotheses. The three areas of natural resource management to apply this approach are: 1) snow water resources,  because energy production, agricultural output, and economic growth require improved assessment of the natural capital banked in the mountain snowpack. 2) fire management and science, because an advanced understanding of the physical and ecological processes driving wildfire is required for management practices that better protect forests and the critical infrastructure within them.  3) abandoned oil well monitoring, because detecting and mapping uncapped or improperly sealed oil and gas wells will provide critical data for improved mitigation, site reclamation, and hazard removal. The team bring together the University of Montana and the University of Alaska Anchorage to conduct locally relevant research. The local focus strengthens the relations with nearby commercial interests to identify questions common to academic and commercial endeavors in modern natural resource based economies. Attention is called to UAS and ML as skills vital to both commercial and academic work. To advance the natural resource based advanced manufacturing industries of the jurisdictions, special consideration is given to developing a workforce that spans from two-year college graduates to junior faculty members. This award's plan centers on paid, credit-bearing internships with key partners, drawing commercial interests into the proposed work, and bringing junior faculty to the research.

There is no model for cation diffusion in and through pyroxene in the presence of exsolution lamellae, which hinders the interpretation of thermal history of pyroxene-bearing rocks. The focus of this collaborative study is Al, Ca, Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene.

The outcome shall be a set of  models for diffusive mass transfer across pyroxene grains that have exsolution lamellae. These diffusion models are general and can also be used to study chemical and mechanic properties of composite materials outside the field of petrology and geochemistry. Al, Ca, Zr and Hf diffusion coefficients will then be applied to develop generalized mass transfer models that can be used to quantify rare earth element (REE) and high-field strength element (HFSE) fractionation during disequilibrium melting along a mantle adiabat followed by subsolidus re-equilibration.

A common feature of pyroxene in natural rocks is the presence of exsolution lamellae.  Although significant progress has been made in quantifying rare earth element (REE) and high field strength element (HFSE) diffusion in pyroxene, very little is known about Al diffusion in pyroxene.  There are no published data for Ca diffusion in orthopyroxene and no model for cation diffusion in and through pyroxene in the presence of exsolution lamellae. The focus of this collaborative study is Al, Ca and HFSE diffusion and distribution in pyroxene and their geochemical applications.  The project consists of three main Tasks: (1) theoretical and numerical studies of the role of exsolution lamellae on cation diffusion in pyroxene; (2) experimental studies of Al, Ca, Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene; and (3) geochemical applications.  The majority of the diffusion experiments will be conducted at 1-atm pressure.  The potential effects of pressure on Al, Ca Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene are not known, but some higher-pressure experiments will be conducted.  Diffusion profiles of Al in experimental charges will be measured with the 27Al(p,gamma)28Si nuclear reaction.  Diffusion profiles of Ca, Zr and Hf will be measured with Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry.  The outcome of Task 1 is a set of microscale and macroscale models for diffusive mass transfer across pyroxene grains that have exsolution lamellae.  These diffusion models are general and can also be used to study chemical and mechanic properties of composite materials outside the field of petrology and geochemistry.  Together with published partitioning and diffusion data, Al, Ca, Zr and Hf diffusion coefficients from Task 2 will be used to develop generalized mass transfer models that can be used to quantify REE and HFSE fractionation during disequilibrium melting along a mantle adiabat followed by subsolidus re-equilibration.  As part of Task 3, new models for closure temperatures of the Ca-in-opx thermometer and the Al-in-opx thermometer will be developed.  These new models will be used to study the distribution and fractionation of REE and HFSE in pyroxenes in peridotites from different tectonic settings. The broader impacts of the proposed work will focus on human resources, which include graduate and undergraduate training and support of a highly productive female scientist.

Like using a convex lens to focus light beams on a single point, in FU, acoustic lenses are used to concentrate acoustic energy onto the desired target deep in the body. FU can be used to heat up, destroy, or change the target tissue, and has been projected as an effective tool for non-invasive brain tumor ablation, transient blood-brain barrier disruption, and neuromodulation, potentially leading to novel treatments of brain tumors, epilepsy, and Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s diseases. However, in these applications, the inhomogeneous medium with non-flat geometry strongly attenuates, reflects, and distorts ultrasound waves, which could lead to inefficient and inaccurate delivery of acoustic energy. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will enhance the state-of-the-art wave focusing capabilities by introducing a new generation of acoustic lenses capable of generating specified high-intensity FU fields. The lens design is based on characterizing the shape and acoustic properties of the target, imposing the desired acoustic field by a backward propagation model, calculating the unique thickness map of the lens design, and finally using a forward propagation model for reconstructing the target acoustic field. This research has the potential to lead the progress of science in emerging therapeutic applications of FU, enabling patient-specific medicine, where lenses are customized and 3D printed for each specific patient. Along with the research activities, the educational plan includes summer camps that will serve, mentor, and empower underrepresented students from historically black colleges and universities on the topic of ultrasound haptics using acoustic lenses. The student interns will acquire unique skills, build professional networks, and gain cross-cultural experiences. <br/><br/>The research introduces the concept of computer-generated holographic techniques to nonlinear acoustics. The experiments and modeling approaches aim to extend the capabilities of the acoustic holographic lenses to generate high-intensity scalable acoustic fields from a single element transducer. At higher excitation amplitudes, the nonlinear effects are exhibited by the generation of harmonics, distortion of the acoustic waveform, and possibly the formation of shock fronts. Such phenomena influence the pressure distribution and the diffraction pattern of the sound field. Therefore, new mix-domain algorithms that incorporate nonlinearities, for the forward and backward wave propagation, will be introduced to achieve efficient and precise patterning of high-intensity fields. The outcome of the research includes a mathematical framework for nonlinear wavefront shaping that advances the knowledge of inverse problems of nonlinear acoustics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cell balances the flows of energy and material, usually carbon, between these two activities. This limitation arises because cells tend to use a single carbon and energy source at a time. Modifying metabolism to utilize two sources at the same time could alleviate the limitation. Directing each source solely to either growth or product formation could abolish the current limitations. Applying computational approaches will facilitate achievement of these modifications. Designing a flexible biorefinery utilizing renewable feedstocks other than carbon dioxide and sugars is the goal.

The above hypothesis will be explored for two scenarios. In one case, two carbon substrates will be converted into two products in a single cell of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 11901.

This dissertation project investigates ?resumptive relative clauses? or RRCs - phrases such as ?the man that the police arrested him?, a conspicuous feature of L2 English speech and writing. RRCs are ungrammatical in some languages including English but are possible in other languages such as Mandarin Chinese. Surprisingly, RRCs are often observed in L2 speech and writing even when they are impossible in both the native language and the L2. These ""interlanguage"" features that cannot be traced to either the speaker's first or second language offer insight into the nature of the human language system and its development independent of the properties of individual languages. Second language learning is of growing importance in our increasingly globalized world, and an understanding of the L2 learning process and how interlanguage features emerge is critical to the development of language teaching methods.<br/><br/>Drawing on recent methodological innovations in the psycholinguistics literature on native speakers, this project investigates whether RRCs in English represent a genuine grammatical option in the L2 learner?s developing language system and/or a subconscious strategy for managing cognitive load during real-time sentence processing. In addition to a control group of native English speakers, L2 learners of English whose native language either has or does not have RRCs undertake a series of experimental tasks probing the production, comprehension, and acceptability of English resumptive vs. non-resumptive relative clauses in three increasingly complex sentence types. The L2 learners complete two versions of the acceptability task - one in English and one in their native language- so that their knowledge with respect to the (im)possibility of RRCs can be compared across the two languages.

For religious migrants, people in their congregations are important sources of support. However, providing the support necessary to cope with the stressors of migration may be complicated if what constitutes support differs between the giver and the receiver. The purpose of this dissertation research is to compare religious migrant and non-migrant understandings of social support and whether their adherence to local expectations of social support is associated with stress (perceived stress as well as hormonal measures). By approaching migration from both a biological and a cultural perspective, this project provides clarity with respect to the impact of chronic stressors among migrants. It also broadens the participation of women in STEM, as it provides training for a woman graduate student in lab and field work. The findings of this research will be disseminated broadly to participant communities and academic and non-academic audiences.<br/><br/>The researcher applies a biocultural approach to understandings of migrant religion and post-national theory to answer the questions: 1. Do migrants and non-migrants of the same religion understand social support the same way? 2. In what ways are migrant understandings of social support similar to or different from those currently described in scientific scholarship? 3. How does secular and non-secular education influence how migrants and non-migrants understand social support? 4. Is the degree to which a migrant or non-migrant gives and receives culturally appropriate social support associated with stress (perceived stress as well as hormonal measures of stress)? To answer these questions, the researcher employs methods that measure the presence of shared cultural norms (cultural consensus) as well as individual adherence to these norms (cultural consonance). Cortisol, a hormone associated with stress and accessible in hair, is used to measure biological stress. The combination of these theoretical approaches and methods provides a novel approach to understanding the migrant experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, thermo-mechanical processing of high-strength magnesium alloys is a challenge because of the inherent atomic-scale structure, which makes them difficult to plastically deform into high performance products at normal temperatures. This award addresses the challenge in processing of advanced high-strength magnesium-based alloys by fundamental research of the multi-axial forging process at high temperatures to attain scientific understanding of the process-structure-property relationship in complex metal deforming behaviors. The research has a potential to accelerate the pace of deployment of magnesium alloys and to promote cost-effective lightweight structure manufacture, allowing, for example, thinner sections or components to achieve better fuel economy in the transportation sector. In this project, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in advanced manufacturing science and the processing concepts will also be integrated in the existing manufacturing curriculum. Furthermore, hosting of advanced manufacturing open house on the Engineering Day and Career Days on campus will foster awareness of advanced manufacturing career pathways in middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to understand advanced processing concepts associated with multi-axial forging, in a sequential manner, in fabricating lightweight  magnesium alloys with ultrafine grains that are characterized by a combination of very high strength in conjunction with high ductility. The process-structure-property study of multi-axial forging, by changing the strain per pass, will address the critical issue of texture-related anisotropy in magnesium alloys through elucidating the relationship between the orientation dependence of grains and the grain boundary character distribution that affect the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms. In addition, the mechanistic basis of high ductility in high strength magnesium alloys will be unraveled through the discovery of quantitative relationship between the orientation distribution of grains and the plasticity mechanisms in a relatively wide grain-structure spectrum from ultrafine-grained to coarse-grained structures. This will be accomplished by studying the dependence of strains per pass on the formability of magnesium alloy by combining nanoindentation experiments with electron back scattered diffraction and post-mortem electron microscopy of deformed grains. Moreover, a machine learning approach for a quantitative relationship between the orientation distribution of grains and the ductility as a function of the strain per pass is envisaged to accelerate the processing of magnesium-based alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ultimately, the study will propose whether sea-level variability can be described, and its predictability can be achieved, with oceanic and atmospheric processes. Appropriate representation of sea-level variability and predictability has fundamental implications for coastal communities worldwide. The principal investigator has ongoing efforts with government and private entities related to sea-level predictability.<br/><br/>This project will quantify the ability of models to simulate and predict annual to decadal sea-level variability at a global scale. The skill of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) will be determined with horizontal resolutions of 1 and 0.1 degrees, while combining model results with tide gauge data, altimetry measurements and atmospheric pressure reanalysis. A mechanistic understanding of sea-level variability will be achieved by partitioning of remote and local forcing, as well as via the propagation of sea-level anomalies throughout the ocean. Sea-level anomalies will be deconstructed into various components: static vs dynamic, externally forced and unforced, manometric vs steric, local vs remote forcing. Intercomparisons of model simulations will identify the effects of model errors and random variability on the predictive skill throughout Earth. The mechanistic analyses will increase reliability of predictions; recommend observational and model experiments; and suggest limitations of ocean and climate variability representations. In terms of broader impacts, the project will have impacts on economic, cultural and ecological resources. The project will represent a collaboration with NCAR, facilitating the model (CESM) implementation. As predictions of sea-level variability are essential for coastal planning, this project will contribute to assess errors of CESM at scales of annual to decadal and relate them to heat, momentum and freshwater fluxes, advection and wave propagation.

These economic and environmental impacts ripple through social systems as well, impacting public health due to impaired water and air quality, and mental health due to revenue losses and unemployment. Unfortunately, attempts to reduce multi-sectoral drought impacts through demand-side and supply-side management are poorly coordinated. Furthermore, drought management often is initiated too late, as water users pursue short-term economic gains while droughts slowly develop. Improved drought forecasts and better integration of early warnings into decision support systems for water management are critically needed to reduce these temporal tradeoffs. The goal of this project is to evaluate the potential gains of better coordinated, forecast-informed drought management of water systems and their institutional and physical infrastructure to simultaneously reduce community impacts of drought and facilitate sustainable economic growth. This research will support NSF?s mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare, as improved drought management can increase social, economic, and environmental benefits for agricultural and urban communities.<br/><br/>The project will focus on the drought-prone Upper Colorado River Basin, where decreased snowmelt runoff resulting from climate warming and rapid urban growth are intensifying water scarcity risks. Three scientific questions will be addressed: 1) What are the economic and environmental impacts of droughts on agricultural and urban communities under current water management practices and the system of prior appropriation? 2) How can integrating forecast-conditioned reservoir operations with water market strategies such as subsidized fallowing, farmer-to-farmer water rights trading, and urban-to-agricultural option contracts reduce these impacts, and what are the tradeoffs of alternative plans? 3) To what extent do such integrated plans reduce vulnerabilities to changing climate extremes, and where they are still insufficient, what forecast skill or additional adaptation mechanisms would be needed to attain satisfactory performance? These questions will be addressed through panel regression models and the development of a multi-objective optimization framework that jointly conditions the operations of critical reservoir infrastructure and water market transactions on seasonal climate forecasts.  The outcome of this research will be an integrated approach to developing alternative drought management policies that stakeholders could consider implementing to achieve more sustainable adaptation to changing drought extremes. The research team will work with agricultural and urban stakeholders in the basin throughout the project to facilitate the translation of this research into practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This wavelength regime of the electromagnetic spectrum is important because it contains a number of spectral features such as strong overtones and combination molecular absorption bands in gas- and liquid-phase molecules for sensing applications. This eye-safe spectral regime also has an atmospheric transmission window, which makes it suitable for LiDAR/remote sensing applications. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will develop the first non-telecom photonic IC platform based on the antimonide material system. The scientific insights and technological advances stemming from the research will also broadly impact the field of photonics by enabling operation in this underdeveloped spectral region. Since the research topic will cross different disciplines of science and engineering, such as optics, materials science, electrical engineering, physics, and chemistry, it offers a range of potential, hands-on learning activities that will engage students of varying backgrounds. In addition to high impact research advancement, this project will support interdisciplinary education activities in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The educational and outreach components are aimed at promoting interests in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and propagating educational opportunities by exposing K-12, undergraduate and graduate students to advancements in optics and photonics.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this project are to advance intellectual understanding of the low-bandgap antimonide material system for the development and demonstration of a photonic integrated circuits (PICs) technology platform in the extended short- and mid-wave infrared (S-MWIR) spectral band and to expand educational opportunities related to infrared materials science and device technology. The primary research goals of the proposed project are to (1) develop the first non-telecom photonic integrated circuits platform, (2) realize novel single-chip?based widely tunable lasers and other PIC components with an emission wavelength range of 2.2-3.4 ?m and finally (3) demonstrate highly-integrated widely tunable sensing PICs. This integrated photonic demonstration will prove feasibility for future, on-chip, low-cost, compact, robust, and energy-efficient photonic subsystems that will enable a wide range of practical applications. The work performed within this project will generate new fundamental knowledge related to the GaSb material system and build innovations at the photonic components- as well as -IC levels. To establish such a monolithic platform, widely-tunable semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, low-loss waveguides and 1 × 2 optical splitters in the wavelength range of 2.2-3.4 µm, will be designed, grown, fabricated and tested. Molecular beam epitaxy will be used for the growth of device structures. Multiple, individual SG-DBR (Sampled Grating-Distributed Bragg Reflector) lasers with tuning ranges of 150-250 nm (depending on the center emission wavelength) will be needed to cover the entire targeted range.  As a result, the highly-integrated optical devices and subsystems will simultaneously improve performance and efficiency as well as help meet low size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) constraints for next-generation S-MWIR photonic technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nucleic acids are the new bits of the 21st century; they encode our health and can be repurposed as alternative storage media for digital data. Harnessing the information encoded in these biological materials requires a scalable way to store and access nucleic acids. For decades, we have relied on energy-intensive low-temperature storage and expensive robotics to maintain the integrity of nucleic acids, which are not scalable. The successful outcome of this proposal is an alternative solution to store massive amounts of nucleic acids, obviating the need for freezers and enabling new products that leverage nucleic acid materials.<br/><br/>The proposed project will lay the foundation for developing a low-cost scalable solution for nucleic acid materials. Current approaches are limited by the requirement of low temperature to circumvent the degradation of nucleic acids, requiring a constant supply of electricity and expensive robotics. Instead, the proposed project focuses on maintaining the integrity of nucleic acids for decades at room temperature and simultaneously enabling search and retrieval functions akin to a computer or internet search engine by leveraging the rapid diffusion of molecules in solution. This ambitious goal will be achieved by using novel synthetic polymers that are made compatible with biological materials to enable rapid encapsulation of nucleic acids while providing long-term protection without the need for low temperature.

For breast conserving surgery (BCS), which represents the standard of care for early-stage breast cancer, the most assured way of achieving satisfactory outcomes is complete tumor removal and preservation of breast cosmesis in a single surgery. Unfortunately, the rates of BCS-related complications, deformities, and secondary surgeries remain high (20-40%), which increases healthcare costs and negatively impacts patient quality of life. To address these problems, this project furthers development of an in-situ, scaffold-forming collagen designed as a conformable and regenerative filler for soft tissue defects and voids. This soft-tissue filler has the potential to improve breast surgeons? ability to provide predictable and pleasing outcomes to their patients. Further, the versatility of this collagen polymer means that it can be used for a variety of other clinical applications (e.g., vocal fold medialization, therapeutic cells, and drug delivery) and to create regenerative tissue products for other areas of major unmet clinical need (e.g., cartilage, skeletal muscle). <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to complete the final technical hurdles to commercialize the novel collagen polymer referred to above. Recognizing the significance of collagen as the body?s primary tissue building material, this patented biomaterial platform was designed to be highly purified and to retain collagen?s natural fibril-forming (polymerization) capacity. While this technology offers a broad range of customization potential, this project focuses on development of an in-situ, scaffold-forming collagen to accelerate and improve healing outcomes of complex cavity, tunneling, and deep penetrating tissue defects. The collagen is applied as a conformable liquid, which rapidly transitions to a fibrillar scaffold with soft tissue consistency. Preclinical studies evaluating this product as a breast tissue filler following lumpectomy have documented the following: 1) ease of use, 2) conformability to patient-specific voids, 3) noninflammatory regenerative healing, and 4) compatibility with standard clinical procedures. This SBIR project seeks to achieve key commercialization milestones associated with establishing pilot-scale manufacturing and achieving relevant product regulatory clearance and approval. Specifically, work will include development and validation of scalable processing steps for collagen purification, sterilization, and viral inactivation. This project will also complete most of the non-clinical bench performance and biocompatibility testing necessary for regulatory filings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Major and trace element compositions of the pyroxenes have been widely used to infer thermal and magmatic histories experienced by pyroxene-bearing rocks.  A common feature of pyroxene in natural rocks is the presence of exsolution lamellae. There is no model for cation diffusion in and through pyroxene in the presence of exsolution lamellae, which hinders the interpretation of thermal history of pyroxene-bearing rocks. The focus of this collaborative study is Al, Ca, Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene. The project consists of three main tasks: (1) theoretical and numerical studies of the role of exsolution lamellae on cation diffusion in pyroxene; (2) experimental studies of Al, Ca, Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene; and (3) geochemical applications. The outcome shall be a set of  models for diffusive mass transfer across pyroxene grains that have exsolution lamellae. These diffusion models are general and can also be used to study chemical and mechanic properties of composite materials outside the field of petrology and geochemistry. Al, Ca, Zr and Hf diffusion coefficients will then be applied to develop generalized mass transfer models that can be used to quantify rare earth element (REE) and high-field strength element (HFSE) fractionation during disequilibrium melting along a mantle adiabat followed by subsolidus re-equilibration. New models for closure temperatures of the Ca-in-opx thermometer and the Al-in-opx thermometer will be developed. These new models will be used to study the distribution and fractionation of REE and HFSE in pyroxenes in peridotites from different tectonic settings.

A common feature of pyroxene in natural rocks is the presence of exsolution lamellae.  Although significant progress has been made in quantifying rare earth element (REE) and high field strength element (HFSE) diffusion in pyroxene, very little is known about Al diffusion in pyroxene.  There are no published data for Ca diffusion in orthopyroxene and no model for cation diffusion in and through pyroxene in the presence of exsolution lamellae. The focus of this collaborative study is Al, Ca and HFSE diffusion and distribution in pyroxene and their geochemical applications.  The project consists of three main Tasks: (1) theoretical and numerical studies of the role of exsolution lamellae on cation diffusion in pyroxene; (2) experimental studies of Al, Ca, Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene; and (3) geochemical applications.  The majority of the diffusion experiments will be conducted at 1-atm pressure.  The potential effects of pressure on Al, Ca Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene are not known, but some higher-pressure experiments will be conducted.  Diffusion profiles of Al in experimental charges will be measured with the 27Al(p,gamma)28Si nuclear reaction.  Diffusion profiles of Ca, Zr and Hf will be measured with Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry.  The outcome of Task 1 is a set of microscale and macroscale models for diffusive mass transfer across pyroxene grains that have exsolution lamellae.  These diffusion models are general and can also be used to study chemical and mechanic properties of composite materials outside the field of petrology and geochemistry.  Together with published partitioning and diffusion data, Al, Ca, Zr and Hf diffusion coefficients from Task 2 will be used to develop generalized mass transfer models that can be used to quantify REE and HFSE fractionation during disequilibrium melting along a mantle adiabat followed by subsolidus re-equilibration.  As part of Task 3, new models for closure temperatures of the Ca-in-opx thermometer and the Al-in-opx thermometer will be developed.

Recently, scientists have recognized that subduction megathrust faults undergo slip in episodic slow-motion earthquakes, or slow slip events lasting days to months. In some cases, slow slip events have been observed to precede (and possibly trigger) major subduction earthquakes, increasing the need to understand them. Slow slip events occurring close to Earth's surface (<5-15 km depth) exist at the Hikurangi subduction zone offshore New Zealand and are uniquely accessible to near-source investigations. In 2018, two observatories (penetrating up to 400 m below the seafloor) were installed during an International Ocean Discovery Program scientific drilling expedition at the Hikurangi subduction zone. Sensors in the observatories are now continuously measuring temporal changes in properties of Earth's crust near the source of slow slip events and will help reveal their causes, consequences, and relationship to destructive earthquakes. This project provides funding to analyze the data collected from the observatories, and to support another mission to the observatories to retrieve and replace the instrument strings at the observatories to enable their continued operation for another five years.  The project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Slow slip events (SSEs) involve transient aseismic slip on a fault (lasting weeks to months) at sliding velocities intermediate between plate boundary displacement rates and those required to generate seismic waves. The physical mechanisms leading to SSEs, their role in plate boundary strain accumulation and release, and their relationship to destructive seismic slip on subduction thrusts are poorly known, due in part to the fact that most well-studied subduction zone SSEs occur far too deep for near-field investigations. A notable exception to this is the northern Hikurangi subduction zone, New Zealand, where well-characterized SSEs occur within <5-15 km below the seafloor, and possibly propagate to the trench. In early 2018, as part of IODP Expedition 375, two borehole observatories were installed in the near field of northern Hikurangi SSEs to monitor deformation, thermal, hydrological, and geochemical responses through multiple SSE cycles. This project will: (1) recover and conduct analyses of data and samples recovered from the observatories; and (2) replace the geochemical sampling and temperature sensing instrument string in one of these boreholes, spanning an active thrust near the deformation front, during a proposed research cruise in early 2023. These data will be integrated with a network of seafloor sensors (absolute pressure gauges, seismometers, and fluid flowmeters) that were also recording along the drilling transect during a large slow slip event in 2019, offering an unprecedented opportunity to integrate multiple seafloor and subseafloor observations in the near-field of a large slow slip event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In areas with permafrost, wetlands can develop when permafrost thaws and the land subsides. This process creates a landscape with pockets of low-elevation wetlands couched within higher elevation permafrost plateaus. This project investigates how the flow of water from permafrost plateaus into wetlands affects the amount of methane emitted from the wetlands. It may be that the water transports thermal energy and nutrients from the permafrost plateau into the wetland, that support methane production. This project could fundamentally change the way researchers study and model wetland methane emissions. The project researchers will collaborate with the Fostering Science and Climate Scholars programs at University of Alaska Fairbanks to create educational and research opportunities for university students, and youths in foster care in the State of Alaska.<br/><br/>Previous research at a thaw bog in Interior Alaska showed that spring rainfall facilitated about 30% increase in methane emissions. Soil water from the permafrost-plateau flowed into the bog and rapidly warmed bog soils, stimulating microbial and plant processes that enhanced methane emissions. These results highlight how the plateau-bog hydrologic connection can influence methane. However, many aspects of this connection remain unclear. Most notably, the previous study captured two of the rainiest years on record, but bog methane emissions only increased in one of the two years. Therefore, to improve the prediction of methane emissions from northern latitudes, the scientists will:  <br/>1) determine the meteorological, soil and ecological conditions within the permafrost plateau that facilitate transport of thermal energy and nutrients from the plateau into the bog, <br/>2) identify if and when these inputs affect bog methane emissions, and <br/>3) assess how winter conditions impact these processes. <br/>These tasks will be accomplished by conducting fieldwork and by using a hydrologic model to examine historic data from multiple different thermokarst bogs to identify the subset of processes and conditions that facilitate plateau-bog transport and enhance bog methane emissions. The project team will then look for the co-occurrence of these processes and conditions throughout the thermokarst wetland landscape and update methane models to appropriately respond to identified circumstances. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Arctic Natural Sciences programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To make 3D printed metal parts more commercially viable, a rapid parts qualification process is needed. This project will support researchers at institutions in two EPSCoR jurisdictions (LA and AL). Louisiana institutions, Southern University and Louisiana State University, will partner with the National Center for Additive Manufacturing Excellence (NCAME) at Auburn University in Alabama to establish a Consortium for Additive Manufacturing Qualification (CAM-Q). CAM-Q will exploit research opportunities at the intersection of materials science and data analytics, with a technological focus on Laser Beam Powder Bed Fusion (LB-PBF) additive manufacturing (AM). This will have the potential to radically transform the AM parts qualification process. The major outcomes of this project will be an overall framework for AM process design and rapid fatigue performance qualification, together with significant contributions to the education, training, and development of a highly-skilled, multidisciplinary workforce to support the industry in the United States. The planned research represents a significant change from the current AM qualification practices. Successful execution of this project will enable the fabrication of metal/alloy parts with a significantly accelerated qualification cycle, make the AM process commercially viable, and propel the US industry to a global leadership position.<br/><br/>To make LB-PBF AM more commercially viable, a rapid parts qualification process is a must. By coupling multiscale simulations and characterization with data analytics and by structuring a meso-scale mechanical testing framework, CAM-Q will establish processing strategy-structure-performance (PSP) relationships for meso-scale building strategies and subsequently demonstrate a new qualification approach on the structural integrity for LB-PBF parts. CAM-Q?s goal is to establish a science-driven, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) based framework for the rapid qualification of AM parts for safety-critical applications. A new PSP database for a crucial collection of Discrete Building Strategy Sets (DBSS) will be generated to support the qualification process by combining experimentation, data analysis, and physics-based modeling. For each Discrete Building Strategy set, this database will include: 1) location-specific process control parameters; 2) detailed microstructure maps, including volumetric distributions of pores/cracks collected via X-ray computed tomography (XCT) scans, three-dimensional (3D) ""slice and view"" data cubes in combination with data analysis and reconstruction, and physics-based simulations linking defects to fatigue performance; and 3) micro-to-meso scale mechanical testing to pinpoint location-specific mechanical performance, with emphasis on fatigue performance. Data analytics will be utilized to evaluate the performance of components and provide guidance on processing strategies for making parts with improved performance, thus achieving rapid quantification.

These economic and environmental impacts ripple through social systems as well, impacting public health due to impaired water and air quality, and mental health due to revenue losses and unemployment. Unfortunately, attempts to reduce multi-sectoral drought impacts through demand-side and supply-side management are poorly coordinated. Furthermore, drought management often is initiated too late, as water users pursue short-term economic gains while droughts slowly develop. Improved drought forecasts and better integration of early warnings into decision support systems for water management are critically needed to reduce these temporal tradeoffs. The goal of this project is to evaluate the potential gains of better coordinated, forecast-informed drought management of water systems and their institutional and physical infrastructure to simultaneously reduce community impacts of drought and facilitate sustainable economic growth. This research will support NSF?s mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare, as improved drought management can increase social, economic, and environmental benefits for agricultural and urban communities.<br/><br/>The project will focus on the drought-prone Upper Colorado River Basin, where decreased snowmelt runoff resulting from climate warming and rapid urban growth are intensifying water scarcity risks. Three scientific questions will be addressed: 1) What are the economic and environmental impacts of droughts on agricultural and urban communities under current water management practices and the system of prior appropriation? 2) How can integrating forecast-conditioned reservoir operations with water market strategies such as subsidized fallowing, farmer-to-farmer water rights trading, and urban-to-agricultural option contracts reduce these impacts, and what are the tradeoffs of alternative plans? 3) To what extent do such integrated plans reduce vulnerabilities to changing climate extremes, and where they are still insufficient, what forecast skill or additional adaptation mechanisms would be needed to attain satisfactory performance? These questions will be addressed through panel regression models and the development of a multi-objective optimization framework that jointly conditions the operations of critical reservoir infrastructure and water market transactions on seasonal climate forecasts.  The outcome of this research will be an integrated approach to developing alternative drought management policies that stakeholders could consider implementing to achieve more sustainable adaptation to changing drought extremes. The research team will work with agricultural and urban stakeholders in the basin throughout the project to facilitate the translation of this research into practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past experience is more likely to be useful in stable environments. In humans and other animals, behavioral evidence suggests that learning rates depend on environmental uncertainty. In constantly changing environments, when uncertainty is high, it would be helpful to learn quickly. In stable environments, learning can be de-prioritized and instead humans and other animals can exploit their learned knowledge. This rate of learning can be formalized as a ?learning rate? and the computational theory of reinforcement learning (RL) aims to explain such learning processes. The proposal will test the role cholinergic neuromodulation, a deep-brain region implicated in a wide array of neurological disorders including Alzheimer?s disease (AD), in setting the learning rate during behavioral tasks. The research within this proposal is complemented with an integrated set of educational goals. A methods workshop on the optical tools that are revolutionizing neuroscience will be developed to augment an ongoing introductory neuroscience course. This workshop, for twenty students in the research track, will introduce students to optical and molecular tools. In addition, this proposal will build on the Psychological and Brain Sciences department?s goal to promote historically excluded identities through its Early Career Colloquium (ECC). A ?Neuromodulation of Brain Circuits? ECC segment will be launched with diverse speakers (4-6 trainees from outside JHU, 2-3 trainees within JHU and 1 keynote faculty talk) and networking events, to build a community of diverse scholars in neuromodulation. <br/><br/>The proposed research will use quantitative behavior in mouse models and theoretical modeling to predict metalearning and then combine two-color, two-photon imaging, chemogenetics, and projection-specific optogenetics to isolate the roles of cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation in setting biological learning rates. The proposal argues that the neural controller of a dynamic learning rate would benefit from three attributes: (1) encode environmental cues, (2) dynamically reflect uncertainty in the environment (i.e., high when uncertain, low when stable), and (3) modulate circuits involved in stimulus-action learning. Preliminary data show that neuromodulation of auditory cortex meets all three criteria. Cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) axons in auditory cortex exhibit phasic, stimulus-evoked responses to auditory cues (1) that depend on preceding CBF axon activity, such that early in learning?when uncertainty is high?CBF axons ramp up their ability to discriminate the two auditory cues, and later in learning?when uncertainty is low?this discriminative signal fades (2). This CBF signal precedes cortical plasticity in a region critical for audiomotor learning (3). These data support a core hypothesis: tonic and phasic CBF signaling dynamically set the rate of cortical plasticity critical for sensorimotor learning. To test this idea, the proposal will isolate phasic, auditory input to the CBF to gain control of this signal (Goal 1), use model-based predictions to test whether CBF axon activity tracks a learning rate parameter in discrimination and reversal learning (Goal 2), and causally manipulate CBF signaling during discrimination and reversal learning and examine learning rate (Goal 3).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Globally, the number of used EV batteries is rising exponentially together with the need for stationary energy storage, which is a concern for sustainability. The project will bring transformative change to the techno-economic feasibility of using retired batteries from electric vehicles (EV) for stationary battery energy storage (BESS) for grid and EV fast charging applications. This will be achieved by dramatically reducing the cost of power processing within a second-use battery energy storage system (2-BESS), which is currently a significant portion of the total cost. The intellectual merits of the project include building the foundation of theory, algorithms, and hardware for a new method for using and optimizing power processing in battery energy storage systems consisting of second-use (2U) EV batteries.  The broader impacts of the project include widespread penetration of renewable energy sources while maintaining a more robust grid and reducing the cost of energy, equitable access and energy justice through affordability, availability, and sustainability; faster proliferation of EVs by reducing the cost of fast charging by buffering the energy and reducing the potential cost of grid upgrades and peak demand charges; and providing high-quality and effective, remote/distance learning to a workforce that may be vulnerable to changing technology and manufacturing landscapes, global crises (like pandemics), and shifting socio-economics.<br/>Although second-use (2U) EV batteries contain approximately 80% remaining capacity, the challenge in their cost-effective use is the diversity in their characteristics that include different drive and temperature cycles while in the EV and potentially different chemistries. This results in a significant variation or heterogeneity in their energy and power capabilities, and their degradation rates.  The current state of the art in handling the heterogeneity is to use one power converter at the output of every battery, leading to higher cost and power losses.  The research in this project will address: (1) a design and optimization framework for power processing with few dissimilar converters at lower power ratings; (2) optimal control of 2-BESS in a new power processing architecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During wildfires, the plastic components of drinking water distribution networks can undergo combustion and pyrolysis with a subsequent release of toxic volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) that can contaminate drinking water. This RAPID project will test the hypothesis that VOCs released by the damaged plastic components of drinking water distribution systems are partially responsible for the water contamination that was observed following the Marshall Fire in Boulder County, Colorado. To test this hypothesis, the researchers and collaborators from the affected water utilities will carry out field studies to collect and analyze ephemeral samples of water and fire-damaged plastic water infrastructure including pipes, gaskets, meters, and premise plumbing. By combining the field studies with targeted laboratory experiments, the researchers and their collaborators hope to elucidate the role of plastic water infrastructure damage and plastic pipe formulation on VOC drinking water contamination following a wildfire. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the development of new knowledge to advance our fundamental understanding of the impact of wildfires on drinking water distribution systems and water quality. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of three doctoral students and an undergraduate student at Purdue University. <br/><br/>Many polymers that are utilized in the manufacturing of the plastic components of drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) such as polyethylene (PE) can generate volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during combustion and pyrolysis. However, a fundamental understanding of the relationships between VOC water contamination and fire-induced damages to the plastic components of DDWS (e.g., pipes, gaskets, meters, and premise plumbing) has remained elusive. The overarching goal of this project is to address these knowledge gaps. To advance this goal, the investigators of this project propose an integrated field and laboratory study to (1) identify VOCs of concern by exhuming and characterizing damaged plastic components from the DWDS of the collaborating utilities affected by the Marshal Fire, and 2) simulate and quantify VOC generation profiles from fire-induced damages to plastic water infrastructure materials using PE flat sheets with antioxidant stabilizers (e.g., butylated hydroxytoluene) as model systems.

Each subsystem is typically studied in a myopic manner with specifically tailored methods. In this proposal, we show how closed-loop multiphysics energy systems can be unified under a circuit theoretic framework and prototyped effectively with power electronics emulation. Since power electronics and their closed-loop control action can be modeled as equivalent circuits, models are obtained that effectively bridge the power electronics and power systems divide, from the converter-level (Watts) to the system-level (Megawatts). Research themes are uniquely poised at the confluence of circuits, control, and power such that project outcomes will address fundamental challenges in the design of sustainably-powered future systems. The proposed techniques naturally yield a variety of learning opportunities where complex systems and their controls can be straightforwardly depicted and their actual behavior becomes obvious once seen as a circuit. Accordingly, this framework codifies numerous topics within electrical engineering so that students can seamlessly apply concepts across their educational experience.<br/><br/>The project will develop modeling and experimentation frameworks that allow for the study of energy dynamics in modern systems. The underlying approach is based on first showing that well-known circuit laws are naturally embedded in control feedback paths for power electronics. This allows for a direct translation of controller dynamical behavior into equivalent circuit representations for converters; extensions are further made for heterogeneous systems containing power electronics, sensors, and machinery. What emerges is a comprehensive framework for closed-loop power systems and electronics modeling where energy acts as the fundamental link between subsystem models. Research thrusts focus on: developing equivalent circuit models for multiphysics systems with closed-loop cyber controls; formulating circuit models for complex power systems with massive utilization of electronics and their accompanying fast controls; and outlining a suite of experimental methodologies for emulation of multiphysics power systems and electromechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

That is, when listening to a sentence, a listener makes predictions about up-coming words (for instance, predicting ""sugar"" after hearing ""I drink my coffee with cream and ...""). When people's predictions are correct, words are read faster because the person has anticipated what is coming up. Past experimental research has demonstrated that prediction in a reading task is modulated by reading skill. The interpretation of this finding is that because reading exposes people to different types of sentence structures and to a wider range of vocabulary, individuals with high reading skill have added knowledge that can be used to generate accurate predictions. One aspect that has not been considered in past literature, however, is the role of socioeconomic status (SES). This is an important variable to investigate because individuals from low SES backgrounds are also more likely to have less reading experience. Hence, it is unclear whether it is reading skill per se or socioeconomic status that impacts predictive ability. Clarifying this point is the goal of the present doctoral dissertation research study.<br/><br/>Drawing data from participants in a community where literacy and SES are not directly linked, two experiments will be conducted to determine the role of literacy on predictive processing during spoken language comprehension. In Experiment 1, eye movements to objects displayed on a computer screen will be recorded while participants listen to sentences where the cue to anticipation is grammatical. Experiment 2 will also employ an eye tracking technique, this time to examine how grammatical and semantic cues modulate anticipatory processes.

Probability theory and the theory of partial differential equations (PDEs) are important areas of mathematics with substantial overlap in their methods and goals. In both fields, one of the major aims is to provide accurate models of how engineered, physical, chemical and biological systems change over time. Probability frequently focuses on how systems which are random and/or unpredictable at the microscopic level can become highly ordered at the macroscopic level. PDE theory frequently focuses on the spatial and temporal evolution of such macroscopic systems. For decades there has been a fruitful interplay between the two fields probability and PDEs, with both intuitions and mathematical techniques from each area finding application in the other. <br/><br/>This project focuses on two aspects of that interplay, which are both related to how probabilistic particle systems resemble PDEs when sufficiently ""zoomed out"". One of these, the area of mean-field games, describes scaling limits of strategically controlled interacting agents evolving as diffusions coupled via a graph structure (often the complete graph). The second, interacting particle systems and hydrodynamic limits, typically focuses on PDE approximations for particle systems in more geometric settings, such as lattices (on taking an appropriate fine-mesh limit in both space and time). The goal of this project is to support the participation of US-based junior researchers and researchers from underrepresented groups in a thematic semester on Probability and PDEs (and in particular their participation in two workshops, on the subjects of mean-field games and interacting particle systems), taking place in the first half of 2022 at the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques in Montréal, Canada.

The long-term goal of BIORETS: Biointeractions is to improve middle and high school students? scientific literacy and positive attitudes towards STEM. This will be achieved by engaging teachers in a professional development program that is focused on immersion in biological research and the development of standards-centered curriculum material based on their research experience. The program?s design will provide an ecosystem of support for teachers? professional development where teachers are at the center of all the interactions within it. Teacher participants will engage in a broad range of research activities: from molecular biology to macroecology.  In addition, teachers will participate in various seminars and workshops to ensure they successfully engage in their research projects and have the support to implement curricular materials of their design. These workshops fall into the following categories: scientific process, instructional design, and action research. Teachers will be encouraged to integrate elements of differentiated instruction in the design of the curricular materials to promote the inclusion of students with learning disabilities. The project has been conceptualized in collaboration with the Puerto Rico Department of Education; thus, it inherently provides a broad impact to low-income, Hispanic students at under-performing schools.  A manual with all the curricular materials produced by the project will be shared via the Internet and the Puerto Rico Department of Education.<br/><br/>The need to provide research experiences to science teachers emerges from traditional science teacher preparation programs that lack apprenticeships in research. It has been shown that teachers that participate in research experiences increase the use of evidence-based practices in their classrooms and student achievement in science. In addition to research experiences, BIORETS: BioInteractions aims to foster teachers' use of action research as a means for critical reflection on their science teaching and empowerment. The project?s rationale is that if teachers receive a professional development experience that increases their STEM research and pedagogical skills, they will be empowered to make decisions that improve student STEM learning and student attitudes towards STEM. Hence, BIORETS: BioInteractions will investigate: 1) How do research experiences (scientific and/or action research) contribute to teacher empowerment to teach science in the classroom? and 2) Do students develop scientific literacy and is this reflected in a change in their attitudes towards math and science?  Mixed methods following an explanatory sequential design will be used to address teacher empowerment. Surveys will be administered to measure teachers? research/scientific literacy skills as well as teacher empowerment. A focus group will be conducted after teachers participate in the program and have answered pre/post survey questions. A quantitative correlation design will be used to address if students from teacher participants develop scientific literacy and change their attitudes towards math and science. Statistical correlation analysis will be used to explain the relationship between these scores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, to be effective, they must be tested to demonstrate a standard level of safety and security. The complex and interconnected nature of the transportation system makes the task of testing and verification exceedingly difficult, raising serious concerns regarding their safety and security. It, thus, calls for new problem formulation and a novel systematic approach for the task of CAV testing and verification. The existing testing solutions use ad-hoc methods, such as miles driven, to demonstrate some indication of safety, often assuming that the CAV's perception of the surrounding environment is comprehensive and ideal. However, no fundamental structure has been developed to demonstrate the security of CAV products. This CAREER proposal models the transportation system as a networked control system providing a novel resiliency metric enabling the testing resiliency of CAVs. In addition, it utilizes the prior developed verification framework to formulate the testing and verification process as a centralized feedback control system enabling the development of a novel attack generator. The expected outcomes of this project would pave the way towards safely testing CAVs, directly impacting the future of this technology and related standards, ultimately eliminating crash-related fatalities and saving lives. The research findings can be further implemented for all networked control systems, such as high-assurance military systems and autonomous systems ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles to power systems. The educational purpose of the project is to expand students', particularly underrepresented and women minorities, awareness of CAV security by designing fully integrated educational modules and demonstrations. We plan to include the following activities to serve the need for rural and largely economically distressed regions: (i) develop after school online STEM curriculum adjusted for primary, High-school, and college students; (ii) provide workshops for educators and industrial partners as their professional development activities; (iii) involve underrepresented undergraduate and college students through research for undergraduate experience and internship program; (iv) develop an undergraduate and an advanced graduate courses.<br/><br/>This CAREER project addresses the problem of testing and verification for the security of CAVs. The importance of the security of CAVs has been recognized in the existing literature and has motivated the development of several detection and compensation algorithms to ensure safety under faults, failures, and attacks. However, not much effort is invested in the task of CAVs testing and verification. This CAREER project illustrates that the current approaches are insufficient to safely verify the security of CAVs in a realistic environment, suffering from the lack of a metric that is dynamic-dependent to measure the system resiliency. We describe a research plan where a transportation system is modeled as a networked control system where roads, pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs (due to their dynamic behavior) are modeled as agents, interacting with each other using sensors and communication networks. The new perspective allows us to propose a novel resiliency metric to be used alongside the safety metric to develop reinforcement learning-based controllers for testing CAVs' security. As there are infinite types of faults and attacks, the proposed controller formulates the effects of attacks rather than focusing on specific types, easing the process of fault and attack generation. This project is expected to advance the area of testing and verification of CAVs by (i) Introducing a novel perspective using the concept of networked control systems enabling the development of a unique data stream generator utilizing reinforcement learning to generate attacks by modeling the testing process as a feedback control system where minimizing safety and security is the desired objective and (ii) Developing a unique experimental platform enriched with the power of mixed reality (MR) and vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL) to test the security of CAVs safely.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the emergence of autonomous cars, there is an opportunity to reclaim urban mobility provided that a proactive control and planning approach is taken. In this project, our goal is to develop fundamental theory and domain-driven techniques for leveraging the opportunities that autonomous cars provide to achieve mobility-efficient smart cities. We consider mixed-autonomy traffic networks which are road networks that are shared by human-driven and autonomous cars. We will develop a set of algorithms for socially-aware control of autonomous cars in these systems. More precisely, we develop control algorithms that take into account the social implications of the co-existence of human-driven and autonomous cars and guarantee overall societal good. Our project enables the transformation from the current reality to the brighter future, in which autonomous cars harmoniously interact with the road and network traffic control systems to increase mobility.<br/> <br/>To unlock the mobility potentials of autonomous cars, a key control challenge is to account for how humans adapt and respond to autonomous cars? actions such as routing decisions. We focus on travelers? routing decisions and develop design and control algorithms that induce efficient routing decisions. We use routing games for modeling travelers? route choices over traffic networks and tackle research challenges associated with controlling the core components of a mixed-autonomy network. (i) We will develop algorithms for altruistic control of autonomous cars? routing decisions, that is, autonomous cars that are routed in the favor of society. (ii) We will develop pricing algorithms that affect humans' routing decisions such that the network is steered towards desirable states.

In areas with permafrost, wetlands can develop when permafrost thaws and the land subsides. This process creates a landscape with pockets of low-elevation wetlands couched within higher elevation permafrost plateaus. This project investigates how the flow of water from permafrost plateaus into wetlands affects the amount of methane emitted from the wetlands. It may be that the water transports thermal energy and nutrients from the permafrost plateau into the wetland, that support methane production. This project could fundamentally change the way researchers study and model wetland methane emissions. The project researchers will collaborate with the Fostering Science and Climate Scholars programs at University of Alaska Fairbanks to create educational and research opportunities for university students, and youths in foster care in the State of Alaska.<br/><br/>Previous research at a thaw bog in Interior Alaska showed that spring rainfall facilitated about 30% increase in methane emissions. Soil water from the permafrost-plateau flowed into the bog and rapidly warmed bog soils, stimulating microbial and plant processes that enhanced methane emissions. These results highlight how the plateau-bog hydrologic connection can influence methane. However, many aspects of this connection remain unclear. Most notably, the previous study captured two of the rainiest years on record, but bog methane emissions only increased in one of the two years. Therefore, to improve the prediction of methane emissions from northern latitudes, the scientists will:  <br/>1) determine the meteorological, soil and ecological conditions within the permafrost plateau that facilitate transport of thermal energy and nutrients from the plateau into the bog, <br/>2) identify if and when these inputs affect bog methane emissions, and <br/>3) assess how winter conditions impact these processes. <br/>These tasks will be accomplished by conducting fieldwork and by using a hydrologic model to examine historic data from multiple different thermokarst bogs to identify the subset of processes and conditions that facilitate plateau-bog transport and enhance bog methane emissions. The project team will then look for the co-occurrence of these processes and conditions throughout the thermokarst wetland landscape and update methane models to appropriately respond to identified circumstances. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Arctic Natural Sciences programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental question regarding human language is how voice quality affects speech production and perception. This project approaches the question by looking at ?period doubling? in natural speech, where a voice has a rough quality and more than one pitch. This also frequently occurs in pathological voice and singing styles. This dissertation project provides insight into 1) the articulatory and acoustic properties of period doubling, compared to those of other voice qualities; 2) the interaction between perceived pitch and voice quality in period doubling; and 3) the role of period doubling in the perception of linguistic tone. The findings are relevant to theories of the voice in linguistics, speech-language pathology, and music. The study of voice quality improves our understanding of the differences between typical and disordered voices, which can be used by clinicians to improve diagnoses and therapy strategies for individuals with vocal pathology. A better understanding of the distribution of period doubling in typical speech is also important to improving pitch detection and voice synthesis technologies, which are used in text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition.<br/><br/>The current project serves as a probe of how people produce and make use of voice quality when processing linguistic information. It consists of three studies. Study 1 includes a production experiment of different voice types in a tonal language to investigate the articulatory and acoustic properties of period doubling and its linguistic distribution. Study 2 investigates pitch and voice perception during period doubling using synthesized speech that is controlled for various acoustic properties. Study 3 investigates the role of period doubling and other voice qualities in tone identification, with the goal of explaining the interaction between pitch and voice in different voice types, and the roles they play in distinguishing words.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is the production of a nanofluid with aggregated colloidal nanoparticles that can significantly reduce the use of harmful solvents in oil and gas production.  Substantial quantities of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) solvents are currently being used to remediate asphaltene deposits in plugged pipelines and wellbores for flow assurance.  This remediation method is costly and environmentally polluting; thus, many oil and gas operators are making a concerted effort to reduce BTEX solvents from their operations. This research project develops a novel micellar formulation that utilizes multifunctional chemistries to deliver solvents directly to the organic deposits.  The proposed direct replacement nanofluid seeks to reduce harmful solvent use in asphaltene remediation by over 40%, thus, significantly reducing their environmental impact. Entrepreneurship and leadership training for students involved in the project is also proposed.<br/><br/>The proposed project will determine the scalability and applicability of the micellar nanofluids for asphaltene remediation.  The technical challenge is the variability of the conditions, including oil type, temperatures, pressures, and surface chemistries.  This project aims to evaluate the performance of the nanofluid under conditions expected in oil and gas fields.  A three-pronged approach is proposed.  The first uses a microfluidic method to screen a variety of asphaltene deposition and remediation conditions to identify which will be the most effective. The second uses a core-flood setup to scale up testing to field conditions and the third is a flow loop setup to mimic pipeline conditions that can be piloted in the field.  The team has explored the vast parameter space to identify which conditions should be used to optimize the nanofluid.

In the case of catalysis, zeolites are often used in conjunction with extremely small particles of catalytic metals ? or even individual atoms ? dispersed throughout the nanoscale pores and voids in the zeolite structure.  The resulting catalysts are highly effective for promoting specific catalytic reactions, while efficiently utilizing small amounts of expensive metals such as platinum or palladium.  Nevertheless, the harsh conditions associated with many catalytic reactions results in metal particle agglomeration and concomitant loss of catalyst efficiency.  The project develops computational molecular models and theory predicting the dynamics of agglomeration and redispersion of metals supported by zeolites.  In addition, the models include design and synthesis features that deter the agglomeration of metal atoms and particles under reaction conditions, thus improving the energy efficiency of catalysts widely used for petrochemical and emissions related applications.  The project is integrated with efforts that address retention of underrepresented communities at multiple points in the STEM pipeline, through collaboration with local organizations that emphasize coding for girls in K-12, and by organizing events that address social and professional development challenges faced by both international and domestic undergraduate and graduate engineering students. <br/><br/>The project develops atomistic models that describe how zeolite composition, gas conditions, and nanoparticle size and distribution affect the thermodynamics and kinetics of cation and nanoparticle interconversion in zeolites. The main objectives are to 1) model the thermodynamics of zeolite-supported platinum and palladium cation and nanoparticle interconversion, 2) predict how catalytically relevant reactant gases promote or impede interconversion, 3) determine how zeolite encapsulation modulates the structure and energy of nanoparticles, and 4) determine the fundamental processes that govern the kinetics of interconversion between cations and nanoparticles. These objectives will be fulfilled by using molecular modeling tools that include density functional theory, wave function theory, classical forcefields, and Monte Carlo simulations. This project will provide guidance on the engineering of deactivation resistant zeolites, a challenge at the frontiers of catalysis and zeolite synthesis. Further, the project will enable transformative predictions of zeolite compositions and synthetic strategies that stabilize catalyst performance in the reaction environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biodiversity ? the variety of plants and animals in a given habitat ? is the key factor in the health of any environment. We see that biodiversity is presently under extreme threat, however, largely from human impacts such as deforestation and climate change. In order to accurately gauge the nature of that threat, it is essential that scientists establish agreed-upon methods for recognizing the distribution and abundance of species, as well as the mechanism, known as speciation, by which they are formed. This is a complicated task because speciation is usually driven by a complex intersection of biological, geological, and climatological forces. To address this challenge, the project will use an integrated approach that combines computer science, field observation, and genomic analysis to reveal the processes that generate and maintain biodiversity via speciation. The project will focus on an area of Madagascar where habitat fragmentation is threatening the survival of unique and irreplaceable biodiversity. In addition to generating important new knowledge about the processes that drive and delimit speciation, the project will include training and mentorship of students across a range of educational levels. This training is critical for empowering the next generation of conservation scientists so that they can mitigate the environmental challenges that the world faces today and in the years to come.<br/><br/>The research focuses on mouse lemurs, which are the world's smallest primates and are unique to Madagascar. These primates are of special biological interest given that they are morphologically and ecologically similar but are genetically highly distinct. This pattern of phenotypic similarity and genetic divergence among species has been observed across the tree of life and is generally referred to as cryptic species diversity. Cryptic species are perplexing to speciation biologists because the indicators of their species identity are hidden to the human eye, thus challenging our ability to accurately measure threatened biodiversity. This project aims to develop and apply a novel and generalizable approach for understanding speciation mechanisms in mouse lemurs specifically, and cryptic species radiations generally. The project builds on current research that indicates that mouse lemurs are highly speciose having experienced episodic bursts of lineage diversification consistent with the climatic cycles of the Pleistocene. Key outcomes of the project will be (1) the development of computational tools for identifying the magnitude, direction, and rate of genetic exchange among lineages, (2) a unique understanding of the roles of ecology, metabolism, and sensory communication for inhibiting reproduction among species, and (3) in those cases where interspecific reproduction occurs, the project will illuminate the role of genomic architecture in compromising the reproductive potential of hybrid individuals. The research will leverage powerful computational innovations for estimating patterns of gene exchange among diverging lineages, new technologies for tracking and monitoring small nocturnal mammals, and methods for applying long-read sequencing technologies for generating genomic resources. Ultimately, this research will help differentiate the effects of natural versus anthropogenic climate change for assessing the health of earth's biodiversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The biogeochemical reactions in this zone greatly impact beach ecology and determine the contribution of nutrients and contaminants to the coastal ocean. Salinity of the water is an important factor in these reactions, so understanding the distribution of salt is critical. It is typically assumed that the maximum salinity in the groundwater is equal to that of seawater. However, concentrations 3-6 times that of seawater have been observed. Evaporation interacting with waves may be an important mechanism that could change both salinity distributions and groundwater flowpaths, due to the influence of salt concentration on fluid density.

(2) Data collection will include a set of detailed measurements of beach salinity and hydrodynamics at three field sites in Delaware to better understand these coupled effects in real systems. (3) Site-specific and sensitivity analyses will generate new understanding of the primary controls on evaporation-induced salinity dynamics and the resulting effects on flow physics in intertidal mixing zones.

Recently, scientists have recognized that subduction megathrust faults undergo slip in episodic slow-motion earthquakes, or slow slip events lasting days to months. In some cases, slow slip events have been observed to precede (and possibly trigger) major subduction earthquakes, increasing the need to understand them. Slow slip events occurring close to Earth's surface (<5-15 km depth) exist at the Hikurangi subduction zone offshore New Zealand and are uniquely accessible to near-source investigations. In 2018, two observatories (penetrating up to 400 m below the seafloor) were installed during an International Ocean Discovery Program scientific drilling expedition at the Hikurangi subduction zone. Sensors in the observatories are now continuously measuring temporal changes in properties of Earth's crust near the source of slow slip events and will help reveal their causes, consequences, and relationship to destructive earthquakes. This project provides funding to analyze the data collected from the observatories, and to support another mission to the observatories to retrieve and replace the instrument strings at the observatories to enable their continued operation for another five years.  The project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Slow slip events (SSEs) involve transient aseismic slip on a fault (lasting weeks to months) at sliding velocities intermediate between plate boundary displacement rates and those required to generate seismic waves. The physical mechanisms leading to SSEs, their role in plate boundary strain accumulation and release, and their relationship to destructive seismic slip on subduction thrusts are poorly known, due in part to the fact that most well-studied subduction zone SSEs occur far too deep for near-field investigations. A notable exception to this is the northern Hikurangi subduction zone, New Zealand, where well-characterized SSEs occur within <5-15 km below the seafloor, and possibly propagate to the trench. In early 2018, as part of IODP Expedition 375, two borehole observatories were installed in the near field of northern Hikurangi SSEs to monitor deformation, thermal, hydrological, and geochemical responses through multiple SSE cycles.

These data will be integrated with a network of seafloor sensors (absolute pressure gauges, seismometers, and fluid flowmeters) that were also recording along the drilling transect during a large slow slip event in 2019, offering an unprecedented opportunity to integrate multiple seafloor and subseafloor observations in the near-field of a large slow slip event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This binding turns off the tumor-killing function of the T-cells. Antibodies designed to block that binding are known as checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors allow the normal immune response so T-cells can attack the cancerous cells. Unfortunately, checkpoint inhibitor treatment is only approved for about a dozen cancer types and is effective in a minority of cases. Designing and testing antibodies that block immune checkpoint pathways through a unique mechanism is the focus of this project.   Enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of the immune response will aid in the design of more effective cancer therapeutics.  The research program is interwoven with an education and outreach program.  Baltimore high school students will engage in interactive research experiences, and a workshop will engage local students and their families in protein engineering. Collaboration with Baltimore teachers will integrate engineering into the K-12 curriculum and inspire students to pursue careers at the interface of engineering, immunology, and medicine.<br/><br/>Clinical antibody drugs competitively inhibit interactions between surface-bound immune checkpoint proteins and their activating ligands. This project will instead target the molecular trafficking behavior of the checkpoint proteins before they reach the cell surface.  Engaging multiple epitopes on a single transmembrane protein can induce clustering and down-regulation, eliminating immune checkpoint proteins from the cell surface. This mobilizes the immune response. The research objective of this project is to discover and design multi-specific down-regulating antibodies (MSDR Abs) targeting immune checkpoint proteins, use them to explore molecular trafficking, and evaluate their effects on the immune system.  MSDR Abs will enable molecular characterization of immune checkpoint pathways and help elucidate the mechanisms underlying resistance to current therapeutics. The proposed work will also lay the foundation for development of custom-designed proteins that enact a distinctive trafficking-based mechanism and have great potential as cancer therapies. Moreover, the modular platform developed herein can be readily extended to other biological systems for a range of research and medical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modifying the response can dramatically improve treatment outcomes. For example, altering the response to chemotherapy could inhibit or reverse tumor growth. Altering the immune system response could reduce the need for vaccine development. Many of the key regulators of these responses are enzymes known as kinases. Several kinase inhibitors have proven successful in treating certain cancers. Utilizing genomic tools to identify which kinases control specific cellular stress responses is a core strategy in this project. Advancing equity and inclusion in the genomics field at various academic levels is another major objective. Introducing genomic technologies and analysis to high school students in the NY Bioforce program is another major thrust of this project. Collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico to develop short courses will also be undertaken.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enable large-scale data-driven prediction of how genes alter cellular response. To this end, assays that extend single-cell genomics to a multiplex platform to map the effects of perturbations will be developed. The objective is to define the molecular changes that cells undergo in response to cellular stress and how those responses depend on the activity of individual kinases in the protein kinome. Information on kinase regulatory networks will be used to manipulate cellular response towards phenotypes of interest, such as treatment-sensitive cell fates. Methods to query these cellular responses must account for how even a seemingly homogeneous group of cells can display substantial heterogeneity in their response to cellular stress. The project leverages high-throughput single-cell genomic techniques to arrive at kinase regulatory networks that define the response of cells to genotoxic stress, immune-associated programs, and genetic redundancy driving dynamic changes induced by kinase inhibition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applications range from vibration suppression and shock absorption to the development of metamaterials with self-sensing capabilities. This research will fill a fundamental knowledge gap in systematic techniques and theories that conceptualize mechanical metamaterials. The project work will focus on metamaterials with heterogeneity that arises from: 1) an inclusion in the topology of an elastomeric matrix, coined a ``digital element"", and 2) the combination of materials whose behavior is primarily viscoelastic with a material whose behavior is primarily elastic and/or hyperelastic.  The selective placement /and or removal of these digital elements allows for the systematic programming of a single host structure to exemplify a host of inertial and elastic behaviors leading to a range of dynamic responses when used as a component in a vibratory system. We hypothesize that the composite viscoelastic and hyperelastic materials will allow the host structure to have tailored novel strain dependent responses. The activities will develop the fundamental understanding and establish the mathematical framework needed to exploit these phenomena using the theory of dynamical systems along with analytical and numerical modeling, material characterization, and experimental testing.

Disinfectants can inactivate pathogens but require an active engagement that places undue burden on personnel and the environment; furthermore, the success rate varies, and the results do not persist. Most current antimicrobial materials are expensive, toxic to humans and the environment, and show minimal viral inactivation. Self-decontaminating surfaces provide a much-needed solution to these limitations, especially in areas with high-touch surfaces and large population flow. Customers, from hardware and elevator manufacturers to hospitals and airlines, will benefit from an effective, low-cost, environmentally sound solution to decontamination and customer safety for conditions such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.  This project has potential impact for the $8 B antimicrobial coatings market, while delivering improved clinical outcomes. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the efficacy of a breakthrough, permanent ceramic coating technology against both viruses and bacteria.  A pure ceramic coating that exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) requirements will be synthesized and deposited on relevant substrates. The key to reaching this goal is gaining an understanding of the mechanism of microbial inactivation ? believed to be the spontaneous generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the surface of the ceramic ? and how to maximize them in a practical coating. Spectroscopic techniques will be used to rapidly assess the number and type of ROS generated and thus the efficacy of the materials. Optimization will occur through the addition/substitution of targeted alkali, alkaline earth, transition, and/or main-group metals to control the lattice of the material and lock-in specific valence states to optimize the ability of the ceramic to generate large numbers of the appropriate reactive oxygen species. Tests will be performed against both viral and bacterial challenges to correlate the results of the rapid screening assessment with antimicrobial effectiveness.

Worldwide production of EO exceeds 27 billion kilograms, and the primary source involves selective reaction of the raw feedstock, ethylene, with oxygen over silver (Ag) catalysts. The Ag catalysts are promoted with complex combinations of five or more elements, each with different roles in catalysis.  Chlorine (Cl) is one of the main promoters used to enhance the selectivity of ethylene conversion to EO.  Although the EO selectivity of current industrial process technology is above 90%, opportunity exists to further increase the selectivity while simultaneously improving process efficiency and decreasing CO2 emissions.  Yet, the interactions by which Cl increases selectivity are not fully understood, thus limiting further improvements in selectivity.  The project combines advanced experimental, computational, and machine learning methods to better understand the catalytic mechanism of EO manufacture and the role played by the Cl promoter. The project will identify the steady-state active phase, surface structure, and surface intermediates present on Cl-promoted Ag nanoparticles at pressures and temperatures relevant for EO catalysis.  Deeper understanding of the operation and design principles for EO catalysts, and increases in EO selectivity, could lead to transformative advances in the U.S. chemicals industry while simultaneously decreasing carbon emissions. In addition, the project will enhance graduate and undergraduate student education at the partner institutions, through cross-training of students between theory and experimental research groups, K-12 outreach via mentorship programs, and integration with educational opportunities that target high school women in STEM.<br/> <br/>The project explores the likelihood that surface structures for active Ag catalysts in many prior studies do not represent catalysts operating at practical conditions. Consequently, the dominant reaction mechanisms and the ways in which Cl improves selectivity remain unclear, particularly at industrially relevant reaction conditions and Cl coverages. The requirement for Cl as a promoter has long been associated with either induced reactivity of surface oxygen atoms or the selective titration of oxygen vacancies responsible for combustion present on oxide surfaces, yet those explanations presume specific mechanistic pathways that are dependent on catalyst surface structure. This project will establish the mechanism and reaction pathways for epoxidation and combustion, and the ways by which those pathways involve specific oxygen intermediates and oxygen vacancies upon oxygen-induced surface reconstructions. Additional insight will be obtained regarding how adsorbed Cl atoms affect surface reconstructions, the distribution and coverages of reactive oxygen species and vacancies, and the associated changes in reaction barriers, kinetics and selectivity.  The inherent complexity of the catalytic system under reaction conditions is addressed through a combination of experimental (time-resolved in situ Raman spectroscopy) and computational methodologies (grand canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations employing machine learning-based potentials). More broadly, this project will provide opportunities for creating and validating methods (both experimental and computational) that address changes in surface structure during catalysis, a major challenge in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PFAS are found in ground, surface, and drinking waters and, in high concentrations, have been associated with serious health effects such as liver and thyroid disease and cancer. Thus, water decontamination efforts focused on mitigating the environmental and health impacts of hazardous PFAS must be considered. Current PFAS removal techniques rely on sorbent materials (e.g., activated carbon and ion exchange resins) for their reasonable removal rates and low costs. Yet, these common sorbents suffer from poor selectivity, low affinity, and slow adsorption kinetics when faced with PFAS at environmentally-relevant concentrations, and the sorbent regeneration processes are energy-intensive. Advanced sorbent materials that exhibit selective and rapid removal of PFAS with inexpensive regeneration are urgently needed. This project examines the use of fluorinated macromolecules with tunable functionalities, porosities, and controllable hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions for advanced sorbent design. The design approach prioritizes manufacturing simplicity to eliminate the need for costly post-synthetic transformations and complex instrumentation. The investigation will focus on understanding the complex interfacial phenomena governing the separation of PFAS from drinking water using the polymer sorbent material. This project also serves as an educational platform for developing graduate-level course materials and engaging undergraduate and K-12 students in STEM research.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost, mass-scale sorbent production strategy using a novel fluorinated block copolymer. The polymer candidate leverages its self-assembly at solid-liquid interfaces to facilitate the elimination of toxic PFAS from drinking water. The porous polymer sorbent will be synthesized from inexpensive, commercially-available monomers and does not require post-synthetic transformation to achieve its desired functionality. The sorbent design is inspired by the underlying interfacial phenomena, where small-molecule adsorption and balanced hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions can be controlled concurrently. To that end, the project aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the working principles of the porous polymer sorbent. The approach will examine the interplay of (i) hydrophilic interactions of sorbent functionality to the short-chain PFAS and water molecules, (ii) balanced hydrophobic carbon-fluorine?fluorine-carbon interactions at solid-liquid interfaces, where the polymer sorbent is ?solid? and long-chain PFAS dissolved in water is considered a ?liquid? phase, and (iii) tuning thermodynamically-driven self-assembly phenomena. PFAS elimination performance will be tested with ?control? and drinking water samples collected from various areas of New Jersey. This project will also establish a sustainable approach for green solvent-based recycling and reuse of spent sorbents. To convey the scientific findings to a broader audience, the investigator will form an Undergraduate & K-12 Research Team at Montclair State University. This team will participate in (i) fieldwork to collect drinking water samples from nearby industrial zones for sorbent testing and (ii) educational outreach by presenting an interactive ?Visual Color Code Sorbent Demonstration? among communities having limited technical knowledge.

Such rapid changes in the structure of individual work conditions have led to unique challenges and pressures for these three groups. Further, the divisions of employees into each of the aforementioned groups may exacerbate societal disadvantages already noted in science and practice, including socioeconomic status (SES) and race because these divisions are seen in the types of jobs that allow for (or mandate) continued work through social distancing requirements instituted by federal and state governments. Thus, the current project will examine how such rapid changes in work structure and status have differentially affected employees across various levels of job structure, SES, and race. The researchers will examine (1) how these changes affect employee outcomes (including job attitudes, health and wellbeing, and job performance), and (2) the ways in which organizational responses to COVID-19 helped to mitigate (or exacerbate) these outcomes. This study seeks to advance the field of organizational science by uncovering the ways in which continued changes in occupational structure and organizational responses interact to influence employees over time.

A better understanding of the aging effect in its early stage (55-65 years old) contributes to the advancement of speech technology (e.g., hearing aids, voice user interfaces) to better fulfill the needs of an aging population. This dissertation investigates the influence of aging on speech perception by comparing speech perception in older vs. younger adults. The experiments investigate listeners? use of the acoustic signal and contextual information, and test how listeners adapt to ambiguity in speech sounds. <br/><br/>Listeners integrate multiple acoustic cues when identifying speech sounds. When the primary acoustic cue is ambiguous, listeners may rely more heavily on a secondary cue to ensure speech understanding. As older listeners experience reduced temporal processing abilities, it is possible that they compensate by weighing non-temporal acoustic cues more heavily in speech perception. Experiment 1 tests whether the age-related cue-weighting shift found previously in the perception of the difference between /b/ and /p/ extends to the /d/ vs. /t/ distinction. Listeners may also adjust their cue weighting depending on the nature of the input. Experiment 2 tests whether younger and older listeners use different cue-weighting adjustment strategies. Additionally, listeners may access stored information about words to help resolve ambiguities in the acoustic signal. Older listeners were previously found to use this lexical information to a greater degree than younger listeners. Experiment 3 explores whether younger and older adults differ in their use of lexical information when learning to interpret utterances that are ambiguous. A final goal of the dissertation is to test whether younger and older adults differ in how they handle changes in speaking rate. In Experiment 4, the effect of speaking rate is examined by embedding /d/ vs. /t/ contrasts in slow and fast speech contexts and presenting these syllables to younger and older listeners to compare their performance in identifying the sounds. The results of the four experiments contribute to our understanding of the human aging process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Aim 3, molecular circuits will be developed that couple thermal control of membrane localization to intracellular biochemistry that controls gene expression or posttranslational modifications, which will provide modular strategies for thermal control for a wide variety of downstream applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In arid regions, water withdrawals from rivers for urban and agricultural use have resulted in dramatic losses of riparian and aquatic habitats and their resident biota. As arid-land rivers dry, cultural connections to these water bodies are also negatively affected, including those of Indigenous peoples that have stewarded these rivers for millennia. However, recent advances in wastewater treatment plant technologies have resulted in high quality treated effluent that could be useful for restoring flow and ecological function in dewatered rivers. In this Research Experiences for Teachers Sites in Biological Sciences (BIORETS) program at the University of Arizona (UA), three cohorts of teacher participants will collaborate with ecologists and municipal natural resource managers to address two primary place-based research questions. First, how does the release of effluent affect the biodiversity of aquatic and riparian species in and along the urban Santa Cruz River in southern Arizona? Second, how do ecological communities change over time in these newly flowing ecosystems as new species return to the system? Teachers will work with academic mentors at UA, as well as with members of the Tohono O?odham and Pascua Yaqui tribes, to collect and analyze data. Teachers also will develop curricula for their K-12 students to participate in ecological studies, learn about water resource conservation, and reinvigorate community connections to the river. <br/> <br/>Historically, treated effluent was generally of poor water quality and it degraded ecological conditions in rivers that received effluent. Although wastewater treatment plant upgrades have greatly improved effluent water quality, large knowledge gaps remain regarding how well effluent can restore ecosystem function and riparian and aquatic biodiversity in arid-land rivers. These gaps are important to address because there are many competing demands for effluent (e.g., agricultural or golf course irrigation) which could reduce its availability to restore flow in rivers. Additionally, numerous basic ecological processes can be studied in these novel urban ecosystems, including community assembly mechanisms such as species turnover and priority effects. In this BIORETS program at UA, teachers and researchers will quantify the diversity and community structure of multiple taxonomic groups (aquatic invertebrates, riparian birds and mammals, and wetland plants) in three newly rewetted reaches of the river over three years, and compare observed patterns with data collected concurrently from nearby dry reaches. Together, these data will elucidate mechanisms of community assembly in novel ecosystems while also providing municipal managers with real-time ecological data to inform water resource management decisions and enhance urban sustainability. The results of this research will answer important ecological questions, shape water management decisions in the Santa Cruz basin, and provide a model approach for other cities to adopt for restoring flow in dewatered rivers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Eventually the cloud deck breaks up and the ocean appears between puffy cumulus clouds, which start out small but grow into towers over the warm equatorial Pacific.  The breakup of the cloud deck, referred to as the stratocumulus to cumulus transition, matters for climate as a cloud deck cools the earth by reflecting sunlight to space while the ocean absorbs most of the sunlight that falls on it.  One concern here is that the stratus to cumulus transition is tied to sea surface temperature (SST), thus the warming of SSTs by greenhouse gas increases could lead to additional warming by favoring well-separated cumulus clouds over a continuous stratocumulus cloud deck.  Concern over this feedback, in which warming begets further warming, has prompted intense interest in the stratocumulus to cumulus transition.<br/><br/>Researchers studying stratocumulus clouds have found a powerful tool in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models, in which the cloudy atmosphere is simulated on a grid mesh with flow variables like wind speed, temperature, moisture, and cloud amount defined on a lattice of gridpoints spaced perhaps a few tens of meters apart.  LES models produce surprisingly realistic simulations of clouds, but they require considerable computing power and the cloud fields they simulate are not more than a few tens of kilometers wide.  The small domain is a severe limitation in studies of the cloud transition, which takes place over hundreds of kilometers.  A further limitation is that cloud behavior is strongly influenced by the large-scale atmospheric circulation, particularly the planetary-scale overturning of the Hadley cells (one each for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres).  The Hadley cells feature rising motion in the towering cumulus clouds over the warmest SSTs balanced by subsidence over the subtropics.  The overturning motion and accompanying large-scale atmopsheric characteristics have to be externally imposed in LES simulations, which is unfortunate as changes in the cloud transition may influence the overturning circulation in ways that could feed back on the cloud transition.<br/><br/>Reseach under this award addresses the mismatch between the accessible domain sizes for LES models and the much larger areas covered by the stratocumulus to cumulus transition and the even larger Hadley cells.  The strategy involves the development and use of a hierarchy of three LES model configurations, the first of which is a small-domain LES domain with periodic boundaries (clouds flowing out of the western side of the domain reenter on the eastern side).  The small domain can be slowly moved over progressively warmer SSTs to induce the cloud transition.  The second configuration is a long channel with inflow at the northern end (representing conditions near California) and outflow at the southern end (the ""Australian"" end).  The domain is narrow but periodic in the longitudinal direction to save on computational expense, and not as long as an actual Pacific transect.  Nevertheless preliminary work shows that the domain is capable of producing the stratocumulus to cumulus transition if an SST contrast is imposed between the northern and southern ends, along with appropriate subsidence.  The third configuration is similar to the second only much deeper and closed at the ends so that it generates its own overturning circulation, smaller than but analogous to a Hadley cell.<br/><br/>Several experiments are planned, for instance with varying carbon dioxide concentration to study changes in the cloud transition as climate warms.  Analysis of model results is guided in part by the theory of horizontal convection, meaning the behavior of convection generated by temperature contrasts along the top or bottom boundary of a domain.  Horizontal convection has been extensively studied in oceanography but is not a common framework for understanding clouds and large-scale atmospheric overturning.<br/><br/>The education and outreach component of this CAREER award takes advantage of the realism of clouds simulated by LES models.  The project works with the Visualization Services and Research Lab (VisLab) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to create a collection of cloud images and animations that will be offered to the public as an online Cloud Gallery.  A version of the Cloud Gallery will be exhibited at the William Benton Museum of Art (WBMA), a public museum in Connecticut.  The project also involves efforts to incorporate art into science teaching, acknowledging the perceptive portrayal of clouds and turbulence found in artworks such as Da Vinci's sketches of waterfalls.  One such effort is conducted through the Joule Fellows program, a six week summer program for K-12 teachers.

However, the desirable impacts of autonomy are only achievable if the underlying algorithms can handle the unique challenges that humans present. To design safe, trustworthy autonomous systems, there is a need to transform how intelligent systems interact, influence, and predict human agents. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will focus on the understanding how humans and mobile robots can and should interact. First, predicting human trajectories in crowded spaces through structured representations will be considered. Second, robot strategies for using these predictions for intelligent decision-making will be considered. The aim is to balance efficiency and safety, guaranteeing reliable performance even in the presence of erratic human behavior and sensor uncertainty. The approaches will be evaluated on real-world robots, motivated by high-impact problem domains, including agricultural robots (which is currently facing a labor crisis, resulting in an increased demand for robotics); collaborative manufacturing (which is seeing a rise in popularity of co-robots); and transportation (where behavior prediction and interaction remains one of key challenges for autonomy). This project will support robotics education through the development of robotics coursework in PrairieLearn, an online problem-driven learning system developed at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and K-12 outreach to spur interest in STEM and robotics.  On-line tutorials and short courses will also aid in both integration of research with education and transition to industry.<br/><br/>Decades of robotics and automation research is reaching a critical turning point: the gap between theory and full-scale deployment is beginning to close.

This project will examine the interaction between humans and mobile robots, aiming to uncover the underlying structure within this interaction and enable fluid robot navigation. Trajectory prediction and crowd navigation will be examined. First, interaction graphs will be introduced as a formal representation that captures the coupling between agents and allows for tractability and computational efficiency through factorizations. This framework allows modeling types of interactions that capture variable and dynamic relationships between agents. Second, this representation and prediction insight will be combined into robust navigation, providing safety even in the presence of uncertainty. Improving mobile robot interaction will impact many different application sectors, including agricultural robots, collaborative manufacturing, and transportation.

The Sandbox is a widely deployed STEM classroom tool that enables students to model landscapes with sand and observe how virtual water flows over the landscape. Its basic design consists of a box of sand on a table with a short-throw projector and an altimetry sensor mounted about 3 feet above the sand. The altimetry sensor passes a 3D scan of the sand surface to software that generates a color elevation map of the surface and projects it onto the surface of the sand. The software projects virtual water flowing across the sand landscape according to the fluid dynamics driven by the sand surface's shape. This project will advance the geophysical principles that the Sandbox can model by adding new simulation capabilities to its open-source software. The project aims to improve educators' understanding of best practices for this tool by measuring the Sandbox's effect on students' performance in courses. By bringing together a team of investigators from both civil engineering and environmental science, the project will produce laboratory projects and evaluations that will impact the pedagogy of geophysics and hydrology topics common to both fields. It will also meet a critical need for updating the Sandbox's software to work with newer altimetry sensors, thereby extending the Sandbox's life as a classroom instrument. Project outcomes will include publication of findings on best practices for using the classroom tool.<br/><br/>The project will add new capabilities in the Augmented Reality Sandbox's software. The scope of the new abilities covers modeling drainage basin delineation, as well as defining and representing infiltration rates for regions in the landscape, rainfall rates over regions of the landscape, and scale factoring for the sandbox's modeled area. These software extensions will provide students in environmental science and civil engineering courses with engaged learning experiences that depict the dynamics of the water cycle and support both quantitative and qualitative modeling. This project will also develop hardware extensions to the sandbox frame's design to support rapid turnaround on laboratory project setup between lab periods and consistent sand landform models across lab periods and projects. The project's evaluation goal is to study the Sandbox's effectiveness in student learning. The project will evaluate both the original and the extended versions of the Sandbox through student surveys and analysis of aggregated scores on pertinent exam questions. With this information, the project will advance understanding of the Sandbox's effect on students' qualitative understanding of geophysical processes. The project will also investigate conditions under which the Sandbox's new modeling capabilities help students understand geophysical processes through simulations. The project aims to improve educators' understanding of best practices for this tool by measuring the Sandbox's effect on students' performance in courses under varying numbers of laboratory projects in which students use the Sandbox. The NSF IUSE:EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

Across species, specific folds are associated with primary sensory and motor functions, as well as with complex functions such as language or creativity. Because of this, brain folding anatomy is widely used in the research of biomarkers for function and dysfunction in such contexts that include psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. This joint proposal between the PIs focuses on differentiating the role of genetic and mechanical factors influencing the formation of folding patterns across multiple species. The study will use a combination of phylogenetic comparative approaches, reconstructing brain folding trajectories, computational physics and physical gel experiments to understand the development and evolution of the cortex. The trans -Atlantic partnership between two of strongest hubs in the USA and Europe for biological and neuroanatomical research, Paris and Boston, will allow the PIs to synergistically collaborate at the interface between computational neuroscience, physics, neuroimaging, and applied mathematics. Several research groups of biologists and physicists in the Paris/Boston region are interested in the role of mechanical forces during development and evolution, and this project will be a unique opportunity to increase our interactions beyond the confines of this specific project. The analysis of brain folding is currently used in the research for biomarkers of psychiatric disorders, however, little is known about the biological significance of folding variability. All code and data funded by this project will be made available open source, as both PIs have done in the past. Many of the tools work directly in the Web, allowing the PIs to integrate researchers and citizen scientists from all over the world.<br/><br/>The project fits within one of NSF's big 10 ideas - understanding the rules of life. Within this question, one of the grandest questions in biology is that of morphogenesis - how do cells and tissue self-organize to create functional organs. This proposal's outcomes will include comparative study of brain cortical morphogenesis across species to understand the origin of folding patterns and the role of mechanical factors in determining them. The use of physical gel experiments and numerical simulations will be of broader interest in understanding other morphogenetic programs in the cerebellum, and other organs besides the brain. By studying different developmental trajectories within and across species, the project will shed light on the link between early, region specific gene expression patterns and the patterns of cortical folding. From an evolutionary standpoint, the project will provide evidence for why there is a strong conservation of folding patterns among phylogenetically related species, such as carnivores or primates. Together, these comparative views will bring about an evolutionary perspective to the study of variability in brain folding, and thus shed light on the link of folding to functionality.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/France project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche, where NSF funds the US investigator and ANR funds the partners in France.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This NSF CAREER project aims to bolster the nation?s grid decarbonization and energy security by developing a grid-edge resource (GER) management framework to increase power system flexibility. The project will bring transformative changes to GER management by overcoming three intertwined challenges, i.e., high scalability requirements, major privacy concerns, and surging cybersecurity risks. This will be achieved by synthesizing ideas from optimization, machine learning, statistics, and cryptology to establish an efficient, private, and secure GER control framework. The intellectual merits of the project include (1) developing a scalable framework that enables efficient cooperative control of heterogeneous GERs; (2) investigating privacy preservation measures for strongly coupled decentralized GER control; (3) investigating models, and detection and mitigation strategies of stealthy cyber-attacks that target at decentralized GER control algorithms. The broader impacts of the project include (1) unleashing heterogeneous GERs to enhance grid reliability and deepen grid decarbonization; (2) advancing the grid?s ability to integrate increasing amounts of renewable generation and GERs in a cost-effective, secure, and reliable way; (3) providing the industry with insight into developing new market products. The integrated education plan will spread control and power system concepts to youth-in-custody, K-12 students, and underrepresented groups, motivating them to pursue STEM education and careers. <br/><br/>Existing GER control frameworks may fail in large-scale deployment because they invariably ignore scalability issues caused by network dimension and GER heterogeneity, lack efficient measures to protect GER owners? privacy, and lack the understanding of stealthy for-purpose cyber-attacks. To advance the knowledge, this project will (1) develop new optimization, machine learning, and statistical tools to construct a GER control framework that is agnostic to GER type, scalable with respect to GER population and network dimension, and applicable for different grid services; (2) characterize privacy risks in GER management and develop cryptology-based and non-cryptology-based privacy-preserving decentralized optimization paradigms; (3) constitute cyber-attack vectors that leverage decentralized GER control algorithms for stealthy attack purposes, determine the detectability of those attacks, and develop corresponding detection and mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A high proportion of these plants are listed as threatened or endangered, and many have gone extinct in the last century. Natural history collections serve as invaluable records of biodiversity and are important references for species that are threatened, endangered, or otherwise difficult to access. The Joseph F.

The newly digitized specimens will be available to researchers across the globe, greatly increasing the utility of the collection. Digitization will be conducted by undergraduates at the University of Hawai?i at M?noa to provide meaningful research experiences for students. The herbarium will host volunteer digitization events, increase collaboration with the campus arboretum, and engage with the public via events at a local botanical garden.<br/><br/>The rare and endemic Hawaiian and Pacific island plant specimens in the Rock herbarium will be preserved through overall modernization of the collection. Specifically, this project will digitize the 55,000 specimens in the collection, remove the backlog of specimens that need to be accessioned, and disseminate specimen data to a broader research community through a dedicated Consortium of Pacific Herbaria web portal and iDigBio.org. Modernization will also include expanded pest management and expanding the throughput of specimen digitization. The project additionally serves to maintain and strengthen collaborations across Pacific herbaria and promote digitization of other, smaller collections. The project will employ nine students each year, emphasizing the training and retention of students from historically excluded groups, including Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.

These systems are intended to improve upon human decision-making by finding patterns in massive amounts of data, beyond what can be intuited by humans. However, it has been demonstrated that these systems learn and propagate similar biases present in human decision-making. This project aims to develop general theory and techniques on fairness in AI, with applications to improving retention and graduation rates of under-represented groups in STEM graduate programs. Recent research has shown that simply focusing on admission rates is not sufficient to improve graduation rates. This project is envisioned to go beyond designing ""fair classifiers"" such as fair graduate admission that satisfy a static fairness notion in a single moment in time, and designs AI systems that make decisions over a period of time with the goal of ensuring overall long-term fair outcomes at the completion of a process. The use of data-driven AI solutions can allow the detection of patterns missed by humans, to empower targeted intervention and fair resource allocation over the course of an extended period of time.  The research from this project will contribute to reducing bias in the admissions process and improving completion rates in graduate programs as well as fair decision-making in general applications of machine learning.<br/><br/>This project will focus on machine learning algorithms for resource allocation, which can be used at various points throughout a process such as in education. The team will propose new notions of fairness and show the applicability of those notions to settings in which limited resources, such as acceptance to the program, faculty mentoring, professional development, and paid assistantships or fellowships, are allocated to students fairly. The proposed research will also go beyond fairness in task-specific supervised learning settings and investigate fairness in unsupervised learning that guarantees to learn fair representations or generative models for multiple downstream tasks. The team will address the practical problems that arise due to uncongenial data in real-world sequential decision-making systems, including distribution shifts between training and test, imbalanced data, and missing sensitive attributes.

The latter process is referred to as glacial isostatic adjustment. A key parameter that determines the rate of this deformation is the viscosity of the deforming material. To date, the vast majority of global glacial isostatic adjustment models assume that Earth's viscosity structure varies with depth alone. However, there exists extensive geological and geophysical evidence for significant lateral variations in viscosity and for the existence of low viscosity regions in the Earths mantle below Antarctica that deform rapidly on decadal or faster time scales. This variability in viscosity causes regions of the solid mantle to deform differently and thus a model of three-dimensional viscosity structure is needed to better measure the changing weight of the Antarctic ice sheet, to accurately model ice sheet dynamics, and to better project future sea level changes in response to Antarctic ice melt. The research conducted here will construct a first-generation reference three-dimensional viscosity model for the solid Earth underlying Antarctica. The analysis will use horizontal and vertical deformations measured by the Global Navigation Satellite System over the last few decades at sites across Antarctica, a state-of-the-art seismic model of the Antarctic mantle, coupled simulations of glacial isostatic adjustment and ice sheet stability, and a novel, observationally driven and mathematically rigorous approach to calculating the glacial isostatic adjustment parameters that cannot be directly observed. This project supports two early-career researchers and two graduate students. Funding will be used to support the participation of U.S. graduate students and instructors in a glacial isostatic adjustment training school, which will be organized by the principal investigator and leadership of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research initiative Instabilities and Thresholds in Antarctica.<br/><br/>Quantifying the magnitude of modern ice mass loss from Antarctica is a key element in efforts to constrain future sea level change. Although satellite gravimetry and changes in ice surface elevation are used to estimate ice mass change, these observations cannot provide a direct estimate because they also record changes in the solid Earth. Similarly, modeling of past and future ice sheet dynamics and sea level change require an accurate model of solid earth deformation. Thus, the contribution from the ongoing response of the viscoelastic Earth to ice sheet evolution across the ice age and into the modern world, termed glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), must be accurately quantified. Although the signal from GIA is widely recognized as being a significant component of modern Antarctic deformation, our incomplete knowledge of earths three-dimensional viscosity structure and the appropriate rheological model for the solid Earth deformation leads to large uncertainties in estimates of present-day ice mass change and modeling of future ice dynamics and sea level change. Fortunately, direct observations of solid Earth deformation have been made over the last few decades by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations installed on bedrock across Antarctica. These observations have been used in forward modeling to infer regional one-dimensional viscosity structure, but they have not been directly used to image the continents three-dimensional viscosity structure. This will be addressed through four key tasks: (1) Inferring plausible steady-state diffusion creep viscosity models from the seismic shear wave speeds determined with the latest ANT-20 seismic tomography model using an inverse calibration scheme based on experimental results from mineral physics and a suite of geophysical constraints; (2) Determining ice histories that span from the Last Glacial Maximum to present from a coupled GIA/ice sheet model, which explores the range of inferred three-dimensional viscosity models and plausible parameters governing ice dynamics. These ice histories will be merged with modern estimates of ice mass change; (3) Exploring and characterizing the spatiotemporal sensitivities of vertical and horizontal GNSS deformation and relative sea level observations to the three-dimensional viscosity structure and ice history produced in tasks 1 and 2 using the adjoint method; and (4) Inverting observations of GNSS crustal deformation rates and relative sea level using the adjoint method to derive a new three-dimensional map of mantle viscosity below Antarctica. These inversions will use the models from task 1 and 2 and intuition gained from task 3 to further refine the three-dimensional viscosity structure and to explore whether observations include signals of transient or non-linear deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For many groups of people, however, speech recognition works less well, possibly because of regional accents, or because of second-language accent, or because of a disability.  This Fairness in AI project defines a new way of thinking about speech technology.  In this new way of thinking, an automatic speech recognizer is not considered to work well unless it works well for all users, including users with regional accents, second-language accents, and severe disabilities.  There are three sub-projects.  The first sub-project will create black-box testing standards that speech technology researchers can use to test their speech recognizers, in order to test how useful their speech recognizer will be for different groups of people.  For example, if a researcher discovers that their product works well for some people, but not others, then the researcher will have the opportunity to gather more training data, and to perform more development, in order to make sure that the under-served community is better-served.  The second sub-project will create glass-box testing standards that researchers can use to debug inclusivity problems.  For example, if a speech recognizer has trouble with a particular dialect, then glass-box methods will identify particular speech sounds in that dialect that are confusing the recognizer, so that researchers can more effectively solve the problem.  The third sub-project will create new methods for training a speech recognizer in order to guarantee that it works equally well for all of the different groups represented in available data.  Data will come from podcasts and the Internet.  Speakers will be identified as members of a particular group if and only if they declare themselves to be members of that group.  All of the developed software will be distributed open-source.<br/><br/>Automatic speech recognition has the potential to democratize the flow of information: artificially intelligent dialog agents can provide information to people who would otherwise not know where to look. The speech developer community's relentless focus on minimum error rate over the past fifty years has resulted in a productivity tool that works extremely well for those of whose speech patterns match its training data: typically, college-educated first-language speakers of a standardized dialect, with little or no speech disability.  For many groups of people, however, speech recognition works less well, possibly because their speech patterns differ significantly from the standard dialect (e.g., because of regional accent), because of intra-group heterogeneity (e.g., regional African American dialects), or because the speech pattern of each individual in the group exhibits variability (e.g., people with severe disabilities, or second-language learners).  The aim of this proposal is to create a new paradigm for the evaluation and training of inclusive automatic speech recognizers.  The proposed new evaluation and training paradigm consists of three components: (1) A ""black-box evaluation"" is an evaluation that can measure the degree of inclusivity of a speech recognizer by observing its outputs, without access to source code or trained parameters.  With appropriately balanced test data, a statistical test can determine whether or not a system provides all groups of users with the same error rates, and if different groups get different error rates, then the size of the difference can be read as a measurement of the size of the problem.  (2) A ""glass-box evaluation"" is an evaluation that identifies error patterns that consistently differentiate between groups, and searches for the causes of those errors in the acoustic signal and in the trained parameters of the network. (3) Inclusive optimization is a family of end-to-end neural network training criteria, and training dataset design and augmentation criteria, that explicitly balance the need for low average error rate against the need for low inter-group and inter-speaker variance.  In order to develop these new evaluation and training paradigms, the researchers propose to develop and distribute open-source data and tools.  Data will be drawn from large public data sources including the 100,000-podcast corpus; researchers will search the corpus for dialog acts in which speakers identify themselves with a particular group, then distribute discovered group identities and manual transcriptions as open-source metadata.  Tools will be implemented using open source toolkits including K2, and those tools will be distributed as open-source system recipes.  Speech technology developers are a competitive bunch: if there is a single number that describes the inclusivity of a speech recognizer, and if there is reason to believe that number to be scientifically well-founded and desirable, then researchers all over the world will compete to make their systems more inclusive.  Proposed research will develop such metrics, and associated data, and will deploy them open-source.  This research will be held up as a model of the social impact of artificial intelligence in the ongoing outreach programs of the investigators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computer models of weather and climate often fail to accurately capture the effects of random, turbulent fluctuations of temperature, humidity, and wind speed on cloud droplet formation and growth. These turbulent fluctuations can impact cloud lifetimes, precipitation formation, and climate feedbacks and therefore are important to model accurately for both weather and climate prediction. The central aims of this project are to understand the small-scale interactions between turbulence and cloud droplet formation and growth and to improve the representation of these processes in weather and climate forecasting models. The educational component of this project is intended to increase engagement of undergraduates from physics and other STEM fields in atmospheric science through the development of lesson plans following principles of authentic instruction. These lessons will be piloted by instructors at teaching-intensive Oklahoma universities and are intended to promote interest in the geosciences among all undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Despite the importance of small-scale interactions between turbulence and microphysical processes in clouds, these interactions remain poorly represented in both large eddy simulations and weather and climate forecasting models. Using direct numerical simulations (DNS) that capture the formation and growth of millions of Lagrangian droplets in a turbulent flow, the researchers will develop new subgrid-scale models for turbulence-microphysics interactions that accurately capture the governing physics. These subgrid-scale models will be validated against DNS and laboratory cloud chamber data; the resulting large eddy simulations will be used to investigate the extent to which interactions between turbulence and microphysics?at spatial scales larger than those attainable in DNS?influence cloud lifetimes, precipitation formation, albedo, and other large-scale cloud properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This instrument will add exciting new opportunities for faculty research, thesis research of undergraduate and graduate students, and course-based research at a dominantly undergraduate institution that has an outstanding record of well-cited publications involving students. Of the 5 co-principal investigators and 2 senior personnel on this grant, 5 are early career researchers within the first four years of their appointment at WWU and this instrument will significantly enhance their research productivity. The new instrument will support grant-funded research with students that covers topics as broad-ranging as utilization of chemical signatures in volcanic glasses/crystals to discern eruption processes, characterization of deep-Earth materials, timescales and rates of ancient subduction zone processes, transport of plastic nanoparticles in the environment, geochemical signatures in biogenic carbonates as recorders of past climate, ore deposit genesis, abundances of particulate matter pollution, and toxicity of metals in marine and terrestrial systems. The LA-ICP-MS will continue to be used to promote research and education partnerships via outreach to pre-college students, nearby community colleges and entering WWU freshman with an interest in STEM, but this grant specifically develops new collaborations with nearby Whatcom Community College (WCC) and WWU Geology and Environmental Sciences departments to develop course-based undergraduate research experiences and paid summer research experiences for undergraduates.<br/><br/>The ICP-MS and associated laser upgrade will improve and expand the current high quality and broad scope of research, including NSF-funded projects, conducted within the Geology Department and the College. Replacing the current unsupported instrument is essential to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of our facility, and the new Agilent 7900 ICP-MS will provide significantly improved detection limits, count sensitivity, plasma stability, and handling of laser particles. A coupled laser, the RESOlution-SE system, will provide a reliable introductory system for non-aqueous samples, which historically make up half of the total samples analyzed at WWU. Specifically, this system will expand the range of materials that can be analyzed (in terms of both composition and size), minimize fractionation, and significantly enhance precision, detection limits, and sample navigation and programming. It will also provide for an additional LIBS detector permitting periodic table masses at a weight percent to ppm range. These upgrades to the ICP-MS and laser ablation system are necessary for researchers working with nanoparticles and toxins, translucent solid materials (e.g., minerals such as quartz and plagioclase), trace element concentrations below 10 ?g/g, small solid samples (<100 ?m diameter), large solid samples that do not fit in the sample chamber, and more.

The overarching goal of the project is to employ participatory design methods to understand the methods for teaching and enhancing social-emotional skills of high-functioning individuals with developmental disabilities, such as those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This project also aims to co-design 360-degree video-based Virtual Reality environments with human actors with relevant stakeholders aimed at providing a realistic and practical learning environment for these individuals, thereby promoting transfer of skills from the virtual environment to real life scenarios they regularly encounter. The co-design process will include individuals with developmental disabilities and their families and professional caregivers. The goal of the virtual environments is to provide effective social-emotional skill training with minimal to no support from behavioral specialists. While the project focuses on individuals with developmental disabilities, the project research results can be used for society at large for a variety of behavioral and social skills training based on: 1) the lessons learned and the methods of participatory design for teaching and enhancing social-emotional skills and 2) the virtual environments depicting scenarios that are common in day-to-day interactions for most adults.

Two learning theories: Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), form the foundation of the project and inform the design of the Virtual Reality environments. From methodological point of view, society and scientific communities can learn from this project how the combination and modification of existing theories for assisting adults with developmental disabilities, such as ABA and CBT, may be used to promote social-emotional skill training for these adults in ?safe? (virtual) environments. Another significant aspect of the project is the longitudinal study on the participants with alternating VR-based and role-playing workshop-based training. This innovative and comprehensive longitudinal study will help provide critical insights to understand: (a) whether the skills learned in virtual environments transfer to real-world scenarios; (b) how/whether VR-based training helps caregivers such as Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) to work better with people with developmental disorders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current key barrier to robots performing these types of service tasks is insufficient dexterity. To approach human dexterity, robots must be able to move their fingers and sense their touched surroundings with a comparable level of resolution to humans. The key challenge is providing high-resolution, calibrated tactile sensing, which once modeled can be leveraged for advanced robotic manipulation. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant supports a sensor design that leverages a camera to observe the contact boundary of a transparent robotic fingertip. When the camera observes deformation of the soft robotic fingertip from touching an object, these observed deformations are mapped to the shape of the deformed finger and applied forces on the fingertip surface through the novel modeling technique. The calibration and modeling techniques to be developed in this project allow for manipulation motion planners to determine the best sequences of grasps to reposition an object in the robot?s hand with an estimate of expected manipulation success. This will advance the field of robotics by increasing dexterous manipulation ability in service tasks benefiting the US economy, prosperity and welfare. The research in robotic perception and manipulation supported by this grant will promote education in robotics. Through close involvement with non-profit organization ?Black In Robotics? the research team will also broaden the participation of underrepresented groups as students learn to design and research robotic systems capable of performing advanced service tasks. <br/><br/>The optical tactile robotic fingertip is modeled as a Cauchy elastic material with a direct correlation between the observed strain and stress field of the sensor. By illuminating the interior of the sensor with multi-colored light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the contact surface shape is reconstructed by correlating light intensity to the interior surface normal, and strain is observed through the deformation of contact surface markings. The novel calibration method enables high-resolution measurement of both the robotic finger contact surface shape and stress field. This is then used to model grasp stability through the high-resolution limit surface and position within the limit surface for a multiple soft-finger grasp. This representation is then leveraged by a high-level grasp planner to strategize a sequence of grasps for in-hand manipulation between target object poses. The modularization of the manipulation problem is expected to increase the rate of motion planning adaption to novel objects while providing a more accurate estimation of grasp stability.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will implement and research a robust and evidence-based professional development (PD) program to train and support faculty in adopting an active learning in mathematics (ALM) approach. The ALM approach will have a deliberate focus on equity-minded instruction. Focusing on transforming mathematics instruction is important because of the documented reputation of mathematics courses as gatekeepers, with gaps magnified for students from groups underrepresented in STEM. These gaps limit broader participation in STEM. With an urgent need to improve STEM education, this project uses evidence-based best practices in PD to engage faculty in opportunities to grow as educators through continuous and sustained community-centered activities. A unique emphasis is on building communities of practice through a variety of lower- and higher-stakes PD formats and the specific focus on in-house PD using the department as the unit of change. This project seeks to increase the number of faculty implementing evidence-based, effective, and equitable teaching practices. Investigation of changes in department culture as teaching is transformed will be invaluable to other departments who aspire to change.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of the Mathematics Equity through Teaching Actively (META) project is to improve student outcomes in undergraduate mathematics education. META will advance this goal by implementing a novel PD program to transform faculty skills and practices in the near-term and improve student outcomes in the long-term. META will also provide an evidence base for scaling the PD program for adoption at other institutions. To advance understanding of the factors that influence faculty interest in ALM and the success of equity-minded ALM-focused PD, META will conduct research to assess faculty challenges, faculty supports, and institutional characteristics that may affect program outcomes. META research will identify and evaluate the impact of faculty challenges, supports, and faculty adoption of equity-minded ALM at the department level.  The project?s research questions are: (1) What are the reported supports and challenges for mathematics faculty who strive to transform their instruction towards equity-minded ALM? and (2) What department-level characteristics support instructional transformation towards equity-minded ALM? To address the research questions, META will collect six data sources: faculty focus groups, individual faculty interviews, assessment surveys from PD activities, recorded pre-observation meetings, completed self-assessment classroom protocols, and recorded post-observation meetings. Data will be analyzed using typological analysis techniques that were employed in META?s pilot project. Results will be disseminated published manuscripts, conference presentations, and distribution among a multitude of existing networks. Findings from META will be of particular interest to departments that are seeking a robust model of PD to support their faculty in becoming more equity-minded while embracing ALM.

The dramatic growth and ever-increasing functionality and performance of wireless devices has crowed the electromagnetic spectrum. Dynamic spectrum sharing in 5G and beyond can meet the demands of scarce spectrum, unprecedented traffic, and better quality of service. For example, unlicensed and license-aided bands, such as 2.4 - 5 GHz industrial, scientific and medical bands, 6 GHz radio frequency bands, 60 GHz millimeter wave bands, are being shared for commercial and scientific use. However, dynamically sharing spectrum poses additional challenges to share autonomously, reliably, and securely among civilian, government, and defense. Therefore, learning surrounding wireless signals is essential to support wireless user coexistence over shared spectrum. This project focuses on developing an adaptive incremental deep learning architecture to infer radio frequency signals in dynamic spectrum sharing environments in real time. The proposed research will provide recommendations to Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard P1900.8 on criteria for evaluating the performance of machine learned spectrum awareness models.

The project combines, natural and social science methodologies with smart computer-based solutions to provide city planners with visual and quantitative information on the state of the environment and potential impacts under different scenarios.   The project team seeks to intensify the cooperation between planners focusing particularly on urban fringes.  Typically, these areas are the most critical parts in cities, where formal instruments to coordinate informal settlements are lacking, often resulting in highly negative trade-offs in risk management (flood, fire), health and sanitation, and air quality.  The results of this research project will help us understand how communities can create more sustainable development pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will bring transformative change by providing operators with the computational tools needed to accurately model heavily stressed power grids. This will be achieved by combining new machine learning techniques with advanced nonlinear optimization algorithms and novel power system modeling methods. The project?s intellectual merits include the development of new solution algorithms for the optimization problems encountered in power systems during extreme events. The broader impacts of the project include mitigating the impacts of climate change as well as educational efforts to develop video game style simulations focused on power system resiliency. In the spirit of citizen science, the players' solutions to these simulations will form a crowdsourced dataset that will be used to train the machine learning models in the project's research efforts, closing the loop between research and education.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop the fundamental theory and algorithms for addressing the heavily stressed conditions inherent to power systems during extreme events. Accurately modeling these heavily stressed conditions yields stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems that are intractable with existing theory and algorithms. Existing approaches address these challenges using assumptions that are inapplicable for the atypical conditions inherent to extreme events, resulting in large errors and resiliency plans that fail to adequately reduce the impacts of extreme events. This project will develop new algorithms that can accurately model power flow nonlinearities, uncertainties, and discrete decisions without sacrificing computational speed and reliability. To accomplish this, the project will improve and combine alternative power flow models, mixed-integer programming solvers, machine learning techniques, and nonlinear optimization to create tailored theory and algorithms for resiliency applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology will provide automated safety and emergency equipment compliance and security seal checks, significantly reducing the time required for audits, while increasing their accuracy and avoiding potential liability claims from undetected failure or tampering with safety equipment. Based on in-flight compliant Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, equipment can be monitored continuously, during flight and on the ground, using a compact communication hub or mobile devices. Self-sustainability is achieved by harvesting energy from mechanical vibrations present in-flight and during taxiing, without requiring time-consuming battery change cycles and avoiding regulatory challenges for hazardous battery chemistries such as lithium-ion. The proposed research will also enable in-flight monitoring applications and automate new tasks such as ensuring compliance with in-flight seatbelt regulations. The proposed system will help passenger airlines stay profitable in a highly competitive market, realizing significant cost-savings through efficient operations, reduced turnaround times, and lower maintenance overheads. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to evaluate a mechanical energy harvesting design regarding its technical feasibility and effectiveness as a power source for asset tracking devices onboard an aircraft. To this end, new technologies for mechanical energy harvesting will be tested: (1) a novel stacked piezoelectric device with tunable resonance frequencies and output enhanced by superposition among different piezo-elements vibrating in phase and (2) a mechanical vibration amplifier which extracts large-amplitude linear motions from vibrations to enhance the amplitude of mechanical movements. The two new technologies may enable the first mechanical vibration harvester which is compact enough to permit effective use in asset tracking in the aviation industry, resulting in an energy harvesting module miniaturized to comply with aviation applications and to efficiently harvest the extremely low frequencies (<10 Hz) dominating cabin vibrations.

To answer current challenges in analytical chemistry for the identification and measurements of a single entity, Dr. Deiss will integrate electrochemistry, microfluidics, spectroscopy, and materials sciences to produce methods for single-entity electrochemistry using ECL in droplets.  ECL is the emission of light by a redox-active molecule after a cascade of electrochemical and chemical reactions.  This research will provide new strategies to elucidate chemical mechanisms, with findings applied to making advances toward the goal of detecting single bacteria.  If successful, this research will help society by generating a method for rapid and highly sensitive enumeration of bacteria, which is needed in fields such as clinical tests and industrial quality control, and to increase the understanding of chemical and biological systems.  A sub-class of microfluidic devices are paper-based devices.  Their versatility, low-cost, portability, and user-friendly features have enabled many studies, as well as point-of-care and in-field applications.  The educational objective of this project is to transform the current knowledge and research in microfluidic paper-based analytical devices and produce low-cost and widely accessible platforms to teach practical analytical chemistry to students in a variety of settings via instructional videos.  The video series of the lab modules will be hosted on free servers and educational websites to ensure its access to a broad audience.

Understanding this process is important for a wide range of problems, such as determining the factors that drive plate tectonics to sustaining deep water and carbon cycles that stabilize the atmosphere/hydrosphere and climate throughout Earth history. This is particularly relevant for society, both because plate tectonic processes are the driving forces behind hazards such as earthquakes and volcanoes and also because our climate and atmosphere make Earth habitable. This project studies large scale convection in the solid Earth by using earthquake data recorded at distant seismic stations in regions of upwelling. Upwellings are notoriously difficult to constrain. The focus will be on three end-member cases: 1) Hawaii, the classic example where deep upwelling occurs beneath ocean lithosphere, 2) Yellowstone, the classic example of deep upwelling that occurs beneath a continent, and 3) the equatorial mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is typically assumed to be a location without deep upwellings. The project will use classic techniques and also some newly developed approaches to better constrain the scale of the upwellings and their pathways. An outreach program will increase diversity in the Earth Sciences via public engagement and education and training of students and early career researchers. The outreach portion includes visits to core discipline classrooms at Morgan State University, a historically black university, with an established connection with two faculty members there. The goal of the visits and the materials is to increase awareness of career possibilities and also the societal relevance of the Earth Sciences. The approach is modeled on the success of the ""Google in Residence"" program that successfully placed Google engineers on HBCU campuses. Eventually a wider range of Earth scientists will be included by developing an archive of materials that can be scaled and adapted according to needs and also best-practice advice, both of which will be made publicly available to the broader scientific community. The project also provides training for undergraduate students, a graduate student, and a post doc in cutting-edge methodologies and use of seafloor seismic data. <br/><br/>Earth?s convective system is important for understanding the evolution of the planet, including everything from the factors that drive and enable plate tectonics to sustaining deep water and carbon cycles that stabilize the atmosphere/hydrosphere and climate over billions of years. It is generally accepted that cool mantle sinks back into the Earth, e.g., at subduction zones, and hot mantle rises, e.g., beneath hotspots and mid ocean ridges. Although mantle tomography has resolved many seismically fast anomalies associated with subduction, imaging upwellings has proven more challenging, potentially because seismic waveforms have difficulty resolving thin slow conduits. Thus, the exact dimensions, locations, characteristics, origin depths and magnitudes of these thermal anomalies are poorly known, as well as their chemical and physical interaction with the surrounding mantle, such as in the transition zone and uppermost mantle. Similarly, the degree to which upwellings change in size and/or are deflected during their ascent and how they vary among tectonic environments is uncertain. Converted and reflected wave imaging of the transition zone discontinuities and the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary should provide tighter constraints. However, there are some discrepancies in studies using these methods regarding hotspot character and location, perhaps because they have used different methodologies and approaches with different sensitivities in different locations. This study will examine this issue systematically at a varied suite of tectonic environments. The planned approach will use the complementary sensitives of converted and reflected seismic phases to image the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and transition zone discontinuities beneath three key regions that are representative of the range of tectonic environments where variability in upwelling characteristics might be expected. These include the iconic hotspot of Hawaii near the center of an old oceanic plate, the classic example of Yellowstone hotspot beneath a continental interior, and finally the mid-Atlantic Ridge where deep upwellings are not predicted by classic models. Analyses will include P-to-S imaging of the transition zone discontinuities and S-to-P imaging of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, both sensitive to vertical changes in shear wave velocity, and also use S-reflections, which have the added advantage of high depth resolution. A systematic approach will allow comparisons among the regions and anisotropic testing and F-K full-waveform modelling will be performed to determine the influence of anisotropy and/or focussing/defocussing for any apparent discrepancies. Once a full range of possibilities is defined from the seismic waveforms, inversions for Earth properties based on experimental and ab initio constraints will determine the properties that can explain the observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These harms include both physical harms (such as losses of life, long- and short-term health harms, or financial harms) and psychological harms (such as loss of trusts on others, emotional sufferings, or confusion). These negative effects can lead to wrong decisions such as drinking bleach to cure the viral infection. In investigating this type of harm, this proposal focuses on two specific research questions: (1) How can the perceptions of harm from information not backed by science be characterized in health crises? (2) How are harm perceptions associated with social media conversations in a health crisis? Results have the potential to advance national health and welfare. Official health organizations such as the CDC and WHO, may gain a better understanding of vulnerable population?s threat and need perceptions. An understanding of people?s perceptions of harmful inaccurate information ultimately helps improve the reliability of social media channels. Broader impacts include the support of a doctoral dissertation, dissemination of findings at professional outlets, and teaching modules related to this research project are part of a course at University of Texas at San Antonio, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).<br/><br/>Despite prior efforts handling harms from inaccurate information in both COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 vaccine contexts, to our knowledge, there is no research that has characterized harm perceptions from such information in health crises. This project takes a sharp focus on perceived harms, rather than on actual harms, and examines the interplay between perceived harms and actual harms. Focusing on the COVID-19 vaccine context, studies examine several COVID-19 vaccine scenarios containing inaccurate information, and characterize harm from that information using three characteristics, i.e., unknown and dread and manageability. Using text mining the project examines the association between harm perceptions and nature of communication in Twitterverse. This is an early attempt at quantitatively measure the harm that results from inaccurate information in the pandemic context. The project advances knowledge in an under-studied area and use conversations in Twitterverse to investigate the nature of communication with respect to harm characteristics. This research bridges social media data with communication theory to unpack the role of social media around crisis communication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Growing use of electronics in nearly all spheres of life has created a great need for engineers, scientists, and technicians to contribute to their sophisticated design and manufacturing process. However, misconceptions of hardware surrounding manufacturing jobs, along with the rising popularity of jobs in analytics and artificial intelligence, motivate students to avoid hardware-related college courses. Students? knowledge of electronic hardware and basic principles of their operation have not received much attention. This has contributed to a remarkable skill gap in the current electronics industry. Hence, there is a critical need for training college students to learn the fundamentals of hardware from a system perspective through a hands-on approach. Additionally, there is a need to stimulate these students interests in hardware. The project aims to design engaging, collaborative, and thought-provoking gamified learning modules that will be played on an electronic hardware platform. Each gamified module, to be played individually or collaboratively in a team, will target training students on one major concept of hardware using an engaging and experimental learning approach. Games will introduce and exercise one of the fundamental concepts of computing hardware. Collectively, the gamified modules will provide a system-level perspective of the modern electronic system. The project intends to evaluate the curriculum at two universities and high schools. <br/><br/>This collaborative project between University of Kansas and University of Florida will investigate a new paradigm of preparing undergraduate students with foundational concepts of electronic hardware and key principles of system operation, including underlying physics (e.g., signal propagation, switching of transistors) and mathematics (e.g., Boolean algebra, logic gates) of computing. The project seeks to understand the ability of gamified learning to stimulate situational interest and learning of hardware content among diverse groups of students, including women, low socio-economic status students, first-time-in-college students, and historically underrepresented ethnic minorities. This project has the potential to create a skilled and diversified workforce in the semiconductor industry. A mixed research method will be used to evaluate the proposed activities in this project. Project activities will also include development of similar gamified modules for high school students, which in turn leads to creating a recruiting pathway for more electrical and computer engineering undergraduate majors. The project will share the gamified modules, hardware platform design, course materials, and other outcomes with the educational and semiconductor community through web portals, workshops, tutorials, and special sessions.

Understanding this process is important for a wide range of problems, such as determining the factors that drive plate tectonics to sustaining deep water and carbon cycles that stabilize the atmosphere/hydrosphere and climate throughout Earth history. This is particularly relevant for society, both because plate tectonic processes are the driving forces behind hazards such as earthquakes and volcanoes and also because our climate and atmosphere make Earth habitable. This project studies large scale convection in the solid Earth by using earthquake data recorded at distant seismic stations in regions of upwelling. Upwellings are notoriously difficult to constrain. The focus will be on three end-member cases: 1) Hawaii, the classic example where deep upwelling occurs beneath ocean lithosphere, 2) Yellowstone, the classic example of deep upwelling that occurs beneath a continent, and 3) the equatorial mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is typically assumed to be a location without deep upwellings. The project will use classic techniques and also some newly developed approaches to better constrain the scale of the upwellings and their pathways. An outreach program will increase diversity in the Earth Sciences via public engagement and education and training of students and early career researchers. The outreach portion includes visits to core discipline classrooms at Morgan State University, a historically black university, with an established connection with two faculty members there. The goal of the visits and the materials is to increase awareness of career possibilities and also the societal relevance of the Earth Sciences. The approach is modeled on the success of the ""Google in Residence"" program that successfully placed Google engineers on HBCU campuses. Eventually a wider range of Earth scientists will be included by developing an archive of materials that can be scaled and adapted according to needs and also best-practice advice, both of which will be made publicly available to the broader scientific community. The project also provides training for undergraduate students, a graduate student, and a post doc in cutting-edge methodologies and use of seafloor seismic data. <br/><br/>Earth?s convective system is important for understanding the evolution of the planet, including everything from the factors that drive and enable plate tectonics to sustaining deep water and carbon cycles that stabilize the atmosphere/hydrosphere and climate over billions of years. It is generally accepted that cool mantle sinks back into the Earth, e.g., at subduction zones, and hot mantle rises, e.g., beneath hotspots and mid ocean ridges. Although mantle tomography has resolved many seismically fast anomalies associated with subduction, imaging upwellings has proven more challenging, potentially because seismic waveforms have difficulty resolving thin slow conduits. Thus, the exact dimensions, locations, characteristics, origin depths and magnitudes of these thermal anomalies are poorly known, as well as their chemical and physical interaction with the surrounding mantle, such as in the transition zone and uppermost mantle. Similarly, the degree to which upwellings change in size and/or are deflected during their ascent and how they vary among tectonic environments is uncertain. Converted and reflected wave imaging of the transition zone discontinuities and the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary should provide tighter constraints. However, there are some discrepancies in studies using these methods regarding hotspot character and location, perhaps because they have used different methodologies and approaches with different sensitivities in different locations. This study will examine this issue systematically at a varied suite of tectonic environments. The planned approach will use the complementary sensitives of converted and reflected seismic phases to image the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and transition zone discontinuities beneath three key regions that are representative of the range of tectonic environments where variability in upwelling characteristics might be expected. These include the iconic hotspot of Hawaii near the center of an old oceanic plate, the classic example of Yellowstone hotspot beneath a continental interior, and finally the mid-Atlantic Ridge where deep upwellings are not predicted by classic models. Analyses will include P-to-S imaging of the transition zone discontinuities and S-to-P imaging of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, both sensitive to vertical changes in shear wave velocity, and also use S-reflections, which have the added advantage of high depth resolution. A systematic approach will allow comparisons among the regions and anisotropic testing and F-K full-waveform modelling will be performed to determine the influence of anisotropy and/or focussing/defocussing for any apparent discrepancies. Once a full range of possibilities is defined from the seismic waveforms, inversions for Earth properties based on experimental and ab initio constraints will determine the properties that can explain the observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mixing required to lighten dense bottom waters and that allows them to rise to mid-depth is strongly enhanced over rough topography. This project will work toward a dynamical theory that captures the interplay between the boundary transformations and interior flows and stratification. This work is important because the abyssal ocean has the capacity to store vast amounts of heat and carbon. A more complete understanding of what dynamical processes shape its circulation will help climate models capture its behavior and role in a changing climate. A pivotal role has been ascribed to the abyss in explaining the drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide during ice ages. Deeper insight into the dynamics of the abyssal circulation will also help understand better how it may have been different during these and other periods of Earth's history.<br/><br/>The proposed work will build a hierarchy of dynamical models of the response of the abyssal circulation to bottom-intensified mixing on slopes with a focus on the two-way interaction between boundary layers on topographic slopes and the interior of the abyss. This interaction will be expressed explicitly using boundary layer theory. The approach will start with the local one-dimensional dynamics on slopes, then consider their coupling to the large-scale context in simple two-dimensional examples, and subsequently extend to idealized and increasingly realistic three-dimensional setups. This will connect recent work on bottom-intensified mixing on slopes to scaling theories for the abyssal overturning that are based on ocean basins with a flat bottom and vertical sidewalls. These dynamics will be explored using a planetary geostrophic model, whose reduced dynamics allow for direct dynamical insight and controlled numerical solutions that resolve all features, including the all-important boundary layers on topographic slopes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Does morphological diversity arise in a sudden burst of evolution, or does it accumulate gradually? The gradual model of adaptive radiation hypothesizes that organisms first diversify in traits to explore new habitats, then to feed on different resources, and lastly to communicate reproductive fitness. However, few rigorous quantitative tests of this model have been performed, and mostly on unique, island-based radiations. This project will test this model of diversification using the family Percidae (e.g., perches, walleye and darters), one of the most diverse families of freshwater fishes in the USA. This research will use advanced 3D imaging techniques to create a comprehensive database of traits linked to habitat, diet and communication and analyses to better understand how and when these traits evolved during the history of Percidae. This work will also expand an open access digital library of fish anatomical diversity, contribute to local ichthyology courses, expand a Natural History Center?s aquatic exhibit space, and train undergraduate and graduate students in fish biology, evolution and statistical programming.<br/><br/>This project seeks to test Streelman and Danley?s ?three stages of vertebrate radiation? using rigorous phylogenetic comparative methods and comprehensive datasets of ecologically-linked phenotypic characters within percid fishes.

Phylogenetic comparative methods will be used to test for peaks in the diversification of these trait complexes using a newly published all-Percid phylogeny. The researchers will investigate how the evolutionary lability of these trait axes has been impacted by intrinsic mechanisms such as allometry, modularity or biomechanical/constructional constraints, and whether this contributes to a hierarchical pattern of trait evolution. Lastly, the researchers will test for an association between each trait axis and speciation rates.

Advancement of the current knowledge in the field of microgrids is critical to transform the present energy landscape by increasing the reliability of the US electric power grid while reducing its carbon footprint. Microgrids are characterized by their extensive inclusion of renewable and distributed energy resources, use of smart technologies, and contribution to the resilience and energy-efficiency of modern power systems. An important challenge for the widespread implementation of microgrids is that they endure significant electromagnetic and thermal stresses during their operation, thus there is an urgent need for the design of novel, more efficient, and more resilient microgrid components. This is particularly true for power electronic converters, which are extensively used for microgrid interconnection to the main grid, and for interfacing of generation sources, energy storage systems and electric loads.  Solid-state transformers are a novel type of power converter that has attracted a lot of attention because they are highly efficient and have a smaller footprint than conventional power transformers given their substantially reduced size, weight and cost; they also include smart functionalities to respond better to grid disturbances. Therefore, solid-state transformers have the potential of replacing traditional transformers for the widespread addition of renewable resources. From the main components of a solid-state transformer, the high frequency transformer is recognized as its key element. The efficient and affordable design of high frequency transformers is critical for achieving the main requirements of solid-state transformers: high density, minimal losses, voltage regulation, and electric isolation. Thus far such design has been a bottleneck for the mainstream adoption of solid-state transformers in distribution systems and microgrids due to reliability and operating life concerns. In this project, we propose the use of novel and innovative modeling and simulation tools for the optimal design of high frequency transformers to maximize their operating life and minimize the possibility of failure or damage under the conditions imposed by microgrid application. The outcomes of this project are expected to have a positive impact on the development of a more resilient and sustainable electrical power grid.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to assess the effectiveness of the synergistic combination of novel multiphysics and microgrid modeling and simulation tools for the optimal design of high frequency transformers for microgrid application, considering the stresses produced by the extensive inclusion of power electronic-interfaced sources, loads, and storage units during steady state and transient conditions. To reach this goal, this project includes the development, implementation, and comprehensive testing of a modeling approach for accurate dynamic simulation of the microgrid system and its online interaction with a detailed physics-based high frequency transformer model. The proposed cosimulation approach constitutes a substantial improvement over existing design tools, considering the particular challenges of microgrid operation. By taking a multiphysics and multi-objective design approach, this project intends to obtain an enhanced high frequency transformer design that maximizes efficiency, operating life and power density of the device. By interfacing finite element analysis and dynamic system simulation tools, this project aims to combine the benefits from both tools as an integral part of an enhanced design optimization process: accurate and realistic microgrid simulation under a variety of normal and abnormal operating conditions, and detailed geometrical and material multiphysics modeling of the HF transformer. The successful completion of the proposed project will constitute an important step forward in the widespread utilization of SSTs in microgrids and distribution systems, which in turn can result in a significantly enhanced efficiency in the integration of renewable generation, as well as in the delivery of electricity to consumers. In addition to the scientific goals of this project, the PI endeavors to use this project as a platform for improving engineering education and recruiting students to power engineering. In order to advance these outcomes, the PI will run a summer undergraduate research program to provide students with genuine research experiences and training in the interrelated power engineering and electromagnetic design areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Growing use of electronics in nearly all spheres of life has created a great need for engineers, scientists, and technicians to contribute to their sophisticated design and manufacturing process. However, misconceptions of hardware surrounding manufacturing jobs, along with the rising popularity of jobs in analytics and artificial intelligence, motivate students to avoid hardware-related college courses. Students? knowledge of electronic hardware and basic principles of their operation have not received much attention. This has contributed to a remarkable skill gap in the current electronics industry. Hence, there is a critical need for training college students to learn the fundamentals of hardware from a system perspective through a hands-on approach. Additionally, there is a need to stimulate these students interests in hardware. The project aims to design engaging, collaborative, and thought-provoking gamified learning modules that will be played on an electronic hardware platform. Each gamified module, to be played individually or collaboratively in a team, will target training students on one major concept of hardware using an engaging and experimental learning approach. Games will introduce and exercise one of the fundamental concepts of computing hardware. Collectively, the gamified modules will provide a system-level perspective of the modern electronic system. The project intends to evaluate the curriculum at two universities and high schools. <br/><br/>This collaborative project between University of Kansas and University of Florida will investigate a new paradigm of preparing undergraduate students with foundational concepts of electronic hardware and key principles of system operation, including underlying physics (e.g., signal propagation, switching of transistors) and mathematics (e.g., Boolean algebra, logic gates) of computing. The project seeks to understand the ability of gamified learning to stimulate situational interest and learning of hardware content among diverse groups of students, including women, low socio-economic status students, first-time-in-college students, and historically underrepresented ethnic minorities. This project has the potential to create a skilled and diversified workforce in the semiconductor industry. A mixed research method will be used to evaluate the proposed activities in this project. Project activities will also include development of similar gamified modules for high school students, which in turn leads to creating a recruiting pathway for more electrical and computer engineering undergraduate majors. The project will share the gamified modules, hardware platform design, course materials, and other outcomes with the educational and semiconductor community through web portals, workshops, tutorials, and special sessions. The project has potential to help students adopt emerging technologies with more complex functionality, such as augmented and virtual reality.

Proteins are sometimes called the ?workhorses? in biology because they catalytically mediate the majority of chemical functions in a living cell. The breadth of these functions depends on the variety of three-dimensional shapes adopted by the chain of amino acids that make up proteins. The trace of a protein chain through space is called its topology.  In a PLT, one end of the amino acid chain threads through a loop or lasso that is formed somewhere along the chain. This topology is similar to that of a simple overhand knot of a string or a rope. The chemical bond that forms the lasso can be made or broken, depending on the chemical environment of the system, and thus acts like an on/off switch for biological activity. Dr. Haglund will combine theoretical and biochemical studies with genetic experiments using fruit flies in order to investigate how PLTs can act as molecular switches to control biological activity through changes in the environment within cells. This project will be integrated with an outreach program to teach students and non-scientists how topologies seen in biology are connected with the topology of knots found in everyday life and in Polynesian culture. <br/><br/>This research project aims to unravel functional insight for proteins with complex topologies, i.e., proteins with a pierced lasso topology (PLT). PLTs are threaded ?knot-like? topologies wherein part of the chain pierces through a covalent loop. Interestingly, PLTs have been found to exist in 18% of all disulfide-containing proteins. Despite this large number, a connection between topology and biological function has not yet been established. As the first research group explicitly focusing on PLTs, the Haglund group will use biochemistry, cell biology, and biophysics tools to investigate functional consequences of disulfide chemistry in vivo and the possible role of disulfides as molecular switches to control biological activity. Molecular dynamics simulations, in vitro, and in vivo physiological assays using Drosophila melanogaster as a genetic model will be employed to examine the biological role of PLTs. This project sets out to reveal mechanistic details of how PLT proteins can fold and thread to reach their biologically active states. These studies will focus on three selected proteins (leptin, superoxide dismutase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the chemokine CXCL5) that are involved in cell regulation, growth, and cell migration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its seven-year duration, this project will fund scholarships 48 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in Mathematics, Environmental Science, Biomedical Sciences, Information Technology, Computer Science and Systems, Computer Engineering and Systems, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Civil Engineering. First-time college students and first-year transfer students will receive full scholarships for their first two years and partial scholarships for their third and fourth years. The project will include a summer mathematics preparation program that aims to enhance entry into STEM disciplines.  Participants will be invited to engage in a research experience or project-based Introduction to Design course in their first year. Coupled with an optional on-campus STEM living learning community and required individual faculty mentoring, the quarterly Success in STEM seminar course aims to support scholars in the formation of a cohesive community through group mentoring. Programming also aims to support students in their professional development. This project is distinguished by its focus on pre-STEM majors in their first and second years on campus, and includes mentorship training for approximately 40 faculty who will be teaching and mentoring diverse student populations. The University of Washington, Tacoma has a large population of students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM; this project aims to further research on how best to support first- and second-year undergraduate students as they enter STEM majors. Through increased recruitment and retention in the critical first two years, the project endeavors to support diverse students, supporting the entry of talented and skilled professionals into the local workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion among low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The specific objectives are to i) recruit talented, low-income students to STEM majors at the University of Washington Tacoma, ii) retain these students in STEM through student support mechanisms in the critical first two years, iii) improve student success and progress via intensive mentoring, early-entry math preparation, first-year research experience and design courses, and the Success in STEM seminar, and iv) broaden participation to promote equity and inclusion in STEM. Mentoring, early research and design experiences, and strong learning communities have been demonstrated to affect psychosocial factors such as academic motivation, STEM identity, self-efficacy, interest/awareness of bias and barriers to STEM access, and health and well-being, thereby increasing student persistence in STEM.  Less is known, however, about how these factors affect first- and second-year students at minority-serving institutions, particularly for AANAPISI institutions. The PI Team hypothesizes that by providing math preparation, early research and design courses, strong learning communities, and intensive faculty mentorship, participants will experience increases in academic success, retention and academic motivation, STEM identity, self-efficacy, as compared with a representative control group. This project has the potential to advance understanding of the effectiveness of mentoring by incorporating an equity lens, coupled with community-engaged early research and design experiences to support the success of low-income students in STEM. A mixed-methods approach combining quantitative data from yearly surveys with qualitative interviews will be used to assess project outcomes. Results of this project will be made available on the team's SSTEM project webpage and social media, and presented at conferences including the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research and AAC&U Transforming STEM Education, and published in journals such as the Journal of Diversity in Higher Education and the Understanding Interventions Journal.

We may not agree with these stereotypes at a conscious level, but they are also stored outside our awareness. Once activated, these unconscious stereotypes can lead to involuntary biases in how we evaluate and interact with others. Past research suggests that unconscious stereotypes are activated only after the brain is finished with visually processing a person. Contrary to this, the present project tests whether stereotypic associations influence the brain's initial visual processing, in turn creating systematic distortions in how a face or object is perceived. These distortions make faces or objects appear more visually consistent with stereotypes than they are in reality. Such a phenomenon of stereotypic vision contrasts with everyday beliefs that visual perception is an accurate reflection of reality. By distorting visual perception in line with stereotypic associations, such effects may deepen and maintain stored stereotypic associations. By providing a better understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie stereotypic vision and their capacity for change, this project could pave the way for new techniques to reduce unintended biases. In doing so, this project could address the difficulty in creating long-term change in stereotypic associations. <br/><br/>This CAREER project builds on Dr. Jonathan Freeman's cutting-edge brain-imaging and behavioral methodology to test his model of stereotypic vision. Through his specialized software, a computer mouse-tracking technique will be used to measure the trajectory of hand movements en route to response alternatives on the screen while they are presented with faces or objects. Despite conscious responses, hand trajectories' simultaneous attraction to an unselected alternative provides a sensitive measure of the effect of stereotypes on the process of perception with millisecond precision. These behavioral effects will be linked with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pattern analyses, permitting an assessment of how biases in perception relate to biases in a face or object's visual representation in the brain. Seven studies will test whether (a) stereotypes bias the visual representation of a face or object, driven by the interplay of brain regions involved in face processing and visual predictions; (b) this effect of stereotypic vision is automatic, rather than conscious and deliberate; (c) this effect is flexible, such that it is not limited to pre-existing social categories (e.g., race, gender, age) but arises with newly acquired categories, and importantly, can be reduced by counter-stereotype interventions. This project will advance a cutting-edge behavioral methodology in tandem with fMRI pattern-analyses. They have the potential to be transformative across psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and related fields, providing a paradigm to reveal the neural representation of 'hidden' cognitive states. Knowledge gained through these studies will be leveraged to develop new mouse-tracking platforms for the general public to raise awareness of subtle forms of bias, generate data for future research, and pave the way for improved techniques to reduce real-world biases."

To realize the beneficial societal outcomes on, for example, interactions between humans and intelligent robots, it is important to develop simulations to test a variety of situations where memory under arousal states will function. In this project, the investigator articulates a research plan to use a simulation of the human mind and body to understand effects of physiological arousal on human memory and cognition and the consequences for human interaction with AI agents. Human-subject studies will be used to introduce stimuli to induce human arousal by using selected stressors and collect physiological and behavioral data during tasks that require cooperation between humans and AI agents. Societal benefits include an architecture to simulate a variety of human-AI interactions under various levels of arousal and stress. This architecture can be used to explore new ways to co-team humans with AI agents and set expectations for positive and/or negative behaviors that might occur in such collaborations. Undergraduate students at Bucknell University will be heavily involved as research assistants on this project. <br/><br/>The investigator plans to develop simulations and elicit arousal states in human operators performing collaborative tasks with agents enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) to understand human-AI interaction. The goal is to better understand, through simulation, how algorithms for intelligent agents can be advanced and expanded to respond to human variations in behavior and memory processes under different levels of arousal, including levels that mimic stress.  The objectives include developing simulations to examine contexts and tasks; understanding how environmental stimuli affect interactions between humans and intelligent agents; and determining how to advance algorithms to optimize human-AI cooperation and avoid maladaptive interactions. The investigator has already extended Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture to account for physiological influences on declarative and procedural memory. Physio-cognitive agents will be developed based on Bayesian and reinforcement learning to acquire knowledge of their environment. Human-AI task simulations will be implemented in a virtual environment to understand how arousal mediates intelligent behavior and how interaction with external environments that include AI agents may change performance, including through maladaptive behavior. The project seeks to discover computationally-enabled processes and contexts to amplify human capabilities. The resulting revised models and open-source code will be made available to the public for further explorations in human-AI interaction.

Disasters may cause fiscal distress for local governments when revenues shrink and expenses grow, thereby affecting their ability to provide adequate local public services such as policing, public works, and education. The extent of local distress depends in part on what other actors do, including local property owners and higher levels of government. This project collects twenty years of New Jersey data from property tax records, municipal budgets, and state and federal budgets to create a fiscal impact model; uses a phone survey of coastal residents and focus groups with public officials to create a behavioral model; and joins them to support the deliberations of a stakeholder group based in coastal New Jersey. This group will explore ways to incentivize more effective management of coastal hazards and increase transparency about how coastal storm and flood events affect municipalities.   <br/> <br/>Better risk management in coastal areas depends in part on re-aligning the incentives experienced by households and local jurisdictions by changing the rules of the intergovernmental public finance. This project extends the method of Fiscal Impact Analysis, a widely used method to assess the local fiscal impacts of land use development proposals, to the situation where coastal hazards cause local fiscal impacts. It also develops a novel agent-based model of intergovernmental fiscal relations to allow strategic exploration of alternative incentive structures. The project integrates these two tools into a simulation modeling system that can support stakeholder deliberations about more protective coastal risk policy. More broadly, the project will help local decision makers to mitigate fiscal stresses from adaptation decisions outside the municipal sphere of influence. From an equity perspective, it serves fiscally distressed coastal communities that often have vulnerable residents residing in the flood plain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fast pyrolysis-derived liquid fuels are regarded as an economically feasible alternative to fossil fuels and some facilities for heat and power generation have been brought online in recent years. However, despite its promising potential, the development of fast pyrolysis has been hindered by the complexity of reactor conditions in biomass pyrolysis, and to date, methods capable of predicting the detailed processes are unavailable. The objectives of this project are to characterize accurately the behaviors of biomass particles and predict the product yields of a fast pyrolysis reactor by using high-fidelity numerical simulations. The proposed research activities will lead to advances in the fundamental science of biomass pyrolysis for energy applications. The educational activities are to engage K-12 science teachers in research in order to promote education on renewable energy. In the U.S., a significant number of K-12 science teachers have not majored in the physical sciences. The research training of K-12 science teachers can enrich their critical thinking and enable them to incorporate their new knowledge into their classroom teaching.<br/><br/>The proposed research plan is to conduct high-resolution simulations of biomass fast pyrolysis and to derive submodels for use in engineering CFD codes. A novel simulation approach, one that combines the lattice Boltzmann method, discrete element method, chemical kinetics, and particle shrinkage modeling, will be employed to describe the physicochemical evolution of biomass particles. Computational results will be validated by experimental data. Based on the simulation results, a drag coefficient model will be derived and tested. This work will address several scientific topics of paramount importance to biomass pyrolysis: physicochemical changes of particles, particle-particle and gas-particle interactions, and effects of particle properties and operating conditions on the pyrolysis products. The underlying difficulty of designing and optimizing an efficient biomass reactor is the lack of fundamental understanding of particle behaviors under realistic conditions. This research will characterize intra-particle transport, flow fields smaller than particle size, chemical reactions, and evolutions of particle size and properties. The resulting open-source code can be used by the scientific community as a baseline tool for further advanced numerical study on the pyrolysis of solid particles, e.g., coal, wood chips, municipal solid waste, or polymer materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inspired by biology, this research will focus on development of the first steps to prepare ionic circuits with amplifying properties built on the principles of both electronic integrated circuits and Nature?s signaling pathways. Prototypes of ionic circuits will be prepared using nanopores with controlled geometry and surface chemistry as the building blocks. The investigators chose nanopores as building blocks, because biological channels and pores in a biological cell create the first step of biological amplification.

Visits of students from local schools at both universities are also planned with hands-on activities on nanotechnology and biosensing.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the research is to design a generic route for ionic amplification and building ionic transistors with millisecond response time for biosensing applications. Nanopores in various materials including silicon nitride, polymer films and glass nanopipettes will be rendered ionic transistors by tuning their surface characteristics and geometries. The nanoporous transistors will be three terminal systems, which will function according to principles similar to those of semiconductor-based transistors. In the ionic systems constructed, instead of electrons, anions will carry negative charge, and, instead of holes, cations will carry positive charge. Nanoscale dimensions of the system are required for a quick temporal response, as movement of only a few ions or molecules will lead to changes in the measured signal. Connecting two ionic transistors in a circuit will lead to preparation of an ionic equivalent of a Darlington amplifier, where current gain is equal to a product of amplifications of the two component transistors. Application of the Darlington amplifier to probe ion channels with ultralow conductivities will be demonstrated as well. Preparation of an ionic differential amplifier will also be explored.

However, the explosion of both model dimensionality and complexity in current and emerging applications exacerbates the challenge of achieving efficient RL in sample-starved situations, where data collection is expensive, time-consuming, or even high-stake, e.g., in clinical trials, online advertising, and autonomous systems. As a result, understanding and improving the sample and computational efficiencies of RL algorithms, sometimes under additional resource and system-level constraints, are rightly understood as critical to the successful deployment of RL in the future. In this project the PIs are involving students at all levels with diverse backgrounds in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and in Statistics, are developing education modules on RL to enrich the curriculum, and are co-organizing workshops and outreach activities to enable the broader dissemination of the project outcomes.<br/><br/>Despite decades-long research efforts, the statistical and computational underpinnings of RL are still far from being well understood, especially when it comes to finite-sample and finite-time issues which are of crucial operational value. This research project is bridging the theory-practice gap of modern algorithmic approaches to RL. It is doing so by (i) characterizing fundamental limits for the sample and computations complexities in various RL settings, (ii) by developing performance guarantees and uncertainty quantification schemes, and (iii) by designing new computationally efficient algorithms that are provably near-optimal in terms of sample complexity in both single-agent and multi-agent settings. The expected outcomes will enable the trustworthy adoption of RL algorithms in sample-starved environments. The complementary expertise of the research team is being leveraged to enrich the statistical and algorithmic foundations of RL through model-, policy-, and value-based approaches. New efficient algorithms that rely on function approximation schemes are being developed in order to address the curse of dimensionality; the resulting techniques are intended to lead to non-asymptotic analysis tools that deal with the complicated statistical dependencies present in RL.

Although a topic heavily studied by security researchers, finding software vulnerabilities is becoming increasingly challenging because the software widely used in day-to-day life is growing larger and more complicated. This project addresses this challenge by rethinking a classic technique called fuzzing for finding vulnerabilities from large software. The high-level idea of fuzzing is to create a large number of random inputs to run software and in turn trigger vulnerabilities. The novelties of this project are the new approaches, techniques, and tools that revolutionize fuzzing and make the nearly random testing process more intelligent and targeted. This way, this project will enhance security of various types of widely used software, ranging from web browsers to server-side programs.<br/><br/>To that end, this project is investigating vulnerability-coverage-driven fuzzing. Existing fuzzing techniques primarily followed an approach called code-coverage-driven fuzzing, motivated by the belief that code coverage and vulnerability finding are strongly correlated. Challenging this widely held belief, this project shows that code coverage has weaker-than-expected ties with vulnerabilities and code-coverage-driven fuzzing is not well suited for vulnerability finding. Pioneering vulnerability-coverage-driven fuzzing, this project invents a series of novel techniques to (1) obtain feedback on vulnerability coverage (2) prioritize test inputs that can reach more vulnerabilities and (3) maximize the chance to trigger vulnerabilities reached by the test inputs. This project also produces new metrics, new benchmarks, and new frameworks for comprehensively evaluating the use of fuzzing for vulnerability finding. With the investigators' experience in research of software security and system security, this project provides a group of education, training, and research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.

In order for these applications to support modern scientific discovery and decision making, however, it is necessary to seek not merely reasonable estimations for the parameters, but perhaps more crucially, a trustworthy interpretation of the estimations and their implications. For instance, what reassurances can we offer about the quality of the estimates in hand? Can we quantify the uncertainty of our estimates due to the imperfectness of the data?  Providing valid and quantitative answers to such questions is a crucial step in ensuring that: the scientific discovery and decision made based on our estimate are informative and trustworthy. Nevertheless, the existing statistical toolbox remains highly inadequate in providing measures of uncertainty for large-scale estimation methods, particularly in those scenarios where the availability of data samples is severely limited. This limits the overall value of the estimates and hampers scientific and decision-making processes. Some example application areas include: joint shape matching in computer vision and water-fat separation in medical imaging.<br/> <br/>Motivated by the above issues, the overarching goal of this project is to develop new foundational theory that integrates statistical assessment and algorithm design in an end-to-end manner, allowing for optimal inferential procedures for various nonconvex low-complexity models. Blending large-scale optimization techniques with statistical thinking, the proposed project seeks to develop a novel suite of distributional theory that enables valid uncertainty assessment for various nonconvex low-complexity models. Specifically, this project consists of the following research. First,  develop a principled approach to construct optimal confidence intervals for unknown continuous parameters, on the basis of novel nonconvex estimation and de-biasing methods. Second, develop fast nonconvex algorithms and efficient uncertainty assessment procedures to reason about unknown discrete variables. Third, investigate the intimate connection between convex relaxation and nonconvex optimization, thus enabling a unified uncertainty quantification framework to accommodate both approaches. All research thrusts are motivated by, and will ultimately be tested on concrete practical applications.

The progression of anomalies can start in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region near 80 km in altitude and go all the way down to tropospheric heights of around 30 km. Because of their downward progression, SSWs represent an important process for downward coupling between atmospheric regions. They are believed to be a product of interaction between planetary waves and the mean atmospheric flow (winds), but it has also been suggested that atmospheric disturbances originating from lower altitudes (gravity waves) play an important role in this interaction by creating the right set of conditions for downward progression (pre-conditioning).

The downward coupling processes in the upper and middle atmosphere are important because of their potential impact on the stratospheric ozone and other important constituents. <br/><br/>The work will involve (1) analysis of characteristics of the temperature anomalies and atmospheric waves using data from satellite measurements and global atmospheric model results, (2) numerical simulations of wave propagation and comparison of the results with characteristics of the temperature anomalies, and (3) investigation of whether pre-conditioning occurs through a change in the zero-wind line height by running ensemble simulations.

The project brings together an international collaborative team to employ the latest methods in collecting and analyzing fossil and archaeological data. The team will strengthen scientific collaborations by training students in analytical and field methods. The results of the project will be shared publicly through school visits and science fairs. All data and results will be shared digitally with the international community, both scientific and public, allowing people from around the world access to evidence of our shared origins. <br/><br/>Recent discoveries suggest that modern human origins are more complex than originally thought, but the limited fossil and archaeological record has obscured exactly when, where, how, and why modern humans appeared. A newly discovered site is unique in both the number of human remains recovered to date and the extraordinary data on the past environments it preserves. So far, this site has yielded complete skull and partial skeleton of an early modern human, remains of several other individuals, and a large number of tools. The site also preserves an abundance of fossils of animals that lived alongside these early humans, providing key data on their environment and ecology. This site is geologically correlated with other famous hominin sites permitting an extraordinary opportunity to compare early modern human behavior across different environments of the same past ecosystem during the same geological time-period. The investigators plan on several field seasons to collect and analyze human and other fossils, gather and study the abundant tools, and document the geology of the site. Some fossils will be reconstructed digitally, and the resulting 3D models will be shared publicly along with data on archaeological and animal remains. After fieldwork is complete, an international team of investigators will be brought together to analyze the anatomical, environmental, geological, and archaeological data to provide integrated analyses and further advance knowledge about the origins of modern humans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, driven by considerable profits, opioid trafficking has co-evolved with modern technologies, such as, social media platforms have been utilized for marketing and selling illicit drugs including opioids, which has attracted increasing attention from both public health agencies and law enforcement. As online opioid trafficking activities are nimble and resilient, it calls for novel techniques to effectively detect opioid trades to facilitate proactive response strategies. By advancing capabilities of machine learning and data science, the goal of this project is to design and develop a holistic framework to model and analyze dynamic multi-modal data to fight against online opioid trafficking and, thus, help combat opioid epidemic. This research will enable a conceptual framework for the federal and state governments, public health agencies, law enforcement, and local communities to develop proactive strategies to build up a drug-free world - one community at a time. <br/><br/>By engaging novel disciplinary perspectives, this exploratory, yet transformative, high risk-high payoff work will involve radically different approaches for the development of an integrated framework to combat online opioid trafficking. The research will have three key components. First, the team will propose a novel heterogeneous temporal graph (HTG) to comprehensively model and abstract multi-modal posts and relational information over time on social media. Second, based on the constructed HTG, the research team will develop an innovative graph transformer to learn user representations for opioid trafficker detection. Third, to tackle the challenge of lack of sufficient labeled data for model training, the team will further develop a new meta-learning algorithm by joining unsupervised graph structure and small amount of supervised training data to update the model. This will enable the model to quickly adapt to a new task, such as identifying a new type of traded opioid and its traffickers on social media, using only a few samples and training iterations. The developed holistic framework for the detection of online opioid trafficking activities will have significant impacts on addressing the critical national opioid epidemic facing our society. The research will be beneficial to data mining and machine learning communities, as well as multidisciplinary domains such as public health, epidemiology, social and behavioral sciences. The outcomes of this project will be made publicly accessible and broadly distributed. The project will integrate research with education through novel curriculum development, participation of underrepresented groups, and student mentoring activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, due to the formidable complexity of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) arising from polypharmacy, it is challenging if not impossible to count them all manually. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing novel computational methodologies and models for early detection of risky DDI patterns when opioids are combined with other drugs (e.g., sedatives, muscle relaxants, anti-anxieties). Since relying on a single data source for biomedical knowledge discovery often results in unsatisfactory performance, the goal of this project is to design and develop a novel and integrated framework (algorithms, models, and techniques) to construct a heterogeneous network built from multiple data sources and extract useful information from the constructed network to reduce the risk of opioid overdoses resulting from polypharmacy. <br/><br/>The key components of the planned research are three-folds.

One issue that must be navigated in this changing landscape is the fate of the many synthetic organic chemicals that ultimately end up in the Arctic. Little is known about the fate of these chemicals once they reach the Artic, and any of these substances can harm organisms and people. The exposure risk of these compounds is tightly coupled to their environmental fate. This research will assess the abundance of these synthetic compounds and the ability of the Arctic environment to break down these substances. To support the education of future scientists on this emerging topic, a high school module will be delivered for the Alaska Summer Research Academy on Arctic environmental chemistry. Additionally, the research groups of Jennifer Guerard and Yu-Ping Chin will recruit a teacher for the Polar TREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) Program. If successful, this project will help direct contaminant mitigation efforts that will be required in the rapidly evolving Artic landscape. <br/><br/>Organic chemicals from industry and agriculture have been recently detected throughout the Arctic in the tundra, air, water, organisms, and people. However, little is known about the Artic fate of current use pesticides (CUPs) or emerging brominated flame retardants (EBFRs). This collaborative work between the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the University of Delaware seeks to understand how the Arctic's unique environment influences the fate and transformation of CUPs and EBFRs. Photolysis may play a critical role in the fate of these substances due to continuous solar irradiance in summer months coupled with the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM).  These factors can catalyze contaminant attenuation through reaction with photo-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) or other pathways. This project tests the hypotheses that: 1) Concentrations of CUPs and EBFRs in surface waters will be highest during and immediately following melt of snowpack; and  2) The formation of analyte-DOM complexes will render these substances more susceptible to photodegradation. The CUPs chlorpyrifos and chlorothalonil, and EBFRs 1,2-bis(2,4,6- tribromophenoxy)ethane and tetrabromobisphenol A, will be measured by atmospheric and aqueous sampling over two field seasons at Toolik Field Station. Partitioning to suspended solids, DOM, and phototransformation pathways influenced by Arctic DOM will be quantified through field and laboratory experiments. Critical measurements will be made of physical and biogeochemical parameters that can be incorporated into an Arctic-specific chemical fate model, including parameters for partitioning into environmental compartments and attenuation rates by photolytic pathways. A chemical fate model for CUPs and EBFRs in Arctic lakes will be developed to predict chemical behavior in Arctic waters under various physical and environmental conditions. Quantifying the persistence and transformation of these compounds will be indispensable for risk assessment and long-term policy development for Arctic region contaminants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The kidney continuously purifies the blood to remove toxins and waste while keeping cells and large proteins in circulation. How the kidney performs this essential function is not fully understood. The blood and urine are separated by a thin basement membrane lined with cells.  This membrane provides a barrier to the movement of large molecules into the urine. Leakage of proteins across the kidney filter is a primary indicator of kidney damage. It is known that the structural and mechanical properties of the basement membrane are altered in diseases such as Alport syndrome, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. This research project will increase understanding of how changes in basement membrane stiffness affect protein transport across the kidney filter. This will be accomplished using an integrated experimental approach.  The work will combine combines chemical, enzymatic, and genetic methods to modify basement membrane stiffness and bioengineered models of the kidney filter. This award will also promote science and engineering concepts to high school and undergraduate students through implementation of a near-peer mentoring program and development of a cell-basement membrane themed curriculum. There will be an emphasis on engaging socioeconomically disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students. <br/><br/>The overall research goal of this project is to understand how basement membrane mechanics regulates the molecular selectivity of the glomerular filtration barrier. This project will investigate the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of the glomerular basement membrane play a critical role in regulating permeability through two distinct mechanisms: (1) by altering compression-dependent transport across basement membranes and (2) through mechanically mediated effects on glomerular epithelial and endothelial cell function. The first objective is to determine how alterations in stiffness regulate the molecular permeability of biologically derived basement membranes. The second objective will evaluate the effects of basement membrane stiffness on podocyte and glomerular endothelial cell permeability. The third objective is to develop a multilayer bioreactor model of the glomerular filter to evaluate the coordinated role of the basement membrane, podocytes, and endothelial cells in regulating pressure-dependent molecular permeability. These studies aim to provide new fundamental understanding of the basic mechanisms of kidney function and determine how disease-mediated changes in basement membrane stiffness contribute to development of proteinuria.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thousands of researchers use workflows for creating and analyzing data from a diverse set of research domains and the uptake of workflows for research is also reflected in a high number of mature workflow management systems with different strengths and foci. Workflows have been instrumental in enabling significant discoveries such as the gravitational waves from colliding black holes and the analyses of DNA from Next-Generation Sequencing technologies. While workflows constitute a research domain in their own right and lead to improvements such as efficiency, feature enhancement, and usability, workflows are inherently designed to serve other domains. The creation of workflows supporting a research topic requires an understanding of the targeted problem and can be a labor-intensive and error-prone process. One source of errors is the communication between domain researchers and workflow providers. Successful communication considers diverse aspects such as the scientific background, native language, home country, and culture of the researchers. While the agreement on one natural language for communication - or involving a translator - is the typical set-up communication, there is a lack of tools or translators for communication between research domains and computer science. VisDict is intended to fill this gap by providing a set of vocabularies in a science gateway to enhance communication. The goal is to present a definition for different domains and workflow providers and, thus, serve as source for terms. Adding visualization will lower the communication barrier further following the saying, ?A picture is worth a thousand words.?<br/><br/>The main goal for VisDict is to create an intuitive visual dictionary that translates terms and concepts between research domains and computer science, specifically computational workflows. A key component of the proposed work is the development of a visual dictionary - VisDict - instantiated as a science gateway that is based on the science gateway framework HUBzero and aimed at providing a knowledge map of terms across disciplines. To accomplish this innovative and transformative goal, the project is conducting a series of surveys and interactions with workflow systems researchers and developers, and researchers from the science and engineering communities. The project is applying semantic representation to create knowledge between different domains to make it seamlessly available to researchers and thus fill the gap in this area. The visualization is intended to enhance understanding, and users are be able to vote on definitions and figures to allow for a wide adoption of the dictionary in diverse communities. By lowering the communication barrier for workflow design and development activities between computer scientists and domain scientists, this project has the potential to significantly enhance and accelerate scientific progress of critical importance for the development and sustainability of society. While the project starts with two communities - physics and ecology - the concept can be applied to any research domain with subject-specific language.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symbiotic interactions involving subsets of species can have disproportionate impacts on communities, reaching well beyond each interacting species. Coral reefs host some of the most iconic symbiotic interactions in nature and are host to the highest diversity of life on the planet. Cleaning symbiosis, wherein small fish or shrimp remove external parasites and associated microorganisms from specific clients, is common on coral reefs. Sites on the reef occupied by cleaners, or ?cleaning stations?, attract a wide variety of fish species that engage in direct physical contact with the cleaner. These highly used territories are viewed both as ?clinics of the sea?, where parasitized and sickly fish seek the service of cleaners, but also as potential ?garbage dumps?, where unnecessary parasites and other microorganisms are removed. This project seeks to understand the role of cleaning symbiosis transferring microbes in coral reef environments. This research supports training for U.S. graduate students and for undergraduates from Arkansas State University, a primarily undergraduate institution that includes a large population of first-generation college students. These students participate in field site research and have opportunities to visit the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for broader exposure to ocean science and more specific laboratory training. The project strengthens international collaboration and further builds on the existing relationships between the team of scientists and resource managers, local divers, fishers, and boat operators, as well as K-12 schools and environmental education programs, and will therefore contribute to local economies. Outreach efforts include a film highlighting this research and publicly accessible narratives shared through press releases and an on-line magazine.<br/><br/>While the benefits of cleaning to reef ecosystem health have been extensively studied, the cleaning costs for cleaner species and the role of cleaning stations as potential sinks for microbial diversity and possibly even pathogens have never been assessed. Here, the researchers utilize the unique features of cleaning stations to understand transfer of bacterial and archaeal symbionts amongst fish and within coral reef environment. The study capitalizes on cleanerfish access to multiple variety of hosts or clients within stations to address new questions about how cleanerfish act as vectors to transfer microorganisms between hosts on a reef and if and how these microorganisms may play a broader functional role in reef resilience. Specifically, the project addresses the following hypotheses: 1) Cleanerfishes serve as keystone regulators of microbial communities, enhancing microbial community diversity and transferring key microbial species between clients, and 2) Cleanerfishes are a particularly important contributor to reef resilience, facilitating recovery of the microbiome following disturbance. The research team uses an integrative interdisciplinary approach involving field and laboratory observations and experiments, and molecular-based tools.

The core technology used in the Internet, IPv4 and BGP, is based on technology developed in the 1970's and early 1980's, when the focus of the Internet was providing connectivity between unsophisticated edge networks and applications.  In contrast, today's users and service providers want high Quality of Experience, e.g., smooth HD video, responsive e-commerce stores, interactive social networks, etc. Addressing these challenges is hard because both IP and BGP have proven to be very rigid and hard to modify.  While there has been much research on clean slate proposals for the Internet data plane, research in the control plane has mostly focused on specific protocols. This project fills this void by using a holistic approach to the design of the Internet control plane that can adapt to efficiently meet the growing demands placed on the Internet.<br/><br/>Based on our experience with the XIA future Internet architecture project, we define three separate but related requirements. First, control protocols must be evolvable so they can adapt to future emerging requirements.  Second Internet routing protocols must be resource aware. Finally, the Internet control plane must support coordination with the control planes of increasingly sophisticated edge networks such as content delivery networks (CDNs) and cloud infrastructure.  The project has a broad research agenda that includes research in protocol support for evolvability and resource-awareness in the Internet, the definition of interfaces and techniques for coordination across edge and transit domains, and a control plane architecture that provides support for common control protocol functions such as discovery and control communication.  This research uses several real-world drivers including traffic engineering, cloud computing and a large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) defense service.  Finally, the project will includes an end-to-end experimental evaluation effort using large-scale testbeds such CloudLab, GENI, and PEERING.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The main intellectual merit of the project is that it addresses three fundamental challenges in for Internet control protocols (evolvability, resource-awareness, and interfaces for coordination across heterogeneous control planes) in an integrated fashion. The results in these three areas will be integrated in a novel control plane architecture for the Internet.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project will also have significant broader impact.  First, tools to run large scale networking experiments across testbeds such as Cloudlab, GENI and PEERING will be made available to the research community. Second, the project will engage undergrad and MS students in the project and integrate results in courses at CMU and UW-Madison, and will organize a DIMACS workshop to engage the community in discussion on the important topic of control plane design for the future Internet.  Finally, the holistic approach to rethinking the network control plane can have tremendous impact on the networking research community and industry."

Consequently, modeling spatiotemporal data with flexible statistical models has become an enormously active area of research over the last decade in many disciplines including the environmental sciences, health sciences and oceanography, among others. In all these applications, researchers require efficient data modeling tools that can adapt to the complexity and size of modern spatiotemporal data, empowering them to quickly fit a variety of scientific models that explain the intricate nature of associations. This research project develops a new class of distributed Bayesian statistical algorithms, the Aggregated Monte Carlo (AMC), that enables efficient modeling of massive spatiotemporal data on an unprecedented scale. While the motivation of the PIs comes primarily from complex modeling and uncertainty quantification of massive spatiotemporal data, the proposed algorithm is general enough to set important footprints in the related literature of machine learning and computer experiments. The overarching goal also includes the development of software toolkits to better serve practitioners in related disciplines. <br/><br/>There has been an explosion in the size, complexity, and availability of spatiotemporally indexed data. This event has outpaced the development in Bayesian statistical methodology in that the fitting of state-of-the-art methods based on stochastic processes for analyzing spatiotemporal point referenced and point process data is prohibitively slow unless restrictive assumptions are imposed. The main problem is that the Monte Carlo (MC) computations in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for fitting these models scale poorly with the size of the data. Solving this problem, the PIs develop a general framework, called Aggregated Monte Carlo (AMC), for scaling MC computations in the stochastic process-based modeling of massive space-time data using a divide-and-conquer technique. AMC has three stages that involve dividing the data into smaller subsets, obtaining posterior samples of the unknown parameters and latent variables across all the subsets using MCMC, and combining the MCMC samples from all the subsets. AMC is tuned to boost the scalability of any state-of-the-art model based on a stochastic process using a divide-and-conquer technique. Computationally, the main innovations include the development of general division and combination schemes for data with diverse spatiotemporal structures. Theoretically, the project provides bounds on the number of subsets such that the posterior distribution estimated using AMC provides a near optimal approximation of the full data posterior distribution in terms of decay of the posterior risks and contraction rates. Conceptually, AMC provides a natural extension of the existing results for combination using the barycenter of subset posterior distributions in parametric models to non-parametric models with complex spatiotemporal structures. The most appealing features of AMC are that it exploits parallel computer architecture for efficient and flexible modeling of massive spatiotemporal data and it provides posterior inference and uncertainty estimates with theoretical guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although it is a key activity in engineering, the fundamentals of how engineers utilize objective data to inform inherently subjective judgments about the system during verification is not well understood. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research into this process and education efforts geared towards improving understanding about and skills for verification activities. The research focus is on modeling the information structures by which engineers build confidence in a system's performance. This knowledge can lead to improved verification strategies and more rigorous ways to evaluate verification data. Hence, the research activities can bring about a potentially transformative paradigm for the practice of systems engineering. Improved verification strategies benefit society by enabling efficient system development with a more robust verification coverage, which may lead to increased safety and efficacy of commercial products and public services and greater overall economic competitiveness. The innovative education paradigm introduced in this project embeds verification into regular engineering assignments to prepare students to exercise sound judgement and be effective decision makers in engineering. Middle school students are engaged with a computer game that teaches conceptual diversity beyond calculations. By realizing that no single answer exists for an engineering problem, students embrace the potential diversity in engineering solutions and focus on understanding how prior knowledge, mental models, preferences, and team member attitudes shape the meaningfulness of their solutions. <br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER project is to study the formation of engineers' beliefs during systems engineering verification activities and to identify patterns and heuristics that better enable engineers to capture their beliefs in information artifacts. Explanatory models of how engineers' beliefs form will be established by combining Bayesian analyses, traditional and dynamic belief graphs, and decision theory with empirical observations of professional engineers and information artifacts (e.g., verification plans and reports). Cognitive mapping will be used to elicit belief structures, Bayesian analysis will be employed to model engineers' beliefs, and Credal sets will be used to account for differing engineers' beliefs.  The educational objective of this project is to help students recognize and embrace the subjective (yet non-arbitrary) nature of correctness in engineering problems. Novel instructional approaches to two key populations for engineering will be implemented and assessed. A digital game to model real-world contexts as math word problems will be used to seek and capture the conceptual diversity that emerges when middle school students cooperate while solving problems. Undergraduate students will be exposed to open-ended problems that foster a solution-verification iterative approach to engineering in several courses from their freshmen to senior years. Overall, this project will contribute to determining the effects of engineers' beliefs and belief structures on verification strategies and the evaluation of verification evidence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seven universities are directly involved (the three Rutgers University campuses, Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Pittsburgh, Drexel University, Temple University, and the City University of New York); indirectly, other regional schools served by the New Jersey and Pennsylvania high-speed networks also participate.  The system has applicability to a several science and engineering domains, such as protein-DNA interaction and smart cities, and is likely to be extensible to other domains.  The cyberinfrastructure is to be integrated into both graduate and undergraduate programs across several institutions.   <br/><br/>The end product is a fully-developed system for collaborative use by the research and education community.   A data management and sharing system is constructed, based largely on commercial off-the-shelf technology.  The storage system is based on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), a Java-based file system providing scalable and reliable data storage, designed to span large clusters of commodity servers.  The Fedora and VIVO object-based storage systems are used, enabling linked data approaches.  The system will be integrated with existing research data repositories, such as the Ocean Observatories Initiative and Protein Data Bank repositories.  Regional high-performance computing and network infrastructure is leveraged, including New Jersey's Regional Education and Research Network (NJEdge), Pennsylvania's Keystone Initiative for Network Based Education and Research (KINBER), the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) computing capabilities, Open Science Grid, and other NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure investments.  The project also develops a custom site federation and data services layer; the data services layer provides services for data linking, search, and sharing; coupling to computation, analytics, and visualization; mechanisms to attach unique Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), archive data, and broadly publish to internal and wider audiences; and manage the long-term data lifecycle, ensuring immutable and authentic data and reproducible research."

This is not only expensive but faces data privacy risks as well. By analyzing data on the device where it is generated, federated learning aims to mitigate both cost and privacy concerns of centralized machine learning without sacrificing its benefits. This collaborative project brings together investigators from two institutions to develop building blocks for practical federated learning by addressing challenges arising from the diversity of user devices and the heterogeneity of data distributions in those devices. <br/><br/>The project takes a three-pronged approach: (1) enable performance improvements for machine learning developers (e.g., judicious participant selection instead of randomly selecting participants); (2) provide efficiency improvements for service providers (e.g., redundancy elimination for data transfers); (3) enable end-users to control their data privacy (e.g., akin to app permissions in Android) without sacrificing device usability. Two core principles underpin these solutions: multi-tenancy both in the cloud and on individual devices; and maintaining theoretical correctness, convergence characteristics, and privacy/security guarantees of federated learning algorithms. <br/><br/>Widespread adoption of practical federated learning can fundamentally change how we gather insights from end-user data and how users value data privacy, because users may not have to sacrifice privacy for convenience in many cases. This, in turn, can force large corporations to rethink their data collection and usage practices, and influence policy makers to consider stricter privacy regulations. All software from this project will be open source. Through outreach and new educational materials, this project will pioneer the training of privacy-aware systems builders.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will produce software artifacts, experimental harnesses, benchmarks, and results of running those benchmarks and artifacts.

The rapid growth of geospatial and spatiotemporal data being collected from space, airborne, and terrestrial platforms provides scientists, farmers, and first responders critical information they need about the surface of the Earth. This emerging area that intersects machine learning, especially deep learning, with geographic information science is called GeoAI. GeoAI can potentially transform society by addressing grand challenges such as rapid disaster response, water resource management, and transportation. One major obstacle, however, is that deep learning heavily relies on a large number of training labels, which are often not easily available for geographic applications due to slow and expensive field surveys. Existing research on semi-supervised learning could not fully resolve the issues due to the complex nature of geographic data such as spatial heterogeneity. This project will fill the gap by exploiting large scale, low-cost, and near real-time volunteered geographic information. The project will contribute towards the next generation water resource management for the U.S. in the 21st century. This research can not only improve the situational awareness for disaster response agencies but also enhance the flood forecasting capabilities of the National Water Model. Planned algorithms will be implemented into open source tools that will enhance the research infrastructure for disaster management and hydrology communities. Educational activities include curriculum development, K-12 computer science education at Alabama Computer Science Summer Camps. The principal investigator has a past record in mentoring undergraduate students from a historically black university and will continue the efforts at the University of Alabama, which has a reputation for producing African American researchers. <br/><br/>The planned framework will bring about several innovations to address significant technical challenges due to data quality issues. First, to address the noisy, biased, and incomplete label semantics, the project will develop novel label enhancement and enrichment algorithms based on physics-aware spatial structural constraints, which advance existing methods (that often assume independent labels) by jointly enhancing labels based on structural dependency. Second, the project will explore a new location error model that better captures geometric shapes than existing square patch-based models, and design efficient joint learning algorithms to update deep model parameters while inferring true shape locations. Finally, to address location ambiguity, the project will explore location ambiguity models and mitigating location ambiguity by leveraging geographical contexts from input imagery features as well as spatial hierarchical constraints. Such ideas advance existing location disambiguation methods merely based on the textual semantic context in natural language processing. The project can potentially transform the field of geospatial data science by addressing a major obstacle of limited training labels by a systematic framework of exploiting large-scale, low-cost, and near real-time volunteered geographic information data. The project can potentially make transformative impacts on interdisciplinary GeoAI applications such as rapid disaster response and national water forecasting.

Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) is a plant virus with highly uniform structure. Using templates derived from BSMV is proposed as an economical alternative to current processes. Virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from BSMV will be designed to act as templates for the production of metallic nanomaterials.  Graduate and undergraduate students in will be trained to design and produce these templates. High school students from underrepresented groups and the general public will be engaged through innovative workshops that teach them about the power of biological engineering and nanomaterials. <br/><br/>BSMV is an attractive biotemplate for synthesis of metallic nanomaterials.  It can be more densely coated with metal than other biotemplates. It interacts electrostatically with metal precursor ion solutions to deposit a wider range of metals. It requires fewer processing steps to coat fully. The role of key BSMV amino acid residues in mediating metal mineralization on the VLP surface will be investigated. Protein and RNA engineering strategies to control biotemplate properties and facilitate biotemplate robustness will be pursued. Surface residues will be altered to facilitate metal-template interactions. Thermal processing to create biotemplated-materials with high electrical conductivities will be optimized. If successful, the techniques developed will create an economical bacterial expression and purification pipeline for designer BSMV biotemplates. The range of metals that ca be deposited on them will be broadened. Key insights into organic-inorganic interactions involved in metal deposition on biotemplates will be uncovered.
