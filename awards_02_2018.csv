The goal of this site is to give students an opportunity to engage in research projects on model-based reasoning. Modeling is an important practice of science as models provide bridges between ideas and observations of the physical world.  Models are simplified versions of real-world systems that allow scientists to ask new questions, test new hypotheses, and communicate explanations to a broad audience.  Major STEM education reform initiatives in K-12 and higher education support opportunities for students to engage in the practice of modeling throughout the STEM curriculum.  These reform initiatives must also be supported by a research base that includes well-defined goals, assessment tools, an understanding of common student difficulties, and effective curricular approaches.  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Model-based Reasoning in STEM Education will give students an opportunity to engage in novel research projects in this exciting and important field.<br/><br/>Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER) combines disciplinary expertise in a STEM field with education research methodology that undergraduate students can do, if provided with preparatory work and mentoring. This DBER REU program will enable STEM students to apply their growing disciplinary knowledge to important problems in education research.  Over the next three years, the program will select 30 diverse undergraduate students to join the RIT STEM research community. During the program, students will engage in rigorous education research projects with the support and collaboration of research mentors. The program will help students prepare for DBER and/or scientific research careers  and graduate programs. These potential future educators will be introduced to teaching, learning, and assessment of the core scientific practice of modeling. Students in this program will disseminate their findings at conferences and through scholarly publications. To support program objectives, this DBER REU program has four core components: Mentored Research projects, Professional Development Workshops, DBER Methods Workshops, and Cohort-building Activities.  The project will contribute to research around the development and assessment of students' abilities in modeling, which is essential for the efficacy of educational initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Evaluating the credibility of web sources is a crucial critical thinking skill in our digitally mediated world. We have learned to rely on search engine platforms to show us the right results, while forgetting that algorithms are biased or that they can be manipulated. This research aims to discover whether and how humans can reclaim their agency when deciding what information sources to trust. Additionally, it will: (1) identify a set of human-understandable signals that are deemed helpful for evaluating the credibility of web sources and validate them through users studies; (2) propose and implement algorithmic techniques for computing some of these signals, providing a trail of transparency about how they work, and (3) develop a novel web platform for the interactive exploration of signals, modeled upon nutrition fact labels, that will contribute in advancing web literacy skills in the broad public.<br/><br/>Experimental evidence on whether labeling information sources with credibility signals affects the critical thinking skills of young people will inform the emerging public debate on how cyber-human systems such as search engines, which are shaping our minds and societies, could support a basic consumer right, that of being informed about the source of information that is being consumed. Other broad impacts are: (1) advancing web literacy through an interactive web platform that explains and gives information about signals to evaluate credibility; (2) monitoring search engine result pages (SERP), by establishing a SERP Observatory on results about vulnerable populations to discover attempts to manipulate the ranking, and (3) educating the public through writings on algorithmic decision making on the web. This research will also involve the entire community of the college in the production of digital content through a yearly Wikipedia Edit-a-thon, which will enrich and expand the results shown by search engines on topics about women, gender, and vulnerable populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the full potential of these novel data resources has not been realized. The data is heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and spatiotemporal. Planning problems for conservation and sustainable development have huge numbers of states and actions, and significant modeling uncertainty. This career-development project supports an integrated program of research, teaching, and outreach to develop new algorithms to convert data into knowledge and decisions for global-scale ecological sustainability. The methods are expected to help improve scientific understanding of animal populations, increase the value of citizen science data, and contribute to development plans that balance social, economic, and ecological objectives. <br/><br/>The technical research goals are to develop new models and algorithms for reasoning about large-scale probabilistic models and for network-based spatiotemporal planning. A new class of graphical models based on probability generating functions is proposed to cleanly model animal populations, and to provide a new and flexible class of deep generative models for general multivariate count data. A novel inference approach based on automatic differentiation will be combined with existing inference techniques to support scalable inference and learning. Algorithms that utilize causal reasoning will be developed to tease apart process from noise in citizen science data. Algorithms that exploit hierarchical structure in spatiotemporal domains will be developed to optimize multiple objectives in a highly scalable way to support sustainable development.

Thus, only way to determine performance of an entire system or a sub-system in the context of a whole system is to test it by applying a set of workloads under controlled conditions. The workloads should be representative of the real applications. In characterizing a system, the workloads that expose diverse system behaviors are more valuable than workloads that behave similarly. Thus, workload characterization is important. This proposal focuses on workloads for storage systems to enable storage systems performance optimization. From a systems perspective, if the behavior of the executing workload can be mapped to one or more of the known behaviors, then the system can be adapted to a configuration(s) that is best suited for that behavior. The goal of this project is to recognize the behavior of the workload to find workload archetype.<br/> <br/>The project will research workload metrics important to measure and define rigorous archetypes parameterized by these metrics to characterize new workloads without complex, slow predictive analytics or onerous domain specification. The investigator plans to produce a workload classification schema in preparation for developing adaptive, workload-aware automated storage tuning and provisioning framework.

Galaxies were just beginning to form from the matter created in the Big Bang, and the intense radiation emitted by these galaxies was burning away the fog of hydrogen gas permeating deep space.  In less than one billion years the fog had cleared, and the young galaxies lived in a Universe where ultraviolet radiation could travel freely through space.  This transformation of the gas in deep space is known as ""cosmic reionization"", and it was a landmark event in the early Universe.  By studying reionization we learn not only about the history of matter in the Universe, but about the formation of the first galaxies.  The goal of this project is to connect the changes we see happening in deep space during reionization to the characteristics of the first galaxies themselves.  How can we combine observations of galaxies and deep space to learn more about this era of cosmic history?  What imprints on the Universe does reionization leave behind?  The PI will use the world's largest telescopes to directly probe both galaxies and intergalactic gas over the same regions early in cosmic history.  The observations will be combined with state-of-the art computer modeling to better understand how cosmic reionization occurred and the ways in which it impacted early galaxies and the matter in deep space.  Building on this research, the PI will integrate his observational expertise into local high-school and undergraduate education.  A key element of this program will be the creation of a campus observatory at UC Riverside.  This will be one of the few such facilities in the country to offer spectroscopy, one of the most broadly used techniques in science and industry, and will be used to promote STEM engagement among underserved groups in Southern California.<br/><br/>Roughly one billion years after the Big Bang the Universe underwent a global transformation.  The first galaxies formed in a Universe filled with dark matter and cold, neutral gas.  As the radiation from these galaxies permeated deep space, however, the gas was ionized and heated, rendering the Universe transparent to ultraviolet photons.  Thirteen billion years later the gas in deep space is still highly ionized.  The early transition from neutral to ionized was therefore the last phase transition of matter in the Universe.  Known as ""reionization"", this transformation was a key event in cosmic history.  <br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to determine when and how reionization occurred by simultaneously studying the gas in deep space and the galaxies embedded within it.  The PI will use the word's largest telescopes to study galaxies (via wide-field imaging) and intergalactic gas (via absorption-line spectroscopy) in the same cosmic volumes during and after reionization.  Spectroscopy will also be used to study the gas in and around galaxies themselves.  These will be the first observations to directly connect the evolving conditions in deep space to the sources driving the evolution.  By further combining data with state-of-the-art modeling, this project will provide a better understanding of how cosmic reionization occurred and the ways in which it shaped early galaxies and intergalactic matter throughout the Universe.  Building on this research, the PI will integrate his observational expertise into local high-school and undergraduate education by creating a campus observatory at UC Riverside.

This relationship, observed in dozens of species in scores of habitats, consistently shows that the number of surviving offspring produced per female declines as the number of individuals in the population increases. Managing the harvest of these species depends on understanding this relationship because the largest harvests are sustained when populations are neither too big nor too small. Despite the importance of density dependence to hunters, pastoralists, and ranchers worldwide, the mechanism producing this relationship remains poorly understood. The goal of this project is to improve our general understanding of the mechanism causing density dependence in herbivore populations. Achieving this goal could fundamentally change how wildlife, livestock, and rangelands are managed. Impacts of the work will be expanded by summarizing the effects of density dependence on harvest of wild and domestic herbivores in media accessible to managers and policy makers. Recommendations for best practices will be made based on the research.<br/><br/>A synthesis of thirty years of research on foraging behavior and population dynamics of large mammalian herbivores will support development of new, broadly explanatory mathematical and statistical models showing how nutritional characteristics of plant communities create density dependence. These models will predict how density dependence is altered by animal body mass, the biomass of plants, and the mean and variance of nutrient concentrations in plants, for example protein or metabolizable energy content. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of fitting these models to data using modern Bayesian methods. Evidence in data for competing models will be evaluated. A new, theoretical and empirical framework for understanding how plants mediate herbivore population growth will be produced, thereby motivating new lines of inquiry in ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today's data sets, from areas such as machine learning, are often massive and high-dimensional: for example, when trying to classify news articles, each article may be represented as a point where the frequency of each word is a different dimension. This leads to geometries that are hard to grasp intuitively and hard to work with computationally (the ""curse of dimensionality""). Finding a smaller and lower dimensional subset of the data points that approximately preserves geometric structure not only reduces computation time but also can improve results by suppressing extraneous features. Representing inter-point distances of a general space in a more structured space can support new operations, such as data visualization by mapping the 2-D plane of the screen, or more efficient computation by mapping to the hierarchical structure of a tree. This project takes the age-old practice of teasing out geometric structure and applies it to the large- and high-dimensional data sets of the modern world. By taking a geometric approach to foundational problems in areas such as big data and machine learning, this project seeks to more closely connect computational geometry and these other areas, in turn both modernizing the classical field of computational geometry and advancing these other areas. The educational goals of this project will be achieved by directly supporting student research on the outlined topics, incorporating topics into developing new courses, and organizing regular seminars in order to grow the visibility and interdisciplinary nature of algorithms and theoretical computer science at the awardee institution.<br/><br/>Given a data set, the goal is to specify its geometric structure, use this structure to summarize and embed into simpler spaces where computations can be done efficiently, and when this is not possible, identify how to minimally fix the data to facilitate these tasks.  The project's focus is on three interrelated topics concerning geometric structure that lie at the intersection of big data, geometry, and machine learning: 1) data factorization and sparsification, 2) metric embeddings for structured spaces, and 3) metric violation distance.  The ultimate purpose is to develop better algorithms for handling data, ranging from better clustering algorithms to better classification algorithms. The ubiquity of such algorithms implies that any progress has the potential for significant real world impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through this process, individual components (for example, molecules) that are guided merely by local binding rules coalesce to form complex structures.  This process is integral to the formation of many vastly complicated structures such as snowflakes and even biological organisms like viruses.  Using self-assembly, scientists are developing a bottom-up manufacturing approach to nanotechnology where instead of starting with raw materials and extracting a desired structure, molecular building blocks are designed so that these building blocks selectively bind in such a way that the desired structure self-assembles with molecular- (if not atomic-) level precision.  While many mathematical models have been defined to serve as a theory for the design and analysis of engineered self-assembling systems, as self-assembly is also a naturally occurring phenomenon, models of self-assembly are useful in modeling natural systems.  A common important feature of many naturally occurring examples of self-assembling systems is that these systems are driven by the complex interaction of distributed components. In order to describe the balancing act observed in the distributed components that play a role in many biological functions, this project will use mathematical models of self-assembly to study how complex sequences of communication between self-assembled components can yield functionality that surpasses functionality of a single self-assembled component. By supporting many undergraduate research assistants, this project will impact the campus and departmental research environment, as well as the quality of undergraduate education.  Moreover, the project will increase awareness of interdisciplinary research at University of Wisconsin-River Falls by means of an interdisciplinary research seminar targeting a general audience and advertised to undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>The project proposes the study of fundamental questions that initiate the development of rigorous frameworks for modeling systems which exhibit distributed behaviors, leading to techniques that could directly be applied in defining tile assembly systems which mimic biological functions.  Ultimately, studying distributed systems in models of self-assembly leads to further understanding of the complex behaviors as well as potential novel uses of distributed systems in self-assembly - uses that can be employed in engineered self-assembling systems.  The project will use active tile assembly models such as the Signal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM) to define and analyze systems, which overcome defined constraints to exhibit algorithmic behavior, by necessarily relying on this behavior being distributed among the individual assemblies of the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, researchers will investigate the following research questions over two years: (1) How and when do first- and third-graders comment on and debug their code during free-play compared to when they are asked to explain what they will do before playing, i.e., explained play? (2) How does students' commenting and debugging compare and change depending on if they analyze worked examples before or after their play? (3) How does students' commenting and debugging of worked examples relate to their explaining and correcting errors in mathematics problems in addition to computer coding?  (4) How does the intervention affect students' early attitudes toward programming and knowledge of the role of programming in STEM professions? Measures include programming and mathematics explanation and debugging tasks as well as surveys related to programming.

While originally bounding theoretically the rate at which data may be transmitted over an imperfect channel, or how far an information source may be compressed, the foundational nature of these inequalities has led to their widespread applications in quantitative fields ranging from computer science to physics. This may be attributed, in part, to these inequalities being dimension-free, that is, the sharpness of the estimate does not degrade with the data dimension, thus making them suitable for analysis and inference in high-dimensional settings that are characteristic of modern problems in statistics, optimization and data science.  Broadly speaking, this project seeks to further elucidate these foundational underpinnings of information theory, and to extend their applicability to modern problems in statistics and data analysis that seek to uncover information from large data sets. The research is coupled with a plan to integrate research and education at multiple levels: the project will train researchers at the interface of statistics, information theory and mathematics, preparing them to enter academic and industrial careers in data science, and skillfully adapt to new fields as national priorities change. Other aims are to promote collaboration within the broader research community through development of thematic workshops and tutorials. <br/><br/>This project will undertake a systematic investigation of information inequalities. This goal will be achieved through an integrated research agenda that seeks to: (i) quantify high-dimensional statistical phenomena; (ii) characterize extremal properties of information inequalities; and (iii) discover new concentration and isoperimetric phenomena through linking information- and transportation-based quantities on graphs and other discrete spaces.  Through these aims, this project will promote the influence of information theory across traditional boundaries and enrich the set of intellectual questions addressed.

Selective-area atomic layer deposition (ALD), in a unique van der Waals growth mode, can overcome the current limitations for synthesis of the 2D nanomaterials. Typically, 2D materials are grown by chemical vapor deposition at high temperatures, which is not suitable for high aspect-ratio structures. Low temperature ALD produces amorphous films, which requires high temperature annealing to generate the desired microstructure, which is not suitable for some semiconductor devices. This research is to provide the knowledge necessary to synthesize crystalline 2D atomic layer materials at backend-compatible low temperatures through selective-area or seeded ALD with van der Waals bonding to the underlying substrate.

This research on ion conduction and dielectric constant of polymeric energy materials aims to understand the structure-property relations in polymers that conduct only one type of ion, such as lithium for advanced batteries and perhaps larger mobile ions for supercapacitors, sensors, and mechanical actuators.  A way to increase the mobility of the conducting ions is to add ""zwitterions"", which are small molecules containing both positive and negative charges, to single-ion conducting polymers. Although the method of adding zwitterions to polymeric materials has shown promise, fundamental insight is needed to design materials for specific functions for future applications.  If successful, the fundamental knowledge generated from this research will result in the understanding needed to design polymeric materials for a variety of specific energy applications, including advanced batteries, fuel cells, solar cells, ionic actuators, supercapacitors, and energy harvesting devices (each of which require maximizing ion transport).  Each of those applications has the potential to change current technologies and improve the lives of humans across the globe.  This project will also provide advanced scientific training and exposure to interdisciplinary research to graduate and undergraduate students, as well as opportunities for outreach.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/> <br/>Ionomers are an important class of energy materials for applications that require single-ion conduction, yet their structure-property relations are only beginning to be explored.  In this research, three novel types of materials are being made: (1) High molecular weight polycations with conducting counter-anions that are homopolymers, random copolymers and diblock copolymers, (2) high molecular weight polyanions with conducting counter-cations that are homopolymers, random copolymers and diblock copolymers, and (3) polar small molecule zwitterions that are non-volatile plasticizers for both types of ionomers to boost ionic conductivity.  A key fundamental question is how mixtures of ionomers and zwitterions can be optimized by careful molecular design of the two.  If successful, this research will reveal the design rules for the codesign of ionomer and zwitterion. By fully understanding the dielectric response of these materials (including the temperature dependence of dielectric constant and ionic conductivity) and using X-ray scattering to detail their morphology, the effects of systematic variations in zwitterion structure in such mixtures will be understood in detail.  By exploring the parameter space of ion content, counterion type and polarity (dielectric constant) of the zwitterion, the potential of this class of energy materials, in terms of highest possible dielectric constant and ionic conductivity, will be determined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural gas hydrates form on the seafloor and in marine sediments beneath the seafloor when water depths exceed ~500 m. Worldwide, marine methane gas hydrates are estimated to store 20% to 50% of Earth?s mobile carbon. Perturbations to temperature and pressure cause gas hydrates to dissociate into methane gas and water. Due to the large reservoir of carbon in methane gas hydrates, the metastability of these minerals, and the fact that methane is a strong greenhouse gas, many scientists have theorized that methane liberated from natural gas hydrates may be a key player in many of Earth?s large global warming events.   However, the amount of gas hydrate locked in marine sediments is not well known, with present estimates varying by four orders of magnitude. This research uses well logs from publicly accessible academic and industry geophysical information and well logs from cores drilled into marine sediments in conjunction with new mathematical approaches to evaluate, model, and estimate the amount of methane gas hydrates in a broad spectrum of different marine settings.  This information is then used to provide crucial, first-time information on the occurrence, distribution, amount of naturally occurring methane gas hydrates in the seafloor, worldwide.  Broader impacts of the work include information that can be used by the petroleum and natural gas industry in discovering and assessing economically feasible natural gas occurrences; the integration of research and education involving large numbers of students who will be involved in the data analysis and interpretation parts of the project; will complement previous gas hydrate assessments in the Gulf of Mexico; and complements a pending research cruise funded by the National Science Foundation- supported International Ocean Discovery Program.  The research will help support an investigator whose demographic is underrepresented in the sciences, will support the development of video field trips, and provide important information to students on careers in geology outside of academia.  <br/><br/>The assessments and estimates of natural methane gas hydrates are based on already existing data from petroleum industry geophysical well logs from offshore locations worldwide that already exists, but has not been systematically analyzed for natural gas hydrate. As a matter of course in exploration studies, the petroleum industry collects well log data in the shallow interval that coincides with gas hydrate stability, but often ignores it because their interest in in deeper seated major liquid petroleum plays, not gas hydrate occurrences.  Up to now, scientists have not exploited this vast treasure trove of data.  This research project focuses on these valuable, but underutilized data.  Research will involve the investigator, her graduate students, and her Borehole Geophysics class. They will examine and analyze well logs from the north Atlantic, the North Sea, offshore Western Australia, and the Gulf of Mexico using novel mathematical and conceptual tools that combine the petrophysical analysis of petroleum industry well logs with numerical modeling and geochemistry measurements to help constrain and understand the distribution and saturation of natural gas hydrates worldwide.

For example, if an app's user interface (UI) has no texts or images to indicate that it will access users' personal data (e.g., GPS data), but the app discloses users' personal data when an action is performed (e.g., pressing a button), then red flags should be raised. Thus, it is crucial to understand the intents of the app to determine whether the app will perform within the user's expectation. Various research efforts have been dedicated to understand apps' intents via analyzing the semantics of texts in UI. However, images, especially icons, remain unexplored. In apps' UIs, icons are often used in interactive widgets (e.g., buttons) to express the intents to use sensitive data. It is often difficult to analyze the semantics of icons due to the varieties in image styles and the lack of descriptive texts.<br/><br/>The proposed research will build a knowledge base of icons' semantics via collecting icons from apps in major smartphone markets, and develop a framework to infer the semantics of icons based on the collected icons.

These larvae spend days or weeks feeding on tiny algal particles to fuel their development until they can metamorphose into juveniles. In nature, however, the plankton includes not only edible particles, but also many particles that are too large to be eaten but which may interfere with feeding on edible particles. These include, for example, large algal particles, eggs and embryos of other invertebrates, re-suspended sediment, and anthropogenic nano- and micro-plastics. When larvae encounter large inedible particles, they may respond by altering their swimming behavior to avoid them, or by capturing and then rejecting them. Such interactions reduce the rate at which larvae can capture edible particles, which forces them to either spend more time feeding before metamorphosis (increasing their overall risk of dying due to planktonic predators), or to metamorphose with less energy, producing juveniles in relatively poor condition. This project examines how large inedible particles affect feeding, time to metamorphosis, and juvenile condition in the larvae of diverse marine invertebrates. The project has the potential to dramatically change our understanding of how larvae feed and survive in natural communities, and thus our understanding of the population dynamics of these important organisms. The project will support research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at California State University Long Beach, a primarily undergraduate institution, as well as summer research internships for students at two local community colleges. Project data will be integrated into laboratory modules in undergraduate courses. Finally, data on the reproductive biology of diverse California marine invertebrates will be added to a public website that is widely used by members of the public, students, and biologists interested in the development, life histories, ecology, and evolution of these common animals.  <br/><br/>The factors that control planktonic duration and juvenile condition in marine invertebrates with feeding larvae have long been recognized as critical to understanding their ecology and evolution. Larval feeding environment is clearly one of those factors, but previous work has focused almost exclusively on one feature of that environment, the abundance of food. This project will evaluate the importance of another potentially critical dimension of the larval feeding environment ? the presence of large inedible particles, which are frequently abundant in natural plankonic communities. It takes a comparative approach to address two key questions about the effects of large inedible particles on larvae (including those of echinoderms, annelids, and molluscs) that feed using several different particle capture mechanisms. First, do large inedible particles present in natural plankton reduce larval feeding rates? And second, does the presence of large inedible particles extend larval planktonic duration or result in the production of lower quality juveniles? Feeding rates of larvae will be measured in short-term experiments in which larvae are exposed to both food and to natural or artificial large inedible particles over a range of concentrations. Effects of large inedible particles on planktonic duration and juvenile quality will be measured by culturing larvae through their entire life cycles in the presence of large inedible particles at various concentrations. Because feeding performance is an important determinant of planktonic duration, larval survival, and juvenile condition, the project will add greatly to our understanding of how conditions in the plankton affect the population dynamics of the many marine invertebrates with feeding larvae.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Educational aspects of this project are designed with formal learning activities (field work at the Congaree National Park, design and construction of experimental installations for education, and the introduction of a new undergraduate level course on sustainable river engineering practices into the curriculum) to build an educational environment using collaborative learning pedagogy in which students learn how to work in a diverse, interdisciplinary, and international group.  These education aspects are targeted to prepare the next generation of engineers to tackle scientific and professional problems associated with water resources management.  Informal learning activities, such as the creation of an interactive digital platform for the Congaree National Park and summer camps for high school students, will inform the general public on the effects that humans and a changing climate can have on the environment in which they live in. <br/><br/>The main scientific objective of the research is to advance knowledge on river morphodynamics, and enable quantitative prediction of changes in channel geometry and pattern observed in the field.  It is hypothesized that the mode of bed material (sand or gravel) transport and the exchange of sediment between the river and the floodplain are key processes controlling river morphodynamics at spatial scales ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers and at temporal scales ranging from a few decades to several centuries.  This hypothesis will be tested with laboratory experiments to gain insight into the role of sediment grain size on channel morphology, mathematical modeling to provide physics-based quantitative tools on river morphodynamics, and fieldwork to characterize the annual variability of channel geometry on a reach of the Congaree River in the Congaree River National Park, USA, that has been responding to changes in hydrology and land use since the 1700s.  Additional field sites that are being affected by human-induced changes in land use will also be considered.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent evidence shows that learning math language (e.g., concepts such as more, few, less, near, before) during preschool supports this development. The purpose of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to examine the process by which math language instruction improves learning of mathematics skills in order to design and translate the most effective interventions into practical classroom instruction. The first objective of this project is to examine if quantitative and spatial math language effect the development of different aspects of mathematics performance (e.g., numeracy, geometry). The second objective is to examine how quantitative math language versus numeracy instruction, either alone or in combination, effect numeracy development. The findings from this study will not only be used to improve theoretical understanding of how math language and mathematics skills develop, but the instructional materials developed for this study will also result in practical tools for enhancing young children's math language and mathematics skills.  <br/><br/>This project is focused on evaluating the role of early math language skills in the acquisition of early mathematics skills. Two randomized control trials (RCTs) will be conducted. The first RCT will be used to evaluate the effects of different types of math language instruction (quantitative, spatial) on distinct aspects of mathematics (numeracy, geometry). It is expected that quantitative language instruction will improve numeracy skills and spatial language instruction will improve geometry skills. The second RCT will be used to examine the unique and joint effects of quantitative language instruction and numeracy instruction on children's numeracy skills. It is expected that both types of instruction alone will be sufficient to generate improvement on numeracy outcomes compared to an active control group, but that the combination of the two will result in enhanced numeracy performance compared to either alone. Educational goals will be integrated with and supported through engaging diverse groups of undergraduate and graduate students in hands-on research experiences, training pre- and in-service teachers on mathematical language instruction, and building collaborative relationships with early career researchers. Intervention materials including storybooks developed for the project and pre- and in-service teacher training/lesson plan materials will be made available at the completion of the project.<br/><br/>The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.

Thus, the geological, biological, and chemical processes taking place there remain poorly understood. Advances in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technology in the past decade mean that we can now send these vehicles to the seabed in water depths of several miles where they collect data from just above the seafloor. AUVs are often equipped with a high-resolution compressed-high intensity pulse (CHIRP) sonar, which can capture centimeter-scale-resolution, cross-section images of the sediment that blankets the seafloor. These thicknesses can then be used as proxies for the length of time a feature has been exposed on the seafloor. Despite this potential, time constraints and a lack of an easily available sonar data processing scheme means that these CHIRP data are often under-utilized.  This research develops a standard workflow and software for processing EdgeTech CHIRP sonar data, for use both at sea and on shore, using already existing AUV-acquired CHIRP surveys of sediment from a specific location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and other associated imaging data. Application of the processed data will be used to measure sediment thickness in an area where knowledge of this parameter advances our understanding of the interplay between the faulting and volcanism at mid-ocean ridge axes.  Broader impacts of the research add value and capability to the existing US AUV fleet and advance our understanding of crustal formation at mid-ocean ridges.  The methods and outcomes of the work will be incorporated into professional development workshops for in-service teachers in the highly diverse San Diego Unified School District, providing resources for lessons that can be widely used throughout the school system and support an early career investigator.<br/><br/>In areas far from terrestrial sources, sediment thickness in deep sea marine environments is a rough proxy for the amount of time a feature has been exposed on the seabed. Thus, this provides a way to constrain the timing of geological events, such as volcanic eruptions and/or slip on faults.  At young features, such as mid-ocean ridges axial valleys, sediment is typically only a few meters thick and so cannot be picked up by other shipboard geophysical/seismic imaging tools. These sediment thicknesses, at present, can only be imaged using near-bottom sonars such as those carried by AUVs. Use of these tools is particularly useful at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges where the interplay between low-angle faults, know as detachments, and volcanism remains poorly understood.  Although it is now clear that vast areas of seafloor are created under the influence of detachment faults, the relationships between detachments and magmatism and melt supply remain uncertain.  This project uses already existing CHIRP data, acquired during fourteen dives of AUV Sentry at latitude 16.5N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in 2013. Research goals are to provide new CHIRP processing protocols that can be used to more quickly process CHIRP sonar data and to use the existing data to quantitatively determine variations in sediment thickness and, thus, establish the relative timing of detachment fault slip and volcanism in the study area.  The research adds significant value to an existing dataset that was acquired in an inaccessible part of the deep ocean and will deliver an open-source software tool to the scientific community and the public in a cost-effective way.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mangroves are a predominant vegetation type of tropical and subtropical coasts around the world. They support diverse, highly productive food webs, and provide valuable ecosystem services such as nursery habitat for fishery species, wintering habitat for migratory birds, protection of coastlines from storm surge, and below-ground storage of large stocks of carbon. Despite the considerable value of these ecosystems, mangrove habitats are severely threatened by coastal development, pollution, and conversion to aquaculture. A central goal of this research project is to enhance our ability to predict the responses of mangrove ecosystems to both natural and human-caused disturbances; this knowledge will help guide efforts to restore these highly valuable ecosystems. This goal will be achieved by identifying general mechanisms underlying these ecosystem responses through analyses of data from long-term experimental and observational studies, and from the predictions of a mathematical model of forest dynamics. Information about the rich biology of these systems, and the findings of this and similar studies in the region will be shared with other ecologists, their students, and amateur naturalists in a PI-authored book on the ecology of neotropical mangrove forest communities. This project will also involve undergraduate student assistants, maintaining the investigator's long commitment to training young scientists and guiding them to careers in science.<br/><br/>The first phase of this research will complete comprehensive analyses of data from long-term observational and experimental field investigations of the factors that control the structure and dynamics of the study forests. Forest demography and composition have been documented by monitoring the fates of individually marked trees in six forests plots that were established in 1993. These observational data are complemented by two long-term field experiments, initiated in 1995 and 1999, that test the independent and interactive effects of competition and herbivory on light gap regeneration and the spatial distributions of species along the tidal gradient. The results of these analyses will be synthesized with a spatially-explicit model of mangrove forest dynamics, parameterized with tree demographic data collected from the forest plots and field experiments. Model simulations will predict changes in forest composition and age/spatial structure under a range of environmental scenarios. The final phase of the project will be devoted to designing and writing a photo-illustrated book on the ecology of neotropical mangrove forest communities. It will be the first of its kind for the region. While focusing on the rich biology of these systems and key ecological processes that shape their structure and dynamics, the book will highlight the dire circumstances faced by mangrove ecosystems and discuss approaches to their protection and sustainable management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How fibrous composites fail is not understood either for engineering materials of this type or, of course, for the more complex material in the human spine.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will contribute to our understanding of the mechanical behavior of these complex material composites.  Fiber-reinforced composites provide materials with greater stiffness due to the fibers and large deformations from the softer extrafibrillar matrix. Fiber composites are important in commercial and military applications, but also to understanding the mechanical properties of human bodies. Many body tissues are fibrillar composites. Understanding the mechanical behavior of the material under its working environment and how load is transferred between neighboring tissues is a significant challenge to understanding multiple diseases.  In particular, ""slipped disc"" of the human spine is a failure of the fibrillar composite structure that we don't understand. Traditional material testing techniques require specimens to be removed from their working position, significantly altering the loading environment and boundary conditions. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging provides a noninvasive approach for determining the composition of a spinal disc in a live person without injury.  This project will support fundamental research on how biological tissues change their mechanical properties as a result of changes in composition. The work will be based on magnetic resonance imaging methods because, later, the results of the project can be used in living people as a noninvasive, safe way to assess changes in mechanical behavior of body tissues. The project will help to advance the field of disc mechanics, and the research results should apply to other soft tissues of the body. Outreach to the community includes a plan to enhance STEM engagement for girls based on the Principal Investigator's ongoing efforts in local Oakland, CA and Berkeley, CA K-12 schools. Involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the outreach activities substantially amplifies the impact.<br/><br/>Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging in combination with finite element modeling addresses many limitations with current approaches for understanding the mechanical behavior of composite structures, such as the intervertebral disc. The disc includes a soft gel-like material surrounded by a fiber-reinforced material. Hydration and swelling are important for the mechanical function of the disc and changes with degeneration are known to alter disc composition and mechanics. Changes in tissue composition result in altered residual stresses, tissue anisotropy, and failure mechanics. The disc provides an excellent model for understanding changes in stress distribution between two distinct materials. The research team will use quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to directly measure special changes in water and proteoglycan composition, which will be used to develop a subject-specific computational model that will be validated through joint- and tissue-level experiments. The knowledge gained will be important for 1) understanding changes in soft tissue mechanics with injury and degeneration, 2) developing innovative tools for studying soft material mechanics, and 3) understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern load distributions in complex soft materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet long-standing questions remain regarding how networks of microorganisms work together to accomplish the complete breakdown of organic carbon in marine sediments. Sediment microbes interact in a myriad of ways that couple their metabolism to the break down of organic carbon, including by sharing products of metabolism. Accumulating evidence further suggests that some microorganisms can interact by transferring electrons directly to other unrelated microorganisms. This ability occurs across diverse microorganisms and appears to be widespread in the biosphere, particularly in anaerobic environments such as marine sediments. This project addresses emerging questions about the identity and metabolic linkages between microorganisms that work together in natural anaerobic marine and estuarine sediments to break down organic carbon. The investigators approach these questions by focusing on the influence of a keystone bacterium on its surrounding microbial community. ""Cable bacteria"" are a recently discovered group of long filamentous bacteria that act as electrical conductors in aquatic sediments providing a conduit for electrons to commute from deeper sulfidic sediments up to the surface oxygen layer by the process of centimeter-scale electron transport. Since their discovery about 6 years ago, these bacteria have been observed in a wide range of depositional sedimentary environments, often at extremely high cell densities. Where these bacteria are abundant, such as in coastal marine muds, they drive intense localized changes in pH and strongly influence the mineral cycling. This research explorew the direct and indirect influence of cable bacteria on the metabolic activity of associated microorganisms. This project also advance the education and training of two early-career investigators, two PhD students, and undergraduate students. The skills and expertise gained from these PhD research projects will enable the students to be competitive in academic pursuits and in bioinformatics and technology applications relevant to private industry. The scientific discoveries emerging from this work is being incorporated into undergraduate and graduate level courses in marine microbial ecology. The research team will reach out to the broader community by hosting public lectures promoting a better understanding of environmental microbial ecology. <br/><br/>The proposed work is to investigate the role of cable bacteria in structuring sediment microbial communities. Due to their growth strategy and morphology, cable bacteria are particularly amenable to experimental manipulation, providing an outstanding opportunity to better understand community interactions among microorganisms in a natural and complex anaerobic environment. The investigators will explore the interactions and relationships between cable bacteria and their associated microbial community by manipulating the growth and activity of cable bacteria and quantifying the resultant microbial community response. Specifically, this project aims to (1) identify microorganisms whose growth is enhanced by cable bacteria, (2) identify metabolic processes linked with cable bacteria activity using metatranscriptomics, (3) test specific metabolic links between sediment microorganisms and cable bacteria activity using a DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) approach, and (4) visually confirm the identity and quantify key microorganisms associated with cable bacteria using microscopy. As more is learned about the identity and the mechanisms by which microorganisms are metabolically linked in anoxic sediments, we will be better able to understand and make predictions about how microorganisms function in their environment and how they can be utilized in bioengineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their specialization, individuals in this scenario are adapted to utilize resources in different ways. However, matings between individuals from differently specialized populations are expected to produce intermediate forms that may not be able to survive well in any environment. One solution to this problem is achieved when variation within a species becomes completely associated with variant, or altered, forms of a chromosome. When variant forms of a chromosome contain multiple genes that are inherited as a single unit, this chromosome region is known as a ""supergene"". A growing body of evidence suggests that supergenes play key roles in innovation across the tree of life. Under the influence of a supergene, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta displays two social forms that differ in how many queens inhabit the ant colony and many other individual, colony, and life-history traits. Many of these differences relate to distinct strategies of colony founding by young queens. This research program will assess how variation in diet, nutrition, and supergene presence shape variation in behavior and reproduction in fire ant queens. This will shed new light on supergene origins and function in fire ants, a model for how supergenes can mediate variation in behavior and reproduction in this and other species as well. Broader impacts of the program include partnering with a local high school to offer experiential learning modules and summer research assistantships, integration of resulting data into undergraduate coursework, and providing new insights into the reproductive biology of an economically important invasive species. <br/><br/>This project will explore the extent to which gene expression differences between queens of alternate social forms in Solenopsis invicta reflect convergence with nutritional plasticity, and thus implicate genetic accommodation. In other words, the research will test the hypothesis that a nutritional ground plan played a key role in the origin of queen polymorphism (and, hence, colony social polymorphism) in S. invicta. This work will provide important insights into the proximal basis of queen polymorphism (i) by decoupling gene expression differences due to variation in nutrition and supergene genotype in individual tissues of S. invicta and (ii) by decoupling the effects of queen genotype (endogenous genetic effects) and colony worker genotypes (indirect social genetic effects) on the mediation of queen polymorphism. Taken together, this work will greatly improve our understanding of how phenotypic plasticity and supergenes mediate a complex behavioral polymorphism important in ant social evolution. Broader impacts of the research program include providing fundamental new information on the genomic and epigenomic factors that regulate the reproductive biology of an important invasive pest species, partnering with a local high school biology teacher to develop new experiential learning modules and to provide summer research assistantships for students in the investigator's laboratories, and integrating the data generated by the project into undergraduate coursework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically, thin-film stability is desirable, such as in the application of coating materials.  However, controlled dewetting or thin-film rupture can also be beneficial, for example in printing and other lithographic processes. Most of the existing studies have involved nonvolatile and nonpolar thin films. The stability of polymer thin films prepared from a volatile and polar liquid, such as water, has practical and fundamental significance and should be investigated. This research involves the fabrication of thin films of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH), a water-soluble and non-toxic polymer, on silicone-coated silicon substrates using a new method called adsorptive spin casting. This method allows the spontaneous adherence of PVOH polymer to the silicone surfaces from water as well as the controlled rupture of PVOH thin films due to directional water evaporation. The study will systematically investigate under- or unexplored areas in polymer thin film stability, such as the (de)stabilization effect of a polar solvent, unconventional thin-film rupture patterns, and the effects of substrate mobility and polarity. As an educator and a female scientist in the longest-standing liberal arts college for women, the PI is committed to improving the representation and retention of women in the STEM disciplines. She will recruit and mentor a diverse group of undergraduate women to carry out new, relevant, publishable, and productive research proposed herein.

Studies of polymer thin films prepared from aqueous solution have been limited due to the particular challenges involved in elucidating the effects of drying dynamics and solvent polarity on thin-film stability. In the proposed research, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) thin-film dewetting on silicon wafer-supported polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) will be studied using a new fabrication method, adsorptive spin casting. This method combines the spontaneous adsorption of PVOH at the PDMS-solution interface and the generation of ordered PVOH dewetting patterns by directional drying. PVOH is chosen because of its tunable crystallinity which will allow the study of a range of dewetting morphologies, from conventional droplets to structures with unique fractal features. Silicon wafer-supported PDMS is the substrate of choice since it will permit the probing of substrate mobility and polarity. The novelties of the research include the design of a new polymer thin-film fabrication method and the systematic exploration of relevant yet under-explored areas in polymer thin-film stability.

Computational modeling of DTES can reveal the hidden event evolving mechanisms and improve the performance of endpoint analytical tasks such as sequence forecasting and grouping. Conventional approaches for analyzing DTES are typically based on strong statistical assumptions and may not work well in practice. Motivated by the recent empirical success of deep learning methods in various application domains, the objective of this project is to develop interpretable deep learning approaches for modeling DTES. This project validates the utility of the developed algorithms in various medical applications. It incorporates the resulting research outcomes into curriculum development and courses, to train a new generation of machine learning and data mining practitioners. In addition, special training opportunities are provided to high school students and community college students for a broader education of modern data analysis techniques.<br/><br/>This project consists of three synergistic research thrusts. First, it develops a series of approaches for integrating external domain knowledge into the modeling process. This guarantees the learned models align well with the domain knowledge and at the same time provides effective regularizations to avoid overfitting. Second, it devises approaches based on mimic learning and pattern dissection to interpret the knowledge hidden in the learned models. This makes the learned models much more practical and reusable. Third, effective model and data sharing mechanisms are developed to transfer the knowledge across similar learning tasks. This maximizes the utilizations of the available samples for each task by leveraging the task relationships. Two key problems in medical domain, hospital readmission and disease phenotyping, are used as the target applications for validating the proposed approaches based on several real-world large-scale patient electronic health record data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The knowledge and new computer modeling tools could also be used to understand how other soft tissues containing elastic fibers such as the lungs, blood vessels, skin, and the digestive system change as the result of applied mechanical pressure. Research findings from this project will be incorporated into a mobile telephone game, teaching modules for K-12 education and into undergraduate and graduate biomedical engineering courses.<br/><br/>An experimentally-validated computational model will be used to determine why and how elastic fibers influence mechanobiological adaptations in biological tissues. This will be accomplished by: 1) Determining the role of elastic fibers in evolving biaxial mechanical properties and contractility in cervovaginal tissue in response to altered loads in situ using a mechanical loading tissue culture system; 2) Formulating a biomechanical growth and remodeling model that describes cervovaginal mechanical properties, contractility, and extracellular matrix composition with and without compromised elastic fibers; and 3) Validating the model by predicting the key features of cervovaginal adaptations in response to altered mechanical loading.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include biological soft-tissue replacement materials such as those found in the meniscus of the knee or the intervertebral disc of the spine, separation membranes for selective removal of chemical or biological contaminants, durable and rapid ion-transport membranes for battery technology, and materials designed to provide long-term impact protection (military, athletics) while retaining high elastic flexibility.  Reduction to practice, however, has been plagued by materials with limited ability to meet the mechanical demands required of such applications, being subject to rapid decay in elasticity and susceptibility to failure by fracture. This project is focused on using a new paradigm in swollen elastomer network design to create mechanically robust polymers capable of sustaining repetitive stress dissipation without fatigue while suppressing susceptibility to fracture and failure needed to ensure long-term performance.  The scientific advancement efforts in the project will be integrated with interdisciplinary education of students.  It will also be accompanied by development of workshops aimed at building collaborations among top soft-matter synthesis and mechanics groups around the world, in an effort to push the frontiers of science, explore new ideas, and accelerate the untapped potential of these unique polymeric materials. The workshops importantly will provide a forum to encourage talented, yet underrepresented young researchers, and provide them access to and mentorship from leading materials researchers in the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Creative efforts in polymer network design over the last decade have led to numerous impactful improvements in hydrogel mechanics. Notable examples include both highly elastic hydrogel networks in which fatigue is minimal but very little energy is dissipated, and highly dissipative hydrogel networks in which toughness is maximized but fatigue is rapid and recovery is subject to long recovery times (minutes to days). Effective integration of both dissipative capabilities and efficient elastic recovery, however, appears limited using current design strategies. The principal objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the ability of junction point morphology (nanostructure) and strand-level organizational control to maximize non-plastic energy dissipation, recovery rate, and fatigue resistance simultaneously in swollen polymer networks. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that synthetic integration of non-bond rupturing dissipative interactions into every molecular strand of the network, combined with implicit coupling of the dissipation mechanism to its own driving force for elastic recovery, will add substantial dissipative capability without sacrificing the rapid elastic recovery or the exceptional fatigue resistance. The project involves the synthetic development of uniquely designed ABC and ABCBA block copolymers which upon heating self-assemble into highly efficient network structures based on core-shell sphere morphologies. The objectives are to explore the ability of the B block domain size and degree of hydrophobicity to successfully tune the magnitude of dissipated energy (e.g., through measurement of fracture toughness) and understand its dependence on strain and strain rate. If successful, this project will transform our access to hydrogel materials that exhibit both fatigue resistance and toughness (bulk and fracture), at rates of recovery far exceeding the most advanced hydrogel systems developed to date.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet long-standing questions remain regarding how networks of microorganisms work together to accomplish the complete breakdown of organic carbon in marine sediments. Sediment microbes interact in a myriad of ways that couple their metabolism to the break down of organic carbon, including by sharing products of metabolism. Accumulating evidence further suggests that some microorganisms can interact by transferring electrons directly to other unrelated microorganisms. This ability occurs across diverse microorganisms and appears to be widespread in the biosphere, particularly in anaerobic environments such as marine sediments. This project addresses emerging questions about the identity and metabolic linkages between microorganisms that work together in natural anaerobic marine and estuarine sediments to break down organic carbon. The investigators approach these questions by focussing on the influence of a keystone bacterium on its surrounding microbial community. ""Cable bacteria"" are a recently discovered group of long filamentous bacteria that act as electrical conductors in aquatic sediments providing a conduit for electrons to commute from deeper sulfidic sediments up to the surface oxygen layer by the process of centimeter-scale electron transport. Since their discovery about 6 years ago, these bacteria have been observed in a wide range of depositional sedimentary environments, often at extremely high cell densities. Where these bacteria are abundant, such as in coastal marine muds, they drive intense localized changes in pH and strongly influence the mineral cycling. This research explorew the direct and indirect influence of cable bacteria on the metabolic activity of associated microorganisms. This project also advance the education and training of two early-career investigators, two PhD students, and undergraduate students. The skills and expertise gained from these PhD research projects will enable the students to be competitive in academic pursuits and in bioinformatics and technology applications relevant to private industry. The scientific discoveries emerging from this work is being incorporated into undergraduate and graduate level courses in marine microbial ecology. The research team will reach out to the broader community by hosting public lectures promoting a better understanding of environmental microbial ecology. <br/><br/>The proposed work is to investigate the role of cable bacteria in structuring sediment microbial communities. Due to their growth strategy and morphology, cable bacteria are particularly amenable to experimental manipulation, providing an outstanding opportunity to better understand community interactions among microorganisms in a natural and complex anaerobic environment. The investigators will explore the interactions and relationships between cable bacteria and their associated microbial community by manipulating the growth and activity of cable bacteria and quantifying the resultant microbial community response. Specifically, this project aims to (1) identify microorganisms whose growth is enhanced by cable bacteria, (2) identify metabolic processes linked with cable bacteria activity using metatranscriptomics, (3) test specific metabolic links between sediment microorganisms and cable bacteria activity using a DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) approach, and (4) visually confirm the identity and quantify key microorganisms associated with cable bacteria using microscopy. As more is learned about the identity and the mechanisms by which microorganisms are metabolically linked in anoxic sediments, we will be better able to understand and make predictions about how microorganisms function in their environment and how they can be utilized in bioengineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These algorithms are used, for example, to send data to mobile devices and to simulate fire and water in movies. Many of the most classical algorithms, and particularly those with applications in linear algebra, have been extremely useful for decades, if not centuries. Yet, some of these algorithms are poorly understood -- they can fail catastrophically, but rarely do. In other words, the worst-case behavior is poor, but the average-case behavior is good. This research will advance the understanding of this phenomenon by employing techniques from the ever-expanding field of random matrix theory (RMT). In turn, this research gives rise to new questions within RMT. A substantial feature of this project is the extensive educational component that integrates research and education. This integration is achieved via a three-pronged approach including a summer workshop on random matrices, high school engagement, and undergraduate/graduate student mentoring.<br/><br/>Two natural ways to employ RMT within numerical linear algebra also coincide with the two most common themes in numerical linear algebra: Algorithm analysis and algorithm development. For example, remarkably detailed estimates from RMT such as rigidity and edge universality have found concrete applications within numerical linear algebra giving average-case performance for the classical power method. Randomized algorithms have found great utility in the big-data age. This research will employ both of these themes with applications to data science, psychology and beyond.

It serves as a ``gatekeeper'' for waters intruding onto the Antarctic continental shelf, such as the warm Circumpolar Deep Water that supplies heat to melt the bases of Antarctica's ice shelves, and for waters escaping the continental shelf, such as the dense water outflows that fill more than one-third of the global sub-surface ocean. A series of high-resolution numerical ocean simulations will be conducted to assess whether past and ongoing regional models and observational campaigns are capturing the ``hot spots'' of heat transport toward the continent, and identify which small-scale/high-frequency processes must be resolved to capture this heat transport. The educational component will substantially broaden participation of undergraduates in oceanography by combining field trips and research-based exercises which have been shown to increase student learning and retention compared to conventional teaching methods. The educational initiative will engage hundreds of undergraduate students per year in research cruises to the local continental shelf and slope off the coast of California. A captain/technician will be recruited to facilitate dozens of cruises annually using the UCLA Zodiac research vessel. The project investigator will develop organizational and educational materials to support the research cruises, with students guided to form their own research hypotheses and analyzing their own data using scientific computing tools. By the end of the project period this educational program will become self-sustaining, drawing from a combination of course fees, research/education grants, donations and direct support from UCLA. The project will also provide research training for a graduate student and support for an early-career faculty member.<br/><br/>Practical constraints imposed by Antarctica's climate and the small scales of variability have limited previous quantification of cross-slope exchange processes to localized regions. There remains a substantial gap in understanding how continental-scale exchanges of water between the open ocean and the shelf seas are modulated by seasonal variability in atmospheric conditions, hetereogenous bathymetry, and small-scale/high-frequency sources of variability such as eddies, tides, overflows and topographic waves. The project investigator proposes to close this gap in understanding by developing the first ocean/sea ice model simulations of the entire Antarctic margins, including the ocean beneath the floating ice shelves, that can resolve small-scale variability and tides. Using analysis techniques based on multiple separation of time scales, the cross-slope exchanges of mass and properties will be quantified and thereby identify regimes in which the Antarctic Slope Front serves as a ``barrier'' vs. a ``blender''. The same framework will then be used to diagnose the dynamics of the Antarctic Slope Current, for example the energy and vorticity budgets, to distinguish the relative roles of atmospheric forcing, bathymetric steering and small-scale variability in localizing exchanges across the Antarctic Slope Front. Finally, idealized process models will be constructed to explore specific hypotheses derived from the circum-Antarctic model simulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emerging chips integrate different types of processor cores, which are specialized for various functions including graphics processing and pattern recognition.  Availability of many cores creates a task scheduling problem for a software program, namely which portions of the software should execute on what type of core. Given that the capabilities of the cores are not equal, a task may take different amounts of time to finish depending on which core it was assigned to.  In a real-time system, while mapping tasks to cores, deadlines should be met, which may not always be possible. Further, the consequences of missing a deadline are not the same for all tasks. Some are more forgiving than others. Consequently, tasks can be classified broadly based on their criticality. This research will investigate an efficient scheduler for mixed-criticality real-time systems.  <br/><br/>In a resource constrained system, consequences of failure to meet a deadline may range from catastrophic to Minor. Consequently, there are varying penalties associated with missing deadlines. The investigator plans to address the scheduling problem of mixed-criticality real-time systems. This scheduling problem is NP-hard; the proposed approach involves an artificial neural network (NN)-based scheduler.  The investigator will experiment with parallel NNs for faster convergence, and develop a prototype system to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of this solution.

However, developing such systems is challenging. System developers must account for the differences in users and hardware platforms, and anticipate how a system will respond to the changing operating conditions. For example, a hearing aid may use its onboard processor to augment speech in relatively quiet surroundings but rely on more powerful cloud computing resources to enhance speech as users encounters more noisy environments. Today, developers lack effective programming languages and tools to help them create and improve such IoT systems.<br/><br/>This project investigates how adaptive IoT systems may be developed using policy-driven software adaptation and synthesis.  Central to our approach is to separate the functionality of a system (encapsulated in software components) from its run-time adaptation (specified as a policy).  Developers will be provided with a language to write policies that control when components are executed, their concurrency, and dynamically selects which alternate component implementation should be used. The policy language will be combined with data-driven techniques that integrate simulation, program analysis, and machine learning techniques to configure the parameters of a policy as well as synthesize new policies.<br/><br/>The research undertaken as part of this proposal will provide a solid foundation for building adaptive IoT systems.

Drawing upon this evidence to make decisions or inform policies therefore requires perusing relevant articles and manually extracting the findings of interest. Unfortunately, this process is time-consuming and has not scaled to meet the demands imposed by the torrential expansion of the scientific evidence base. This work seeks to design novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that can automatically ""read"" and make sense of unstructured published scientific evidence. This is critically important because decisions by policy-makers, care-givers and individuals should be informed by the entirety of the relevant published scientific evidence; but because evidence is predominantly unstructured -- and hence not directly actionable -- this is currently impossible in practice. Consider clinical medicine, an important example which serves as the target domain of this proposal (although the framework and models will generalize to other scientific areas). Roughly 100 articles describing trials were published every single day in 2015. Healthcare professionals cannot possibly make sense of this, and thus treatment decisions must be made without full consideration of the available evidence. Methods that can automatically infer from this torrential mass of unstructured literature which treatments are actually supported by the evidence would facilitate better, evidence-based decisions. Toward this end, this research seeks to design NLP models capable of mapping from natural language scientific articles describing studies or trials to structured ""evidence frames"" that codify the interventions and outcomes studied, and the reported findings concerning these. NLP technology is not presently up to this task. Therefore, this project will support core methodological contributions that will advance systems for data extraction and machine reading of lengthy articles; these will have impact beyond the present motivating application. <br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the focus of this work concerns developing novel, interpretable (transparent) neural network models for extraction from and inference over lengthy articles. Specifically, this project aims to design models that can automatically identify treatments and associated outcomes from free-texts, and then infer the reported comparative effects of the former with respect to the latter. This pushes against limits of existing language technology capabilities. In particular, this necessitates models that perform deep analysis of individual, potentially lengthy, technical documents. Furthermore, model transparency is critical here, as domain experts must be able to recover from where in documents evidential claims were inferred. New corpora curated for this project (to be shared with the broader community) will facilitate core NLP research on such models. To realize the aforementioned methodological aims, the researchers leading this project will develop conditional and dynamic ""attentive"" neural models. Specific methodological lines of research to be explored include: (i) Models equipped with conditional, sparse attention mechanisms over textual units that reflect scientific discourse structure to achieve accurate and transparent extraction of, and inference concerning, reported evidence. (ii) Neural sequence tagging models that take multiple 'reads' of a text, exploiting iteratively adjusted conditional document representations as global context to inform local predictions.

Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute (HBOI) at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) has a long history of exploring the ocean biodiversity. These efforts have produced a unique collection of specimens designated as the Marine Biotechnology Reference Collection (MBRC). The MBRC is a taxonomically and geographically diverse collection of more than 31,500 preserved benthic marine invertebrates and macroalgae (seaweeds). This collection is unique in that nearly 30% of the samples were selectively collected by the manned Johnson-Sea-Link submersibles at depths of more than 150 m, from locations that are otherwise difficult to access by trawling or dredging due to rugged topography or reef habitats. Collection by submersible means that these specimens are relatively intact compared to those traditionally collected with trawl or dredge. This collection is also unique in that it includes in situ photographs and videotapes.  Collections that were made over a period of 30 years or more provides an opportunity to study changes over time. Research on the specimens, data, images, and videos has already contributed to a better understanding of evolutionary biology, ecology, characterization of marine habitats, and resource management, and has been vital to HBOI's drug discovery program. A goal of this project is to provide the scientific community access to these unique samples and accompanying data. The excellent condition of the specimens makes them useful for molecular analyses, and the videos provide important data to characterize poorly known marine habitats, some of which support commercially and recreationally important fish and invertebrate species.   <br/><br/>An outcome of the project will be a web-accessible version of the collection database, including photos and annotated video clips, for use by researchers, students and the general public worldwide. The collection consists of a complete set of fully digitized dive logs and specimen photographs and thousands of hours of video recordings. Collection data will be verified for accuracy.  Specimens will be barcode labeled for ease in accessing; they are currently organized by collection date in a temperature-controlled environment.  Digitized videotapes will be annotated and linked to the specimen database.  Links to the specimen database will ensure that the complete set of data - specimens, field notes, collection data, photographic images, and videos - can be made publicly available on-line.  Results of this project will be shared and made available to researchers, resource managers, students, and the public through the HBOI-FAU website and through iDigBio.

It is expected that a group of two students will work on each project. The projects are accessible to undergraduate students and, at the same time, are contemporary research problems with potentially novel solutions that can lead to publications. In addition, the program will emphasize the training of students in the fundamentals of conducting research. In line with this goal, weekly professional development seminars will be conducted on subjects such as abstract writing, research ethics and presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The activities of genes direct the formation of tissues and organs but the proper shape, structure, and mechanical properties of the tissues are also guided by internal and external loading during development. It is known that abnormal tissue properties occur along with birth defects and cancer, but the extent that the abnormalities are genetic or occur from aberrant mechanical loads isn't known.  It remains poorly understood how the mechanical and genetic factors work together to build normal tissues. The research will build an improved understanding of the underlying causes of birth defects and cancer by separating genetic from mechanical effects in tissue development.  The work is an essential step toward the development of therapies to prevent or treat these diseases. The novel tools to control genetic expression and internal cell loading may also enable new strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, contributing to the progress of science and to the advancement of national health. The educational goal is to engage students from a variety of backgrounds in research. Ihe research will be integrated into: (1)opportunities for underrepresented minority high school students through the Columbia Engineering E.N.G. program; (2) career development and summer research mentoring for undergraduate women through the Columbia Engineering Summer@SEAS Program; and (3)a new course on Morphogenesis: shape and structure in biological materials aimed at introducing upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering students to research at the interface between mechanics and biology.<br/><br/>The project will study several mechanics-based questions about the construction of tissues and organs, specifically how actomyosin-based tension is transduced through cadherin-based cell-cell contacts to regulate epithelial tissue morphogenesis. Three objectives are planned and include: (1) testing how tissue structure is controlled by forces, (2) determining the cellular rearrangements that drive cell shape changes, and (3) studying how these changes affect tissue mechanics.  The research will advance fundamental understanding of how mechanical factors couple with biological factors to build and shape living tissues, filling a gap in our understanding of the role that mechanics plays in translating genotype to phenotype during development. The research will utilize the model organism Drosophila melanogaster and combine biomechanical and confocal imaging studies with systematic optogenetic manipulation of cellular force generation and mechanics in order to determine how tension generated by cellular actomyosin contractility and adhesion mediated by E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts control epithelial tissue shape, structure, and mechanics during embryonic development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In healthy cells, many chemical reactions take place all the time.  Scientists think of these reactions as forming a network, like a wiring diagram, with connecting wires describing the movement of nutrients and metabolites through a cell's chemical reactions.  Knowing the entire wiring diagram is not necessary for understanding the fate of individual nutrients, but the many interconnected circuits make it difficult to isolate only the part of the diagram important for certain activities, such as maintaining iron levels. This research will use mathematical techniques (specifically, algebraic geometry and dynamical systems) to find the simplest components in a reaction network that allow a cell to exhibit observed behaviors.  Results will be tested using laboratory observations of how yeast cells manage and transport iron.  Complementing the research projects will be educational activities centered around a Directed Reading Program in which undergraduate students will gain experience reading and presenting mathematics with the help of graduate-student mentors.<br/><br/>The dynamics observed in living systems is much more than the sum of its parts.  Systems biology, therefore, seeks to understand how biological components come together to generate emergent, systems-level behavior.  A current bottleneck in systems biology is the lack of mathematical theory relating system structure to emergent behavior.  Accordingly, this project will develop a theory of reaction systems tailored to biological networks.  The investigator will build on her recent work that has helped clarify how bistability and other phenomena emerge in real-life systems.  The aims here are to discover new criteria for multistationarity in reaction systems, and to answer the question of when Hopf bifurcations are preserved when new components are added to a network.  These results will be used to answer important biological questions pertaining to how cells process information and how iron levels are maintained within cells.  Specifically, the aims are to investigate the capacity for bistability and oscillations in phosphorylation networks, and to determine which components of iron-trafficking networks keep cellular-iron levels tightly regulated.

One class of these is shape-shifting materials that have the capacity to alter their shape in a desired manner.  Such shape-shifting materials have the potential for implementation in the fields of artificial muscles, soft robotics, self-deploying devices, smart windows, self-healing materials, adhesives, and many other areas.  The materials developed here combine the benefits of (a) liquid crystalline elastomers (which are highly deformable polymeric materials that reversibly change shape upon heating) and (b)light-activated chemical changes in the material that enable it to be reshaped, healed, and realigned at will.  The overall scope of the project seeks to understand the underlying relationships between the molecular structure of the materials and their remarkable properties and performance, and subsequently use that knowledge to design improved approaches and molecular structures for such smart materials.   In addition to advances in technology, this project will also contribute to the development of a ""bootcamp"" in the recently formed PhD degree program in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Colorado with the express goal of bringing in students from diverse backgrounds that would not otherwise consider or be ready to enter a PhD program in materials science.  This program aims to recruit and train diverse personnel, comprising a large number of undergraduate and graduate students, in a powerful combination of chemical synthesis, materials science, and polymer chemistry.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Programming fully reversible, shape-shifting polymers presents a special challenge despite a large amount of promising work in this area. Liquid crystalline networks (LCNs) represent one of the most capable polymeric materials because they offer thermoreversible strain, programmable simply by directing molecular-scale alignment. Although the polymer network enables the translation of molecular order to shape, it is also inherently limiting when trying to program new or complex alignment. Here, light will be used as a stimulus for radical-mediated addition-fragmentation chain transfer (AFT) that causes a cascading dynamic covalent-bond exchange reaction to occur within the network.  Using this chemistry, readily reprogrammable shape-shifting materials will be explored with independent control over the LC phase shape, disordered shape, and the switching temperature.  <br/> 	The overall objective of this work is to further the understanding, accessibility, and implementation of AFT-based LCNs through chemical design in coordination with programming conditions to develop versatile, readily reprogrammable shape-shifting materials.  This work will focus on fundamental understanding of these smart materials and their design at both the macro- and nano-scale, including: i) determining fundamental formation-structure-property-programming relationships that will be used to develop a library of photopolymerizable, programmable LCNs,  ii) combining disparate material compositions, alignments and structures in macroscale materials to understand the impact of interfaces and gradients in composition and structure on the material actuation and response, and   iii) forming nano-scale structures through imprinting and holography to determine and understand the effects of feature size as compared to LC domain size on the bond-exchange process, its effectiveness, and the LC alignment. Each scientific direction is coupled to education and training of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Why does ECS remain stubbornly segregated when it comes to gender parity? The goal of this CAREER project is to use ethnography to compare subfields of ECS in which women have different levels of participation. It investigates the relationship between cultural values, norms and practices that 1) presume practitioners from dominant groups are more competent than practitioners from underrepresented groups; and 2) privilege the technical dimensions of computing over the social ones. The uneven participation of women across ECS subfields suggests that subfield cultural values and norms vary. To examine this variation, this project focuses primarily on the experiences of female faculty members because they are a critical population that shape the next generation of ECS practitioners, have a long-standing relationships with their disciplinary subfields, and may have experiences that could lend critical insights into the social/technical divide. The project's findings articulate and forge pathways toward broadening participation in ECS because they inform learning modules and course curricula to educate students, faculty, and leaders in academia about the benefits of diversity and transformations required to foster welcoming environments for women to participate in ECS with equal opportunities, resources and regard. Due to the prominence and impact of ECS, identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identities. Harnessing the power of diversity in this way will positively contribute to all domains on which computing impinges.<br/><br/>This CAREER project is a comparative analysis of the impact of subfield culture on women's representation in ECS. It deconstructs theoretical assumptions undergirding ECS practices to understand how complex, intersectional biases disenfranchise women from the field. To yield new knowledge useful in efforts to broaden participation, this CAREER project systematically conceptualizes how labor segregation may relate to an ideological hierarchy between the social and technical dimensions of computing and influence cultural exclusions along intersecting vectors of gender and race. Using a theory-driven, interdisciplinary research approach that integrates gender and racial equity research, anthropology and science and technology studies, this CAREER project works to: 1) Develop and refine a theoretical model of change in ECS to combat the covert and overt mechanisms that marginalize women; 2) Describe and analyze epistemic bias emerging from ideologies that consider empirical data superior to qualitative data and trivialize socially applied research in ECS; 3) Identify and assess elements of culture in ECS that reproduce or challenge inequitable power relations; 4) Describe women's differential experiences in ECS subfields along vectors of race, ethnicity, and gender identity; 5) Develop and analyze educational interventions into ECS culture that spring from an original method integrating ethnography and case study methods to both interrupt the reproduction of dominant class rule and to study the beliefs and power relations of computing communities. Not only does this project contribute a novel qualitative theory of cultural change in ECS, it also tests innovative methods to better elucidate who and what counts in the field and why. Further, it creates highly adaptable and sustainable techniques that provide opportunities for engineers to practice recognizing and responding to bias in social dynamics and articulating means of institutional change in communion with their peers. Finally, this project provides much needed anthropological theory to the problem of women's underrepresentation in ECS to advance inclusive educational practices that support and capitalize on the aptitudes of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polyelectrolytes with opposite charges associate with each other, yielding versatile, soft solids suited for use as adhesives, medical dressings, membranes for purification, carriers for controlled drug release, and scaffolds for cell culture. These so-called ""polyelectrolyte complexes"" have also been discovered as membrane-less organelles within cells. Despite the promise and prevalence of polyelectrolyte complexes, it is not known why some combinations of polyelectrolytes make strong, rubbery materials while other combinations produce viscous fluids. This project will investigate broadly the fundamental relationships between the composition of individual polyelectrolytes and the properties of the hydrated complexes they form. This understanding will guide the design and application of known and new materials for new technologies. An emphasis on chemistry student education and training, including broadening participation in STEM, will expose participants to the latest ideas, techniques and problem-solving tools to better serve the flourishing polymers industry. Student participation in high-value video tutorials on aspects of polyelectrolytes will reach a broad audience of scientists and will help build professional presentation skills of young trainees involved. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>A number of interesting and useful amorphous phases spontaneously assemble when polyelectrolytes of opposite charge, Pol+ and Pol-, are mixed. However, little is known concerning why different combinations of Pol+ and Pol- have substantially different association strengths. This work will quantitatively and systematically probe the dependence of Pol+/Pol- association on ""hydrophobicity,"" or water content. Using robust synthetic methods, a series of increasingly hydrophobic cationic and anionic polymers will be prepared and complexed. The free energy of association will be determined by measuring, using sensitive radioisotope or spectroscopic methods, how easily Pol+Pol- ion pairs are broken by the addition of salt. At the same time, the amount of water in the complex will be determined with infrared spectroscopy. The results will correlate the strength of association to water content and number of methylene units added to enhance hydrophobicity. Complex formation between charged polypeptides will reveal the association strength of an ion pair or ""salt bridge"" formed between two amino acids. The fundamental insights resulting from the project will also impact the biological/health field since charged segment pairing of proteins is essential in protein folding (or misfolding). In a final thrust on polyelectrolyte interactions, the pairing strength between a polyelectrolyte and a nanoparticle of defined surface composition will be measured. The exceptional educational resources available at Florida State University's GEOSET studios will be employed to enhance the professional development of undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduates, in particular women chemists, will be recruited through the University's undergrad research program and will be mentored in science and presentation skills. Building on previous successes within the research group, graduate students will collaborate to produce several informative, competitive, well-edited educational videos on polyelectrolytes and polyelectrolyte complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These hybrid metal-ceramic materials form layers on the atomistic scale, much like pieces of paper stacked together, which allows the layers to locally kink instead of crack under load.  This kinking behavior has only recently been discovered, yet if understood, has the potential to provide tougher, lighter and more damage-tolerant materials for our nation's aging energy, communication and transportation systems.  As a result, MAX phases will be investigated with varying stacking sequences and layer orientations across a variety of real-world loading conditions, including impact, and dynamic fatigue and fracture.  In addition, experimental techniques utilizing cutting edge high-speed imaging coupled with surface acceleration mapping under these complex-loading scenarios will be performed, that are able to extract more material behavior information than classical techniques.  These findings will provide meaningful input for predictive computational models in structural design leveraging MAX phases, as well as other similar advanced materials. This work brings together multidisciplinary efforts in materials science, and applied and theoretical mechanics. Novel means to reach untapped local communities at all ages will be enabled through a dance-mechanics education and outreach program. The research and outreach components highlight the innate creativity and correlations involved in both, and aims to inspire the next generation of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) enthusiasts.  <br/><br/>This research focuses on an emerging class of materials, MAX phases, a family of layered hexagonal early transition-metal carbides and nitrides.  These materials exhibit a newly classified defect deformation mechanism termed ripplocations, a nanoscale buckling phenomena, which accommodates strain in a different manner than dislocation motion in plasticity or bond rupture in fracture, and leads to the formation of nonlinear kind bands (NKB) under load.  While a notable portion of the materials science community is examining these 3D layered solids, relatively little research exists pursuing their behavior on the meso- to continuum level.  This effort aims to fill that gap through three highly integrated experimental research foci.  The first characterizes deformation behavior varying strain rate and stress states, as well as layer orientation and stacking sequences, utilizing nonlinear buckling theory to determine the driving parameters in NKB formation. The second quantifies crack tip energetics in dynamic fracture leveraging a hybrid experimental-numerical scheme, as well as explores impact fatigue, extending the classic Paris Law for temporal effects.  The third pursues damage behavior, conducting inertial impact experiments exploiting the Grid Method and the Virtual Fields Method, an emerging inverse technique. The extensive investigations on MAX phases will shed light on competing ductile, pseudo-ductile and brittle deformation mechanisms across length and time scales, thus making a significant contribution towards systemically capturing, understanding and optimizing these unique layered solids. More broadly, the findings will help understand how anisotropic materials accommodate strain under complex loading conditions, and paves the way for specifically textured (defect engineered), functionally graded, and/or hierarchical material design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this challenge, discovering and understanding the properties of high thermal conductivity materials that can efficiently dissipate heat from hot spots and improve the performance of devices constitute an urgent need. This CAREER project aims to investigate new high thermal conductivity materials and understand the fundamental transport phenomena and mechanisms associated with the chemistry and structures of such materials. The PI is using complementary approaches, including multiscale modeling, advanced synthesis and characterization methods.

The research components of this project are closely integrated with various education and outreach activities, offering cross-disciplinary training beyond traditional educational boundaries, and involving the participation of underrepresented and diversity groups. This is accomplished through industry-academia collaborations, development of a new interdisciplinary course curriculum, and establishment of a Nano-Energy outreach program.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The principal investigator and his research team are investigating a new class of high thermal conductivity materials (such as BAs, BP, GeC) to address the critical challenge of heat dissipation in modern electronics and photonics. Some of these unique materials have been predicted recently by ab initio theory to have ultrahigh thermal conductivity, over 1000 W/mK, enabled by multiple factors, including a large mass ratio of the constitutive atoms, acoustic bunching, and isotopic purity. This CAREER project aims to experimentally realize these high thermal conductivity materials through a synergistic growth-measurement-model approach to investigate the optimum growth conditions, structural and thermal properties, and phonon transport mechanisms. The team develops new characterization tools, including advanced phonon spectral mapping spectroscopy based on the time-domain thermoreflectance technique, and advanced atomic-level material structural control methods, to establish detailed structure-property relationships with microscale quantification. Experimental measurement results including phonon mean free path spectra are analyzed using atomistic density functional theory and multiscale Boltzmann transport equations solved by Monte Carlo simulations. Completion of this project may lead to transformative technological innovations for advancing the performance and energy-efficiency of future electronics and photonics.

It was submitted to the Discovery Research K-12 program, which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. The goal of this study will be to improve elementary science teaching and learning by developing, testing, and refining a framework and set of tools for strategically incorporating forms of uncertainty central to scientists' sense-making into students' empirical learning. The framework will rest on the notion that productive uncertainty should be carefully built into students' empirical learning experiences in order to support their engagement in scientific practices and understanding of disciplinary ideas. To re-conceptualize the role of empirical investigations, the study will focus on the transitions between the experiences and processes students seek to understand, classroom investigations, evidence, and explanatory models as opportunities for sense-making, and how uncertainty can be built into these transitions. The project's underlying assumption is that carefully implementing these forms of uncertainty will help curriculum developers and teachers avoid the oversimplified investigations that are prevalent in K-8 classrooms that stand in stark contrast to authentic science learning and the recommendations of the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council, 2012). Accordingly, the project will seek to develop curriculum design guidelines, teacher tools, professional development supports, and four elaborated investigations, including sets of lessons, videos, and assessments that embed productive uncertainty for second and fifth graders and designed for use with linguistically, culturally, and socio-economically diverse students. <br/><br/>The hypothesis of this work is that if specific forms of scientific uncertainty are carefully selected, and if teachers can implement these forms of uncertainty, elementary students will have more robust opportunities to develop disciplinary practices and ideas in ways consistent with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (Lead States, 2013). Employing Design-Based Research, the three research questions will be: (1) What opportunities for sense-making do elementary school empirical investigations afford where we might strategically build uncertainty?; (2) How can we design learning environments where uncertainty in empirical investigations supports opportunities for learning?; and (3) In classrooms with sustained opportunities to engage with uncertainty in empirical investigations, what progress do students make in content understandings and the practices of argumentation, explanation, and investigation? The work will consist of three design cycles: Design Cycle 1 will involve two small groups of six teachers in adapting their curricula to incorporate uncertainty, then describe how students engage around uncertainty in empirical investigations. Design Cycle 2 will involve the same small groups in implementing and refining task structures, tools, and teacher instructional strategies. In Design Cycle 3, teachers and researchers will further refine lesson materials, assessments, and supports. The project will partner with one school district and engage in design research with groups of teachers to develop: (1) a research-based description, with exemplars of opportunities for student sense-making within empirical investigations at both early and upper elementary grades; (2) a set of design principles and tools that allow teachers to elicit and capitalize on sense-making about uncertainty in investigations; and (3) four elementary investigations elaborated to incorporate and exemplify the first two products above. These materials will be disseminated through a website, and established networks for supporting implementation of the NGSS. An advisory board will oversee project progress and conduct both formative and summative evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Normally, charged polymers are very flexible and do not have strong mechanical properties.  This project involves a solid material formed from a mixture of a very rigid and strong charged polymer (similar to Kevlar(R)) and an ionic liquid (also known as a molten salt).  This new material, which is called a molecular ionic composite (MIC), combines the best properties of solids and liquids.  MIC materials are stiff and non-flammable solids and yet they can conduct ions like lithium and sodium with very low resistance, as if the ions were in a liquid.  The properties of MICs can also be widely tailored for potential use in different applications such as water purifiers, electromechanical sensors, or artificial muscles.  This project will combine cutting edge research tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray analyses, materials science theories, and computational molecular simulations in order to build fundamental understanding of how MIC materials work.  By combining such interdisciplinary knowledge and insights, these researchers will work to create new designs for MIC materials for devices such as safer, cheaper, and more lightweight lithium batteries.   This project shows promise for feeding into advanced battery materials technology, thus enabling a potential new avenue for US business impact on the $20B global battery market.  Students and collaborators involved in this project will gain new knowledge about these novel polymeric conductors, and this new knowledge will be integrated into polymer science classes on the Virginia Tech campus and propagated to K-12 children and their parents in an educational outreach program based in Southwest Virginia. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project aims at a non-flammable solid with the modulus of poly(methyl methacrylate), but where a high density of ions inside move as if they were in a liquid.  It builds on the discovery of a new class of polymeric ion conductors that are termed molecular ionic composites (MICs).  The prototypical MICs, formed from a rigid-rod anion-containing polymer and an ionic liquid (IL), exhibit the following special combination of tunable properties: ionic conductivity up to 8 mS/cm, widely tunable elastic modulus (0.01&#8722;3 GPa), and thermal stability up to 300 degrees C.  MICs show promise for allowing use of metal electrodes in lithium and sodium batteries, potentially enabling higher energy density as well as battery operation over a wide temperature range and with inherent fire resistance.  While these materials display impressive properties, researchers are only beginning to understand the origins of why such fast ion transport is commensurate with such a stiff and robust material matrix.  This project combines fundamental polymer analyses involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray scattering, and microscopy with molecular dynamics simulations and theories of conduction and oriented matter.  Better understanding of the fundamental nature of MICs could feed into design of new compositions to meet desired requirements for battery electrolytes or other molecular separations applications.  Students and collaborators involved in this project will gain new knowledge about these novel polymeric conductors, and this new knowledge will be integrated into polymer science classes on the Virginia Tech campus and propagated to K-12 children and their parents in an educational outreach program based in Southwest Virginia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If the blocks possess distinctly different chemical properties, then they may be capable of self-assembling into well-ordered physical structures that impart material properties that are very different, and often better, than the properties of the individual blocks alone.  Unfortunately, the chemical synthesis of block copolymers is generally much more complicated, energy intensive, and expensive compared to that employed in synthesizing a typical commodity polymer of just one block.  While polymer chemists have made remarkable progress in developing new ways to synthesize block copolymers, commercial success has been limited and often relegated to applications in high-cost fields such as advanced medical devices or semiconductor manufacture.  In this project, a new physical approach will be used to create blocky copolymers in a straightforward, economically-attractive fashion by selectively modifying specific sequences of units along the chains of commercially available polymers.  The breakthrough approach here involves performing chemistry in the gel state, whereby specific portions of the chains are essentially hidden from the modifying chemistry.  This research will provide significant advancements in accelerating the creation of tailored block copolymer assemblies and enhance fundamental insight toward next-generation membrane technologies.  With respect to the grand challenges facing our society, this project will provide cost-effective, readily available alternative materials needed to meet critical demands for water purification membranes, fuel cell membranes for clean energy conversion, and environmentally-friendly materials for the medical and healthcare industries.  The interdisciplinary nature of research activities in this project, ranging from pure chemistry to materials structure and properties, will provide a plethora of educational opportunities to a diverse community of students and researchers eager to contribute to our nation's leadership in a scientifically and technologically advanced society.<br/><br/><br/><br/>PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will focus on a new way to create blocky copolymers using straightforward, post polymerization chemistries on semi-crystalline homopolymers in the gel state. With reactions upon only the accessible amorphous chain segments within the semi-crystalline network, this new physical process yields a non-random, blocky incorporation of functionality, and is a simple alternative to the complex polymerization mechanisms that are conventionally employed in the synthesis of block copolymers. Building upon recent discoveries that semi-crystalline polymers, such as syndiotactic polystyrene and poly(ether ether ketone), can be brominated in the heterogeneous gel-state as a simple way to create blocky copolymers with tailored sequence distributions, this project aims to engage a wealth of substitution chemistries available with brominated aromatic templates to create a wide variety of new blocky copolymers as a means to systematically manipulate phase behavior and thus the formation of ordered morphologies with tailored properties.  In addition to the substitution chemistries, the morphological parameters of the semi-crystalline gel will be altered by controlled temperature, concentration, and solvent to precisely affect the sequences of functionalized and non-functionalized chain segments.  The grand challenge to be addressed in this project will be: Can we now direct the formation of ordered phase-separated domains, similar to that observed with conventional block copolymers, by tailoring the chemical composition of these new, gel-state functionalized, blocky copolymer systems? Membranes of the blocky copolymers will be architecturally tailored for energy conversion and water purification applications.  The interdisciplinary nature of research activities in this project, ranging from pure chemistry to materials structure and properties, will help to educate a diverse community of researchers, including underrepresented groups.  Educational outreach activities will engage citizens of all ages through the focus on cutting-edge research aimed at ensuring a healthier, more energy-efficient global society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most studies of patterns and processes responsible for vegetation change have focused on deciduous shrubs, which have shown increases in abundance throughout much of the Arctic.  Fewer studies have examined changes in tree abundance at the interface between arctic tundra and the boreal forest. This project will take advantage of historical aerial images collected throughout the Brooks Range during the 1950s and 1970s to provide a comprehensive census of changes in tree abundance in recent decades in northern Alaska. Investigators will also test hypotheses about whether differences in nutrition, colder soils, and more widespread permafrost explain why trees in the western Brooks Range have increased their growth in response to recent warming, while those in the eastern Brooks Range have not. In addition, the investigators plan extensive education and outreach activities in rural and urban Alaska. Rural efforts will include visiting classrooms in Kotzebue High School to share research results, providing opportunities for Kotzebue High School students to join the research team in the field, arrainging to be interviewed by local public radio stations, and delivering public lectures at National Park Service headquarters in several local villages. In Anchorage, the investigators plan to equip a public high school in Anchorage with supples needed to conduct tree-ring research, train students in standard methods, and help them design a study to link white spruce tree ring data in their backyards to long term climate records. <br/><br/>The relative abundance of forest and tundra has important implications for surface energy exchange, carbon cycling, wildlife habitat and the availability of subsistence resources at high latitudes. The northern limit of the boreal forest in Alaska is formed within the Brooks Range. The eastern Brooks Range is an area well known to dendrochronologists as an epicenter of divergent tree growth responses to climate warming. Divergence refers to the deterioration of historically strong positive correlations between temperature and tree growth. The recognition that divergence has been widespread in the circumboreal has undermined confidence in paleoclimate reconstructions and created uncertainty in projections of vegetation-climate feedbacks. While divergence is a well-known phenomenon, its implications for changes in tree abundance and shifts in treeline position remain unknown. Recent findings in four watersheds along a west to east gradient in the Brooks Range suggest colder, more permafrost-affected soils limit tree access to soil nutrients and may be the cause of divergence in the eastern Brooks Range.  In this study, investigators will expand the spatial extent of this previous work to examine the causes and consequences of divergence in the Brooks Range. They will combine repeat aerial photography with tree-ring analysis and detailed measurements of tree microclimates, mycorrhizal associations, nutrient relations, and reproductive effort in 25 Brooks Range watersheds to yield broad-scale mechanistic insights into controls on tree growth and changes in tree abundance in a changing climate. They will test the hypothesis that positive growth responses to warming and increased tree abundance will prevail in the western Brooks Range and in habitats with warmer soils, while neutral growth responses to warming and stagnant treelines will be common in the eastern Brooks Range and in areas with cold soils.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As cancer progresses and invades into the bowel wall beneath, a signals between cells trigger the formation of new, abnormal blood vessels. These vessels are twisted and have variations in their structure and components.  There are also significant differences when compared to normal blood vessels and capillaries. Existing techniques to directly investigate the colon tissue's structure and function in a living subject are limited due to technological constraints. This project will develop a probe that can be used on an endoscope, a standard piece of surgical equipment, that can image the tissue and reconstruct a three-dimensional representation of the tissue properties.  This technology will be useful for anatomical ""tubes"" of many types and sizes - including the digestive tract, pancreatic duct, and other structures. This novel device will be used to test the hypothesis that an abnormal structure and organization of blood vessels beneath the surface of the colon tissue is related to colorectal tumor growth and development.  Similarly, it is expected that effective treatment of colorectal tumors will be accompanied by a return of normal blood vessel structure and organization.  Within this project, research and educational components are integrated through undergraduate and graduate student mentoring and training activities, course development, and a Biophotonics-specific summer camp.  In the summer camp, students will learn the fundamentals of light and how light can be used to answer research questions in the life sciences.<br/><br/><br/>The project focuses on developing a novel Tomographic Imaging MicroEndoscopy (TIME) platform, capable of multimodal characterization of tissue structure and perfusion.  The Research Plan builds on an optical fiber bundle image guide-based microendoscopy platform, previously developed by the PI, capable of imaging superficial tissues at subcellular (<3.5 micron) resolution.  The proposed platform will be capable of deployment via endoscope (for gastrointestinal applications) or catheter (for intravascular applications) and be capable of multimodal real-time in vivo tomographic imaging of microvasculature, spectroscopic quantification of tissue perfusion (hemoglobin content and oxygen saturation) and high-resolution imaging of superficial tissue microarchitecture.

Some of the protein materials are even made from predominantly one type of such structure, showing that high material performance can be achieved by relatively simple structural motifs. This project aims to elucidate how a class of synthetic polymers, which possess both a relatively complex molecular architecture and well-defined secondary structural motifs, may allow for the development of new materials with predictable physical properties. The different ways of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions in these complex polymer molecules may turn out to be the primary factor that determines the macroscopic properties. Successful completion of this research may enable the generation of polymeric systems that will approach the level of sophistication and versatility found in some  of nature's biomaterials and the properties of these materials may be tailored for a variety of applications. This research project entails the design and preparation of such complex molecules and their supramolecular assemblies, as well as the study of their properties.  It also provides a model system of complex macromolecules, enabling comparison of the multiscale assembly and the material properties with predictions from computer simulations and modeling. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in this area and acquire skills in polymer synthesis, material characterization, and computer simulations. The program will integrate the research with the development of interdisciplinary courses on bioinspired polymeric materials, provide vibrant research experiences to undergraduates and high-school students, and promote polymer research and its impact on society through lectures and workshops for the public. Emphasis is given to involving underrepresented students at all levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Using living polymerizations and other strategies, polymers with complex architectures and controlled molecular structures can be synthesized for new materials. One central question that arises is how to control the organization of these complex polymers at different scales to achieve targeted material properties. This research puts a particular emphasis on the secondary structures of complex synthetic polymers, and the connection between the different organizations of the structural motifs and the performance of resulting materials. The model system used in this research is the comb-like macromolecules containing polyamino acids (PAAs) as the side chains. Synthetic PAAs are polypeptide model systems that can form alpha-helix or beta-sheet structures, and that can be made on a large scale. Current studies mainly focus on the linear PAAs and their various copolymers. However, incorporating PAAs into complex macromolecular architectures (e.g., comb-like or brush-like) has profound effects on the association and physical properties of the polymers. The research aims to elucidate the relationship between the structural configuration and the material properties of the PAA-grafted comb macromolecules. The investigation begins with the use of water-soluble PAAs that form intermolecular beta-sheets, to guide the association of the comb macromolecules into fibril-based thin films. The mechanical properties of the polymer films will be compared with those made from proteins or linear PAAs. The study will then continue on the hydrophobic PAAs that form alpha-helices, and determine how different structural configurations of the helices may dictate the morphology and mechanical properties of the PAA-grafted comb macromolecules. At the end of the project, the stress-induced transformation of alpha-helix to beta-sheet in the PAA-grafted comb macromolecules will be examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central dogma of molecular biology has long stated that DNA codes for RNA, which codes for protein, which then carries out a cell's important functions; but there is a rapidly growing appreciation for the functions of RNA itself in fundamental biology. At the same time, there is a pressing need for new techniques to investigate these functions, including how RNA interacts with other molecules. In this work, Hargrove and coworkers develop new technology to meet this need using pattern-based recognition, which is similar to human's sense of taste, wherein a handful of receptors can identify a wide range of flavors based on how the components of those flavors differentially interact with the receptors. In this application, small organic molecules are used as receptors to evaluate different ""flavors"" of RNA structure and rapidly reveal how the shape of RNA corresponds to its function. The assay developed will be widely accessible for future investigations into the classification of RNA functional motifs, and the library of small molecule receptors and their properties will be a publicly available and searchable database. The knowledge and technology produced provide the basis for novel, fundamental discoveries into the structure and function of regulatory RNAs and thus, the central dogma of molecular biology, which impacts all areas of life, from the environment to human health. These innovative technologies push the limits of differential sensing to include structural biology, paving the way for the structure-based classification of additional biomacromolecules. This research integrates with the educational plans of the PI to: 1) implement research-based experiments and collaborative projects among diverse undergraduate and high school students throughout North Carolina; 2)increase student understanding of noncovalent interactions via accessible visualization and application activities; 3)introduce students to interdisciplinary research and real-world applications of chemistry and chemical biology; and 4) increase student engagement in the study of STEM fields. <br/><br/>The long-term research goal of the PI is to establish guiding principles for small molecule and protein recognition of RNA and to use these principles for the development of chemical probes for RNA structure and function. The CAREER research objective is to draw upon exquisitely tunable small molecules to develop timesaving and simple technologies that elucidate critical principles in RNA recognition and related function. The identification of functional yet non-protein coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences has led to a revolution in molecular biology, yet myriad questions surround the molecular function of ncRNA. These knowledge gaps include the driving principles behind ncRNA molecular interactions, particularly the influence of three-dimensional shape, and how these interactions guide ncRNA-dependent processes. Fundamental investigations of ncRNA biochemistry are hindered by challenges in molecular characterization, including the intensive time and expertise required to determine 3D RNA structure. Using techniques recently developed in the lab of the PI, the proposed work addresses a number of fundamental molecular questions, including: 1) How does shape influence small molecule:RNA recognition? 2) What RNA structural elements can small molecule receptors differentiate? 3) How do varying environmental conditions impact this differentiation? 4) How do base modifications influence RNA recognition? 5) Can arrays of small molecules differentiate functional RNA elements in a manner comparable to or better than proteins? These novel, small molecule-based methods for understanding RNA recognition provide ready access to chemical insights that reveal both the fundamental principles of small molecule:RNA recognition and the pivotal role RNA shape plays in regulating key cellular functions, ultimately leading to new knowledge in the ncRNA field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To derive this understanding, the experimental approach in this research project takes advantage of changes in dielectric behavior of absorbed atmospheric water molecules in response to damage initiation and progression. By tracking the ability of water molecules to rotate in response to an oscillating electromagnetic field, early and non-visible changes in the chemical and physical characteristics of the material can be measured. The new and valuable insight into the mechanisms responsible for the progression of damage derived from these measurements will improve our ability to design more robust materials and better predict impending failure, thus advancing national health, prosperity, welfare, and national defense. The research will be complemented by an effort to provide access to K-12 summer engineering camp activities at North Carolina State University for students from rural and isolated urban communities. A sustainable process for packaging and disseminating these high-value educational resources will be developed and implemented, expanding their impact beyond the students attending the on-site camps and increasing visibility and knowledge of engineering among students who may not otherwise consider or pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the research is to derive the mechanistic underpinnings of polymer composite damage progression across spatial scales in response to coupled thermal, hygroscopic, and mechanical loading. The specific objectives in support of this goal are to: (i) describe the link between water-polymer interaction and topology, nanovoid content, polarity, and hygrothermal aging of fiber-reinforced epoxies; (ii) connect the response of absorbed molecular water to multiscale damage induced by dynamic, fatigue, and impact loading; (iii) use a neural-network technique to extract the salient variables that govern damage progression for use in deriving a mechanistic understanding of the molecular precursors to damage; and (iv) reconcile the experimental and neural-network derived insights with the physical basis of state-of-the-art multiscale, multiphysics simulation techniques. This project will allow the PI to expand the knowledge base in mechanics and materials science, enabling safer and more efficient use of polymer composites across multiple industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Public memorialization often emerges in the aftermath of fraught, sometimes violent, encounters. The spaces dedicated to preserving those social memories can therefore function as much to resolve conflicts as to erase or remember particular identities or histories. This has been well-documented within formal, public spaces, but we know less about the informal mechanisms through which commemorative spaces are established, maintained, and contested. This project, which trains a student in methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, conducts a case study of informal forms of memorialization in an American city in order to understand what impact the establishment and maintenance of a commemorative sites has on identity formation, civil society, and violence reduction. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations engaged in policy dialogues related to understanding the origins and motivations for urban violence, and to what extent memorialization attenuates its prevalence.<br/> <br/>Harvard University anthropology doctoral student Samantha Hawkins, under the supervision of Dr. Laurence Ralph, will explore the inner-city as a complex, affective landscape, wherein urban memorials function as tools of cultural recollection in a context marked by violence. These memorials are also sites of regulation and contestation, made evident by their ongoing obliteration and reinscription. She will conduct ethnographic fieldwork in Baltimore, which is an ideal site to conduct the study as it has the second highest per capita murder rate in the U.S. The makeup of and changes to memorials in Baltimore, the different levels of engagement and investment, the varying reasons that they are erected and/or destroyed, the patterns of aesthetic composition, demonstrate something significant about material claims to space and identity. The project asks how social relations and political ideologies are woven into a topography of memory. Can a material object both reflect political authority and social hierarchies, while also serving efforts of urban black populations to preserve a cultural identity? The investigator will employ a range of qualitative ethnographically-grounded techniques, pursuing three key areas of inquiry: how the memorial functions as an object of argument through which survivors of those lost to violence seek to legitimize their lived experience and assert value; the role of urban space in re-presenting material traces of memory and defining personhood; and the impact of violence in the formation of identities. This research will produce a critical account of memory politics in Baltimore's inner-city, contributing both to the anthropology of race and class, as well as broader scientific debates about memorialization.<br/><br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how and why some groups have come to be more species-rich than other groups is a central and unsolved problem in the life sciences. One class of explanations for these differences in species numbers involves the rate at which new species arise. Using tools from genome biology and computational data science, this project will identify the mechanisms that lead to different rates of species formation and quantify their importance in a major group of vertebrate animals.  The project will provide training in genomics, geographic information systems, computational biology, and biodiversity science for students and researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Genomic resources and new scientific software developed for the project will be made publicly available, and a museum exhibit will highlight the ways in which genomics and computer programming are changing the way scientists study and understand the diversity of life forms on Earth.<br/><br/>This project will produce a novel synthesis between population biology and large-scale patterns of species diversity by integrating next-generation population genomics with a phylogenetic comparative perspective on lineage diversification rates. The project will quantify the genomic signal of several population processes to address how rates of population splitting and persistence influence speciation rates as measured on time-calibrated phylogenetic trees. These objectives will be supported by estimating phylogeographic and population genomic parameters across many species of squamate reptiles that vary in rates of speciation, and by developing new methods to link these parameters to diversification rates on phylogenetic trees. The project will also assess how organismal traits (life history, dispersal biology, population size) contribute to demographic processes that can influence the formation and persistence of incipient species. The project will provide a bridge between biological processes that occur at two very different timescales and will provide an understanding of how changes in populations at ecological timescales affect changes in biological diversity at deep (million-year) timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Soft materials that can undergo large reversible deformation have been widely utilized in industrial applications such as tires and soft adhesives, or emerging technologies such as soft robots, biomedical implants and stretchable display. In these applications, the underlying soft materials are required to be stretchable to enable functionality and yet fracture resistant to enhance reliability. Driven by this need, various physical or chemical mechanisms have been developed to enhance the fracture resistance of soft materials, and they share a common theme: to introduce energy dissipation or consumption by the material during deformation. However, theoretical modeling and experimental characterization of fracture in such soft dissipative materials are challenging due to the lack of understandings on the quantitative relation between energy dissipation and fracture resistance. This research program will establish experimental and modeling capabilities to uncover the complex nonlinear mechanics associated with soft material fracture, which will lead to quantitative principles for engineering new soft functional materials that are mechanically robust, as well as new tools to measure and predict fracture in soft materials. Thus, the research will promote the science of soft material fracture to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. As part of research, education and outreach programs will be developed to promote research of soft material fracture in academic, educational and industrial sectors by creating an interdisciplinary summer workshop, integrating research findings into curriculum and K-12 outreach activities, and building collaborations with industrial partners.<br/><br/>A major challenge in soft material fracture is the large deformation near the tip of a crack, which causes nonlinear strain and stress fields as well as complex failure and dissipation behaviors. To address this challenge, a particle tracking method will be used to measure the crack tip deformation field in model soft materials under various fracture modes. For elastic materials, the experiments will provide data to assess the region of validity for existing crack tip asymptotic solutions, to discover new structures of crack tip fields, and to enable local evaluation of energy release rate through the J-integral, thus eliminating the requirement of specialized experimental geometries. For dissipative materials, the experimental data of crack tip deformation field, augmented by accurate constitutive models, will be used to identify the crack tip dissipation zone and to separately measure the intrinsic and dissipative toughness. A finite element model will also be developed to couple the crack tip failure process, represented by a cohesive zone, with the bulk material dissipation, which will enable the prediction of crack growth in soft dissipative materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These material systems can potentially bear mechanical loads but also perform other duties.  The research aims at transforming the ancient art of origami into a theoretical framework for designing multi-functional materials.  It is envisioned that these multi-functional origami materials can significantly advance the performance and sustainability of many strategic applications like morphing airframes, adaptive wind turbines, energy harvesters, and medical devices.   Origami folding - due to its seemingly infinite capabilities of developing 3D geometries from 2D sheets - is becoming an increasingly popular subject among mathematicians, educators, architects, and engineers.  However, we are still scratching the surface of its potential.  The research will formulate a systematic method: analysis, design, and experiment, to fully uncover the physics underpinning the 3D multi-stability from folding.   Such physical insights will be exploited to create linkages to translate these stability properties into unprecedented material functions, such as on-demand property programming, static diode effects, and motion rectification.  Research results will also be leveraged to enhance origami as an engaging teaching tool through the creation of a book of origami folding exercises for teaching engineering. The research will also lead to a Creative Inquiry project for undergraduates, in collaboration with the Clemson Engineers for Developing Countries program, on the design of origami emergency shelters in Haiti. This project will produce educational tools that are specifically designed to be adopted by other educators to train high-quality researchers and engineers as well as to motivate K-12 students to pursue undergraduate and graduate STEM study. The research outcomes of this project will enable new low-cost material systems to adaptively protect infrastructure systems from natural and man-made disasters and to increase the collection of energy from renewable sources.<br/><br/>Multi-stability has been used to create many multi-functional materials and structures for shape reconfiguration, property adaptation, vibration control, and energy harvesting.  However, current systems are built upon low dimensional mechanisms such as the buckled beams, the simplicity of which severely limits their overall potential.   This CAREER award aims to leverage the mechanics of origami folding to advance the study of multi-stable systems into the fundamentally three-dimensional domain. The sophisticated shape transformations via folding can impart novel stability properties that are unavailable in the lower dimensional mechanisms, including the anisotropic arrangement of stable and unstable states, asymmetric energy barrier between stable states, and the use of pressurization to eliminate or create stable equilibria.  This project will formulate nonlinear mechanics analysis, experiment validation, and crease design methodologies to harness these stability properties and synthesize architected multi-functional material systems.  This project, if successful, will create a new field of three-dimensional multi-stability, including a high-fidelity mechanics modeling process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These range from internal patterns, like the repetition of vertebrae in the spinal cord, to external patterns like the stripes of black pigment on a zebra. Pigmentation has become a powerful model for exploring the origins and genetic mechanisms behind these types of patterns. For example, new information about insect development has been learned by studying the colorful eyespots in butterflies. In plants, the mechanisms of pigment production have been well-studied, but surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of complex patterns of pigmentation. Filling this knowledge gap is the goal of this research. This project will study two species of monkeyflower; each has flowers with strikingly different color patterns. What's more, when the two species are mated together, new intricate and complex color patterns emerge. Since these new pigmentation patterns are seen only when different species are mated together, it suggests that interactions between their genomes give rise to the new patterns. Exploring how such interactions between different genomes can produce unexpected new traits is a primary focus of this research. One master's student, six undergraduates, and six high school students will be recruited to carry out this work. These students will be exposed to high-impact learning opportunities as they are immersed in hands-on scientific research.  At least two of the high school students will be selected from a high school that specifically serves disadvantaged youth.<br/><br/>The pigmentation patterns in the hybrids of Mimulus cupreus x M. luteus var. variegatus are too intricate to quantify using standard approaches. Instead, a new digital image analysis pipeline is being developed. This approach will be useful for analyzing spatial patterning in monkeyflowers and in other taxa. The researchers will use this new method to identify and quantify elements of floral color pattern in a phenotypically diverse F2 hybrid population. Next-generation sequencing will be used to map the genomic regions responsible for the observed variation in flower patterns. Because M. cupreus and M. l. variegatus also differ in yellow carotenoid pigmentation, the same phenotypic and genetic datasets will be used to identify the genetic basis of divergent carotenoid production, which is an important but under-studied component of plant physiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Visual analytic technologies help people in a variety of these domains including business, health, education, national security, and many more. These visual analytic techniques are effective since they combine powerful machine learning with interactive data visualization. Currently, the way that people use such systems is through user interfaces with control panels to adjust parameters of the analytic models and visualization properties directly. For example, controls may ask users to select which analytic model to use, which parameter to adjust, and by how much. However, when people do not have the necessary expertise or training in data science or information visualization, they may not be able to properly use these tools and miss out on important insights. Instead, this project will explore, design, develop, and evaluate techniques that allow people to demonstrate their analytic goals, tasks, and operations. Developing this ""visual analytics by demonstration"" method of user interaction has the potential to impact numerous data-driven domains, and society more broadly. This project will also provide educational experience and research training for graduate and undergraduate students to guide them towards careers in computing.<br/><br/>The proposed research will create Visual Analytics by Demonstration prototypes, generalizable toolkits, and demonstration primitives to foster exploration and discovery in visual analytics. Instead of control panels that require users to directly parameterize analytic models and visualizations, people provide demonstrations, from which the system selects the appropriate visual representation, analytic model, and parameters. To realize the benefits of such technology, many research challenges exist and must be addressed. For instance, what are the basic demonstration primitives that people use to communicate their intent to a system? How can systems interpret these demonstrations and perform the correct analytic and visualization operations? Finally, how can these systems guard against potential user bias in exploring data using by-demonstration? Project objectives include the design, implementation, and evaluation of by-demonstration visual analytic prototypes. The research will perform formative studies to develop demonstration primitives categorized by user tasks. The project will design and develop applications for specific data domains as well as general, open-sourced toolkits for other researchers to use and extend. User studies will identify if and how specific tasks and operations can be performed by demonstrations, and how these compare in performance to current control panel interfaces. The proposed work will also create instructional material to integrate visual analytics by demonstration into courses that teach visual analytics, or data science more generally.

This happens when cancer spreads, but also when an embryo grows.  Whether cells can change from ones that move into ones that remain in the same place is partly dependent on the tissue stiffness. If we better understand this change in cells, it will improve our understanding of how cancer progresses and how our organs grow. The change from mobile to a static cells is call mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). MET is important to kidney and heart development, wound healing and cancer metastasis. When MET happens, migrating cells change so that they are immobile and tightly bound to neighboring cells. MET depends on tissue stiffness, but the details of the dependence aren't known. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will measure the response of cells to dynamic changes in matrix stiffness and determine how EMT is affected by tissue stiffness. This will help in understanding how embryos grow, how to better manufacture artificial tissues and in building 'organs on a chip' that can be used for drug discovery research. The PI and graduate student supported through this project will develop and implement a workshop for grade 6-12 teachers focused on biomechanics and mechanobiology concepts so that they can better teach their students, including how engineering research impacts society.     <br/><br/>Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) is a phenotypic change in which migratory cells with weak cell-cell contacts transition to tightly bound cells exhibiting apical-basal polarity. MET is central to embryonic remodeling, establishment of organ architecture, wound healing, reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells, and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. While it is recognized that mechanical properties of the cellular niche change dynamically during MET-associated processes in vivo, important questions still remain regarding how microenvironmental physical properties regulate MET. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop a dynamic hydrogel system that recapitulates changes in tissue mechanical properties during MET-associated events, and then to use this system to determine the expression of genes associated with epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell migration. Further studies will elucidate the role of key mechanoresponsive signaling molecules and epigenetic remodeling in regulating MET response to mechanical signals. The establishment of molecular mechanisms linking tissue mechanics and MET will result in a better understanding of mechanotransduction processes and will provide insight into how mechanical signals regulate cell plasticity. The research program provides the foundation for educational and outreach efforts aimed toward incorporating positive themes about the impact of engineering and mechanobiology on society into engineering curricula and into recruitment efforts directed toward grade 6-12 through graduate-level students. A workshop for grade 6-12 teachers focused on biomechanics and mechanobiology concepts will be developed and implemented and will demonstrate how research impacts society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how and why some groups have come to be more species-rich than other groups is a central and unsolved problem in the life sciences. One class of explanations for these differences in species numbers involves the rate at which new species arise. Using tools from genome biology and computational data science, this project will identify the mechanisms that lead to different rates of species formation and quantify their importance in a major group of vertebrate animals.  The project will provide training in genomics, geographic information systems, computational biology, and biodiversity science for students and researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.

These objectives will be supported by estimating phylogeographic and population genomic parameters across many species of squamate reptiles that vary in rates of speciation, and by developing new methods to link these parameters to diversification rates on phylogenetic trees. The project will also assess how organismal traits (life history, dispersal biology, population size) contribute to demographic processes that can influence the formation and persistence of incipient species.

The project will exploit the group's multiple natural experimentation with extreme environments to develop detailed conceptual models for major ecological and morphological transitions that will inform on the rules underlying morphological change. These models will then serve as predictors for how and why transformations occur, which can be tested in other groups with similar narratives. Important examples include the initial emergence of four-limbed vertebrates onto land, how birds took the sky, and the first steps in the reign of mammals.

These range from internal patterns, like the repetition of vertebrae in the spinal cord, to external patterns like the stripes of black pigment on a zebra. Pigmentation has become a powerful model for exploring the origins and genetic mechanisms behind these types of patterns. For example, new information about insect development has been learned by studying the colorful eyespots in butterflies. In plants, the mechanisms of pigment production have been well-studied, but surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of complex patterns of pigmentation. Filling this knowledge gap is the goal of this research. This project will study two species of monkeyflower; each has flowers with strikingly different color patterns. What's more, when the two species are mated together, new intricate and complex color patterns emerge. Since these new pigmentation patterns are seen only when different species are mated together, it suggests that interactions between their genomes give rise to the new patterns. Exploring how such interactions between different genomes can produce unexpected new traits is a primary focus of this research. One master's student, six undergraduates, and six high school students will be recruited to carry out this work. These students will be exposed to high-impact learning opportunities as they are immersed in hands-on scientific research.  At least two of the high school students will be selected from a high school that specifically serves disadvantaged youth.<br/><br/>The pigmentation patterns in the hybrids of Mimulus cupreus x M. luteus var. variegatus are too intricate to quantify using standard approaches. Instead, a new digital image analysis pipeline is being developed. This approach will be useful for analyzing spatial patterning in monkeyflowers and in other taxa. The researchers will use this new method to identify and quantify elements of floral color pattern in a phenotypically diverse F2 hybrid population. Next-generation sequencing will be used to map the genomic regions responsible for the observed variation in flower patterns. Because M. cupreus and M. l. variegatus also differ in yellow carotenoid pigmentation, the same phenotypic and genetic datasets will be used to identify the genetic basis of divergent carotenoid production, which is an important but under-studied component of plant physiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A big attributed network (BAN) is characterized by a combination of (a) high-dimensional and heterogeneous network topologies and (b) high-dimensional and heterogeneous attribute data. Effective analysis of BAN data relies on simultaneous subgraph mining and feature selection for discovering complex patterns that are interesting or significant. However, as yet little has been done to bridge these two important research areas. The focus of this project is therefore to unify a wide range of complex pattern discovery tasks including, for example, the detection and forecasting of societal events (disasters, civil unrest), anomalous patterns (disease outbreaks, cyberattacks), discriminative subnetworks (cancer diagnosis), knowledge patterns (new knowledge building) and storylines (intelligence analysis), and to resolve the fundamental modeling, algorithmic, and interactive challenges associated with ubiquitous BAN data in today's big data era.

The research approach includes the development of: (1) novel principled methods capable of learning complex patterns of interest directly from BAN data; (2) near-linear-time common inference algorithms capable of optimizing a variety of BAN-specific model objectives that are subject to different constraints on subgraph topologies and structured sparsity models; and (3) a computer-interpretable language-based system capable of modeling and interpreting rich user feedback schemes in BAN data.

We consume plants either directly, or by eating animals that have been fed with plants. Therefore, life on earth would simply not be possible without plants. The calories, amino acids, vitamins and mineral ions our bodies require are taken up by plants from the environment or they are made within plant cells after uptake of some of the building blocks. Plants use these nutrients for growth and the production of edible organs such as tubers and seeds. However, abiotic stresses, including soil mineral limitation, drought and high temperature, and biotic stresses such as pathogen and insect pest attacks provide a threat to plant food production. But how can plants achieve mineral ion uptake, even under stress, and how are they able to use the nutrients and produce the tissues and organs needed for the human food supply? Plants have evolved specific membrane proteins that can sense and transfer environmental signals, as well as recognize and transport mineral ions from the outside environment into the cell. Novel scientific approaches have revolutionized our understanding of the structure and function of plant membranes, and this workshop will address important breakthroughs in membrane biology with respect to signaling, nutrient transport and plant growth. We expect that the scientific interactions will promote discussions on how to meet the challenge of feeding the global community of tomorrow and will facilitate advances essential for food security.<br/><br/>The 6th Pan American Membrane Biology Workshop will be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada from June 24-28th, 2018.

Given the importance of membrane biology and its potential to continue to make groundbreaking discoveries, there is pressing scientific demand for opportunities to communicate and interact. This meeting will be both stimulating and timely, and specific objectives are (1) to organize and support knowledge exchange and discussions on the latest scientific advances in membrane biology research, including in areas related to plant membrane structure, transport, protein trafficking, and signal transduction, (2) to promote interactions between scientists and trainees to share new discoveries in the field of membrane biology as it relates to plant growth, development and nutrition, and to enhance training and new collaborations that will move the field forward and (3) to directly involve newly independent scientists and trainees, with emphasis on diversity and gender. The workshop agenda will include discussions for trainee mentorship, publication strategies and emerging areas of plant membrane biology in a supportive setting to promote trainee and established researcher interactions. The broader impacts of this meeting are manifold. It will promote participation of groups underrepresented in science and support diversity in the plant biology community by connecting the trainees with senior scientist role models.

Originally developed as a theory to optimize the efficiency of heat engines, two extensions of thermodynamics in the last century advanced the theory to the point at which quantum mechanics should be incorporated. First, the identification of the role of information in thermodynamics makes strong connections between heat, entropy and information. Second, extensions of thermodynamics to the realm of microscopic systems in which fluctuations are significant allow the application of thermodynamics at the level of single trajectories of classical particles. Quantum mechanics requires both of these features as information and fluctuations are central to the behavior of quantum systems. The experimental control over single quantum systems that has been achieved in this century places us in a unique position to extend thermodynamics into the quantum regime. Understanding quantum thermodynamics will be increasingly important as quantum machines become more complicated and as classical machines are further miniaturized.  The experimental work will utilize microscopic superconducting circuits as artificial atoms and the interaction of these atoms with microwave light to control the atom's environment.  The team will conduct a series of experiments elucidating the relationship between quantum information, heat and work.

Natural polymers, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, starch, proteins, and chitin, have been utilized in composites, plastics, biofuels and other applications. The development of synthetic polymers from molecular biomass, such as plant oils, rosin acids, terpenes, terpenoids, and furan, is a fast-growing area. However, there are many mounting challenges in increasing the component of biobased polymers in the commercial market, in contrast with dominant petrochemical-derived counterparts. To promote sustainability and national prosperity, this project will develop next-generation renewable polymers by designing general strategies based on wrapping of macromolecules on polymers from natural resources to improve their physical properties, especially addressing critical hurdles on inferior mechanical properties involving a variety of biomass.  A central goal is to understand how macromolecular chain wrapping via supramolecular interactions dictates thermal and mechanical properties of these materials and to establish structure-property relationships.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Sustainable biobased polymers from natural resources are facing a lot of compelling challenges.  Among them, many polymers suffer inferior mechanical properties, largely due to their inherent low chain entanglements (thus, they have very high chain-entanglement molecular weight). Macromolecular architectures and compositions play vital roles in dictating these properties. The planned research is aimed to provide an economical, robust, and general approach to enhance mechanical properties of biobased polymers. The central idea is to wrap bulky biobased polymers with a flexible and highly entangled macromolecule via supramolecular interactions. The overall goal of the proposed research is to simultaneously maximize the use of biomass and enable biobased bulky polymers with high tensile strength and desirable elongation under stress by incorporating minimal levels of macromolecular wrapping. This project includes the development of macromolecular engineering protocols through parallel efforts on: (1) polymers containing bulky biomass such as fatty acid, resin acid, isosorbide, guaiacol, pinene, tulipalin, and glucose;  and (2) biocomposites based on lignin and cellulose nanowhiskers.  An essential goal is to understand how macromolecular chain wrapping via supramolecular interactions dictates thermal and mechanical properties of these materials and to establish clear structure-property relationships. The planned research program seeks to explore potentially transformative concepts to address sustainability issues by maximizing the use of biobased polymers with enhanced thermomechanical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of the known matter in the universe is in an ionized state, a plasma, comprised of electrons and ions that strongly interact with electromagnetic fields.  Magnetic reconnection is an explosive phenomenon that occurs in plasmas where magnetic field lines suddenly rearrange themselves to release large amounts of energy.  This has important implications here on Earth for fusion energy schemes and prediction of space weather events that can disable satellites used for communication and navigation. Magnetic reconnection is also theorized to occur around violent astrophysical events such as in the vicinity of gamma-ray bursts or active galactic nuclei where the magnetic fields are very large and the particles move at close to the speed of light.  This project will investigate magnetic reconnection under similar conditions in the laboratory and test the accuracy of existing theories.

The electrons are mostly confined to the target surface and expand radially outwards at the speed of light. This generates a very large azimuthal magnetic field. Focusing two laser pulses in close proximity forms oppositely directed magnetic fields in the midplane to form a driven reconnection geometry.  Numerical modeling has indicated the conditions created by the laser pulses will satisfy the requirement for accessing the relativistic magnetic reconnection regime. Measurements of the timescale of the reconnection and the characterization of accelerated particle jets will be used to benchmark and test existing theories and numerical models.  Further, the education and outreach goal of the project is to help address under-representation of women and minority groups within many fields of STEM, and specifically in plasma physics.  This will be done by developing curriculum to educate undergraduate students about unconscious bias and when this may lead to unintentionally discriminatory behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These applications require low latency and fast response time, which are often difficult to attain due to the physical distance and bandwidth limitations between users and the cloud. To cope with these limitations, edge computing has been introduced as a new paradigm that optimizes cloud computing to provide distributed computing solutions at the edge of the network, where IoT users utilize the computing resources in their vicinity (sometimes called ""cloudlets""). Driven by the surging demand for edge computing, the energy consumption of clouds, cloudlets, and devices becomes increasingly important both from an environmental and cost viewpoint. Most of the existing energy consumption improvements in clouds come from improved engineering rather than improved algorithms. Such a practice fails to incorporate significant optimization opportunities available for clouds/cloudlets/devices to reduce their energy consumption. This two-year project focuses on developing resource management systems to significantly improve energy efficiency in edge computing. <br/><br/>The project consists of the following research thrusts: 1) understanding energy consumption in edge computing by exploring recurrent energy consumption patterns and identifying potential improvements; 2) introducing energy-aware data and job decomposition algorithms by developing mathematical and scalable computational models that seamlessly integrate multiple system objectives; 3) developing energy-aware placement of jobs to the edge components based on matching theory, graph theory, and distributed online algorithm design; and 4) evaluating the system on the National Science Foundation-funded CloudLab platform.<br/><br/>This project will enable more efficient use of cloud computing at the edge, while reducing energy consumption, which leads to cost reduction in edge services. It also benefits IoT users by extending battery lifetime of their smart devices and by improving their application performance. This project may lead to societal benefits such as promoting livable communities and smart cities. This research will be integrated into the into classroom teaching via a cloud computing course. Specialized outreach activities of this project are aimed at increasing participation of students from groups underrepresented in science and engineering.

Results could contribute to innovations in motor skill training, including rehabilitation of sensorimotor disorders after stroke and development of prostheses, as well as to ergonomics, brain-machine interfaces, robotics, and tele-operations.  The project will advance the NSF's educational goals by encouraging underrepresented students to consider STEM career paths.

The project will address this question at both the behavioral and neural levels and asks whether multisensory integration and motor control share a common sensorimotor map (a model relating motor commands to sensory consequences). A combination of psychophysics and reaching tasks will indicate whether multisensory integration and motor learning affect each other at the behavioral level. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the researchers will examine whether connections between sensory and motor areas of the brain change in strength when subjects learn a new spatial relationship between vision and proprioception; this would suggest a shared sensorimotor map at the neural level.

This project tests the hypothesis that the reason for this is because redundant (i.e., matching) multisensory information elicits greater attention than does either mis-matching multisensory information or unisensory information. The results from this project will provide key insights into infant perception, attention, learning, and memory and, as a result, they will suggest better ways for helping infants acquire critical cognitive and social skills. In addition, the results will provide new insights into the root causes of some developmental disabilities (e.g., autism) which are known to involve impaired perception and attention to multisensory information. Finally, the results from this project will provide a scientific foundation for the design of  tools that will permit clinicians to more effectively detect and ameliorate impaired attention to multisensory information in young children with developmental disabilities, thereby improving their cognitive and social development.<br/><br/>By around 6 months of age, a previously rudimentary, reflex-like selective attention response system becomes transformed into an endogenously driven selective attention system. This new functionality permits infants to deploy their attention to sources of multisensory redundancy that are of specific interest to them. The project seeks to answer three main questions. First, what mechanisms underlie developmental changes in infant selective attention to sources of multisensory redundancy? Second, how does early experience contribute to developmental changes in selective attention to multisensory redundancy in infancy? Third, how does improving selective attention to multisensory redundancy contribute to information processing across different psychological domains? Infants residing in monolingual and bilingual households will be tested with eye tracking methods to assess attention to multisensory redundancy inherent in talking faces. In some cases, eye tracking will be used  with an intersensory matching procedure to examine infant matching of auditory and visual attributes of speech. In other cases, eye tracking will be used with a habituation/test procedure to investigate learning of multisensory events. The investigators will analyze the temporal distribution of attention as well as the latency of responses. The findings from this project will provide novel insights into the emergence of attention and learning in infancy, clues to maximizing attention and learning in typically developing infants, and clues to improving attention and learning in infants at risk for developmental disabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Sharma is developing new synthetic methods for the construction of the types of bioactive molecules that are frequently used in efforts to identify drug leads for the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, and neurological disorders. The research described seeks to develop cascade reactions that take advantage of a sequence of carefully timed steps to convert inexpensive, readily accessible compounds into higher-value, complex molecules. To accomplish this, the Sharma group is developing new reaction protocols that involve the use of more than one metal at a time. This research is expected to have broad application in the fields of chemical synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and therapeutics development.  Professor Sharma is also pioneering an outreach program, the Synergistic Catalytic Cycle for Education Excellence  (SC2E2), that provides crucial hands-on science education for underrepresented students in the State of Oklahoma. The SC2E2 program encourages an increase in school enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of highly qualified STEM students from low-income areas in the State of Oklahoma.<br/><br/>Despite dramatic advances in natural product-inspired drug discovery, many bioactive scaffolds (spirocycles, medium-sized rings, and terpene furanolactones) remain underexploited in drug discovery screening owing to the challenges associated with their synthesis. To address these challenges, this research program will utilize metal carbene cascade reactions for the efficient scalable synthesis of such scaffolds. More specifically, this research focuses on the use of diazo-derived metal-carbenes that are ambiphilic in nature in combination with a second metal catalyst to trigger sequential reactions with a nucleophile and an electrophile. The ensuing cascade reactions lead to the rapid generation of molecular complexity. A comprehensive educational plan is also integrated with the research goals to provide an inclusive scientific education experience for students from underrepresented groups in the State of Oklahoma. The proposed SC2E2 program is inspired from developed research involving synergistic catalysis, in which two or more catalysts act simultaneously to improve the efficiency of existing transformations. Likewise, SC2E2 builds upon inclusive educational practices in a cyclic process by providing students training, guidance and leadership opportunities, which ultimately help cultivate a new generation of diverse STEM professionals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Song Lin is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University.  Prof. Lin's lab aims to develop new methods for building organic molecules that contain carbon-nitrogen bonds.  Carbon-nitrogen bonds are critically important. Over 85% of the top-selling pharmaceuticals have at least one carbon-nitrogen bond. With this in mind, the goal of the research being pursued is to establish efficient, selective, and sustainable reaction technologies that will promote the formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds from abundant starting materials.  Electrochemistry, a process that directly uses electricity to drive chemical reactions, is an intrinsically efficient, selective, and sustainable technology. It would appear to be an ideal method for making carbon-nitrogen bonds in a sustainable manner. However, electrochemical reactions frequently do not afford the chemical selectivity and efficiency necessary to accomplish a particular transformation. The introduction of catalysis that can control the chemical reaction portion of the process can solve this problem. In so doing, the catalyst augments the energy efficiency of electrochemical reactions by offering an opportunity to better control the yield and identity of the end product. The project lies at the interface of organic synthesis, catalysis, and electrochemistry. Therefore, it is also well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Prof. Lin's group is actively engaged in outreach activities by integrating the key elements of their research into the education and training of the next generation of scientists at both collegiate and K-12 levels.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Lin of Cornell University is developing electrocatalytic methods for new carbon-nitrogen coupling reactions. The proposed research enlists the combination of electrochemistry and redox-active metal catalysis as a general approach to enable highly efficient and chemoselective amination of organic substrates. Three specific aims are being pursued simultaneously. The scope of the electrocatalytic diazidation of alkenes for the synthesis of vicinal diamines is being investigated, the electrochemical azidooxygenation of alkenes for the synthesis of aminoalcohol products is being advanced, and an electrocatalytic paradigm to decarboxylative and deborylative azidations is being expanded. Additional efforts are studying the mechanisms of the electrochemical reactions using kinetic and voltammetric experiments. Finally, the new reaction methods are being employed to improve the synthesis of bioactive complex targets.  The proposed educational plan is working to expand the nation's infrastructure for STEM education on collegiate and K-12 levels with a particular emphasis on sustainability.  Toward this goal, the Lin Lab is actively participating in the development and promulgation of electrosynthesis-related teaching modules aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the fossil record, and among existing species, large morphological changes are frequently associated with changes in habitat or ecology. However, there remains little understanding of the general rules that govern morphological change associated with ecological change. This project will use skeletal and soft-tissue anatomy as well as detailed 3D shape data to study closely-related, transitional species to investigate the evolution of morphology and ecology in the long-lived and fossil-rich group Crocodylomorpha (crocodiles, alligators, and their extinct relatives). The project will exploit the group's multiple natural experimentation with extreme environments to develop detailed conceptual models for major ecological and morphological transitions that will inform on the rules underlying morphological change. These models will then serve as predictors for how and why transformations occur, which can be tested in other groups with similar narratives. Important examples include the initial emergence of four-limbed vertebrates onto land, how birds took the sky, and the first steps in the reign of mammals. The innovative technologies, techniques, and widely applicable conclusions from this research will promote interdisciplinary work among paleontologists, biomechanists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists.  The researchers will make their data, digital models, analytical tools, and essential supplementary files available for wide access. Furthermore, this project will support associated PhD and Postdoctoral research as well as foster access to higher education for substantially underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project will use integrative approaches to reveal the complexities of ecomorphological changes across major evolutionary transitions. The study will examine how novel environments put new, often extreme demands on historical phenotypes by addressing how large-scale habitat and ecological transitions drive evolution across multiple integrated anatomical systems. The research will test hypotheses about phenotypic integration on an evolutionary scale to determine whether developmental rates, sequence heterochrony, and/or patterns of modularity determine if consistently applied rules of ecomorphological diversification underlie adaptive radiations. The outcome will be an unprecedented database of crocodylomorph cranial and post-cranial diversity that includes contrast-enhanced neural and skeletal tissues, raw and partitioned CT stacks, and 3D digital models as well as comparative, intra-clade conceptual models for how predatory vertebrates shift to lives on the shoreline, within the sea, and toward herbivory. The microCT and cutting-edge, diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging, in addition to a robust morphological phylogeny for analysis of evolutionary trends using the latest phylogenetic methods, represent potentially transformative methodologies developed by this research group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cloud storage services must keep the data of thousands of customers separated while also allowing customers to operate on it efficiently. Safely intermixing customer-provided operations over data is problematic. Historically, processor hardware isolates programs, but increasing data access rates make that costly. This project develops a new approach to storage that allows safe operation on data without hardware protection using recent advances in programming languages.<br/><br/>The approach combats data movement between disaggregated storage and compute nodes by having untrusted tenant extensions pushed to Sandstorm, a new cloud storage system. Sandstorm's insight is that storage extensions can use language-level isolation to eliminate hardware isolation overheads that cannot be avoided today: not with virtual machines, containers, nor serverless Lambdas. Sandstorm also eliminates copying data for safety, so extensions benefit from low-level hardware functionality like zero-copy network transmission. The project will develop multitenant benchmarks, low-cost performance-isolated concurrency mechanisms for multicores, techniques to minimize data movement within servers, storage extensions that demonstrate the benefits, and distributed extensions over clusters.<br/><br/>As power limits data center scale, minimizing data movement out of storage becomes crucial. Sandstorm enables any cloud developer to accelerate data-intensive applications like real-time social network and natural graph analysis and fine-grained coordination of hundreds of thousands of autonomous vehicles. All artifacts will be developed openly under a permissive MIT license for academic and industrial use.

Economic models of conforming to social norms assume that people conform either because of material incentives or to avoid punishment.  This research project will use economic theory and laboratory experiments to study why people conform to social norms when there are no material incentives to do so or punishment for deviating from those norms. The theory is based on the idea that individuals want to judge themselves in a positive way but lack a direct way of evaluating themselves.  As a result, individuals look at the actions of their peers to form the positive image of themselves, allowing them to form a better image of themselves.  Comparing one?s behavior to their peer?s lead to a better understanding of social conformity that does not require material incentives or punishment.  The researchers will then conduct laboratory experiments to test this theory.  The results of this research project will provide an input into the formulation of policies to enhance social cohesion.  The project will support a doctoral dissertation research and therefore contributes to growth of US's economic research capital and global leadership in economics research.  <br/><br/>Economic theories of social conformity based on sanctions, social signaling, or adherence to social norms cannot explain why there is conformity among those whose actions are not likely to be seen by others, nor do they address the environment in which peer effects may be strong.  This research project seeks to deepen understanding of why social conformity arises in the absence of material incentives with a unified theory and two experiments. The theory posits that individuals have an intrinsic desire to judge and evaluate themselves positively.  Lacking objective means of self-evaluation, individuals rely on social comparisons to better understand what their choices reveal about themselves.  By deriving behavioral conformity from self-image, the model establishes a scope for peer effects without observable incentives or the pressures of social stigma.  Two experiments are then conducted to test the predictions of this model.  The first experiment tests whether individuals follow a pattern of peer effects that is uniquely consistent with self-image evaluation.  The second experiment tests whether a noisier signal mitigates peer effects by garbling the information peer-behavior provides.

This employment data will be combined with expenditure and unemployment compensation data for the study.  The researchers will categorize different types of unemployment compensation (unemployment insurance, lump sum payments, and no insurance) and use sophisticated methods to analyze how the type of unemployment compensation unemployed workers receive affects affect their consumption over time.  The researchers will then develop a theory that combines the insights of both economics and psychology to explain the observed differences in consumption patterns of unemployed workers receiving different types of unemployment compensation. The researchers will then use the results to discuss policy recommendations.  The results of this research will provide valuable inputs into unemployment compensation policies in both developed and developing worlds.  The results will also be used as an input to develop policies to improve the functioning of labor markets, hence enhance economic growth both in the US and around the world.  Finally, the results of this research project can be used by individuals to plan their consumption during periods of unemployment.  <br/><br/><br/>The debate about the optimal choice between (combinations of) unemployment insurance (UI) and lump sum payment at the time of layoff focuses on the tradeoff between the disincentive from the former to the inability to smoothen consumption because of the uncertainty of unemployment duration in the case of the latter.   There is very little empirical and theoretical investigation of this tradeoff, especially in developing countries that are struggling to develop their unemployment compensation systems.  The proposed research project will use theory and large data sets to investigate how the type of unemployment compensation scheme affects the consumption trajectories of laid off workers.  The project follows a strand in the economics literature that documents consumption profiles around economic shocks. The PIs will build a new high-frequency longitudinal microdata of formal employment and expenditure for more than 400,000 individuals and exploit this dataset and a rich empirical setting with multiple sources of variation in unemployment insurance schemes across workers to document new empirical findings. The project will then estimate structural models of behaviors that explain these consumption patterns and evaluate their ability to explain the empirical observations. The project will then use the estimated models to discuss policy implications for unemployment compensation schemes, particularly for developing countries. The results of this research project will provide critical inputs into the formulation of unemployment compensations schemes and other labor market policies, improve the functioning of labor markets and in the process, increase economic growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will use modern sophisticated methods to study the benefits and costs of labor movements across countries, within countries, and within cities. Many of the issues associated with labor migration are likely to increase in the future and understanding the possible spillover effects from migration is an important concern in the United States and the world.  For example, many large cities in the world are facing congestion and environmental stress and whether and how to invest in transportation infrastructure is a key question to be discussed now.  Understanding how to develop policies to maximize the role of migration as a poverty-reduction strategy has great promise for development around the world.  The results of this research will provide guidance on policy relating to labor markets, urbanization, and international relations, thus helping the US develop well-informed policies that enhance economic growth as well understanding the possible spillover effects from migration. This is an important concern in the United States and the world.  <br/><br/>The proposal contains three interlinked projects to study internal and cross-border migration. The first project seeks to quantify the heterogeneity in returns to migration through a two-stage RCT. Prospective internal migrant will be offered either ""low"" or ""high"" subsidies. Some of those who receive ""low"" subsidies will be surprised with a ""high"" subsidy after they have made a migration decision. The second project will use an observational panel data and a suite of experiments to study the economic effects and distributional consequences of a large public transportation investment. The third project develops and estimates a binational regional spatial equilibrium model of migration focusing on the US-Mexico border migration using a dataset of Mexico-US migration flows.  Providing quantitative and rigorous evidence of the benefits and costs of migration is indispensable now when there is increasing urbanization, movement of people across borders, and migration is a controversial topic world-wide. The proposed research will generate new datasets and disseminate the research findings.

To date, most visualization tools have been designed to support open-ended exploration of patterns in data; though useful for some tasks, this exploratory model does not fit well when analysts have existing models or hypotheses.  This project aims to support a ""concept-driven"" analysis style in which analysts can share their existing conceptual models with the system, which uses those models to generate visualizations that allow the analyst to explore places where the models and data disagree and develop revised models that reconcile those discrepancies.  To do this, the research team will design a number of prototype techniques for communicating conceptual models, algorithms for selecting visualizations and data features that best match those models, and interfaces that highlight discrepancies and provide tools for analysts to dig into the data around them.  If successful, these concept-driven analyses will provide better ways for scientists and other analysts with existing models to leverage data while reducing the risk of confirmation biases in which people choose analyses that don't show where their existing models are wrong. The project will also enable the research team to learn more about the ways people come to form and express expectations about data.  Lastly, project will provide opportunities for graduate research training as well as tools to support K-12 outreach workshops that introduce younger students to data science.<br/><br/>The project has two main activities.  The first involves prototyping three elicitation techniques that prompt users to externalize their mental models and expectations about a dataset: free text expressions combined with natural language processing techniques that extract both variables of interest and implied relationships between them; concept mapping tools that allow users to graphically express relationships between entities, ideas, and concepts as node-link diagrams in which the nodes represent key aspects of the data and links represent suspected relationships between them; and tools for sketching expected relationships between variables using existing visualizations such as line charts and heatmaps.  The team will also develop interfaces that encourage analysts to develop several alternative models to reduce the chance of confirmation bias.  The second main activity is using the captured models to generate relevant visualizations that support discrepancy exploration.  To do this, the team will first use a taxonomy of best practices for choosing visualizations that best fit the concepts and relationships represented in the models.  They will then design interfaces that highlight discrepancies in both the visualizations (for instance, by highlighting data that badly fits a model) and the models (for instance, by highlighting links in a concept map that are not supported by the data) to call attention to inconsistencies.  Both the elicitation and feedback interfaces will be refined through a series of semi-structured visual analysis studies in which participants use them to analyze data in domains of general interest such as socioeconomic indices, crime statistics, and health risks.  The refined versions will then be used to compare the effectiveness of the concept-driven approach with more traditional exploratory approaches, as well as against both structured and unstructured workflows that interleave exploratory and concept-driven elements, in a series of lab studies using participants drawn from a number of scientific disciplines and a case study with scientific partners at Argonne National Laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current nanomanufacturing processes involve complex time- and energy-consuming steps, require meticulous regulation of the assembly environment, and, generally do not allow hierarchical organization across length-scales (from nano to macro). This project investigates directed epitaxial assembly that enables the efficient fabrication of hierarchical mesostructured materials using the building blocks of life -- like silk. Such a capability allows integration of mesoscaled features in three-dimensional materials and the manufacture of multifunctional materials with enhanced mechanical, heat transfer and mass transport properties. Hierarchical mesostructured materials are, in fact, a new class of materials with increasing importance in the design of the next generation of high tech materials. Additionally, the basic understanding nanoscale assembly phenomena in natural polymers liaises the rules of fabrication in living matter with technology.  The outcomes of this project have the potential to greatly impact national economy and general welfare, with ramification in the NSF's Big Ideas of the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier and Understanding the Rules of Life. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of the study, which involves nanomanufacturing, material science, protein engineering, thermodynamics and biochemistry, helps broaden participation of young scientists and underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The objective of this CAREER project is to understand and exploit the orchestration of forces and fields that enable the nanomanufacturing of structural biopolymers in hierarchical mesostructured materials, mimicking processes that occur in living organisms. This basic understanding defines a new nanomanufacturing paradigm that enables the formation of complex architectures at the mesoscale. The major barriers to this vision are a poor understanding of the phenomena that modulate biopolymer assembly and the lack of fabrication techniques that blend bottom-up and top-down approaches in complex systems. In this study, thermodynamic principles, directed assembly, additive manufacturing and protein engineering provide the basic tools to explore and harness structural proteins folding, assembly and fusion. In particular, epitaxial growth of structural proteins, e.g., silk, is studied at the nanoscale using design principles that liaise the sequence-structure-assembly properties of polypeptides and that allow for their use as seed materials to template and direct assembly processes. This basic understanding enables the nanomanufacturing of biopolymer-based hierarchical mesostructured materials, unattainable with current nanomanufacturing techniques, that exhibit enhanced toughness and resilience, selective mass transport and modular heat dissipation, impacting several technological fields that span biomedical, agriculture, aerospace, automotive, microelectronics and energy applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the investigator focuses on the divergence in incomes per capita within Europe before the Industrial Revolution. Economic historians have recently suggested several competing explanations for this divergence, but many of these explanations are rooted in the events that took place around the time or in the aftermath of the Black Death (1347-1350). Therefore, this research constructs new measures of economic activity starting from 1300 in order to explore the factors that contributed to sustained economic growth in Northwestern Europe but hindered it elsewhere. The investigator utilizes a unique data source -- revenues of the Catholic Church -- to study how various regions responded to the Black Death. Given the limitations of the existing data, it remains unclear whether, and via which channels, the massive population losses during the Black Death can be linked to the divergent growth paths of European economies after 1500. The resulting database will illuminate some of the long-standing questions in economic growth and also improve our understanding of pre-modern society.<br/><br/>In the recent years, economic historians have suggested several competing explanations for the divergence in the incomes per capita between Europe and Asia, as well as within Europe, before the Industrial Revolution. Many of these explanations are rooted in the events that took place around the time or in the aftermath of the Black Death. With the exception of a handful of countries, however, the existing data on incomes in the late Middle Ages is fragmented and ill-suited for testing these hypotheses. This research uses data on revenues of the Catholic Church, which were collected as the taxes on clergy, to measure the dynamics of regional inequality in Europe in a more direct fashion. The Catholic Church was a uniquely cohesive and capable institution that used advanced bookkeeping methods, routinely updated registries of its personnel, and transferred vast amounts of wealth all over Europe. Besides its geographic scope, the assembled panel-like database has the following advantages: (i) Church revenues are available at annual intervals right before, during the course of, and immediately after the Black Death; (ii) the primary spatial unit is diocese, which allows the researcher to study subnational variation in income levels; (iii) at a given point in time, most transactions were made in the same currency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flowering plants dominate the majority of terrestrial ecosystems and most depend on animal pollinators to complete their lifecycle. Biologists hypothesize that the interaction with pollinators ultimately increases the number of flowering plants over time. However, important details are lacking about how this might be happening. Flower color, shape, and size are widely understood to reflect adaptation to pollinators. Yet, emerging evidence indicates that microscopic changes in floral features may also have large effects in driving new species to evolve. This project will investigate how biochemical, microscopic and macroscopic traits of flowers vary with different animal pollinators in the water-willow genus, Justicia. Researchers will determine the evolutionary relationships among Justicia species native to North, Central and South America to analyze trait data, including field-based observations of pollinator behavior. The project will train high school, undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups and community college students, as well as a post-doctoral research associate. Researchers will provide outreach to the public about the ecological and economic importance of pollination biology through educational exhibits at the University of Colorado Boulder Museum of Natural History and Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that variation in morphological traits intimately involved with the reproductive success of flowering plants are inter-correlated and are associated with functional groups of animal visitors.

Precise assessment and prediction of patient status in the ICU can enable early interventions, and can result in improved patient outcomes. However, today's ICUs still face many barriers for assessing and predicting patient status. First, essential information such as pain and functional status are not captured automatically, but rather are repetitively measured by overburdened ICU nurses, with new assessments added each year. Second, existing methods for predicting patient status have limited accuracy and are used infrequently (e.g. every 24 hours as opposed to in real-time). This leads to missing opportunities for early interventions. Finally, existing models cannot automatically incorporate family caregiver feedback for improved patient status prediction. Together, these challenges point to the critical need for developing several fundamental intelligent building blocks of future ICUs. These building blocks should address: (a) how to learn new patient status prediction models without compromising performance on previous prediction models, (b) how to handle the complex clinical data for precise prediction of patient outcome, and (c) how to incorporate family caregiver feedback into the prediction models.<br/><br/>This project will pursue three specific research objectives that will address these issues: (1) Lifelong Multi-Task Learning: Novel multi-task deep learning models will be developed for recognizing clinical expressions and functional activities related to pain and functional status assessments. These models will be customized in an innovative manner to maximize information sharing among related tasks. (2) Multi-Scale and Dynamic Learning: Novel multi-scale recurrent neural networks will be developed to predict precise patient outcomes while handling multiple temporal scales and implicit input changes over time. (3) Continual Opportunistic Learning: Novel active deep learning models will be developed to query the labels of the most informative data points for improving the models over time, with minimum burden on users. The proposed project will bring together novel elements of machine learning algorithms and critical care medicine. This will represent the first attempt to autonomously assess pain and functional status in the ICU, to predict precise patient trajectory from high-resolution data, and to improve predictive clinical models through user feedback. In addition, the research will be impactful because what is learned here, will contribute to a broader understanding of future design considerations for the next generation of lifelong learning systems and intelligent hospitals. The PI will also provide a highly-integrated research and educational program for Florida high school teachers and students, and University of Florida (UF) undergraduate students in the context of the intelligent ICU. The PI proposes to: (1) sponsor summer internships for math teachers, (2) organize an Intelligent Machines workshop on coding and machine intelligence for the high school students, and (3) develop focused research and training activities for undergraduate students.

However, with the increase in the size and complexity of spatial data, traditional desktop-based analysis is inadequate for the task, and there is a need to accelerate compute-intensive spatial applications on modern computers and supercomputers to get results in real-time. This requires new software design and implementation, as well as efficient algorithms for spatial query, join and overlay that can scale with the data and the available hardware resources.

The second objective is to inject spatial data awareness into the existing Message Passing Interface (MPI)-based Geographic Information System (GIS), and incorporate new features to leverage high performace computing resources by using specialized software packages. A new load balancing technique will be developed that works during the file partitioning phase by non-contiguous file reading supported by the MPI library.<br/><br/>The MPI-Vector-IO library will enable efficient parallel input/output on large polygonal datasets stored on parallel filesystems, thus improving the state-of-the-art.

With each breath in, the device generates a vacuum that helps lift the chest and abdomen, helping the patient breathe in.  With each breath out, the device increases pressure over the chest and helps the patient breath out faster.  By assisting the work of breathing, patients no longer feel short of breath and can once again engage in normal daily activities. The device promotes a healthy breathing cycle, which prevents hyperinflation of the airways and degeneration of alveoli in the lungs. Noninvasive ventilation and pulmonary rehabilitation have both been shown to have significant, positive effects on the quality of life and medical outcomes of COPD patients. The technology aims to improve patient's well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will explore two innovative aspects. First, control will be distributed. That is, a large number of sensors and actuators will be spread throughout the manipulator, and information gathered by each sensor will be used to control only a small number of nearby actuators. This distributed control strategy avoids the transmission of large amounts of data across the structure, and eliminates the need for a powerful central computer to process this flood of data. Second, the control law will be iterative. That is, the soft manipulator will learn to achieve its objectives over multiple attempts. Although the approach taken is not explicitly based on biological behavior, both these features are present in animals that manipulate objects using compliant appendages. Computer simulations will be used to study performance of the new control laws on extremely complex robots, with hundreds of individually controllable segments. Physical experiments will be conducted on systems with between five and ten such segments. The modeling and control approaches will advance the national health and economic prosperity, by enabling reliable autonomous operation of soft multi-segment robots, to increase their usability in numerous applications, including manufacturing, surgery, search and rescue, navigation, and personal home assistance.<br/><br/>This project will explore novel distributed planning and control approaches for multi-segment soft robotic systems.

Flowering plants dominate the majority of terrestrial ecosystems and most depend on animal pollinators to complete their lifecycle. Biologists hypothesize that the interaction with pollinators ultimately increases the number of flowering plants over time. However, important details are lacking about how this might be happening. Flower color, shape, and size are widely understood to reflect adaptation to pollinators. Yet, emerging evidence indicates that microscopic changes in floral features may also have large effects in driving new species to evolve. This project will investigate how biochemical, microscopic and macroscopic traits of flowers vary with different animal pollinators in the water-willow genus, Justicia. Researchers will determine the evolutionary relationships among Justicia species native to North, Central and South America to analyze trait data, including field-based observations of pollinator behavior. The project will train high school, undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups and community college students, as well as a post-doctoral research associate. Researchers will provide outreach to the public about the ecological and economic importance of pollination biology through educational exhibits at the University of Colorado Boulder Museum of Natural History and Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that variation in morphological traits intimately involved with the reproductive success of flowering plants are inter-correlated and are associated with functional groups of animal visitors. Researchers will investigate the evolutionary history of New World Justicia (Acanthaceae; the Acanthus family), whose ca. 400 species show remarkable diversity in micro-morphological floral traits essential to reproduction, including anthers, pollen and stigmas, and support a range of vertebrate and invertebrate pollinators. Outcomes of the research will include a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for New World Justicia species based on nuclear genomic data, a quantitative analysis of macro- and micro-morphological variation in relationship to pollinator type, and improved taxonomic circumscriptions for this widespread yet poorly characterized lineage. Research will facilitate the discovery and description of species new to science, build herbarium research collections, and expand ethological information about pollinating animals. Targeted fieldwork in five Neotropical countries will strengthen international collaborations among US and Latin American scientists and facilitate investigation of this species-rich lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award funds research that incorporates more realistic assumptions about individual and household behavior into macroeconomic modeling. Dr. Angeletos and his team will conduct several projects to understand the empirical, quantitative and policy relevance of this alternative approach to understanding macroeconomic outcomes. The research has transformative potential.  The new model of economy-wide market efficiency assumes that individuals are boundedly rational (that is, they are sometimes inattentive or have limited cognitive abilities).  The result promises to be new theories about the causes of business cycle fluctuations.  These new results would be extremely useful for policy makers in many contexts, including the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy. The result would be a direct contribution to performance and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. <br/><br/>The researcher will examine how frictions in information, attention, and cognition affect belief formation, coordination, and the overall outcomes that can be achieved in large economies. Specific contributions include: (1) A parsimonious structural interpretation of salient features of macroeconomic data. (2) A new formalization of the Keynesian multiplier widely used in macroeconomics that does not depend on unrealistic assumptions about nominal rigidity and policy constraints. This formalization may help to explain why aggregate demand shocks can trigger a recession. (3) A theory of why general equilibrium mechanisms may be less potent, or more slow-moving, than is usually presumed in macroeconomics. This theory can also explain the economy may respond to shocks and policy shifts as if the agents were discounting the future heavily. The new theory will be evaluated against empirical evidence. (4) New insights into the effects of monetary and fiscal policy during liquidity tramps, including a resolution to the forward-guidance puzzle and a rationale for front-loading fiscal stimuli. (5) Re-examining fiscal multipliers and Ricardian equivalence, along with a new approach to the equilibrium determinacy of the Neo-Keynesian model and the role of Taylor rules.

Professor Walczak and his students develop new methods to make carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, the most abundant biopolymers, are involved in energy storage in the body.  They also control molecular recognition events in the body. This research develops versatile methods for the synthesis of bioactive glycosides and glycopeptides.  This research enables comprehensive studies on the function of carbohydrates in biology, and facilitates the preparation of high-value biological compounds and pharmaceutical agents. The synthetic approaches specifically enable the preparation of anti-diabetic drugs and anti-tumor antibiotics.  Professor Walczak's group is well positioned to educate and train students from groups that are underrepresented in science. Outreach activities focus on improving science awareness in the local communities, specifically through education at the high school level and public presentations. The education program integrates efforts at the department and university levels to create a collaborative community of researchers working at the interface of chemistry and biology.<br/><br/>This research develops versatile new methodologies for the synthesis of bioactive saccharides, primarily glycosides and glycopeptides.  A majority of known methods to synthesize saccharides focus on substrates in which the anomeric position is substituted with an electronegative element. This approach bears several limitations such as substrate dependence, the need for protective group manipulations, and incompatibility with free alcohol groups. The central hypothesis of this NSF CAREER award is that configurationally stable anomeric nucleophiles are engaged in stereospecific (stereoretentive) reactions under transition metal-catalyzed conditions,  forming carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds with high selectivities.  These moieties are independent from the nature of the substrates and catalysts. Capitalizing on these new conceptual foundations, three specific aims are pursued: (a) the development of cross-coupling reactions of anomeric boronic acids, (b) the implementation of new chemical methods for the synthesis of carbon-glycosides, and (c) the development of new methods in the synthesis of nitrogen-linked glycoproteins. Successful realization of these aims yields novel umpolung methods that eliminate the critical problems inherent to the previous approaches. The synthetic approaches also enable the preparation of anti-diabetic drugs, anti-tumor antibiotics, glycoproteins, and glycopeptides under standardized and user-friendly conditions. The research program is also intimately connected with ongoing educational and outreach activities. An undergraduate course featuring blended learning supplemented by randomized trial to improve undergraduate pedagogy is being developed and implemented. The outreach activities focus on mentoring high-school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This year's Lectures will take the format of a workshop on recent developments in mean curvature flow, a mathematical model for the deformation of surfaces (and higher-dimensional objects) that decreases area most rapidly.  The workshop is aimed at graduate students and early career researchers, as well as researchers from related applied fields in which processes like the mean curvature flow naturally arise. The workshop will consist of a one-day introductory course on mean curvature flow, followed by a series of longer form survey lectures from a selection of preeminent researchers which will introduce participants to some of the most important recent breakthroughs in the field. These lecture series will be supported by auxiliary talks from further leading researchers and a series of short talks by graduate students and early career researchers.<br/><br/>Geometric flows, such as the mean curvature flow, have proved to be a powerful tool in the analysis of a large number of important problems in differential geometry, image processing and mathematical physics, leading to a profound impact on each of these fields. They also arise naturally in such diverse physical contexts as thermomechanics, annealing metals, crystal growth, flame propagation, wearing processes and conformal field theory, where they model physical processes involving interfaces and surface energies. The mean curvature flow is the prototypical geometric flow equation and, as such, tools developed to understand its behavior often lead to insights into the behavior of other flow-based models. The main themes to be explored at the workshop will be the uniqueness, rigidity and genericity of cylindrical singularities, the classification of ancient and soliton solutions, and recently developed entropy and noncollapsing methods.<br/><br/>Conference website: http://www.math.utk.edu/barrett/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

UV light is a harmful to DNA and proteins. In flowering plants, pollen is particularly susceptible to UV damage, but dark pigments in flower petals may protect the pollen by absorbing UV light. The intensity of UV light reaching Earth has increased greatly during the 20th century and may continue to increase, especially in some regions. This project explores whether protective pigmentation in flowers has increased in response to increasing amounts of UV light.  Because flower color is important for attracting pollinators, understanding how it may have changed is necessary to understand how effectiveness of pollination may also have changed.  Pollination effectiveness, in turn, is important for the economic success of many agricultural crops and for the ecological well-being of all flowering plants. This project will also provide research experiences and mentoring for students from underrepresented groups, and will engage the general public through outreach activities at multiple events.<br/><br/>Researchers will test the prediction that temporal increases in UV-B radiation have driven increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation in the petals of flowers. Because UV-B has increased most in polar and temperate regions during the last century, they predict that species with polar and temperate distributions will display larger increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation than sub-tropical species. Additionally, the researchers will test the prediction that species with pollen-bearing structures exposed to sunlight will respond to changes in UV-B, while those with pollen structures recessed within the flower (protected) will not. Researchers will use herbarium specimens and bioclimatic databases to gather data on flower pigmentation and abiotic conditions for 75 diverse taxa with different geographic distributions. They will also sample color across a 55-year time span and will use comparative models to assess whether rapid changes in UV-B have elicited rapid change in flower coloration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first goal is to measure more accurately how residential segregation by income has evolved in the last decade. The second goal is to analyze how changes in the income composition of neighborhoods ? such as neighborhoods that are gentrifying or becoming more impoverished ? are tied to outcomes for individual families. What kinds of people are entering, leaving, and staying in changing neighborhoods?  Where do they come from and where do they go? What are the implications for their welfare? Neighborhood changes, changing forms of separation between more affluent and less affluent families, and minority access to better neighborhoods have a strong bearing on urban development related to housing inequality, affordable housing, and school disparities.<br/><br/>This study analyzes trends in income segregation since 2000, addressing two aspects of these trends. The first question is how measures of segregation are affected by the reduction in sample sizes in the American Community Survey (ACS), which scholars now rely on for data at the census tract level. There is good reason to believe that direct measures are biased upwards as sample sizes decline, so that results may show increasing segregation even if there has been no real change. The project will apply new methods of correcting for sample bias to the original sample data in a federal Research Data Center. Working with confidential data ameliorates other methodological limitations in published data including: 1) the suppression of data by race/ethnicity in tracts with small numbers of minority residents and 2) top-coding of the income distribution. The second question is how changes in the income composition of neighborhoods are produced through patterns of residential mobility. The project will make use of the original records from Census 2000 and 2010 and the 2008-2012 ACS that can be linked over time. The study will select neighborhoods that have experienced gentrification, poor neighborhoods that have become poorer, and affluent neighborhoods that have become more exclusive. In each type of neighborhood, it is possible to identify the number and characteristics of residents who remain from 2000 to 2010, who leave, and who enter.  This research will offer new insight into how individual-level (mobility) behaviors aggregate to macro-level (neighborhood) outcomes, which is an enduring issue in social science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This site is supported by the NSF Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, in partnership with the Department of Defense. This program in WWU's Department of Chemistry provides research projects and professional development for students from community colleges and small four-year universities with limited research opportunities. Among the recruited participants, an emphasis is placed on underrepresented minorities from community colleges. Under the guidance of a faculty mentor, the students perform research in the areas of biochemistry, synthetic chemistry, or materials chemistry. In addition to providing an authentic research experience for these students, this program facilitates student transitions from community colleges to four-year universities, thus increasing the likelihood of these students obtaining an advanced degree in the sciences. The research training and workshops for REU participants provides them with training towards a career in chemistry, or a related science, and contributes to increasing the diversity of the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>The student participants choose a research project from one of three main areas of chemistry: biochemistry (structure, function and engineering of proteins and nucleic acids), synthetic chemistry (organic and organometallic method development, natural product synthesis, small molecule activation, biomaterials), or materials chemistry (nanomaterials, solar concentrators, heterogeneous catalysis, computational methods). This program also provides workshops that improve students' perspectives on how to conduct research, communicate scientifically, and initiate their career in chemistry. In addition to numerous formal and informal activities for the entire group of REU participants, divisional groups (biochemistry, synthetic chemistry, and materials chemistry) are used to provide additional training that is specific to the research area, including workshops and combined group meetings. Many projects are also collaborative between multiple investigators at WWU, allowing the REU students to interact with more faculty members and get exposure to a broader scope of research topics. The culmination of the summer program is a symposium in which REU participants give poster presentations on their research projects in addition to keynote speakers from each of the three research areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The organizing committee will assess this first effort to decide if this effort should continue, hoping that in-depth training of PhD students annually will produce analytically savvy cohorts of future leaders of quantitative paleobiology equipped to spearhead future developments in the field. As importantly, the training will produce life-long contributors (and users) of an earth science cyber-infrastructure that has been rapidly growing in recent years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The economic impact from blooms of these algae can be devastating to fishing and shellfish industries and tourism.  However, bioactive compounds and molecules produced by these toxic algae have also become an interesting and exciting avenue for innovative basic and applied research.  The Algal Resources Collection (ARC) at the University of North Carolina Wilmington is the only public collection exclusively dedicated to toxic microalgae in the United States.  Currently comprising 424 algal strains, ARC is a major supplier of toxic algae strains for scientists all over the world.  Cultures have been extensively used by national and international research community in studies encompassing diverse subject areas, including ecology, taxonomy and phylogeny, comparative genomics, studies on the effects of algal toxins on human and animal health, and for the development of toxin profiles.  Cultures are also used to develop alternative solutions for the monitoring and remediation of toxic algae and toxins, as well as in the search of new bioactive compounds in the development of new drugs to treat or cure a variety of diseases.  Additionally, ARC researchers and staff are involved in outreach activities that involve diverse educational levels including K-12 teachers and students, undergraduate, graduate and PhD students.<br/><br/>This project seeks to optimize the functionality and accessibility of the ARC as a Living Stocks resource.  The main goals are: 1) Enhancement of infrastructure and procedures for the improvement of culturing conditions and workflow efficiency, 2) Improvement of the collection organization and curation practices, and 3) Increase the visibility of the collection to the research community.  These improvements will allow ARC to offer their unique cultures to a much larger portion of this scientific community, to take the final step towards the consolidation of the ARC as a community research resource, and to achieve the self-sustainability necessary for its maintenance and expansion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These types of molecules constitute a highly important class of systems due to their role in a number of important processes, such as photosynthesis and homogeneous transition-metal catalysis. Strongly correlated systems are difficult to model, in part, due to the inability to divide up the molecule into small parts (""inseparability"") to focus on only one part at a time.  This requires simulations to be performed on an entire system, which is usually far too complicated for even the world's fastest supercomputers. Prof. Mayhall's research is focused on studying the extent of this inseparability in different types of molecular systems. This knowledge will then be used to design better theories and software which start from a ""separated"" initial description, reintroducing the effects of inseparability in a slow and controlled manner, to avoid the large growth in computational complexity while maintaining accurate results. This work has the potential to contribute to technologies involving energy production and chemical catalysis. Prof. Mayhall's outreach program involves developing two sets of educational modules targeting distinct demographics.  The first is focused on inmates in regional detention facilities, and the second is directed toward female high-school students interested in STEM fields.  The latter work is done in collaboration with established activities at Virginia Tech.<br/><br/>The main goals of this project are two-fold, 1) obtain better understanding of inseparable systems, such as strongly-correlated molecules and collective excited states in molecular aggregates and materials, and 2) develop new computational methods capable of modeling these systems in a way which exploits approximate separability to obtain computational algorithms which can be effectively parallelized to run on large scale computing resources. To achieve these goals, Prof. Mayhall's research group is pursuing two distinct approaches. The first approach builds on recent work from the PI in which an approximate tensor decomposition is used to model ground and excited states in strongly correlated systems. The second approach draws on recent work in the field based on quantum embedding theories, with direct applicability to large scale parallelization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Random environments are ubiquitous to many physical systems: gases, condensed matter, chemical reaction, etc. The inherent complexity of these phenomena motivates the use of noise in their mathematical description. A fundamental challenge is to interpret how this noise affects the dynamical aspects of the system. In condensed matter physics, the lack of synchrony between random scatterers can eliminate all propagation of waves-- a phenomena known as Anderson localization. On the other hand, disordered gases exhibit high diffusivity properties, with applications in imaging. A mathematical understanding has impact on technological applications in atmospheric science, wireless communications in urban environments, physiological imaging and electronic transport in nano-structures. <br/><br/>This workshop will present recent developments on wave propagation, scattering and diffusion in random medias at the interface of probability theory, mathematical physics and partial differential equations.

Researchers use specimens to describe new species, understand the relationships between taxa, explore the environment, and conserve our natural resources as well as to train the next generations of biologists.  Collections in the Auburn University Museum of Natural History span plants and animals, with particularly strong holdings from the very diverse Gulf of Mexico coast region, and important collections from the rest of the world.  Auburn University completed a new, state-of-the-art facility for their collections in 2013.  Since moving to the new facility, the collections have seen remarkable growth, not just in terms of the number of specimens, but in the outreach that the museum is able to perform for people in the state and region.  The museum absorbed collections from other university units and orphaned collections from other institutions in the area, putting strain on the space available.  The collections stored in alcohol (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates) have grown at a particularly fast rate, and the alcohol storage area is limited because of needed safety measures for the proper storage of flammable liquids.  <br/><br/>This project will provide compactorized shelving that will dramatically increase the amount of space within the alcohol collections.  Moving invertebrate specimens from an area not currently rated for storage in ethanol into the compactors will also allow growth of the dry collections (particularly insects), which are also approaching capacity.  This project will demonstrate the complexity of managing collections and as an opportunity to teach a class in museum curation techniques to graduate students and upper level undergraduate students, and to further engage students to assist in the project.  Open house events at the Wehle Center are planned to provide programs to underserved children in the area.  Social media will be utilized to keep the public apprised of the project and the resources that the collections represent.  Digitization of the collections will be completed, and all data will be available on the museum site (aumnh.org) as well as data aggregators such as iDigBio (idigbio.org).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the world's largest collection of chytrids, it serves as a resource to the research community by providing cultures to biologists in both academic and industrial settings, resulting in biological insights found in over 200 published articles.  Although these microscopic fungi reproduce with a swimming spore they occur in soils as well as in fresh and saline waters; they fill important ecological roles as parasites and also by degrading substrates such as pollen and other plant material, insect exoskeletons, hair, etc.  Chytrids are notorious for their role in the global decline of amphibians; the collection contains over 180 strains of the amphibian pathogen from around the world.  This collection was developed and maintained by Joyce Longcore at the University of Maine without institutional support for more than 25 years.  To safeguard the chytrid collection, it will be moved to the University of Michigan's recently remodeled Research Museums Complex where it will be stored in a state-of-the-art cryopreservation facility and managed by the University's Herbarium unit. The collection will be a resource for the scientific community involved in research on chytrids and their function in terrestrial and aquatic systems.<br/><br/>Chytrid fungi require special growth and maintenance conditions, because they are aquatic fungi that reproduce with flagellated, wall-less zoospores. Most of the University of Maine collection is cryopreserved, making inter-institutional transfer in a frozen state possible, however, approximately 12% of the collection is routinely transferred in liquid cultures, because it has not been amendable to freezing. The first goal of the project is to move the collection in Maine to the Research Museums Complex in Ann Arbor where fungal strains will be stored in liquid nitrogen freezers.  Cryopreservation in the vapor of liquid nitrogen stabilizes samples at -193 degrees Celsius; because inadvertent exposure to temperatures above -80 affects the viability of frozen cultures, storage in liquid nitrogen is safer than storage in typical ultralow freezers with electrical compressors.  A second goal of this project is to develop methods to freeze and secure the remaining 12% of strains that have been resistant to cryopreservation.  To verify taxonomic assignments of the culture collection and to better characterize its contents, DNA barcoding will be performed by sequencing and making accessible the 18S and ITS ribosomal RNA gene regions.  Finally, this project will transform the collection into a public resource by making additional data about the strains accessible online and improving the distribution and maintenance of the cultures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with enabling reproducibility and justifiability of decisions in the data analysis process, specifically as it relates to visual data analysis. Visualization is an important tool for discovery, yet decisions made by humans based on visualizations of data are difficult to capture and to justify. This project will develop methods to justify, communicate, and audit decisions made based on visual analysis. This, in turn will lead to better outcomes, achieved with less effort and cost. The increasing use of visual analysis tools for decision making will make data analysis accessible to a broad variety of people, as visual analysis tools are generally easier to use than scripting languages and do not require extensive computational and statistical training. This research and its related activities increase accessibility and enhance the data analysis infrastructure for research and education.  <br/><br/>To achieve these goals, this research will develop a framework for making visual analysis sessions not only reproducible but also reusable. The approach is based on tracking semantically meaningful provenance data during an interactive visual analysis session. Once a discovery is made, analysts can use this history to curate a succinct analysis story, adding justifications and explanations to make their analysis reproducible by others. Using a semi-automatic process, analysts will be able to make their actions data-aware, so that their analysis processes become robust to changes, such as updates in the data. A second contribution of the proposed work is the integration of visual analysis into computational analysis processes. While visualization is commonly used to present computational analysis results, the results of a visual analysis session are rarely used to feed into further computational processes. The techniques developed in this project will allow analysts to feed analysis results (selections, aggregations, filters, etc.) back into a computational environment. This will make it possible to use interactive visualization at any point in the data analysis process while maintaining reproducibility and enabling reuse. The expected results include new methods to capture user intent, create data stories from analysis processes, and to integrate computational and visual data analysis, leveraging the strength of both, human abilities and computational power. The results will be disseminated in publications and in the form of open source software, and accessible via the project website (http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/projects/2018-nsf-reproducibility/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

UV light is a harmful to DNA and proteins. In flowering plants, pollen is particularly susceptible to UV damage, but dark pigments in flower petals may protect the pollen by absorbing UV light. The intensity of UV light reaching Earth has increased greatly during the 20th century and may continue to increase, especially in some regions. This project explores whether protective pigmentation in flowers has increased in response to increasing amounts of UV light.  Because flower color is important for attracting pollinators, understanding how it may have changed is necessary to understand how effectiveness of pollination may also have changed.  Pollination effectiveness, in turn, is important for the economic success of many agricultural crops and for the ecological well-being of all flowering plants. This project will also provide research experiences and mentoring for students from underrepresented groups, and will engage the general public through outreach activities at multiple events.<br/><br/>Researchers will test the prediction that temporal increases in UV-B radiation have driven increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation in the petals of flowers. Because UV-B has increased most in polar and temperate regions during the last century, they predict that species with polar and temperate distributions will display larger increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation than sub-tropical species. Additionally, the researchers will test the prediction that species with pollen-bearing structures exposed to sunlight will respond to changes in UV-B, while those with pollen structures recessed within the flower (protected) will not. Researchers will use herbarium specimens and bioclimatic databases to gather data on flower pigmentation and abiotic conditions for 75 diverse taxa with different geographic distributions. They will also sample color across a 55-year time span and will use comparative models to assess whether rapid changes in UV-B have elicited rapid change in flower coloration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports a symposium which will take place as a component of the 2018 Annual Meeting of the Developmental Neurotoxicology Society (DNTS). The symposium will bring together major contributors to the field of adolescent brain development. Presentations will address numerous topics such as (a) how endocannabinoids impact cortical development; (b) what neuroimaging has revealed about cortical network development; (c) how discord between impulsivity and control contribute to risky behaviors, and (d) how exposure to common stimulants  contribute to  abnormal brain functioning.  Experience-dependent plasticity will also be discussed.  Conference attendees will be researchers, policy makers, basic scientists, clinical researchers,  and government representatives (e.g., Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control).

What constitutes the innovation capital of the economy? By addressing these questions from a novel perspective, this research will advance our knowledge about some of the most important issues that relate to national prosperity and welfare. The investigator also identifies a new source of market failure that is very likely to attract future research in this area.<br/> <br/>This research contains three projects. The first is concerned with where innovation resources go, how they are allocated across different R&D areas. The theory developed shows that the market allocates excessive innovation resources to high return areas relative to the social optima, as appeared to be the case in the dot.com boom. The source of the inefficiency is the lack of property rights on open problems that combined with R&D resources, give rise to innovations. It is a novel contribution of this project to recognize this source of inefficiency, and examine the specific channels and its potential magnitude. The second project is concerned with the incentives to innovate versus imitate and the interaction of the two forces in driving growth. Intellectual property rights affect the way in which innovators and imitators split the surplus created by knowledge transfer. This project further examines the impact on long run growth and welfare.

Lake productivity is also influenced by inputs of organic molecules from the watershed which compete with algae for light and, at high concentrations, can result in tea-colored water. Inputs of nutrients and organic molecules from the watershed vary substantially from lake to lake and change through time as well. The researchers will study the implications of watershed inputs for lake water quality, food webs, and other benefits humans derive from lakes. Their research will experimentally test and refine a mathematical model of lake productivity and ultimately predict the response of lakes to watershed inputs of nutrients and organic molecules that vary across the landscape and through time.

Dr. Do is also engaging in hands-on laboratory training and mentoring of young chemists to prepare them to become the next generation of scientific leaders. <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Do at the University of Houston (UH) is developing new sustainable routes to access technologically useful polyolefins. This research seeks to eliminate the need to use expensive alpha olefin co-monomers in the preparation of low- and medium-density polyethylene and to overcome the tendency of transition metal catalysts to be inhibited by polar vinyl olefins. Dr. Do's bimetallic catalysts take advantage of metal-metal cooperativity to achieve reactivity patterns that are distinct from those of conventional monometallic catalysts. These studies are being guided by mechanistic investigations using spectroscopic tools to interrogate the nature of observable reaction intermediates and computational methods to evaluate the energy barriers of discrete reaction steps. This work is critical to our understanding of olefin polymerization catalysis and may provide insights into where catalyst design improvements could be made. Dr. Do is also initiating educational outreach plans that will introduce young students to the chemical profession. The objectives of Dr. Do's educational activities are to make learning chemistry accessible to the general public and give chemistry majors at UH the practical skills that they need to be successful in their independent careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In practice, representations of large graphs need to be partitioned and stored on a cluster of machines to ensure the desired response time and throughput. Such a classic cross-server partitioning problem has been extensively studied and has been shown to be highly complex. Furthermore, modern deep storage architecture further complicates the problem with the need of ""cross-hierarchy"" partitioning, i.e., placing graphs into different layers of the storage systems. This change makes existing solutions inadequate. This research aims to pursue a holistic approach that exploits both graph structure and workload characteristics to achieve better performance for distributed graph representations in future deep storage architecture.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project includes two synergistic research tasks, together forming a novel graph partitioning solution for deep storage architecture. The first task focuses on an online graph placement algorithm, which could instantly distribute the continuously arriving graph vertices and edges to proper server and specific internal storage layer based on an elaborate heuristic score. Building upon the first task, the second task focuses on adjusting current partitions dynamically according to the workloads. This adjustment is based on a new promotion/demotion algorithm that not only promotes/demotes a single vertex but also changes the priorities of its neighbors according to the Matthew Effect.<br/><br/>With the increasing importance of large graph structures and the emergence of new storage technologies, existing graph storage systems experience significant challenges towards graph partitioning. This research effort aims towards building highly efficient distributed graph storage systems in future storage architecture. In addition, this project integrates the research activities with education and outreach efforts to train broadly inclusive and globally competitive science workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Campanian Ignimbrite, which erupted from the Campi Flegrei near Naples, Italy, 40,000 years ago, is the deposit from one of the youngest truly large pyroclastic density currents on Earth. The currents reached over 80 km from the vent and devastated an area currently occupied by more than 4 million people. Traditional models for these currents assume they are tens to perhaps 100 meters thick, but our past work shows the Campanian current moved as a kilometer-thick flow across the landscape, overtopping ridges 1.5 times that height.  This great mobility makes this sort of ""expanded"" pyroclastic density current much more hazardous and the damage less predictable. This dilute current required an enormous amount of gas, more than can be explained by the amount dissolved in the magma prior to eruption.  Two other possible sources are the entrainment of air and the involvement of water from a hot hydrothermal system within the volcano. This project will determine the amounts of gas from the magma, air, and hydrothermal system involved in the current. This information will be used to make better predictions of which volcanoes might produce highly mobile currents and design hazards maps that take this mobility into account. Two undergraduate students, two graduate students, a post-doctoral researcher, and a professor will work on this project at Northern Arizona University and a graduate student and a professor will work at Oxford University. Three Italian researchers will also collaborate in this project. The results may be used for hazards assessments and response plans, including for the US Naval Support Activity in Naples.<br/><br/>A recent thermal magnetization study of the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) found the temperature of emplacement was above 580 oC even at 80 km from the vent. This limits how much air could have been incorporated, but, to calculate precise quantities, a better knowledge of the magmatic temperature and whether other sources of gas, such as magmatic gas and hydrothermal fluids, were significant, is needed. This project will include 1) field investigations to better characterize the CI stratigraphy and link distal and proximal deposits and define the relative timing of volcanic events; 2) complete volatile analysis (H2O, CO2, S, F and Cl) of melt inclusions and apatite microphenocrysts via Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ion probe, and electron microprobe. Back-calculating volatile concentrations during open-system degassing is a new technique that should reveal much about the Campanian Ignimbrite magma history; and 3) a study of the glass transition temperature at varying strain rates and residual water contents to better define the emplacement temperature. Current models and interpretations of datasets may need to be modified to include the potential role of hydrothermal fluids in ""supercharging"" an eruption, as hydrothermal water does not appear in many petrologic measurements of gases. A model for explosive eruptions that includes the potential contribution of erupted hydrothermal systems will help define volcanic hazards more accurately and may elucidate a possible cause for paroxysmal pyroclastic density current-producing eruptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microscopic algae and aquatic plants strongly influence the benefits that humans derive from lakes, because they influence water quality and are the foundation of the food web supporting species important to commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries. The abundance and growth rate of algae contribute to lake productivity, and lake productivity is affected by inputs of natural and human-derived nutrients, primarily phosphorus and nitrogen. Lake productivity is also influenced by inputs of organic molecules from the watershed which compete with algae for light and, at high concentrations, can result in tea-colored water. Inputs of nutrients and organic molecules from the watershed vary substantially from lake to lake and change through time as well. The researchers will study the implications of watershed inputs for lake water quality, food webs, and other benefits humans derive from lakes. Their research will experimentally test and refine a mathematical model of lake productivity and ultimately predict the response of lakes to watershed inputs of nutrients and organic molecules that vary across the landscape and through time. The project will support the training of six undergraduate students, including students from Puerto Rico and Native American populations. These students will conduct independent research projects as part of a ten-week field ecology program. <br/><br/>The researchers will use replicated mesocosm experiments, a comparative study across broad natural gradients, and a whole-lake manipulation to test hypotheses drawn from their mathematical model of lake productivity. First, predicted counteracting effects of terrestrially-derived organic carbon and nutrients will be evaluated using replicated mesocosms subjected to supplies of these elements in varied ratios. Second, the project will use a comparative survey of lake food web productivity to test predictions for how lake size alters the effect of terrestrial organic carbon and nutrients. Third, the researchers will embrace the full complexity of natural ecosystems in a whole-lake manipulation of terrestrial organic carbon and nutrient inputs. Finally, following refinement of the mathematical model of lake productivity based on experimental results, the researchers will use a global meta-analysis to test the general applicability of the mathematical model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flowering plants dominate the majority of terrestrial ecosystems and most depend on animal pollinators to complete their lifecycle. Biologists hypothesize that the interaction with pollinators ultimately increases the number of flowering plants over time. However, important details are lacking about how this might be happening. Flower color, shape, and size are widely understood to reflect adaptation to pollinators. Yet, emerging evidence indicates that microscopic changes in floral features may also have large effects in driving new species to evolve. This project will investigate how biochemical, microscopic and macroscopic traits of flowers vary with different animal pollinators in the water-willow genus, Justicia. Researchers will determine the evolutionary relationships among Justicia species native to North, Central and South America to analyze trait data, including field-based observations of pollinator behavior. The project will train high school, undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups and community college students, as well as a post-doctoral research associate. Researchers will provide outreach to the public about the ecological and economic importance of pollination biology through educational exhibits at the University of Colorado Boulder Museum of Natural History and Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that variation in morphological traits intimately involved with the reproductive success of flowering plants are inter-correlated and are associated with functional groups of animal visitors. Researchers will investigate the evolutionary history of New World Justicia (Acanthaceae; the Acanthus family), whose ca. 400 species show remarkable diversity in micro-morphological floral traits essential to reproduction, including anthers, pollen and stigmas, and support a range of vertebrate and invertebrate pollinators. Outcomes of the research will include a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for New World Justicia species based on nuclear genomic data, a quantitative analysis of macro- and micro-morphological variation in relationship to pollinator type, and improved taxonomic circumscriptions for this widespread yet poorly characterized lineage. Research will facilitate the discovery and description of species new to science, build herbarium research collections, and expand ethological information about pollinating animals. Targeted fieldwork in five Neotropical countries will strengthen international collaborations among US and Latin American scientists and facilitate investigation of this species-rich lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is a partnership between institutions with a strong focus on serving underrepresented communities of students, and the investigators are committed to participating in K-12 and undergraduate mentorship programs through their respective institutions.

To uncover these links, the investigators will (1) quantify seasonal and diel dynamics under ambient conditions in a benthic marine community, (2) conduct factorial manipulations of two climatic stressors - increased carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures - and measure impacts on physiology, diversity, and productivity, and (3) conduct a second field experiment to evaluate whether productivity responses are due to changes in physiology or biodiversity. Climatic changes have the potential to influence ecosystem functioning by altering physiology, abundance, and community structure (i.e., biodiversity), and this research specifically aims to partition these different pathways, leading to more effective predictions of impacts on benthic marine ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, mimicking the molecules of life (one of the NSF ""Grand Challenges"" for 21st century science) presents an opportunity to controllably harness this power to benefit humanity. Currently, many medicines are adaptations of molecules produced by living organisms. By constructing artificial analogs of the enzymes that Nature uses to build molecules, new potential medicines may be discovered. In this project, Dr. Gorske is developing enzyme mimics to accomplish this goal. The design of these enzyme mimics is allowing undergraduates to construct them with minimal training. This is enabling students to gain experience conducting meaningful research prior to choosing a major. Such early access to these research experiences, which include both summer research internships and course-related laboratories, is stimulating interest in pursuing science as a career. Especially, underprepared and underrepresented students and groups are being exposed to STEM fields. In the process, students are contributing directly to the development of new technology for facilitating the discovery of urgently needed medicines.<br/><br/><br/>With support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Gorske of Bowdoin College is developing biomimetic catalysts for nucleophilic trifluoromethylations that deliver enantiopure alpha-trifluoromethyl alcohol and beta-trifluoromethyl carbonyl subunits for construction of new biological probes and medicines. These studies are elucidating the structural design parameters of peptidomimetic catalysts that maintain their competency in polar solvents and facilitate nucleophilic trifluoromethylation reactions. In turn, the results of these investigations are informing iterative cycles of catalyst design and structure-activity relationship analysis that aim to produce highly enantio- and regio-selective nucleophilic trifluoromethylation catalysts with wide substrate scope. More broadly, a new class of structured catalyst scaffolds designed to be generally applicable to a wide range of reactions is being realized, while simultaneously providing early but authentic research experiences for undergraduates. These experiences are specifically designed to enhance learning outcomes and enthusiasm for pursuit of STEM careers, especially among members of underrepresented groups in STEM fields that are identified through partnerships with both internal and local external organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the world's agriculture concentrated onto large commercial farms, many producers elsewhere have abandoned farming for more profitable industries, such as tourism. Yet, it is widely recognized that food security depends on maintenance of a diversified economy that includes at least some modicum of local food production. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, investigates this economic niche of local farmers, who continue to farm even as economic benefits wane. The researcher asks why people chose to continue traditional livelihoods and self-sufficiency even when it seems to counter economic self-interest.  In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of navigating food insecurity, improving economic and agricultural policies, and promoting environmental, cultural, and economic sustainability.<br/><br/>Dana Conzo, under the supervision of Dr. Krista Harper of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, will explore why agricultural producers remain committed to small-scale farming when participation appears to not be in their short to medium-term economic interest. It tests a classic hypothesis in economic anthropology that human economic behavior is often driven by materially irrational but culturally strategic aims. This project will be conducted in St. Kitts; the Caribbean has long been recognized as an ideal laboratory for examining longitudinal political economic trends because of its long engagement with capitalist production and colonialism. St. Kitts' integration into the global economy began as a sugar producer and has continued as a luxury tourist destination, making it an appropriate location to investigate how and why people maintain cultural practices in changing cultural, economic, and political landscapes. Using a range of established ethnographic and geographic techniques for data collection and analysis, such as participant observation, interviews, and spatial analysis in ArcGIS, the investigator will interview small-scale agricultural producers and trace the island's food and economic flows. The findings will contribute to debates in economic anthropology about autonomy, food security, land and labor practices, and globalization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first challenge addressed by this project is to account for uncertainty in the position and velocity of each agent. This uncertainty can be caused by inaccurate measurements or imperfect communications. To capture uncertainty, this project uses probability distributions to quantify the collective behavior of all the agents. This is called the macroscopic description of the network. The second challenge addressed by this project is to find control laws that achieve a desired macroscopic behavior of the network, using only distributed algorithms and local information. That is, the project will find rules by which each agent will control its own velocity, based only on knowledge of a few neighboring agents, but in such a way that a desired macroscopic probability distribution is obtained. The local dynamic behavior of the individual agents is called the microscopic description of the network, and the goal of this project is to find rules for microscopic behavior that give rise to a desired macroscopic result. An example is the control of a large group of autonomous mobile robots that pick up and deliver packages across a wide geographic region. The macroscopic goal is that, for each point in the region, the probability density of a delivery robot being available should match the probability density that a package needs to be picked up. For large numbers of robots, it is impractical to achieve this macroscopic goal by controlling every individual robot from a single command center. Instead, to avoid prohibitive requirements for communication bandwidth, information storage, and data processing, the computational task should be distributed among the individual robots -- however, the individual robots can only share data with a few nearby units. The challenge addressed by this project is for the individual robots to plan their movements based only on this limited local exchange, in such a way that the entire network of robots spreads out across the delivery region in a pattern mirroring the customer demand. This project advances the national prosperity and helps to secure the national defense by improving the ability to control large networks of mobile robots for commercial applications such as package delivery, or security applications such as surveillance and interdiction.<br/><br/>The macroscopic deployment problem is approached in three steps. The first step is to define a single fictitious agent that captures the macroscopic state of the multi-agent network. This is done by choosing the mean and the covariance of the individual states of all the constituent agents of the network to be the statistical quantities that determine the probability distribution of the state of the representative agent. Tools from stochastic optimal control theory are then applied to steer the network towards areas of high importance. The second step is to solve the microscopic deployment problem for the constituent agents of the network, by assigning tasks to different agents based on their suitability to accomplish these tasks. The proposed solution approach is based on a divide-and-conquer scheme that is centered around a special class of Voronoi-like spatial partitions (sub-divisions of the workspace of the multi-agent network). The expected outcomes of this effort will include 1) stochastic control algorithms for the solution of the macroscopic control problem, 2) partitioning algorithms for the computation of Voronoi-like subdivisions of the network's workspace, 3) distributed algorithms for the solution of the microscopic control problem that leverage the Voronoi-like partitions and Lloyd's algorithm. The third and final step is to validate the proposed algorithms via a set of experimental demonstrations that will take place at the facilities for robotics research at the PI's home department.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carbon bond forming reactions are important in pharmaceutical and other fine chemical products; However, such reactions often require the use of rare and expensive metals.  Replacement of the expensive metals in these processes with earth-abundant and non-toxic iron is the goal of this project.  In addition to the research activities, Professor Gutierrez is piloting a partnership between the University and the nearby Prince George's Community College to encourage community college students to conduct hands-on summer research at University of Maryland and to train community college faculty to use and implement modern computational tools in undergraduate education. These efforts are further enhanced with the Alliance for Diversity in Science and Engineering.   <br/><br/>Knowledge of the mechanisms of iron-catalyzed processes is rudimentary, thus hindering rational catalyst design. This hypothesis-driven project focuses on performing mechanistic studies designed to increase understanding of the factors that control reactivity and selectivity. in carbon-bond forming reactions. By performing both calculations and synthesis in one laboratory setting, Professor Osvaldo Gutierrez and his research team are well positioned to address new developments from both the computational or experimental sides of the research to gain a far-reaching picture of the factors controlling product selectivity. Specific research goals include the use quantum mechanical calculations and chemical synthesis of mechanistic probes to elucidate the mechanisms of iron-catalyzed carbon-carbon cross-coupling reactions.  The team also seeks to develop predictive models, based on transition state calculations, of reactivity and selectivity of iron-catalyzed carbon-carbon double bond functionalization.  The researchers also establish guiding principles for predicting geometry and spin states of diamine bispyridine iron(II) catalysts.

Convex optimization problems are a special class in which the constraints are simple enough that continuous problems gain geometric and/or discrete structures. These structures have been studied extensively over the past century. Some of these techniques like linear programming have become fundamental tools in all fields of science.  More recently, there have been interesting cases in which continuous methods have yielded advances in discrete optimization. In this project, the PI seeks to develop significantly more efficient algorithms to solve convex problems, especially problems come from graph and combinatorial problems. A major obstacle to developing nearly linear-time algorithms for both continuous and discrete problems is the lack of understanding of convex geometry and its connection to algorithms. <br/><br/>This project focuses on three key topics and related goals: 1) Algorithmic Convex Geometry: understand how well convex sets can be approximated by ellipsoids (KLS conjecture), explore ways to deform an explicit given polytope as a Riemannian manifold and use the deformations to develop faster polytope sampling algorithms; 2) Combinatorial Optimization: break the square root iterations barrier for solving linear programming by understanding the relation between convex geometry and interior point methods to develop a fine-grained complexity for interior point methods; 3) Convex Optimization: investigate cutting plane methods via the geometry of localization sets, develop efficient cutting plane methods via algorithmic convex geometry and explore non-convex optimizations via sampling algorithms.

Many climate models simulate strong open sea deep convection within the Weddell and occasionally the Ross Sea, with periods ranging from decades to centuries. This process brings a large amount of heat from the subsurface and releases it to the atmosphere, changing ocean and atmospheric temperatures and winds globally, and producing large holes in sea-ice called polynyas. Interestingly, the largest Weddell Sea polynya observed since the 1970s was seen from satellite pictures this past (2017) October, making an understanding of polynyas ever more urgent. The mechanisms underlying Southern Ocean convective variability, the reasons that it differs widely across climate models, and the impacts of variability on ocean circulation, heat and salt cycles remain unclear. This makes it difficult to determine whether models simulate (or fail to simulate) Southern Ocean convection for the right reasons, whether such events are likely to reoccur and whether past changes in convection are exerting an impact on the course of modern climate. This proposal will directly inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR6) assessment project, focusing on a previously understudied area, expanding our fundamental knowledge of the Southern Ocean and its role in the global climate system, and developing new model diagnostics. By providing insights into the relationship between deep ocean convection and ocean/climate indices on multiple timescales, this proposal will potentially inform design of future observational networks. The proposed work will enhance education and dissemination of research via undergraduate teaching and strong outreach activities both in West Philadelphia, where Dr. Marinov will partner with a public elementary school, and in Baltimore, where Dr. Gnanadesikan will continue his strong involvement in the Science Olympiad.<br/><br/>The project is organized around four major scientific questions and underlying hypotheses:1. What produces SO deep convection and determines its frequency and intensity across coupled climate models? 2. What are the global oceanic implications of Southern Ocean convection? 3. How do changes in convection impact the transient climate response and climate sensitivity? 4. How do eddy parameterizations and model construction affect the representations of SO convection and resulting oceanic teleconnections? The team will run a set of new simulations and PIs will analyze (a) a suite of models already run at Johns Hopkins (JHU), (b) a suite of new model runs at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GDFL), (c) models submitted to the IPCC-AR5/IPCC-AR6 as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project versions 5 and 6 (CMIP5,6). PIs will examine how different models become ""preconditioned"" for convection by producing a buildup of heat at depth or salt anomalies at the surface; how convective variability produces changes in key water masses and how heat, salt, mass transport signals evolve over time. They will examine the impact of convective variability within a large ensemble of the same coupled climate model, as well as within versions of the GFDL models which differ in model construction (hybrid vs. level coordinate), resolution (1 vs.   degree ocean), and eddy mixing coefficients. A side benefit of the proposal will be building a set of novel metrics than can be used for routine benchmarking and evaluation of GFDL and CMIP6 models. These metrics will help evaluate strengths/weaknesses of SO simulations, including tracking corrections in long-standing model errors from one model generation to another.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For many species, the decision with whom to mate depends on information communicated via the release of 'pheromones', a complex blend of chemicals that are released by one animal to be sensed by another. Therefore, understanding how pheromones affect mating behaviors has broad implications for animal behavior and evolutionary biology. Because pheromones communicate precise information, the links between pheromone production and perception are expected to be relatively stable within species. However, previous studies suggest that pheromones are remarkably flexible, and can change rapidly as new species evolve. One possible explanation for this apparent puzzle is that some shared genes co-regulate the independent processes responsible for pheromone production and perception. These shared genes could provide a path for the evolution of pheromone signals without losing the link between pheromone production and perception. This hypothesis will be tested by taking advantage of the fruit fly courtship ritual as a model. Studies will focus on genes that encode proteins that function as pheromone receptors in the nervous system, as well as regulators of pheromone cuticular production, and their possible role in pheromonal differences between males and females and across related fruit fly species. In addition to training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students, the broader impacts of this project will include genetics and neuroscience outreach and education activities associated with the public education system in the St. Louis region. <br/><br/><br/>Mating pheromones are essential for the maintenance of species boundaries in diverse animal taxa. However, it is puzzling how, as closely related species diversify, pheromones could evolve without fitness costs associated with their decoupling from related mate choice behaviors. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that mating pheromone production and perception are genetically linked via the action of pleiotropic genes. Specifically, the project will test the hypothesis that members of the Gustatory receptor protein family in Drosophila play a role in the sensory perception of specific cuticular pheromones as well as in the regulation of their synthesis by acting as regulatory autoreceptors in the pheromone-producing oenocytes. Approaches will include a combination of behavioral, chemo-analytical, and state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9-dependent genome editing approaches to establish a genetic linkage between the perception and production of pheromones, to investigate the role of pleiotropic chemoreceptors in regulating the female pre-to-post-mating phenotypic switch from attractive to repulsive pheromonal profile, and the role of pheromone receptor evolution in promoting assortative mating and speciation in the genus Drosophila. Findings will provide novel mechanistic insights into the regulation of mating behaviors by pheromones in particular, and the evolution of mating signals in general. In addition to diverse genetics and neuroscience outreach activities in the St. Louis region, the investigator and co-workers will use studies of mating behaviors as training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students in experimental design, behavioral and genetic data collection and analyses, and scientific presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People recognize words far more easily than even the best computer speech recognition systems, even though the actual sounds we hear as consonants and vowels vary greatly depending on context (what sounds come before or after), who is talking, and the setting (a quiet room versus a crowded airport). Most current models of speech recognition cannot handle the huge variability in real speech because they do not operate on the actual speech signal. Also, they do not learn, so they cannot model how people acquire language. This project addresses these challenges by comparing current models of speech recognition to each other and to human capabilities, with the goal of understanding how human speech processing is so robust and flexible.  In addition, simplified ""deep learning"" networks will be developed and evaluated as models of human speech recognition. Deep learning networks are similar to cognitive models in that they learn abstract representations of the data, not task-specific rules or algorithms. These networks have been used to create accurate commercial speech recognition systems. By comparing them to human performance, the investigators may provide new insights into why human speech recognition is so robust. The results of this project will have technical implications (better understanding of human flexibility may aid in improving computer speech recognition) and health implications (better understanding of human speech recognition will aid in developing better interventions for language disorders). The project will also support the training of a postdoctoral researcher and a PhD student, both of whom will develop skills that can be used to contribute to research and development in academia or industry. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of a ""shallow deep network"" model called ""DeepListener"" that will be compared with the behavior of human listeners. A close match in the millisecond-level behavior of the network (for example, in which words are temporarily confusable with each other) and human performance suggests that human speech processing may emerge from similar principles as those in the model. In preliminary work, DeepListener learned to recognize 93% of 2000 real words (200 words produced by 10 talkers). DeepListener will be evaluated by detailed comparison to standard neural network models of cognitive theories and to human performance. The ways in which DeepListener is similar and dissimilar to human performance and competing models will help to advance scientific theories of human speech recognition. This project will follow emerging standards for open science: experiments will be pre-registered and data and computer code will be made freely and publicly available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over five years, this project plans to provide scholarships to 36 students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in STEM. The specific aim is to improve successful transfer of urban STEM students from two-year institutions to baccalaureate STEM programs at PSU.  To accomplish this goal, the program will implement: (1) A summer S-STEM bridge program; (2) A course-based undergraduate research experience for students during their first year; and (3) Direct placement of S-STEM Scholars in internships and/or independent research experiences in their second year. The project will provide students with financial support, training in professional skills (communication skills, teamwork, ethics, etc.), and research opportunities necessary for success in STEM.  In addition, the project will cultivate a sense of belonging among the Scholars to support students as they transition into a university environment.<br/><br/>The project goal is to increase the number of low-income, urban STEM students who transfer from a community college, graduate with a STEM bachelor's degree, and pursue graduate degrees and/or gain employment in STEM careers. The project will: (1) Improve the processes for recruiting and successfully transitioning urban transfer students from two- to four-year STEM programs; (2) Provide financial, academic, and social support to STEM transfer students; (3) Evaluate project activities that lead to STEM transfer success; and (4) Disseminate project outcomes. To evaluate if students successfully transition and reach their highest potential, the project will use mixed-methods, quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess program outcomes, including monitoring academic progress, administering pre/post surveys, and conducting focus groups. Students? sense of belonging will be measured to determine how participation in the program results in changes to this important affective attribute.  If so, the investigators will explore the relationship of this change to mitigating transfer-shock, which can constrain transfer students from persisting to graduation. A survey will measure three constructs known to be associated with success: attitude toward STEM, career goals in STEM, and sense of belonging. Furthermore, focus groups will contribute to an in-depth understanding of the student experience. The project will measure perceptions and success within three groups of students:  Scholars, non-Scholar STEM transfer students, and four-year STEM students. Comparisons among these groups will support understanding the efficacy of the project's activities to help students achieve academic goals (e.g., timely graduation), mitigate transfer-shock (provide scaffolding for building a sense of belonging in STEM), and give Scholars tools for success (i.e., strong letters of recommendation, internships). Evaluation data will inform education research about what does and does not work to mitigate transfer-shock and facilitate success in baccalaureate STEM. The project has the potential to produce a sustainable institutional road-map for mitigating transfer shock, and improving overall persistence, graduation, and success for underserved STEM students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conferences themselves focus on two factors that are tightly associated with plant growth and survival: water and photosynthate (sugars produced by plants during photosynthesis, that are used for building plants and that are the basis for all food consumed by all organisms on Earth). Most participants already work on the transport of one or both of these factors, but they usually only work at one or two of the following scales: gene transcription, cell physiology and development, wood or inner bark physiology or development, whole plant size and shape, or function of communities or entire landscapes. This conference provides an important venue to bring together researchers working on these different scales.  The smaller conference is for early-career scientists, and the larger conference has special activities designed to help early-career scientists make meaningful relationships with more established scientists.  The organizers expect that all scientists will benefit from these relationships, and so the conferences will not only move the fields of plant biology forward, but will enrich the worker-base to ensure continuing advancements in the field.<br/><br/>This award will support the travel and registration costs of about 15 early-career scientists for two linked conferences, the five-day Gordon Research Conference (GRC), and the two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) in the area of Multiscale Plant Vascular Biology (target sizes 200 scientists, and 50 early-career scientists, respectively). It is increasingly recognized that knowledge of water and photosynthate movement through systems gives much information about how that system functions, from the levels of subcellular parts up through landscapes.  That same information may be used to understand how robust a system is to perturbation, and the basis for that robustness, which can be used in predictions and management for applications such as development of suitable plants for future conditions, understanding the links between plant physiology and climate-change-induced ecosystem shifts, and linking community transpiration to ground and atmospheric water stores. The GRC will focus on plasticity in these systems to help predict what is possible, and may show how the variability stabilizes or destabilizes systems at multiple scales. The GRS will provide a forum for early-career researchers in these fields to identify knowledge gaps in the role of vascular transport on climate change and that can be addressed through multidisciplinary collaborations. The conferences have three broader impacts. 1) Learning opportunity for a range of scientists, with an emphasis on early-career and participation of under-represented groups. The GRC will have four activities to encourage mixing and mentoring. The GRS has an agenda to facilitate peer interaction. The meetings are being advertised broadly through scientific societies and organizations that work to increase diversity in biological sciences.  2) Advancement of science, the elaboration of which may ultimately help ensure our continued existence on Earth given the importance of primary producers (plants) and the many risks to their health and productivity. 3) Development of community in a fragmented field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, people and animals who are bold and extroverted tend to seek different mates and act differently during courtship than those who are shy and introverted.  Part of this may have to do with learning - extroverts learn better from positive rewards, introverts learn better from negative experiences. This project explores the genetic and behavioral connections between personality, learning, and mate choice.  This is done by testing mate preferences, shyness and boldness, and learning ability in the same individuals, and by using genomic technology to search for a common genetic basis underlying these features.  This work will help us understand how reproductive decisions change with the environment and drive the origin of new animal species. The project will support graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. A main focus is to expand an ongoing mentorship program focused on community outreach and high-impact learning experiences for high school students. In this project, high school and college-age students will be trained during the school year as counselors for an elementary-level STEM summer camp focused on animal behavior and local natural history, applying their science knowledge towards engaging younger students.<br/><br/>Hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of mating preferences have focused on their adaptive value with respect to mating decisions. A growing body of work has shown that biases unrelated to mating, notably at the sensory periphery, can shape mating preferences. If these biases are under divergent ecological selection, this can facilitate reproductive isolation. This project focuses on whether interspecific differences in mating preferences can emerge from personality, an ecologically important suite of behavioral traits. The swordtail fish species Xiphophorus malinche and Xiphophorus birchmanni diverge in both mating preferences and personality traits. The proposed project seeks to unravel the common mechanisms underlying personality, preference development, and mating decisions. This will be accomplished by (1) measuring phenotypic correlations between non-sexual exploratory and risk-avoidance behavior, mate-sampling patterns, and mating preferences; (2)  using aversive and appetitive conditioned-response paradigms to evaluate the relationship between personality and learning mode; (3) characterizing the relationship between learning in sexual and non-sexual contexts; and (4) using hybrid genetic lines to elucidate genetic covariance between personality and preference and identify candidate genomic regions.  The project will support graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. A primary objective is expansion of an established mentorship program out of the CICHAZ field station in central Mexico, which currently focuses on community outreach and high-impact learning experiences for high school students. Under the current proposal, high school and college-age students will be trained during the school year as counselors for an elementary-level STEM summer camp focused on animal behavior and local natural history, applying their science knowledge towards engaging younger students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many climate models simulate strong open sea deep convection within the Weddell and occasionally the Ross Sea, with periods ranging from decades to centuries. This process brings a large amount of heat from the subsurface and releases it to the atmosphere, changing ocean and atmospheric temperatures and winds globally, and producing large holes in sea-ice called polynyas. Interestingly, the largest Weddell Sea polynya observed since the 1970s was seen from satellite pictures this past (2017) October, making an understanding of polynyas ever more urgent. The mechanisms underlying Southern Ocean convective variability, the reasons that it differs widely across climate models, and the impacts of variability on ocean circulation, heat and salt cycles remain unclear. This makes it difficult to determine whether models simulate (or fail to simulate) Southern Ocean convection for the right reasons, whether such events are likely to reoccur and whether past changes in convection are exerting an impact on the course of modern climate. This proposal will directly inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR6) assessment project, focusing on a previously understudied area, expanding our fundamental knowledge of the Southern Ocean and its role in the global climate system, and developing new model diagnostics. By providing insights into the relationship between deep ocean convection and ocean/climate indices on multiple timescales, this proposal will potentially inform design of future observational networks. The proposed work will enhance education and dissemination of research via undergraduate teaching and strong outreach activities both in West Philadelphia, where Dr. Marinov will partner with a public elementary school, and in Baltimore, where Dr. Gnanadesikan will continue his strong involvement in the Science Olympiad.<br/><br/>The project is organized around four major scientific questions and underlying hypotheses:1. What produces SO deep convection and determines its frequency and intensity across coupled climate models? 2. What are the global oceanic implications of Southern Ocean convection? 3. How do changes in convection impact the transient climate response and climate sensitivity? 4. How do eddy parameterizations and model construction affect the representations of SO convection and resulting oceanic teleconnections? The team will run a set of new simulations and PIs will analyze (a) a suite of models already run at Johns Hopkins (JHU), (b) a suite of new model runs at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GDFL), (c) models submitted to the IPCC-AR5/IPCC-AR6 as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project versions 5 and 6 (CMIP5,6). PIs will examine how different models become ""preconditioned"" for convection by producing a buildup of heat at depth or salt anomalies at the surface; how convective variability produces changes in key water masses and how heat, salt, mass transport signals evolve over time. They will examine the impact of convective variability within a large ensemble of the same coupled climate model, as well as within versions of the GFDL models which differ in model construction (hybrid vs. level coordinate), resolution (1 vs.   degree ocean), and eddy mixing coefficients. A side benefit of the proposal will be building a set of novel metrics than can be used for routine benchmarking and evaluation of GFDL and CMIP6 models. These metrics will help evaluate strengths/weaknesses of SO simulations, including tracking corrections in long-standing model errors from one model generation to another.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent research indicates that these large-scale events have altered the hydrological and ecosystem balances over historical and geological timescales (decades to thousands of years). This project will assess how far north along the coast of southwestern North America these storms have occurred in the geologic past, and how far inland they controlled geomorphic change events through rain and erosion. The specific goal is to determine if previously documented periods when tropical cyclones dominated runoff and sediment deposition across large alluvial fan systems of the southern Baja California peninsula can be detected in central Baja California, the southern California deserts, and even as far north as the southern Arizona Sonoran Desert. Data will test whether dissipating cyclones were drivers of alluvial fan sedimentation over thousands of years, and if a temporal correlation can be established to a period of transition between a milder, humid paleoclimate to the current arid climate. For the first time, a tropical cyclone landfall chronology covering the last few millennia will be developed for the Pacific coast of southwestern North America. This research has the potential to inform large-storm prediction scenarios for southern California and northwestern Mexico, which is relevant to hazards management for communities in need of risk assessment of rare and extreme events. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of earth scientists using a tiered approach, with field-based collaboration of postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. This approach has been proven successful for inclusion of underrepresented minorities, enhanced also with planned research alongside Mexican collaborators and students. The project will provide unique broader educational experiences for grade-school students in Indiana and Arizona, through the use of technology to connect fieldwork and classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will compare a recently established alluvial fan chronology in southern Baja California, with newly-obtained alluvial fan and paleotempestological records. A Holocene paleotempestological record of overwash deposits in the Pacific coastal Vizcaino Desert will be developed for the first time. The inferred tropical storm activity will be compared with inland alluvial fan deposition in this area and in the northern Sonoran Desert, enabling discrimination of signals from different moisture sources, based on observed coastal and alluvial sedimentology, stratigraphy, and specific proxy records. Effects of different sources of moisture that drive sedimentation will be assessed by probing different time periods, and compared to independent paleoclimatic proxies. Bayesian analysis of luminescence, cosmogenic, and radiocarbon geochronology will improve age control precision. The coupled alluvial and coastal record at orbital timescales will help to understand linkages between Quaternary alluvial sedimentation and hydroclimatic variability in the region, and will increase our understanding of basic principles of alluvial fan aggradation in response to change in arid hydroclimates. The project will test effects of millennial- and orbital-scale shifts in tropical circulation on landscape evolution of the region, which are, in turn, critical to test models of occurrence and effects of hydrological extremes and associated landscape changing events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the current understanding of the drivers of such changes is limited, making an investigation of overturning in the Sub-polar region a key ocean research priority. This field program explicitly addresses this gap. Furthermore, by engaging the larger international community studying the North Atlantic, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) is playing a key role in catalyzing scientific progress by promoting international collaborations, synthesis, and the sharing of resources and by training future generations. Key to the latter is a network of early career scientists whose professional growth will continue to be facilitated through targeted activities that have been tested and improved during OSNAP's initial phase. Graduate students and post-docs will be trained in seagoing operations and in the processing and analysis of observational data.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this field project, in conjunction with other measurements in the North Atlantic, is to establish determination of the linkage between intermediate and deep water formation and the overturning circulation--a connection that is present in climate models, but has yet to be observed. This project will also provide the first comprehensive view of spreading pathways for the deep waters in the Sub-polar basin. Starting in 2014, the US-led international project, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP), provides a continuous record of the full-water column, trans-basin fluxes of heat, mass and freshwater in the Sub-polar North Atlantic, in partnership with the UK, Netherlands, Canada, Germany and China. Data from the first 21 months of the full OSNAP observing system has been used to produce an initial time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes for the Sub-polar basin. These preliminary results reveal a highly variable overturning in the basin, interior pathways for overflow waters, surprisingly energetic boundary current systems on timescales from days to months, and a strong overflow plume in the Iceland Basin. The additional two years of OSNAP observations will cover a time frame sufficient to make comparisons with other overturning time series and optimize the OSNAP measurement system--all necessary tasks prior to a request for longer term measurements. This component of OSNAP (OSNAP West) is for the western array across the Labrador Sea between Greenland and Canada in coordination with Germany and Canada. The sub-goal for OSNAP is to quantify the structure and transport of the West Greenland boundary current system and determine the nature of its variability and shelf-slope exchange. In addition, the overflow water pathways throughout the subpolar region and the mechanisms responsible for their variability will be studied by analyzing the subsurface float data collected since 2014 and the output of high-resolution ocean circulation models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will involve emerging agricultural technologies like transparent soil (a recent discovery which is a hydrogel that behaves like soil), a near-peer and college-focused mentoring model, and interaction with scientists. The youth will learn to build and code Raspberry Pis (small and affordable computers that students can use to learn programming) to share their data with agronomists and plant scientists. The outcome goal for this work is to prepare youth to enter a post-secondary institution with strong research skills through experience in conducting careful, rigorous scientific research. Throughout the three-year project, youth will be engaged in the same type of scientific research that is occurring at the university level. Specifically, youth will learn: (i) to build the tools (sensors connected to Raspberry Pi and sensors connected to the Internet of Things web infrastructure provided by IBM Watson software system) they will use to collect their data, (ii) to carry out a rigorous scientific investigation (identifying questions, as well as finding and minimizing experimental containments, and determining dependent vs. independent variables), and (iii) to develop models and potential explanations based on their data in collaboration with practicing scientists. The program will recruit low-income youth, and youth from populations underrepresented in science from high schools in Boston Public Schools and support them in learning core scientific research skills and engage them in building the tools they will use to conduct their more complex experiments. The program will not only build the capacity of the youth participants to make potential scientific discoveries, but through the mentoring program youth leaders and mentors will become role models to youth in their community.<br/><br/>There are four major aspects of the proposed work. First, youth will engage with cutting edge technologies being used in scientific research labs. Second, a diverse team of collaborators will be assembled consisting of STEM career development experts, Youth Mentoring experts, Scientists, and Science Educators to design the proposed work. Third, the program is a unique combination of three synergistic components: (1) a near-peer mentoring approach, (2) STEM learning, and (3) youth purpose and career development. Unlike other out-of-school STEM programs, this program will not only support the learning of STEM concepts, but it will do so by taking youth on a personal journey designed to help them discover the relevance of STEM skills for fulfilling future career aspirations, as well as preparing them for post-secondary education. Fourth, the data that youth will share with practicing scientists has the potential to help answer important questions in plant science regarding how plants, particularly their root structures, react to environmental stressors. The research approach provides an opportunity to examine how such constructs as purpose, critical consciousness, and work volition impact youths' intentions to pursue a STEM field. To date, these important constructs have not been seriously considered in STEM career development. Thus, the research on the impact of near-peer mentoring and youths' adaptability and intentionality to explore, pursue, and stay in STEM fields will provide the ITEST community with an evidence-based model integrating near-peer mentoring, scientific research, and STEM career development to elucidate how youth may successfully pursue a STEM field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current methods to achieve cellular resolution are invasive (e.g., blood test or tissue biopsy), and non-invasive imaging modalities do not achieve cellular resolution. The principal goal of this Expeditions project is to develop computational imaging systems for non-invasive bio-imaging, deep beneath the skin, and at cellular-level resolutions. This project has the potential to fundamentally impact healthcare and medicine, by enabling live views of cross sections of human anatomy, simply by pointing a camera at any part of the body. This would put individual users at the center of their healthcare experience and make them true partners in their healthcare delivery. The health imaging devices that result from this project will act as an important pillar in the personalized medicine revolution. This research expedition also holds the potential to launch new healthcare paradigms for chronic disease management, pediatrics, low-resource healthcare, and disaster medical care. Beyond healthcare, making progress on the problem of cellular-scale deep-tissue imaging using light will push the frontiers of the fundamental problem of inverse scattering, which impacts numerous areas of science and engineering. The order of magnitude advances made in inverse scattering and imaging through scattering media will have significant cross-cutting applications in diverse areas such as basic science, consumer imaging, automotive navigation, robotics, surveillance, atmospheric science, and material science. Finally, projects with a single, easy-to-appreciate, and high-impact goal have the potential to inspire the next generation of scientists, attract diverse set of students driven by humanitarian and social causes, and become a platform for inclusion and innovation.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate new computational imaging systems, to non-invasively image below the skin at tunable depths, in highly portable form-factors such as wearables or point-of-care devices. The main challenge is that light scatters as it travels through the human body, and in this process, the spatial information from different points within the body gets mixed up. A new concept, Computational Photo-Scatterography (CPS), is being applied in this project in order to computationally unravel the scattered photons in an imaging system, and allow creation of sharp images and accurate inferences. Recognizing that the brute-force complexity of unraveling scattered photons is prohibitively high, the project uses a computational co-design framework that leverages advances by team members from multiple domains: programmable illumination and optics, image sensors, machine learning, inverse graphics, and hybrid analog-digital computing.  The project will use machine learning (ML) instead of physics-based de-scattering to speed up the solution of the underlying inverse problem. A combination of physics-based inverse graphics algorithms, and ML algorithms combining deep learning and generative modeling will be used to estimate tissue scattering parameters -  motion due to blood flow induces time-variation in tissue parameters, which makes solving the inverse scattering problem more difficult. The project will use ML to create fast but approximate estimators, which will serve as accelerators for inverse scattering. The development of new sensors, able to capture the data necessary to reconstruct the structure of the tissue deep below the skin, constitutes the most important contribution of the project. These systems and algorithms will have the potential to break the current resolution limits of noninvasive bio-imaging by nearly two orders of magnitude, enabling cellular-level imaging at depths far beyond currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researcher will investigate how people develop new understandings of risk in very high risk/very high reward situations. The context in which this question will be investigated is clinical trials of new cancer immunotherapy drugs, which have the ability to achieve high cure rates for previously incurable and rapidly terminal disease. Because the possibility of a cure comes at the cost of serious side effects, the new immunotherapies introduce a level of uncertainty about treatment outcomes beyond what either  patients or clinicians have heretofore experienced.  This requires new methods of communicating about and navigating uncertainty for those who run and those who participate in clinical trials. This research will investigate the relationship between new clinical understanding of immunotherapies and how explanations of risk and efficacy are crafted, utilized, and contested in the unique cultural space of the clinical trial.<br/><br/>Dr. Marlaine Figueroa Gray (Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute) will conduct this preliminary study by documenting and analyzing conversations in which patients are consented into trials, focusing on how uncertainty is framed by the provider and the patient.  Figueroa Gray will use ethnographic methods to collect data by documenting the content of consent conversations in which providers explain benefit and risk of trial participation to patients, and will observe the clinical space in which such conversations take place.  The researcher will also conduct interviews with providers who run the trials and patients who participate in them at a cancer research facility in Seattle, Washington.  Findings from this research will connect biomedical and lay understandings of new immunological therapeutics to professional and lay conceptions of risk and management of uncertainty.

River input is the primary source of land-derived sediment to the marine environment. These particles have significant impacts on the health of coastal ecosystems and the geology and bathymetry of coastal oceans and shipping channels. They directly and indirectly affect fisheries and navigation. This research focuses on the movement of sediments carried into the Gulf of Mexico, via the Brazos River, during the unprecedented rainfall and flooding event that occurred during Hurricane Harvey. The Brazos River ranks as the second largest contributor of nutrients and organic matter to the Gulf of Mexico, after the Mississippi River.  Unlike the Mississippi, however, most sediment delivered to the Gulf of Mexico from the Brazos is carried during flooding events like that which accompanied Hurricane Harvey.  Little is known about the fate of this sediment.  It is not clear if it is retained in the coastal zone, where the nutrients and chemicals it carries affect the coastal environment, or is carried offshore and deposited in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Through intensive sampling of sediments just offshore the mouth of the Brazos River and further offshore in the Gulf of Mexico in what is known as the Texas Mud Blanket, this project will determine the principal repository of sediments delivered to the western Gulf of Mexico by a major Texas river.   <br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to investigate the hypothesis that flood-borne sediment from the Brazos River is initially deposited in the coastal zone and subsequently mobilized and carried offshore with a large fraction of it being deposited in the Texas Mud Blanket.  The work builds on the analysis of sea-bottom sediment samples collected in 2017 during flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey.  This new program will include two sampling cruises to augment already collected data. The first cruise will entail acquisition of ~25 cores that will indicate sediment deposition and transport in the near-shore region near the Brazos River mouth.  Preliminary work indicates that much of the initial deposition of Brazos River sediment occurred east of the original sampling region.   The second cruise in will collect additional Brazos region cores and expand sampling into the Texas Mud Blanket, with the goal of documenting changes in Brazos sediment deposition from the Hurricane Harvey flooding.  During both cruises, complementary hydrography data will be collected. This includes water column velocities and suspended sediment loads. Provenance of individual layers, within the sediment samples and box cores, will be determined by digital photos and x-radiographs of intact core slabs that show sediment fabric and structures.  To differentiate Gulf of Mexico from Brazos River sediments, sub-samples of collected cores will be geochemically analyzed and profiled for short-lived-radioisotope geochronology, water content, grainsize distribution, and mercury and carbonate content.  These indicators will help identify the origin of the sediments deposited in the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The subfamily includes well known species such as Namibian fog basking beetles (Onymacris unguicularis, used in biomimicry research) and the North American blue death-feigning beetle (Asbolus verrucosus), along with thousands of poorly known or still undescribed species. This research will describe hundreds of species new to science, explore where these beetles live and how they are related to each other across the planet, and investigate the various adaptations that have allowed these beetles to thrive and diversify across the world's deserts. This project will also train a postdoctoral researcher, two Ph.D. students, and approximately 15 undergraduate students, as well as facilitating collaborations and providing training to a diverse group of scientists from across the globe. Project participants will also be designing and leading hybrid courses between Northern Arizona University and Namibia's renowned Gobabeb Research Center, and working to enhance research collections in all participating institutions. <br/><br/>This project will resolve centuries-old issues in our understanding of desert darkling beetles by 1) generating DNA data from recently collected and museum specimens using high-throughput sequencing and target enrichment methods to recover ~631 genetic loci for approximately 500 species across the Pimeliinae. Additionally, approximately 300 larval and adult morphological characters will be scored for each species. Morphological data will be combined with the molecular data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the subfamily. The resulting phylogeny will inform taxonomic decisions and help place current distributions and life histories within an evolutionary context. 2) Producing an Open Access electronic monograph of the subfamily using the mx/TaxonWorks bioinformatics platform and a matrix-based approach to coding and organizing morphological characters for descriptions, linked to the Coleoptera Anatomy Ontology (ColAO) to provide explicit definitions and images for anatomical terms. The monograph will include the first worldwide key to the Pimeliinae tribes and subtribes, images of specimens and characters, distribution maps, an extensive catalog of darkling beetle names and literature, and matrix-based descriptions. 3) Examining historical biogeography, diversification patterns, and adaptations to xeric conditions across the subfamily using the resulting phylogeny, over 20,000 georeferenced museum and modern specimens, and recently developed analytical tools for biogeographic analyses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has recently become clear, however, that many marine species are subdivided into multiple populations that have evolved to thrive best under contrasting local environmental conditions. Nevertheless, we still know very little about the genomic mechanisms that enable divergent adaptations in the face of ongoing intermixing. This project focuses on the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), a small estuarine fish that exhibits a remarkable degree of local adaptation in growth rates and a suite of other traits tightly associated with a climatic gradient across latitudes. Decades of prior lab and field studies have made Atlantic silverside one of the marine species for which we have the best understanding of evolutionary tradeoffs among traits and drivers of selection causing adaptive divergence. Yet, the underlying genomic basis is so far completely unknown. The investigators will integrate whole genome sequencing data from wild fish sampled across the distribution range with breeding experiments in the laboratory to decipher these genomic underpinnings. This will provide one of the most comprehensive assessments of the genomic basis for local adaptation in the oceans to date, thereby generating insights that are urgently needed for better predictions about how species can respond to rapid environmental change. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for a postdoc as well as two graduate and several undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities. The findings will also be leveraged to develop engaging teaching and outreach materials (e.g. a video documentary and popular science articles) to promote a better understanding of ecology, evolution, and local adaptation among science students and the general public. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to characterize the genomic basis and architecture underlying local adaptation in M. menidia and examine how the adaptive divergence is shaped by varying levels of gene flow and maintained over ecological time scales. The project is organized into four interconnected components. Part 1 examines fine-scale spatial patterns of genomic differentiation along the adaptive cline to a) characterize the connectivity landscape, b) identify genomic regions under divergent selection, and c) deduce potential drivers and targets of selection by examining how allele frequencies vary in relation to environmental factors and biogeographic features. Part 2 maps key locally adapted traits to the genome to dissect their underlying genomic basis. Part 3 integrates patterns of variation in the wild (part 1) and the mapping of traits under controlled conditions (part 2) to a) examine how genomic architectures underlying local adaptation vary across gene flow regimes and b) elucidating the potential role of chromosomal rearrangements and other tight linkage among adaptive alleles in facilitating adaptation. Finally, part 4 examines dispersal - selection dynamics over seasonal time scales to a) infer how selection against migrants and their offspring maintains local adaptation despite homogenizing connectivity and b) validate candidate loci for local adaptation. Varying levels of gene flow across the species range create a natural experiment for testing general predictions about the genomic mechanisms that enable adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow. The findings will therefore have broad implications and will significantly advance our understanding of the role genomic architecture plays in modifying the gene flow - selection balance within coastal environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People do not acquire all knowledge about a topic in a single experience. Instead, it is built up over experiences or lessons that are separated in time. The lessons also may come from different sources, such as books, lectures, videos, museum exhibits. A major challenge is to explain how individual, separate episodes of learning are integrated with one another, such that the knowledge base accumulates over time. This knowledge base extends beyond what we have learned explicitly, to include self-derived information, through logical processes such as induction and deduction. Prior research has found age-related increases in the ability to extend beyond explicit information to self-derive new knowledge through integration of separate episodes of learning. It also has found individual variability in the process, that relates to academic achievement. This new research will highlight the sources of these differences. These discoveries will inform interventions to promote these processes, thereby improving the depth and breadth of learning. In addition to its translational potential, the project also will benefit society by increasing the scientific literacy of undergraduate and graduate students, and by engaging children from diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>This project concerns the specific productive process of self-derivation of new factual knowledge through integration of separate yet related episodes of new learning. This occurs when learners integrate information newly acquired in one lesson (e.g., liquids expand with heat) with information newly acquired in another (thermometers contain liquid), and productively derive new factual knowledge (thermometers work because liquid expands as heat increases). There are age-related increases in self-derivation through integration across the school years. The major objective of the project is to test the source of the improvements. The research is situated in a broader literature on memory integration. It is distinguished by its focus on development, on process, and on producing factual knowledge. The guiding hypothesis is that age-related improvements are explained by developmental variability in the efficiency and efficacy of five component processes: encoding, reactivation, integration, selection, and self-derivation. The behavior of preschool to elementary-age children is consistent with a developmental progression in successful engagement of these processes. The project will directly test the suggested progression in 4- to 9-year-olds. Behavioral measures will be complemented by eye tracking. Tracking visual attention provides a window on cognitive effort, indicating engagement of component processes, and their relation to self-derivation of new knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As photosynthetic organisms, phytoplankton directly take up dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to synthesize their tissues using energy from the sun.  In addition to carbon (C), essential nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) are required by these primary producers.  While dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) is the preferred form of P because it is a small enough molecule that phytoplankton can directly absorb it, in the sunlit surface waters of the ocean the concentration of DIP can be drawn down to limiting levels.  In this situation, the larger dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) molecules can become available through enzyme hydrolysis reactions, which convert DOP to DIP.  There was mounting evidence that DOP can play a crucial role in supporting primary production in the ocean, yet very little is known about the nature of the DOP pool.  There are many analytical impediments to gaining information about the chemical structure and composition of DOP, and without knowledge of its composition there is no basis for evaluating the potential bioavailability of DOP to primary producers. The proposed work will employ a unique combination of methods to gain novel insight into the composition and bioavailability of DOP.  Field and laboratory (culture) nutrient addition incubation experiments will target the drivers of DOP variability, information crucial to resolving models of primary production in the ocean. Results of this work will be transformative for understanding DOP composition, DOP variability in space and time, and microbial control on the nature of the marine DOP pool.  <br/><br/>This proposal will support a postdoctoral scholar, two undergraduate students and two undergraduate students. Recruitment of undergraduate students will focus on entraining Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, through SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science)and related venues. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international meetings.  We also propose to conduct outreach to middle schools, including bringing The Artistic Oceanographer Program, an interactive inquiry-based program targeting middle school age science and art standards by integrating concepts in ocean science literacy with art, to local middle schools in New York and Hawaii.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed work will provide foundational information on the way DOP molecular characteristics translate into P-bioavailability to marine microorganisms, and in turn how microorganisms growing under different dissolved inorganic nitrogen: dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIN:DIP) impact the composition and bioavailability of DOP.  A newly developed sequential ultrafiltration (SUF) method will be applied to samples collected along a natural P-gradient in the western North Atlantic. The SUF method quantitatively segregates and concentrates DOP into 4 molecular weight size classes, which can be subjected to bioavailability assays using phosphohydrolytic enzymes, and to liquid chromotography-mass spectrometry to provide detailed compositional information.  Using these combined methods we will probe in situ DOP, the evolution of in situ DOP during shipboard incubations under different DIN:DIP, and the composition and bioavailability of DOP produced by organisms isolated from key stations along the natural phosphate gradient.  Contrast of in situ patterns to those developed in controlled culture experiments using field isolates will be achieved by identifying cellular shifts in organic phosphorus biosynthesis pathways, and tracing how such shifts impact DOP composition.  The combined methodological approach will provide unparalleled insight into DOP composition and bioavailability, addressing this major knowledge gap.  Results of this work will be transformative for understanding DOP composition, DOP variability in space and time, and microbial control on the nature of the marine DOP pool.  Such information is a prerequisite to building ecosystem models that capture the influence of P biogeochemistry on primary production and carbon cycling in aquatic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent research indicates that these large-scale events have altered the hydrological and ecosystem balances over historical and geological timescales (decades to thousands of years). This project will assess how far north along the coast of southwestern North America these storms have occurred in the geologic past, and how far inland they controlled geomorphic change events through rain and erosion. The specific goal is to determine if previously documented periods when tropical cyclones dominated runoff and sediment deposition across large alluvial fan systems of the southern Baja California peninsula can be detected in central Baja California, the southern California deserts, and even as far north as the southern Arizona Sonoran Desert. Data will test whether dissipating cyclones were drivers of alluvial fan sedimentation over thousands of years, and if a temporal correlation can be established to a period of transition between a milder, humid paleoclimate to the current arid climate. For the first time, a tropical cyclone landfall chronology covering the last few millennia will be developed for the Pacific coast of southwestern North America. This research has the potential to inform large-storm prediction scenarios for southern California and northwestern Mexico, which is relevant to hazards management for communities in need of risk assessment of rare and extreme events. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of earth scientists using a tiered approach, with field-based collaboration of postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. This approach has been proven successful for inclusion of underrepresented minorities, enhanced also with planned research alongside Mexican collaborators and students. The project will provide unique broader educational experiences for grade-school students in Indiana and Arizona, through the use of technology to connect fieldwork and classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will compare a recently established alluvial fan chronology in southern Baja California, with newly-obtained alluvial fan and paleotempestological records. A Holocene paleotempestological record of overwash deposits in the Pacific coastal Vizcaino Desert will be developed for the first time. The inferred tropical storm activity will be compared with inland alluvial fan deposition in this area and in the northern Sonoran Desert, enabling discrimination of signals from different moisture sources, based on observed coastal and alluvial sedimentology, stratigraphy, and specific proxy records. Effects of different sources of moisture that drive sedimentation will be assessed by probing different time periods, and compared to independent paleoclimatic proxies. Bayesian analysis of luminescence, cosmogenic, and radiocarbon geochronology will improve age control precision. The coupled alluvial and coastal record at orbital timescales will help to understand linkages between Quaternary alluvial sedimentation and hydroclimatic variability in the region, and will increase our understanding of basic principles of alluvial fan aggradation in response to change in arid hydroclimates. The project will test effects of millennial- and orbital-scale shifts in tropical circulation on landscape evolution of the region, which are, in turn, critical to test models of occurrence and effects of hydrological extremes and associated landscape changing events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diatoms float in the surface ocean as part of a group of organisms collectively called phytoplankton. There are thousands of different species of diatoms distributed across the global ocean.  A famous oceanographer Henry Bigelow once said ""All fish is diatoms"" reflecting the importance of diatoms as the base of the food chain that supports the world's largest fisheries. Despite their small size, diatom photosynthesis produces 20% of the oxygen on earth each year. That's more than all of the tropical rainforests on land. The major objective of the research is to understand how the metabolic differences among diatom species affects the amount of diatom organic carbon that is carried, or exported, from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. As diatoms are photosynthesizers like green plants, their biological carbon comes from converting carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater from the atmosphere into organic forms.  Diatoms also require a series of other nurtrients supplied by the ocean such as nitrogen and phosphorous and, uniquely for diatoms, the silicon used to construct their glass shells.  This research will investigate how genetic and physiological differences among diatoms influence how each species react to changes in nutrient levels in the ocean and how those shifts affect the export of diatom carbon to the deep sea. The link between diatoms' physiological response and their carbon export comes about because shifts in physiology affect diatom attributes like how fast they sink and how tasty they are to predators. So if we can relate the physiological condition of different diatoms to the food-web pathways followed by different species, we can ultimately use knowledge of diatom physiological status and food web structure to predict how much diatom carbon gets to the deep sea. The research involves investigators with expertise in the physiology and genomics of diatoms and in the ocean's chemistry. The work will initially take place in the subarctic North Pacific in conjunction with the NASA Export Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field program. The EXPORTS program is using a wide variety of methods to quantify the export and fate of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the upper ocean. The research supports the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research will also serve as the basis for activities aimed at K-12 and junior high school students. <br/><br/>The research will broadly impact our understanding of the biology of the biological pump (the transport of photosynthetically fixed organic carbon to the deep sea) by forming a mechanistic basis for predicting the export of diatom carbon. It is hypothesized that the type and degree of diatom physiological stress are vital aspects of ecosystem state that drive export. To test this hypothesis, the genetic composition, rates of nutrient use and growth response of diatom communities will be evaluated and supported with measurements of silicon and iron stress to evaluate stress as a predictor of the path of diatom carbon export. The subarctic N. Pacific ecosystem is characterized as high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) due to low iron (Fe) levels that are primary controllers constraining phytoplankton utilization of other nutrients. It has been a paradigm in low Fe, HNLC systems that diatoms grow at elevated Si:C and Si:N ratios and should be efficiently exported as particles significantly enriched in Si relative to C. However, Fe limitation also alters diatoms species composition and the high Si demand imposed by low Fe can drive HNLC regions to Si limitation or Si/Fe co-limitation. Thus, the degree of Si and/or Fe stress in HNLC waters can all alter diatom taxonomic composition, the elemental composition of diatom cells, and the path cells follow through the food web ultimately altering diatom carbon export.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are called internal waves and they have been largely studied in deep ocean basins and mid-to-outer continental shelf regions. However, steep internal waves are common in the inner shelf and can modify turbulent mixing, exchange of materials across the continental shelf, and biological productivity of coastal waters. This research will conduct an intensive field campaign and numerical modeling aiming at resolving the transformation of internal waves across the shelf including breaking and dissipation. Historically, internal waves are detected using observations of subsurface ocean temperature that are made at fixed locations using moorings or vertical profiles of temperature, each with their own limitations in resolution. This research uses a fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system, a new method that provides measurement over large areas over the shelf (kilometers), with high spatial (<1 meter) and temporal resolutions. These measurements will be combined with more traditional point measurements for hydrographic and turbulence variables. Results from this work will yield insights into benthic ecology, cross-shelf exchange of nutrients and pollutants, turbulent mixing, larval connectivity, coastal hypoxia, and ocean acidification. The educational component of this CAREER project is based on the idea that one of the best ways to help students succeed in the sciences, and to shape the innovators of the next generation is to inspire passion for science. This is achieved through the integration of research and teaching and activities that relate curricular concepts to societal issues that excite the students, and by demonstrating how perseverance is an important part for success. At the university level, courses will be re-designed to include: (i) socio-scientific issues related to ongoing research, and (ii) active learning techniques that encourage risk-taking and perseverance as a constructive path to scientific discovery. At primary and secondary education levels, the investigator will develop a mentor-toolkit to help professionals in STEM careers, who desire to serve as a role model but lack training in elementary education, to most effectively communicate their path to science and the struggles that they faced and overcame along the way.<br/><br/>The inner shelf is, in effect, a ""swash zone"" for nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) and their intermittency and small spatiotemporal scales pose challenges to observation. Consequently, there are few comprehensive field measurements of NLIWs on the inner shelf to test dynamical theories derived from numerous laboratory and numerical studies. This project will use high resolution DTS measurements, coupled with a dense array of hydrographic instruments and turbulence measurements, to capture a continuous view of the cross-shelf evolution of NLIWs. Results from a pilot study in the South China Sea demonstrate that DTS measurements can provide a unique perspective on NLIWs - allowing for detection of internal wave characteristics (form and path), variable propagation speed, reflection, wave-wave interactions, and ""internal tidepools"" (cool water left behind after the wave has run back down the slope). Furthermore, as opposed to boat-based measurements, which must physically follow a wave across the shelf, the proposed measurements are capable of capturing a cross-shelf view of many waves and will be useful for understanding variability in internal wave ""weather"" on the shelf. The observations will be performed at two locations, representing different shelf geometries and characteristic internal wave fields, and the data will be analyzed to advance our knowledge on NLIW transformation over the inner shelf, the fate of internal wave energy, and the effects of NLIWs on mass flux and turbulent mixing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

UAVs will significantly impact our daily life by enabling new applications, and simplifying existing applications including transportation, traffic control, remote health monitoring, surveillance, border patrolling, habitat monitoring, and precision agriculture. An important drawback to commercialize UAV-based solutions in these domains is networking inefficiency. Current communication protocols are extremely inefficient in accommodating dynamic topologies of networks of UAVs. This project seeks to address this issue and develop predictive communication strategies by anticipating network topology changes. The research will thus develop cognizant communication protocols for fully autonomous UAV networks by facilitating high-throughput information exchange and eliminating the need for multiple ground control stations.  <br/><br/>This project aims to develop novel tools for predictive communication for networks of flying objects with heterogeneous maneuverability levels. The key idea is to take preventive actions via communication protocols before anticipated network partitions and/or failures. The proposed methodology relies on developing a universal model to predict motion trajectories of surrounding network nodes. To enable motion profiling, driving force of each object is modeled as a hierarchical generative model with a hidden layer shared among objects of the same type. The use of a novel merge-and-split method provides flexibility in accommodating new object classes with unseen maneuverability levels and repealing intruding objects. Novel methods based on cyclic monoids in category theory will be used to design optimal measurement patterns for network topology prediction. Finally, a predictive routing algorithm will be developed by incorporating the predicted network topology into decision making when looking for the optimal path. A concrete characterization of the tradeoff between the routing optimality and prediction uncertainties will be developed based on random matrix concentration inequalities to pave the road for practical implementation. Graph snappers and hybrid routing techniques will be studied to integrate conventional and predictive routing algorithms to accelerate the routing algorithm execution for large-scale networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This vast ocean around Antarctica is the primary location where the waters that fill the deep ocean are brought to the surface where they interact with the atmosphere and with sea ice.  Because of this unique role in the global climate system, the physical and biological processes that occur in the Southern Ocean have a disproportionately large impact on the properties of the global ocean, including the amount of heat and carbon dioxide that is trapped in the deep ocean for hundreds to thousands of years.  Extremely sparse observations of both the Southern Ocean?s circulation structure and biological properties, such as nutrient and biomass concentrations, have presented a significant barrier to understanding the modification of near surface waters and their subsequent exchange with the deep ocean. In recent years, the SOCCOM (Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling) project has used innovative robotic technologies, namely autonomous profiling floats, to provide observations of biogeochemical properties in the Southern Ocean with unprecedented coverage in space and time.  This advance marks a step change in our ability to mechanistically understand the Southern Ocean?s role in the global carbon cycle but many of the physical and biological processes responsible for generating the observed biogeochemical distributions are not adequately captured by the floats because of their relatively coarse sampling interval (10 days).  In this project, two ocean gliders will be piloted to track individual floats in order to measure the oceanic circulation features that impact exchange between the surface and interior ocean.  Gliders sample the upper 1000 meters of the ocean once every 4 to 5 hours and are able to resolve variations in fluid motion on time scales of about a day. On these scales, the variability of vertical velocities are quite large and thus the circulation at these shorter temporal and smaller spatial scales significantly influences the vertical transport of ocean properties.  An improved characterization of motions at these scales, and their impact on heat and carbon transport, will lead to a better understanding of the role the Southern Ocean plays in the global carbon cycle.<br/><br/>Two autonomous ocean gliders will be deployed in the Indian sector of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, coincident with one or more semi-Lagrangian Argo floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors through the SOCCOM project. The gliders will be piloted to track the Argo float for a period of at least four months, resolving the mesoscale and submesoscale structure surrounding the float as well as variability occurring at periods shorter than the float?s 10-day sampling interval. Measurements of the upper ocean hydrographic and velocity fields will permit an analysis of hydrodynamical instabilities within the mixed layer and their impact on vertical transport and exchange across the base of the mixed layer.  The glider data will also be combined with the float observations and remote sensing products to derive vertical tracer fluxes, with the goal of quantifying the partitioning of export between sinking and advective pathways.  Ultimately, this project will provide observations of the physical processes that contribute to high-frequency spatial and temporal variability in Southern Ocean tracer distributions and will provide a significant step towards describing the mechanisms that influence physical and biogeochemical distributions and transport pathways in the Southern Ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diatoms float in the surface ocean as part of a group of organisms collectively called phytoplankton. There are thousands of different species of diatoms distributed across the global ocean.  A famous oceanographer Henry Bigelow once said ""All fish is diatoms"" reflecting the importance of diatoms as the base of the food chain that supports the world's largest fisheries. Despite their small size, diatom photosynthesis produces 20% of the oxygen on earth each year. That's more than all of the tropical rain forests on land. The major objective of the research is to understand how the metabolic differences among diatom species affects the amount of diatom organic carbon that is carried, or exported, from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. As diatoms are photo-synthesizers like green plants, their biological carbon comes from converting carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater from the atmosphere into organic forms.  Diatoms also require a series of other nurtrients supplied by the ocean such as nitrogen and phosphorous and, uniquely for diatoms, the silicon used to construct their glass shells.  This research will investigate how genetic and physiological differences among diatoms influence how each species react to changes in nutrient levels in the ocean and how those shifts affect the export of diatom carbon to the deep sea. The link between diatoms' physiological response and their carbon export comes about because shifts in physiology affect diatom attributes like how fast they sink and how tasty they are to predators. So if we can relate the physiological condition of different diatoms to the food-web pathways followed by different species, we can ultimately use knowledge of diatom physiological status and food web structure to predict how much diatom carbon gets to the deep sea. The research involves investigators with expertise in the physiology and genomics of diatoms and in the ocean's chemistry. The work will initially take place in the subarctic North Pacific in conjunction with the NASA Export Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field program. The EXPORTS program is using a wide variety of methods to quantify the export and fate of photo-synthetically fixed carbon in the upper ocean. The research supports the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research will also serve as the basis for activities aimed at K-12 and junior high school students. <br/><br/>The research will broadly impact our understanding of the biology of the biological pump (the transport of photo-synthetically fixed organic carbon to the deep sea) by forming a mechanistic basis for predicting the export of diatom carbon. It is hypothesized that the type and degree of diatom physiological stress are vital aspects of ecosystem state that drive export. To test this hypothesis, the genetic composition, rates of nutrient use and growth response of diatom communities will be evaluated and supported with measurements of silicon and iron stress to evaluate stress as a predictor of the path of diatom carbon export. The subarctic N. Pacific ecosystem is characterized as high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) due to low iron (Fe) levels that are primary controllers constraining phytoplankton utilization of other nutrients. It has been a paradigm in low Fe, HNLC systems that diatoms grow at elevated Si:C and Si:N ratios and should be efficiently exported as particles significantly enriched in Si relative to C. However, Fe limitation also alters diatoms species composition and the high Si demand imposed by low Fe can drive HNLC regions to Si limitation or Si/Fe co-limitation. Thus, the degree of Si and/or Fe stress in HNLC waters can all alter diatom taxonomic composition, the elemental composition of diatom cells, and the path cells follow through the food web ultimately altering diatom carbon export.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is generally accepted that the triggers to both these large earthquakes and the melting of the subducted crust and overlying mantle somehow involve the release of fluids from the subducted sediments and crust via devolatilization reactions that cause the breakdown of minerals that contain water in their structure. However, the identity of the specific minerals and reactions responsible for the release of fluids has been elusive because none of the minerals that are believed to be common in subduction channels have the appropriate stabilities with respect to pressure and temperature based on thermodynamic calculations. This study will support the Ph.D. dissertation research of a graduate student from an underrepresented group in geosciences, and will involve two undergraduate students from Amherst College that is collaborating on some of the analytical activities.<br/>	<br/>This project is to test the alternative hypothesis that garnet-bearing reactions that produce fluids during the subduction process are significantly overstepped with respect to their nominal equilibrium location at a specific pressure and temperature. That is, the common minerals found in subduction zones may persist to significantly greater depths (the depths recorded by earthquakes) because the nucleation of the new phases necessary to initiate the reaction is suppressed. This hypothesis will be tested through application of a novel approach that utilizes Raman spectroscopy on inclusions of quartz inside of the mineral garnet to determine the pressure-temperature conditions at which the garnet nucleated and, thus, the conditions at which major devolatilization occurs. The results of this study should help resolve a long-standing paradox and will provide a much clearer understanding of the processes responsible for triggering earthquakes and mantle melting thus aiding in the ability to predict the occurrence of these hazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has recently become clear, however, that many marine species are subdivided into multiple populations that have evolved to thrive best under contrasting local environmental conditions. Nevertheless, we still know very little about the genomic mechanisms that enable divergent adaptations in the face of ongoing intermixing. This project focuses on the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), a small estuarine fish that exhibits a remarkable degree of local adaptation in growth rates and a suite of other traits tightly associated with a climatic gradient across latitudes. Decades of prior lab and field studies have made Atlantic silverside one of the marine species for which we have the best understanding of evolutionary tradeoffs among traits and drivers of selection causing adaptive divergence. Yet, the underlying genomic basis is so far completely unknown. The investigators will integrate whole genome sequencing data from wild fish sampled across the distribution range with breeding experiments in the laboratory to decipher these genomic underpinnings. This will provide one of the most comprehensive assessments of the genomic basis for local adaptation in the oceans to date, thereby generating insights that are urgently needed for better predictions about how species can respond to rapid environmental change. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for a postdoc as well as two graduate and several undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities. The findings will also be leveraged to develop engaging teaching and outreach materials (e.g. a video documentary and popular science articles) to promote a better understanding of ecology, evolution, and local adaptation among science students and the general public. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to characterize the genomic basis and architecture underlying local adaptation in M. menidia and examine how the adaptive divergence is shaped by varying levels of gene flow and maintained over ecological time scales. The project is organized into four interconnected components. Part 1 examines fine-scale spatial patterns of genomic differentiation along the adaptive cline to a) characterize the connectivity landscape, b) identify genomic regions under divergent selection, and c) deduce potential drivers and targets of selection by examining how allele frequencies vary in relation to environmental factors and biogeographic features. Part 2 maps key locally adapted traits to the genome to dissect their underlying genomic basis. Part 3 integrates patterns of variation in the wild (part 1) and the mapping of traits under controlled conditions (part 2) to a) examine how genomic architectures underlying local adaptation vary across gene flow regimes and b) elucidating the potential role of chromosomal rearrangements and other tight linkage among adaptive alleles in facilitating adaptation. Finally, part 4 examines dispersal - selection dynamics over seasonal time scales to a) infer how selection against migrants and their offspring maintains local adaptation despite homogenizing connectivity and b) validate candidate loci for local adaptation. Varying levels of gene flow across the species range create a natural experiment for testing general predictions about the genomic mechanisms that enable adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow. The findings will therefore have broad implications and will significantly advance our understanding of the role genomic architecture plays in modifying the gene flow - selection balance within coastal environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wave breaking is an important source of turbulence and mixing at the ocean surface, including the turbulent exchange of gasses and heat between the ocean and the atmosphere.  Wave breaking is also a hazard to navigation and safe passage for vessels at sea.  The key question is ""how much energy is lost when waves break?"".  This lost energy is both an important parameter for accurate wave forecasts and for prescribing ocean-atmosphere exchange.  Recent work has suggested that the quantity and size of bubbles generated during wave breaking are the key controls on the energy dissipation and thus the strength of breaking.  This project will use field observations and computer models to verify this dependence, with application to improve wave forecasting and ocean-atmosphere coupling. The proposed work will support a postdoctoral researcher and contribute to public outreach with specific contributions to the annual Discovery Days event at the University of Washington, that reaches 10,000 students from regional K-12 schools.<br/><br/>The technical approach of the project is to measure wave breaking in the open ocean with freely drifting buoys that are equipped with motion sensors, turbulence profilers, and cameras for bubble recording. The proposed work builds on recent results using the Surface Wave Instrument Float with Tracking (SWIFT) drifters to measure the turbulent dissipation rate beneath breaking waves and a VOF-based (volume of fluid) Eulerian-Eulerian polydisperse two-fluid model to simulate the two-phase bubbly flow. Previous results suggest that dissipation by bubbles may be an increasingly large fraction of the total wave breaking dissipation during high sea states. The measurements to be carried in this project will be analyzed to determine the time evolution of the bubbles, as well as the turbulence and motion associated with individual breaking waves. The data will be used to test a recent formulation that scales the total dissipation with the time integral of the bubble plume volume. Further, a related formulation that scales bubble plume depth with the area of foam patches visible at the ocean surface will be evaluated. Improvement of the latter formulation will allow estimates of plume volume and infer dissipation remotely. The formulation derived will be compared with other estimates for dissipation, which include: the Phillips breaking crest distribution, equilibrium wind input, and in situ measurements of turbulent dissipation. The proposed work will also examine the effects of intermittence and the consequences of sparsely sampled field observations. These measurements will be compared with the high resolution, two-fluid model simulations of the breaking process. This approach will enable a more complete investigation of breaking wave conditions and an assessment of the inherent sparseness of the observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumption of organic material produced by the algae in deeper waters or in sediments consumes oxygen, leading to low-oxygen ""dead zones"" in many places like the northern Gulf of Mexico. This process of nutrient input, algal growth, and loss of oxygen is called eutrophication. Consumption of the organic matter also releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the water, and contributes directly and indirectly to ocean acidification. In order to understand and predict this impact on acidification, it is important to understand how much of the organic matter degradation occurs in the water column versus in the sediments, how variable it is between seasons and years, and how it is affected by processes such as storms that disturb the bottom sediments. In this project, investigators from three institutions along with their graduate and undergraduate students will conduct a combination of field observations and computer modeling to address these questions in the northern Gulf of Mexico. They will share their results with the public through local outreach activities, and with secondary school students in Louisiana through partnerships and curriculum development with local teachers.<br/><br/>The proposed research will use a combined observational and numerical modeling approach to better understand the role of shelf sediment in driving bottom water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH dynamics and acidification at seasonal scales. Past and current studies have not addressed this mechanism. This current lack of knowledge makes it difficult to construct a comprehensive carbon budget for this region. The proposed research will (i) quantify the role of benthic fluxes in DIC production leading to acidification in the bottom water; (ii) determine the importance of the seasonally changing benthic DIC flux in acidifying the bottom water; and (iii) explore the importance of episodic resuspension events in modulating benthic fluxes of DIC. Seasonal sampling will be carried out in Louisiana shelf using state of the art benthic lander platform to record in situ sediment and bottom water oxygen consumption rates, organic matter remineralization rates, sediment oxygen penetration depths, benthic fluxes of DIC and accompanying pH drop. Bottom current velocities and turbidity will also be recorded in conjunction with sediment porewater and water column sampling. Complementing these detailed near-bed and seabed observations, we will utilize a recently developed coupled hydrodynamics, sediment transport and biogeochemistry model (HydroBioSed) to scale up observed estimates of benthic fluxes to an annual scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collaboration with South American colleagues is planned as is extensive student involvement.<br/><br/>This project aims to employ classical dendrochronological techniques to generate new tropical tree-ring chronologies that are annually resolved and absolutely dated. Radiocarbon measurements (14-Carbon) will ensure accurate dating assessments. Thus, successful tree species will be selected to improve the 14-Carbon curve for the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting tree-ring series will be used to reconstruct past climate variability and regional to large--scale atmospheric dynamics for the last several centuries. The specific aims of the project are to improve understanding of: (1) the spatiotemporal variability of the South American summer monsoon (SASM); (2) long-term interactions between El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the SASM; and (3) the impact of volcanic forcing on past hydroclimate of the tropical Andes.<br/><br/>The research aims to provide significant advances in the science of tropical dendrochronology by<br/>developing a tree-ring network for the tropical Andes in Peru and Bolivia, a region with exceedingly scarce coverage of high-resolution terrestrial paleo-records. While tree rings have been extensively used in temperate climates, the tropics remain relatively unexplored due to the difficulty, in particular, of identifying consistent wood layers (tree rings) corresponding to seasonal or annual growing periods. The Central Andes are an ideal region for overcoming these difficulties, due to the pronounced precipitation seasonality and diverse forests.<br/><br/>The tropical Andes are a hotspot for biodiversity and its geographic position makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change. It also contains nearly all the tropical glaciers on the globe, and recent, widespread glacial retreat is causing a rapid decline in hydrological reserves.  This decline, in combination with increasing water demand due to population growth and economic expansion poses an enormous challenge for water availability, biodiversity and food security. The complex topography of the Andean Cordillera leads to a climate that is characterized by strong zonal and vertical precipitation gradients. Moisture influx from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon basin is modulated by the SASM and ENSO. The scientific understanding of this variability is challenged by the scarcity of long instrumental observations, which also limits the ability to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections over this region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project is to enable exploration of the inherent insecurity of the IoT paradigm by exploring innovative data analytics as applied to raw cyber security data.  Insights gained will allow detection, characterization and attribution of Internet-scale compromised IoT devices, coupled with their malicious activities, in near real-time.  Several technical challenges impede addressing IoT security at large, including, the excessive diversity of IoT devices in addition to their Internet-wide deployment, the lack of IoT-relevant data and the shortage of IoT-specific actionable attack signatures.  In this context, this project serves NSF's mission to promote the progress of science by aiming to generate a first-of-a-kind, large-scale analysis of the magnitude of compromised IoT devices.  The project also promotes cyber security research and training for minorities, given that it will be executed within the boundaries of a designated Hispanic-serving institution.

The project will design and develop real-time algorithms that are capable of inferring Internet-scale exploited IoT devices by exploring darknet data.  Furthermore, the project will investigate formal correlation approaches rooted in stochastic data structures between IoT-relevant passive measurements and malware samples to aid in the attribution and thus the remediation objective.  The project will further explore the orchestration behavior of seemingly independent IoT activities, which operate within well-coordinated IoT botnets.  To this end, the project will innovate time series analytics based upon trigonometric interpolation techniques, recursive optimal stochastic estimators, and bitmap matching algorithms to infer such IoT botnets by employing passive measurements.The project will also (1) develop a unique cyberinfrastructure for IoT cyber threat indexing by automating the proposed algorithms, techniques and methods, (2) generate IoT-specific signatures by employing piecewise hashing techniques, and (3) create access methods based on an API mechanism and a front-end service facilitated by Elasticsearch to allow the sharing of IoT-centric empirical data, threat intelligence and signatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to understand how assessment practices may drive teacher effectiveness. This research study will include participation of 58 elementary, middle, and high school STEM teachers who previously participated in a Noyce-funded project and who have persisted in teaching in Boston or other nearby high-need districts. The project will compare differences in the assessment practices of these Noyce-program teachers to 29 other K-12 STEM teachers from the same area, but who participated in different training programs. The project aims to increase knowledge about STEM teacher effectiveness by how teacher effectiveness may relate to teachers measure their students' understanding. The project will examine changes in how STEM teachers measure student learning over several years, as the teachers gain more experience in the classroom. Outcomes from the research will help us understand how STEM teachers measure student learning and use that information to improve their teaching and to assign grades. <br/><br/>The goals of the research study are to: (a) Increase understanding of teachers' assessment practices, particularly for Noyce Scholars in comparison to other STEM teachers who also persist in teaching in high-need school districts; (b) Measure growth in the assessment practices of Noyce Scholars in comparison to other STEM teachers over time; and (c) Better understand the role of the conceptual, pedagogical, cultural and political challenges teachers face as their assessment practices change. The research employs both qualitative and quantitative methods, in an interaction analysis framework, to study four research questions about K-12 STEM teachers who have persisted in teaching in high-need districts: (1) What are the teachers' current assessment practices? (2) How have their assessment practices changed from when they began teaching in a high-need district? (3) How do salient retrospective conceptual, pedagogical, cultural, and political challenges negotiated by the teachers explain their current classroom formative assessment practices and changes over time in their assessment practices? and (4) For teachers who have persisted teaching in Boston Public Schools, how do assessment practices relate to student performance outcomes on classroom assessments and to district and State standardized mathematics and science exams? Across these questions, the research team will examine differences between Boston and other districts, as well as effects of other factors, including Noyce- vs. non-Noyce- prepared teachers, length of time teaching in high-need districts, and school-level influences such as school culture, accountability rating, stability of leadership, and professional development opportunities. The project will contribute to theory about teacher assessment practices and the degree to which interaction analysis is useful in studying these practices. The project will also contribute to educational policy implications for supporting teachers to navigate pedagogical perspectives, curricular expectations, administrative policies and procedures, and external pressures as they persist in STEM teaching careers in high-need districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in spite of noteworthy success, today's CFD still remains limited to a small design space.  One of the grand challenge problems is the simulation of a full aircraft envelope.  Today's computing platforms are based on massive parallelism and heterogeneous processor designs to deliver petascale performance (10^15 floating point operations per second).  This research has the potential to effectively harness this level of performance and significantly address grand challenge problems through advances in numerical schemes, efficient parallel algorithms, and implementation strategies to enable underlying simulations that are currently infeasible.  It also aims at transforming CFD simulation capabilities to dramatically reduce the cost and time needed to solve complex multi-physics problems.  As such, this research fills a gap in the understanding that lies at the intersection of computational fluid dynamics and parallel computing.  This interdisciplinary research also shapes the next-generation of students and researchers with a multi-faceted skill set required to solve challenging problems at the boundary of domain sciences, applied mathematics, and computer science to promote the progress of science and advance national prosperity and welfare as stated by NSF's mission.<br/><br/>This research creates HiPer, a CFD solver for high-performance turbulent flow simulations on massively parallel machines.  HiPer solves the Navier-Stokes equations on multi-block structured grids for complex geometries by combining the following key components: (i) a novel time-delayed implicit time-marching scheme tailored for heterogeneous architectures;  (ii) parallelization strategies for shared- and distributed-memory systems aimed at reducing the synchronization and communication time; and  a hybrid multi-block structured grid enhanced by geometric multigrid to increase convergence as well as reduce the number of grid cells.  Applications that are drivers in the near- and long-term serve as benchmarks for continually measuring progress towards the grand challenge goals.  In particular, two application case studies serve as drivers for the near-term: (a) the simulation of the complex unsteady flow through multi-stage compressors and turbines, and (b) noise generation and propagation in a high-speed turbulent jet.  The intellectual merit of this work is the development of novel numerical techniques, parallelization strategies, and scalable software that enable turbulent-separated flow simulations that are computationally intractable today.  To engage and inspire young generations to this approach, this project strives to (i) organize hands-on workshops at relevant conferences, (ii) design and develop an educational kit targeted to teaching CFD and high-performance computing (HPC) concepts, (iii) design lab-based courses on HPC for computational scientists, including hands-on labs using HiPer on large-scale systems for on-site students, and (iv) release videos and guest lectures through University of California's Early Academic Outreach Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such advances will enable a better understanding of human interactions with nature and improve our ability to forecast how environmental change will affect services provided by natural and agricultural ecosystems in the future. To reach these goals, this project will synthesize three decades of the principle investigator's and his close colleagues' research into a predictive theory of the way ecosystems with many species are organized and how they change over time. The core of this theory is based on organisms' abilities to consume resources, grow, and be consumed by other organisms as well as the network architecture of these consumer-resource interactions among tens, hundreds and thousands of species. Elements of this general theory have been published in over one hundred papers, most of which are sole or co-authored by this project's principle investigator. How the ideas in all these papers fit together, including the theory, its foundations, and future directions have yet to be adequately synthesized and articulated. This project will describe that synthetic framework in the form of a book, a review article, visualizations and video animations that define the concepts, equations and computer simulations underlying the theory. This research will also increase the accessibility of ecological network theory to broader audiences, and advance the careers of researchers who are members of groups underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>This project will synthesize theory focused on the structure, dynamics, and evolution of food webs and their bipartite subsets including mutualistic and host-parasite/pathogen networks based on integrating consumer-resource theory with network theory and the metabolic theory of ecology. This involves describing the conceptual and computational theory of allometric trophic networks and its application to ecological, evolutionary and sustainability sciences including predictions of the quantitative consequences of species loss, fishing, and climate change. Further development aims to advance a systems biology of ecology that synthesizes ecology by integrating its subdisciplines, especially organismal, population, community and ecosystem ecology, as well as the interface between ecology and evolutionary, social, sustainability, and network sciences.

Examples include wireless communications,  computational photography, and the training of multilayer networks for classification tasks. In some cases, performance is fundamentally limited by the amount of data. In other cases, the main limitation is the computational complexity of processing algorithms. A major challenge for researchers is to understand these fundamental limits. This project explores these limits by studying probabilistic models that describe the statistical relationship between the data and the unknown quantities of interest (e.g., transmitted message or correct label). The research involves combining ideas from information theory and statistical physics to compute fundamental limits and using these results to design efficient methods with improved performance. The interdisciplinary nature of the research is mirrored in the education activities of this project, which focuses on making connections between engineering, statistical physics, and the information sciences, as well as improving undergraduate education through exploratory data analysis.<br/><br/>The key conceptual idea behind this research is that statistical dependencies induced through multiplication by dense random matrices can be understood through connections with simpler models involving additive Gaussian noise. In a recent breakthrough, the investigator showed how ideas from information theory could provide rigorous proofs for behaviors that had been conjectured using the heuristic replica method from statistical physics. Building upon this insight, the research is organized around three thrusts: i) Developing new theoretical methods to provide rigorous and interpretable characterization of fundamental limits; ii) Designing new algorithms for inference, learning, and compression; and iii) Analyzing bi-linear and multi-layer inference problems with applications to deep learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, modern global estimates of this process (commonly called carbon export) differ by over 100%. These estimates are often derived from regional relationships between ocean measurements and satellite observations that are then applied globally. Persistent differences between the satellite and field-based estimates of carbon export have been found throughout the ocean, suggesting that improvements are needed. This project will determine whether profiling floats equipped with chemical sensors can be used to estimate the export of carbon in the ocean. Floats will be deployed at Ocean Station Papa, but the approach is scalable in nature and could be used to validate and improve the satellite algorithms used for global carbon export determinations. The project will support a female, early career scientist and a postdoc, as well as facilitate international collaboration with Canadian scientists. Additionally, the results may assist the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) EXPORTS campaign as well as other satellite carbon export development efforts. <br/><br/><br/>Modern global estimates of the biological pump differ by over 100% (~5 to >12 Pg C yr-1) making it challenging to determine the role of marine biogeochemical (BGC) cycling in modern climate and climate variability.

Persistent discrepancies between unique satellite algorithms and unique geochemical approaches suggest that accurately quantifying the biological pump remains a fundamental research goal. This project will assess the capability of using BGC profiling floats to estimate the export of distinct biogenic carbon pools (dissolved and particulate organic carbon, and particulate inorganic carbon). By using BGC floats to close multiple upper ocean tracer budgets this project will address two known issues common to other geochemical approaches: assumptions about (1) dissolved organic carbon cycling and (2) the integration depth used for annual carbon export assessments. The method will be tested at Ocean Station Papa, but is scalable in nature and could be used to develop a carbon export database suitable for the validation and training of satellite algorithms required for global carbon export determinations. Results from the floats will be compared to satellite carbon export algorithm estimates over the 5-year float lifetimes. Ten years of existing BGC data from profiling floats and a mooring in the region will also be used to provide further context about interannual variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, TC prediction models and global weather prediction models are expected to merge in a near future. Turbulent mixing in the ocean surface layer under TCs effectively couples the ocean and atmosphere through air-sea exchanges of heat and momentum. This air-sea coupling is modulated by ocean surface waves (sea states) that are particularly complex and varied under TC conditions. Surface waves affect both one-dimensional (vertical mixing/diffusion), and three-dimensional  (upwelling and horizontal advection) processes in the upper ocean. The focus of this study is to advance ocean turbulent mixing schemes that explicitly include the impact of surface waves. Although similar efforts are underway in modeling centers worldwide, few of such efforts include extreme (TC) conditions. Results from this study will inform on the leading order impacts from surface waves on upper ocean processes in high wind conditions, on the benefits of coupling wave and ocean models, and on optimal approaches to implementing wave-dependent parameterizations. The proposed effort is timely and will immediately benefit both the regional and global weather and climate modeling communities. The results of the research will be integrated into the Hurricanes: Science and Society website that is currently used by tens of thousands of educators and students as well as the general public. In addition to their technical training, the graduate students will receive training from education and outreach professionals on how to translate complex scientific concepts into non-expert language.<br/><br/>This collaborative study will be carried out by combining state-of-the-art modeling and observational data obtained in previous field programs. Specifically, upper ocean responses to several historical Tropical Cyclones will be simulated using a coupled ocean-wave model that includes sea-state dependent Langmuir turbulence parameterizations and other significant surface wave impacts (the Stokes advection, the Coriolis Stokes force, the Stokes shear force, and the air-sea momentum flux budget). First, the model results will be used to constrain the wind stress and the drag coefficient. Next, the model results, with and without the wave effects, will be compared with observational data, including mixed layer temperature, current, and turbulence data. This investigation will clarify whether the Langmuir turbulence and other surface wave effects make leading order impacts on upper ocean responses to Tropical Cyclones, and whether their accurate prediction requires a fully coupled ocean-wave model with sea-state dependent parameterizations.

Most research on the gut microbiome has focused on human and rodent models. This doctoral dissertation project takes a broader, comparative perspective by examining gut microbiome characteristics in non-human primates, to better understand microbiome variation across species, diets, and habitats. Beyond providing new, relevant animal models for understanding human health, this multi-species research will provide fundamental knowledge about primate-microbiome relationships relative to host ecology and evolution, and will inform husbandry practices for improving the management of endangered species. The results of this study will be shared with the scientific community via publication in peer-reviewed journals, specific conservation organizations, such as the IUCN Primate Specialist Group, and the Duke Lemur Center, and with the general public via commitment to educational science outreach. The project will also provide training for undergraduate students in field and laboratory methods, bioinformatics and statistical analysis, and data dissemination.  <br/><br/>For leaf-eating primates, one critical role of the gut microbiome is to convert ingested plant fiber into essential nutrients. Indeed, upwards of 57% of daily energy demands in folivorous primates are met by microbially-synthesized compounds. Yet, our understanding of the influence of host ecology and evolution on the primate gut microbiome remains limited, as there is a paucity of available comparative data. To boost comparative power, the co-PI's dissertation research is focused on the structure and function of the gut microbiome in multiple lemur species that vary in relatedness, the proportion of foliage in their diets, the type of forest they inhabit, and their endangerment. The investigators will explore gut microbiomes in two wild populations of Coquerel's sifakas living in northwest Madagascar, and the captive population housed at the Duke Lemur Center in NC. Combining two methods of powerful genetic sequencing, that respectively determine microbial membership and metabolic function, this project address three specific aims: (1) a phylogenetic comparison across several wild primate species, (2) determination of normative gut microbiome variation across populations of a host species, and (3) investigation of the effects of captivity on sifaka gut microbiome. Ultimately, this study will improve understanding of the fragility of the folivore gut microbiome and offer insight into primate nutrition, with potential applications to primate husbandry and human healthcare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most of the organic material produced by phytoplankton in the sunlit surface waters of the oceans is eaten and recycled in the surface waters, a small amount sinks to the deep ocean in what is called the ""biological carbon pump."" The biological pump is particularly hard to study in high latitude regions, which can be difficult to get to and challenging to work in. It is also particularly important to understand the biological pump in these parts of the ocean, where much of the world's deep ocean waters are formed. The export of carbon to deep waters can be estimated by carefully measuring the amount of excess oxygen left behind in surface waters. Oxygen in seawater can be measured very precisely using sensors deployed on moorings, floats, and gliders. These sensors can be deployed for years at a time, but their measurements must be carefully calibrated. In this project, investigators would use carefully calibrated oxygen sensors on gliders to, in turn, calibrate the oxygen sensors on a set of moorings in the high latitude North Atlantic Ocean, to study the biological carbon pump over a period of two years. The project would train several undergraduate students and a graduate student, and result in the development of educational laboratory materials that incorporate glider and mooring data from the project.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to observationally constrain the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of the biological carbon pump (determined as annual net community production; ANCP) and its influence on air-sea carbon dioxide flux by using biogeochemical sensor measurements from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Irminger Sea Array. However, existing OOI oxygen sensor calibration suffers from both pre- and post-deployment drift, currently precluding the ability to calculate ANCP by oxygen mass balance. The investigators therefore propose to improve the accuracy and utility of OOI Irminger Sea oxygen measurements by deploying two gliders configured for air calibration of their oxygen sensors when surfacing between profiles. These air-calibrated gliders will be used to intercalibrate all 12 existing oxygen sensors on the Irminger Sea Array and produce a calibrated oxygen product incorporating data from all sensors, which will ensure sufficient accuracy to calculate ANCP. Both the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of ANCP, including upper ocean biological productivity and thermocline respiration, will be determined using an oxygen mass balance approach within a data- constrained 1D physical model. A suite of 1D model simulations including the inorganic carbon system, gas exchange, and ANCP determined from oxygen mass balance will be used, together with OOI carbon dioxide measurements, to diagnose influences of physical and biological drivers of air-sea carbon dioxide flux, improving both quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how the biological pump influences the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems will revolutionize healthcare through early identification of patients at risk, cell-level diagnosis and treatment using nanoprobes, and robotic surgery. They will reduce traffic congestion and help eliminate fatalities by powering autonomous vehicles and unmanned drones. And, they will make businesses safer by detecting and defending in real-time against financial fraud and internet attacks.  More generally, these systems will transform how people sense and interact with the surrounding world making it more adaptive and responsive to our needs.  In order to fulfill this vision, a new generation of AI systems is needed to power mission-critical applications where human safety and well-being are at stake, and can work in adversarial environments that change continually and unexpectedly.  Besides being intelligent, these decision systems need to address four challenges. First, they must react in real-time (i.e., making decisions in seconds or even milliseconds) to support applications such as robotic surgery and self-driving cars. Second, AI systems need to learn continually on live data streams as their environments evolve chaotically.  Third, these systems need to be secure, i.e., ensure privacy, data confidentiality, and decision integrity. Finally, as these systems make decisions on behalf of humans, their decisions need to be explainable to someone with limited understanding of AI. For example, if an AI system diagnoses a patient with a rare disease or deems a certain test unwarranted, the system should provide an explanation in terms of the patient's history and that of the larger population, and not point to the AI algorithm's internal computations. The goal of this Expedition project is to build AI decision systems to address these challenges by developing open source platforms, tools, and algorithms for Real-time, Intelligent, Secure, and Explainable (RISE) decisions. Achieving this goal requires a holistic approach that combines AI, security, systems, and hardware research.  For example, to successfully deploy a fleet of delivery robots in a crowded city requires not only advances in AI (e.g., the ability to perceive and safely navigate complex urban environments), but also advances in systems (e.g., new hybrid edge-cloud systems able to coordinate vehicles in real-time), security (e.g., ensure the information collected by robots' sensors does not compromise customer's privacy), and computer architecture (e.g., hardware and software co-design to reduce power consumption and improve security). <br/>    <br/>The RISE project aims to empower a large community of pioneers to build innovative applications and solutions based on the tools and ideas it will create, and broaden research participation, allowing students and researchers across many disciplines to contribute and build on its artifacts.  Building and fostering a community around a common open platform for AI systems will enable the next decade of innovation centered around widespread, intelligent, and trustworthy computing. The key technical contribution is in the areas at the interface of systems, hardware, and security, which would enable real-time AI. In the Systems domain, there are two key ideas: 1) the design of micro-kernel to fundamentally transform the time scale at which decisions using deep models are made; and, 2) incorporating the ability to replay the state and the decision history of the system.

Existing methods to manufacture hierarchical nanostructures with long-range order require the use of templates that are limited in terms of fabrication scalability, cost, and time. They also lag behind on generating controlled composition variations in three-dimensional structures. This award supports fundamental research to produce needed knowledge for the study of a facile process to generate scalable and reconfigurable three-dimensional templates for the directed assembly of hierarchical nanostructures with rationally designed structure, topology, composition, and long-range order. This research promotes scientific understanding of the self-assembly process and provides strategies to direct the assembly by engineering the environment. Since assembly process is common in nature, e.g., living cells assemble into functional organs following a hierarchical order, knowledge from this research contributes to the understanding of life and life's engineering, which impacts the NSF Big Idea of 'Understanding the Rules of Life'. The multi-disciplinary research, involving acoustics, fluid dynamics, materials science and manufacturing, provides unique training and research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. The project involves community college students, especially, those from under-represented minorities, in research and help achieve academic success in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The assembly of hierarchical nanostructures directed by acoustically-modulated emulsion can overcome several limitations existing assembly methods have, including disordered structures in long range, high cost, lengthy time, low scalability, and limited control of composition and anisotropy. However, fundamental scientific barriers are yet to be overcome to fully exploit the application potential of hierarchical nanostructures. This research is to fill the knowledge gap on the dynamics of nanoparticles and nanoparticle-loaded droplets in the Pickering emulsion system when subjected to a standing acoustic field. The project performs multi-scale molecular dynamics and finite element simulation, coupled with experimental validation, to investigate the dynamics of nanoparticles and emulsion droplets and delineate the effects of key process variables. Based on the fundamental studies, acoustically-modulated emulsion systems are designed and developed to manufacture a set of rationally designed metal oxide hierarchical nanostructures with structural, topological and compositional anisotropy in both nano- and micro- scales. Using titanium dioxide-based dye sensitized solar cell as a model device, the correlation of nano- and micro- scale structural and compositional anisotropy with the macroscale material properties and device performances are established.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One strategy to help wound healing is to implant a hydrogel containing isolated hMSCs directly into the wound site.  The hydrogel provides structural integrity to the surrounding tissue.  However, during wound healing, hMSCs remodel and degrade the hydrogel over time.  These processes must be better understood to design hydrogels with the optimal properties for wound healing. This CAREER project will apply a combination of new and existing methods to characterize the region around cells during cell remodeling and degradation of the synthetic hydrogel material. The goal of the combined research and education effort is to: (1) use a novel interdisciplinary approach to provide new techniques to answer a critical problem in biomaterials and cell biology, (2) recruit and train a diverse work force and (3) educate a broad audience in biomaterials, materials characterization, and wound healing. The research will have a major impact on biomaterials design. These new materials have the potential to increase the rate of wound healing and prevent development of chronic wounds. In addition, the principle investigator will recruit, train and educate a broad audience. This will be done by: (i) outreach to the public at the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown, PA, (ii) mentoring of middle and high school students and (iii) mentoring and training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this work is to characterize the spatial and temporal rheological evolution of a synthetic hydrogel during cell-mediated degradation to determine viability as an implantable wound healing scaffold. The physical microenvironment is hypothesized to control hMSC degradation strategies during cell migration to efficiently deliver hMSCs to the wound and control material degradation. To test this, the research includes a) characterizing hMSC degradation strategies in homogenous hydrogels that mimic the stiffness of native tissues, b) determining the change in response to an interface in stiffness, and c) determining how gradients in scaffold stiffness change hMSC-mediated degradation and direct motility to increase cell delivery and material integrity. hMSCs will be encapsulated in 3D in a well-established photopolymerizable poly(ethylene glycol)-peptide hydrogel. The peptide cross-linker in this material is degraded by cell-secreted enzymes. Dynamic scaffold properties will be measured with bulk rheology and microrheology. Multiple particle tracking microrheology (MPT) will measure the spatio-temporal degradation profile created in the scaffold by encapsulated hMSCs. These measurements will determine the unique degradation strategies hMSCs use in response to changes in their microenvironment. Bulk rheology will quantify the change in material integrity as hMSCs permanently degrade the synthetic scaffold. Using this knowledge, the viability of these materials as implantable wound healing scaffolds and the microenvironments that most efficiently deliver hMSCs to an injury while providing structure to the surrounding tissue will be determined. The research outcomes will be: i) identification of the microenvironment cells engineer during motility in response to homogeneous and heterogeneous environments in the scaffold and ii) determination of microenvironments that increase cell delivery and material integrity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the scene in an animal's eyes only makes sense if it knows its own body position and movements. While they are moving, animals can also predict how their senses will be affected by their own movements. For example, as a human walks, his eyes bounce up and down with his steps, but he does not see this motion because his brain predicts and ignores this self-generated visual information. Though much is known about how this process works in a single sense organ, less is known about how multiple senses work together to do this. In many animals, the inner ear monitors the position and movement of the body. However, the inner ear is inside the head and difficult to study and manipulate. This project will take advantage of animals with rotation sensors on the outside of their bodies to observe how these organs influence behavior.  In flies, specialized organs called halteres detect body movements and these structures are located outside the body near the wings.  This research will measure changes in fly behavior that occur when the sensory information coming from the haltere is changed and when it does not match information gathered through vision. This work will show how multiple senses are integrated with the animal's own behavior to guide movement. By examining how the brain combines multiple sensory inputs and anticipates the consequences of its own behaviors, this work will uncover mechanisms of the brain's function that can be applied to other species and that can be used to understand biological brains and engineer algorithms for moving machines. The project will also be incorporated into a series of workshops at an all-girls high school with the goal of improving quantitative and computer coding skills in female students. <br/><br/>Distinguishing between self-generated and externally generated body movements is a central challenge for the nervous system. Efference copy, a neural signal of opposite sign to expected sensory input, is a possible mechanism for this distinction. Efference copies have been observed in single sensory systems, but how might they function in a multi-sensory context? Using an animal with a well-understood visual system and an easily-accessible mechanosensory organ, these experiments will investigate how these two sensory modalities combine during voluntary and involuntary movements.  In flies, body rotations are detected by specialized mechanosensors called halteres. These are modified hindwings that perform a function similar to the mammalian vestibular system. This project will investigate the integration of haltere information, visual information, and motor commands through quantitative behavioral analysis of flying flies. Flies will fly under different conditions: flight with imposed body rotations (tethered to a motor), flight with free, self-generated rotations (tethered to pins suspended between magnets), and rigidly tethered flight (no body rotations) with imposed movements of the haltere. The fly's head movement behavior will be observed under these conditions, and the behavior of intact flies will be compared to flies with their mechanosensory halteres removed or manipulated. Finally, information theoretic analysis will be used to quantify the flow of information in the visual and mechanosensory systems and construct a theoretical framework that can be used to understand how information about body rotations is integrated with visual information to control posture and gaze. Taken together, these experiments and model will demonstrate how two sensory modalities are combined and integrated with motor feedback during flight.  Broader impacts include workshops to broaden experience for young women in quantitative and computer coding skills and presentation of the work to various non-scientific audiences. Work completed here has application to the field of robotics and the development of higher quality autonomous aerial robotics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collaboration with South American colleagues is planned as is extensive student involvement.<br/><br/>This project aims to employ classical dendrochronological techniques to generate new tropical tree-ring chronologies that are annually resolved and absolutely dated. Radiocarbon measurements (14-Carbon) will ensure accurate dating assessments. Thus, successful tree species will be selected to improve the 14-Carbon curve for the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting tree-ring series will be used to reconstruct past climate variability and regional to large--scale atmospheric dynamics for the last several centuries. The specific aims of the project are to improve understanding of: (1) the spatiotemporal variability of the South American summer monsoon (SASM); (2) long-term interactions between El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the SASM; and (3) the impact of volcanic forcing on past hydroclimate of the tropical Andes.<br/><br/>The research aims to provide significant advances in the science of tropical dendrochronology by<br/>developing a tree-ring network for the tropical Andes in Peru and Bolivia, a region with exceedingly scarce coverage of high-resolution terrestrial paleo-records. While tree rings have been extensively used in temperate climates, the tropics remain relatively unexplored due to the difficulty, in particular, of identifying consistent wood layers (tree rings) corresponding to seasonal or annual growing periods. The Central Andes are an ideal region for overcoming these difficulties, due to the pronounced precipitation seasonality and diverse forests.<br/><br/>The tropical Andes are a hotspot for biodiversity and its geographic position makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change. It also contains nearly all the tropical glaciers on the globe, and recent, widespread glacial retreat is causing a rapid decline in hydrological reserves.  This decline, in combination with increasing water demand due to population growth and economic expansion poses an enormous challenge for water availability, biodiversity and food security. The complex topography of the Andean Cordillera leads to a climate that is characterized by strong zonal and vertical precipitation gradients. Moisture influx from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon basin is modulated by the SASM and ENSO. The scientific understanding of this variability is challenged by the scarcity of long instrumental observations, which also limits the ability to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections over this region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particular area of interest is the rate of exchange of gases such as carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide, which play important roles in Earth's climate. Understanding and modeling air-sea exchange on a global scale requires understanding of how gas exchange rates vary in response to a number of factors such as temperature, wind speed, and the presence of surface chemical films (known as surfactants) in the ocean. Over the past 25 years, major advances have been made in understanding air-sea gas exchange in the open ocean, mainly due to improvements in methodologyand a number of successful process studies. However, some important questions remain, such as what happens near coastal areas (including inland seas), and how surfactants affect gas exchange. The Baltic Sea Gas Exchange Experiment (Baltic GasEx) is a collaboration between scientists from the US and Germany designed to address these questions. Participants in Baltic GasEx will measure the air-sea gas exchange rates with different techniques in the Baltic Sea before and after the spring bloom, when concentrations and compositions of surfactants will be different. The expeditions will be conducted on a German ship (Alkor), with the ultimate goal of quantifying the relationship between wind speed and gas exchange in an inland sea, and understanding the impact of surfactants on air-sea gas exchange. The project will involve significant international collaboration, public education and outreach through both participating U.S. institutions, and substantial student training in partnership with the international collaborators.<br/><br/>NSF funding will support helium-3 and sulfur hexafluoride measurements during Baltic GasEx to determine the gas exchange rate. German colleagues are independently funded to quantify surfactants with AC voltammetry, surface tension, and sum frequency generation; to determine chemical characteristics of the micro layer; and to estimate the gas exchange rate using eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2 and DMS. The proposed experiment is designed to address the question of whether open ocean wind speed/gas exchange parameterizations can be applied to inland seas like the Baltic. Also, the effect of surfactants on gas exchange has been studied extensively in the laboratory, but there is little direct field evidence for the effect of surfactants on gas exchange. The proposed experiment, with expeditions at times with both high and low surfactant concentrations, should shed new light on the effect of natural surfactants on gas exchange. Finally, some wind speed/gas exchange parameterizations proposed for the Baltic Sea appear to be higher than typical open ocean parameterizations. These are typically based on eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2. However, in open ocean experiments where both the helium-3/sulfur hexafluoride approach and eddy covariance of CO2 have been deployed, there seems to be a discrepancy between gas transfer velocities measured with the two techniques. This experiment should show whether a similar difference in gas transfer velocities measured via these two techniques also exists in the Baltic Sea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most of the organic material produced by phytoplankton in the sunlit surface waters of the oceans is eaten and recycled in the surface waters, a small amount sinks to the deep ocean in what is called the ""biological carbon pump."" The biological pump is particularly hard to study in high latitude regions, which can be difficult to get to and challenging to work in. It is also particularly important to understand the biological pump in these parts of the ocean, where much of the world's deep ocean waters are formed. The export of carbon to deep waters can be estimated by carefully measuring the amount of excess oxygen left behind in surface waters. Oxygen in seawater can be measured very precisely using sensors deployed on moorings, floats, and gliders. These sensors can be deployed for years at a time, but their measurements must be carefully calibrated. In this project, investigators would use carefully calibrated oxygen sensors on gliders to, in turn, calibrate the oxygen sensors on a set of moorings in the high latitude North Atlantic Ocean, to study the biological carbon pump over a period of two years. The project would train several undergraduate students and a graduate student, and result in the development of educational laboratory materials that incorporate glider and mooring data from the project.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to observationally constrain the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of the biological carbon pump (determined as annual net community production; ANCP) and its influence on air-sea carbon dioxide flux by using biogeochemical sensor measurements from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Irminger Sea Array. However, existing OOI oxygen sensor calibration suffers from both pre- and post-deployment drift, currently precluding the ability to calculate ANCP by oxygen mass balance. The investigators therefore propose to improve the accuracy and utility of OOI Irminger Sea oxygen measurements by deploying two gliders configured for air calibration of their oxygen sensors when surfacing between profiles. These air-calibrated gliders will be used to intercalibrate all 12 existing oxygen sensors on the Irminger Sea Array and produce a calibrated oxygen product incorporating data from all sensors, which will ensure sufficient accuracy to calculate ANCP. Both the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of ANCP, including upper ocean biological productivity and thermocline respiration, will be determined using an oxygen mass balance approach within a data- constrained 1D physical model. A suite of 1D model simulations including the inorganic carbon system, gas exchange, and ANCP determined from oxygen mass balance will be used, together with OOI carbon dioxide measurements, to diagnose influences of physical and biological drivers of air-sea carbon dioxide flux, improving both quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how the biological pump influences the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using both maternal (mitochondrial) and paternal (Y-chromosome) DNA for modern and ancient samples will provide information on the genetic diversity and structure before and after European colonization and identify effects that differed for males and females. This project will support graduate student training and mentoring, including experience as teaching assistants for the genomic lab portion of the SING (Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics) workshop where indigenous peoples learn how to use genomics as a tool and form a network of indigenous scientists. Using a community based approach, this project completes research in a collaborative way with indigenous communities, resulting in more accurate information and enhanced scholarship. <br/><br/>Researchers have speculated about the demographic effects of European colonization, the population genetic structure of Native Americans pre-contact, the amount of European admixture and the estimates of the number of indigenous Americans present pre-contact. It has been difficult to quantify these demographic changes because there are no published datasets with large numbers of ancient individuals and their descendants. In this project, mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA data will be combined with existing archaeological information and documented oral histories to infer the effects of European Colonization on males and females in the ancient Prince Rupert Harbour (PRH) population and modern descendants. The researchers hypothesize that the effects of European colonization will be greater for men than women because of differences in activity patterns and admixture.  The large sample size present in the PRH population, in addition to the long-term continual habitation in the coastal area, provides a unique dataset to use as comparative data for other researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With thehelpof high-performance computing (HPC),predictiveand accuratecombustion simulations have a tremendous potential to emerge asacost-effective andreliable design, assessment, and decision-making tool for practicalsystems (e.g., gas turbines, internal combustion engines, furnaces, etc.). Detailed predictive modeling of combustion system requires, among other things, detailed and accurate modeling of thermal radiation.  However, models for thermalradiationused in combustion simulations are usually over-simplified.  The main bottlenecks in usingdetailedradiation modelare itshighcomputational cost and poorparallel efficiencyinHPC. This project explores several novel ideas to increase efficiency and robustness of a high-fidelityradiation solverinHPCcombustionsimulations, leading to the possibility of performingpredictiveand accurate simulations ofpracticalcombustion systems in a realistic time-frame. Theability to performsuchlarge-scalereliablepredictive simulationisnot onlyimportantin the design process ofrealcombustion devicesbutalsoessential tofurther our understanding of fundamentals of combustion processes. Considering the ever-increasing need for cleaner combustion devices, this predictive capability can potentially have a significanteffectin academic research,as well asin energyandtransportation industry.  Theproject will also have an impact in popularizing computer programming in undergraduate students.  Therefore, this research aligns with the NSF'smission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare.<br/><br/>The radiation solver of choice in this project is a Monte-Carlo ray tracing-based (MCRT) solver.  It is one of the most accurate radiation solver available, and typically outshines all other radiation solvers as the complexity of the problem increases. To achieve improvements inefficiency and scalabilityoftheMCRTsolverin HPCsimulationsof large-scale combustionsystems,thisresearchbrings together ideas from different disciplines of mathematics, statistical theory, and computer science and applies them to solve an engineering problem.

First, the projectisdeveloping new algorithms for improved convergence using special statistical distributions with low discrepancy.  Second, novel strategies for MCRT load management, both in terms of computational time and memory utilization, are beingexplored toimprove scalability of the solverin HPCsimulations. Third, the improved MCRT solver are planned to be created as a modular, platform-independentsolvermodulewithstandardized interfaces so that it can be used with any combustion and/or CFD solver withoutsignificant sacrifice of its performance.

This doctoral dissertation project will study changes in DNA methylation (a chemical mark on DNA that influences gene expression levels) in different baboon species, to better understand how changes in DNA methylation affect gene expression, how DNA methylation has diverged between species, and the role of natural selection in this process. Differences in how particular genes are expressed are thought to be important in explaining many differences among primate species, including some traits that are unique to the human lineage. Novel data on gene regulation and expression can therefore help to advance knowledge about the development of our own species. The project will support student training and mentoring at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels, and the development and dissemination of interdisciplinary approaches using genomic methods that can be applied to a number of other fields of study.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of genetic ancestry on DNA methylation by leveraging genetic admixture in 150 adult baboons from a wild baboon population in Kenya. Admixed individuals (baboons with ancestry from two distinct but closely related taxa) provide the opportunity to test how genetic variation from different ancestries influences DNA methylation when placed in a common environment. Furthermore, because the study population has been affected by both recent and historical admixture events, it can be used to test hypotheses about the legacy of archaic hominin admixture with modern humans. Finally, this project will ask whether between-species differences in DNA methylation translate to changes in gene expression, testing an important assumption of models that link DNA methylation to trait variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the other hand, modern data analysis is highly adaptive. Large parts of modern machine learning perform model selection as a function of the data by iteratively tuning hyper-parameters, and exploratory data analysis is conducted to suggest hypotheses, which are then validated on the same data sets used to discover them. This kind of adaptivity is often referred to as p-hacking, and blamed in part for the surprising prevalence of non-reproducible science in some empirical fields. This project aims to develop rigorous tools and methodologies to perform statistically valid data analysis in the adaptive setting, drawing on techniques from statistics, information theory, differential privacy, and stable algorithm design. <br/><br/>The technical goals of this project include coming up with: 1) information-theoretic measures that characterize the degree to which a worst-case data analysis can over-fit, given an interaction with a dataset; 2) models for data analysts that move beyond the worst-case setting, and; 3) empirical investigations that bridge the gap between theory and practice. The problem of adaptive data analysis (also called post-selection inference, or selective inference) has attracted attention in both computer science and statistics over the past several years, but from relatively disjoint communities. Part of the aim of this project is to integrate these two lines of work. The team of researchers on this project span departments of computer science, statistics, and biomedical data science. In addition to attempting to unify these two areas, the broader impacts of this research will be to make science more reliable, and reduce the prevalence of ""over-fitting"" and ""false discovery.""

Recent research indicates that these large-scale events have altered the hydrological and ecosystem balances over historical and geological timescales (decades to thousands of years). This project will assess how far north along the coast of southwestern North America these storms have occurred in the geologic past, and how far inland they controlled geomorphic change events through rain and erosion. The specific goal is to determine if previously documented periods when tropical cyclones dominated runoff and sediment deposition across large alluvial fan systems of the southern Baja California peninsula can be detected in central Baja California, the southern California deserts, and even as far north as the southern Arizona Sonoran Desert. Data will test whether dissipating cyclones were drivers of alluvial fan sedimentation over thousands of years, and if a temporal correlation can be established to a period of transition between a milder, humid paleoclimate to the current arid climate. For the first time, a tropical cyclone landfall chronology covering the last few millennia will be developed for the Pacific coast of southwestern North America. This research has the potential to inform large-storm prediction scenarios for southern California and northwestern Mexico, which is relevant to hazards management for communities in need of risk assessment of rare and extreme events. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of earth scientists using a tiered approach, with field-based collaboration of postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. This approach has been proven successful for inclusion of underrepresented minorities, enhanced also with planned research alongside Mexican collaborators and students. The project will provide unique broader educational experiences for grade-school students in Indiana and Arizona, through the use of technology to connect fieldwork and classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will compare a recently established alluvial fan chronology in southern Baja California, with newly-obtained alluvial fan and paleotempestological records. A Holocene paleotempestological record of overwash deposits in the Pacific coastal Vizcaino Desert will be developed for the first time. The inferred tropical storm activity will be compared with inland alluvial fan deposition in this area and in the northern Sonoran Desert, enabling discrimination of signals from different moisture sources, based on observed coastal and alluvial sedimentology, stratigraphy, and specific proxy records. Effects of different sources of moisture that drive sedimentation will be assessed by probing different time periods, and compared to independent paleoclimatic proxies. Bayesian analysis of luminescence, cosmogenic, and radiocarbon geochronology will improve age control precision. The coupled alluvial and coastal record at orbital timescales will help to understand linkages between Quaternary alluvial sedimentation and hydroclimatic variability in the region, and will increase our understanding of basic principles of alluvial fan aggradation in response to change in arid hydroclimates. The project will test effects of millennial- and orbital-scale shifts in tropical circulation on landscape evolution of the region, which are, in turn, critical to test models of occurrence and effects of hydrological extremes and associated landscape changing events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For artworks on paper, watermarks are a key element in dating and authentication. Classifying and distinguishing watermarks is a difficult, time-consuming task even for paper analysis experts. Recent research has shown that a computer-based decision tree can reduce dramatically the time expended in the task of watermark identification and the concomitant identification of sheets of paper made on the same mold, while at the same time increasing the confidence in the result. The application of digital image processing to this task is one example of the new field of computational art history, which has exploded over the past decade. Through this project, automation using digital image processing can scale up the task of watermark and moldmate identification to handle the universe of the hundreds of individual watermarks in the papers of prints and drawings of Rembrandt and his pupils and allow expansion of this identification beyond these artworks in major museums to the thousands in smaller museums and private collections. This is expected to energize the expansion of this valuable forensic to the thousands of watermarks in laid paper used in artworks on paper by other pre-1750 artists. Advances in computational art history stemming from this project will offer a path for the general population, which is growing quite comfortable with the expansion of computer usage in everyday life, to engage with art in a new and appealing way. Art history is one subfield within cultural heritage that has delayed the longest in joining the emergence of the digital science and humanities. The success of this project will be a major enabler for further trans-disciplinary activities between the humanities and the sciences, thereby decreasing the separation of their two cultures, which is vital as the digitization of all aspects of daily life gains dominance at a scorching pace.<br/><br/>This project continues the pioneering efforts in the new field of computational art history that is broadening acceptance of digital image processing as a vital tool in art history research as it tremendously expands the intellectual reach of art historians. As the first tools are developed in this nascent field and more scientists and engineers are drawn to the challenges of these problems, the specific needs of art historians will undoubtedly reveal new tasks requiring advances in the underlying science of digital image processing. This connection between computation and the visual humanities also offers a powerful link to combat the widening gulf in education at all levels between engineering science and the humanities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising approach to this challenge is the use renewable electricity to produce energy-rich chemical fuels that can be stored, transported, and used whenever necessary. This approach requires catalysts that are capable of efficiently converting inert molecules such as water and carbon dioxide into chemical fuels like hydrogen and methanol. Currently, such catalysts are typically derived from expensive, rare metals such as platinum. To make the electrochemical production of fuels more economically feasible new catalysts that are based on inexpensive and abundant elements are needed. In this project supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. William Harman, Chemistry Department, University of California - Riverside, is exploring platforms based on carbon and boron that mimic many of the important features of commonly used metals catalysts. Their ability to reduce carbon dioxide to fuels and fuel precursors is being developed and inexpensive catalysts are being designed. In addition to providing a vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students at UCR, this research program incorporates outreach to community colleges in the inland southern California area with a focus on promoting opportunities for study in STEM fields among underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>	Due to their intrinsic redox activity and unique modes of reactivity, transition metals have dominated the field of electrochemical small molecule activation.  Recently, materials based on graphitic carbon, often doped with heteroatoms, have emerged for applications in electrocatalysis. This project is preparing carbene-supported and zwitterionic diboraanthrancenes and diboraanthracenes with tethered metal ions. These species are redox active and are capable of coupling electron transfer and small molecule activation. Based on this behavior, catalysts are designed for the electrochemical synthesis of energy rich species, such as methanol, from small molecules, such as carbon dioxide. This research program incorporates a summer research experience for undergraduates at local community colleges as well as outreach to this community regarding opportunities for advanced study in chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CO2 is an undervalued and underutilized chemical raw material. This project is focusing on reactions of CO2 to prepare important chemicals useful for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. Professor Popp's research is using both experimental and computational methods to better understand how these reactions work and how to improve them. Professor Popp is pursuing educational activities aimed at increasing the quality and quantity of U.S. scientists, especially from underrepresented groups served by WVU. This is being accomplished by enhancing the academic experience both in the classroom and the laboratory. Specific activities are aimed at enhancing the university experience for student Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces at WVU interested in pursuing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) careers.<br/><br/>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an attractive renewable resource for the production of chemicals; however, it is traditionally undervalued by the chemical industry because of its stability. Nevertheless, its broader utilization as a C1 feedstock could help shepherd a more sustainable carbon economy in the future. Catalytic olefin reductive carboxylation with CO2 is a potentially powerful way to create new carbon-carbon bonds while generating minimal waste. Professor Popp is focusing on two underdeveloped olefin reductive functionalization strategies: hetero(element)carboxylation and transfer hydrometallation/carboxylation. The former strategy employs element-boron reagents (where ""element"" includes boron, silicon, and tin) and copper catalysts to enable olefin difunctionalization using CO2 under mild conditions. Building upon insights gained from extensive kinetic study of iron-catalyzed hydromagnesiation, the latter strategy investigates new systems that achieve hydrozincation/carboxylation in a single catalytic reaction. Rational method optimization is accomplished in parallel with studies of catalytic reaction mechanisms using a combination of operando spectroscopic techniques, studies of stoichiometric reactions and preparation of plausible intermediates, as well as computational methods. In support of the broader impacts of the project, Professor Popp is organizing new training and career mentorship opportunities for STEM-interested student Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces at WVU, collaborating with a primarily undergraduate institution in the Appalachian region on catalysis research relevant to this project, and developing a new multimedia tool for organic chemistry education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Speaking one's native language does not usually feel like a particularly difficult or demanding task: in most situations adults do this without experiencing any noticeable difficulty. Despite this, much research into language production has shown that it is a highly complex cognitive task, and that there are many mental processes involved in translating an abstract idea to a linguistic message that we can communicate with our mouths or hands. Understanding the nature of these mental processes is important both for understanding how to develop better treatments for language disorders, as well as for developing more sophisticated natural language technology. The present project contributes to a better understanding of how language production proceeds by investigating speech errors in Hindi. Speech errors provide one of the most important sources of insight into natural language production. However, the majority of research into speech errors during language production is focused on English, potentially limiting the scope of this research. The present project fills a gap in our knowledge by investigating speech errors in Hindi, a language that has very different grammatical properties than English. In addition, the present project increases the visibility of Hindi for psycholinguistic research. Hindi remains highly understudied in psycholinguistic research on language production and comprehension, despite its many unique grammatical properties and the fact that it is the third most spoken language in the world, with over half a billion speakers worldwide and over half a million in the United States alone.<br/><br/>Previous research on European languages has shown that speakers will sometimes produce verb agreement errors in certain grammatical contexts. For example, in the sentence 'the key to the cabinets is rusty', English speakers will sometimes produce the incorrect plural form 'are' instead of the correct is due to interference from the plural noun 'cabinets'. Research has shown that this interference is highly sensitive to the structural properties of the 'distractor' noun--'cabinets'. However, the precise structural properties that make a linguistic expression prominent and likely to create interference during language production are not well understood. Hindi can help shed light on this. Unlike other studied languages, Hindi has a 'mixed' agreement system: in some contexts, the verb agrees with the subject (as in English), and in others it agrees with the object. Here, the researchers will use structured experiments utilizing two methodologies--the spoken production paradigm and the binary choice agreement paradigm--to identify the circumstances under which Hindi speakers produce errors in verb agreement in both subject agreement configurations and object agreement configurations. In comparing error patterns for subject agreement and object agreement, this research will shed light on what factors make linguistic expressions cognitively prominent during language production. The results will be of interest to psycholinguists developing models of agreement production and to linguists interested in the grammatical generalizations that speakers acquire about their native language.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most current treatments for cardiovascular diseases are based on rough estimates of outcomes from the results of clinical trials, which might not apply to individual patients due to patient-specific variations. Computational models of the cardiovascular system, developed from patient-specific clinical data, can help refine the diagnosis and personalize the treatment, significantly improving patient care and reducing mortality. The current patient-specific methods for cardiovascular diseases have been demonstrated mainly in simple, isolated examples. For widespread adoption of personalized medicine, a flexible and easy-to-use framework for integrating patient data and simulating cardiac biomechanics needs to be developed. This project focuses on creating an integrative framework with simulation, analysis, and visualization tools that will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in personalized medicine, ultimately improving patient care and treatment outcomes. Results from this research will benefit the U.S. healthcare system, society, and economy, while supporting the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and advance the national health. The tools developed as a part of this research involves several disciplines including computer science, bioengineering, and mechanical engineering. The multidisciplinary components of the project is being integrated into a larger educational effort that offers the students a solid foundation in developing computational tools and algorithms, while also broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in research.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this research is the advancement of the state-of-the-art in translational medicine with the help of computational modeling and interactive analysis tools to improve the basic understanding of the cardiac muscle and personalize treatment of cardiovascular diseases in patients. The research focuses on creating a novel computational framework to automate biomechanics finite-element simulation and analysis of patient-specific cardiac systems. Further, it aims to advance the knowledge of disease and therapeutic mechanisms by developing advanced multiscale methods to model muscle contraction and growth. Some of the key computational tools and methods proposed as part of this framework include: (1) a geometric mesh generation tool for systematic generation of patient-specific finite element meshes from clinical data; (2) an algorithm for accelerating high-order finite-element simulations using the graphics processing unit (GPU) for fast tuning of model parameters to match the patients' baseline cardiac function; (3) new methods for multiphysics simulations of cardiac systems to model multi-scale muscle mechanics and tissue growth; and (4) new visualization and virtual reality tools to enable animated volume rendering and visual analytics of the results of the cardiac simulations. Successful development of these open-source tools will enable faster adoption of patient-specific computational models by the research community to understand therapeutic mechanisms. This framework can significantly advance the state-of-the-art in personalized medicine, ultimately improving patient care and treatment outcomes. The multidisciplinary components of the project is being integrated into a larger educational effort to offer students a solid foundation in combining biomedical engineering with scientific computing. The education and outreach plans of this research can inform the community about the crucial role of computational models in improving patient-care.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the project seeks to understand and emulate the way in which swarms of bats use echolocation, which is a type of active sensing. In active sensing, for example sonar or lidar, an agent uses the reflection of an emitted signal to learn about its surroundings. Passive sensing, in contrast, relies on the reflection or emission of signals originating elsewhere, such as vision systems that rely on ambient light, or thermal imaging systems that detect heat. In large bat swarms it has been observed that some members seem to navigate by ""eavesdropping"" on signals emitted by other bats, instead of generating their own. This observation raises many possibilities, including questions of whether eavesdropping changes the behaviors that the swarm can achieve. This project will address these questions through studies on wild bat swarms, then will employ the results in experiments on multiple mobile robots. Of interest will be the ways that simple rules for active sensing by the collective may give rise to complex emergent behavior. The results of this project will benefit national prosperity and welfare by enabling new capabilities in multi-agent networks of mobile robots, for applications such as search and rescue, surveillance and environmental monitoring, package delivery, and construction. This work will also provide insight into the native behavior of bats, many species of which are critically imperiled due to disease and habitat loss. The project includes engagement with K-12 students across Virginia, and supports the development of educational modules that will be disseminated to classrooms throughout the state. <br/><br/>The role of sensing in the collective behavior of multi-agent systems -- and particularly the impact that active and passive sensing may have on emergent phenomena -- is currently unexplored. Robotic systems are increasingly turning to distributed approaches, therefore understanding how to leverage their interaction over sensing channels could represent a paradigm shift in the control of such systems. This project seeks to provide a new vision for the dynamics and control of multi-agent systems by coupling sensing and communication. This project is motivated by the intercepted sensing observed in bat swarms. The research team will collect quantitative data from field experiments with wild gray bats, perform model-free analyses to determine how collective sensing and behavior manifests in bats, use this insight to inform and validate a model of group behavior with active sensing, and create numerical and robotic testbeds for hypothesis-based exploration of these novel collective dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

River input is the primary source of land-derived sediment to the marine environment. These particles have significant impacts on the health of coastal ecosystems and the geology and bathymetry of coastal oceans and shipping channels. They directly and indirectly affect fisheries and navigation. This research focuses on the movement of sediments carried into the Gulf of Mexico, via the Brazos River, during the unprecedented rainfall and flooding event that occurred during Hurricane Harvey. The Brazos River ranks as the second largest contributor of nutrients and organic matter to the Gulf of Mexico, after the Mississippi River.  Unlike the Mississippi, however, most sediment delivered to the Gulf of Mexico from the Brazos is carried during flooding events like that which accompanied Hurricane Harvey.  Little is known about the fate of this sediment.  It is not clear if it is retained in the coastal zone, where the nutrients and chemicals it carries affect the coastal environment, or is carried offshore and deposited in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Through intensive sampling of sediments just offshore the mouth of the Brazos River and further offshore in the Gulf of Mexico in what is known as the Texas Mud Blanket, this project will determine the principal repository of sediments delivered to the western Gulf of Mexico by a major Texas river.   <br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to investigate the hypothesis that flood-borne sediment from the Brazos River is initially deposited in the coastal zone and subsequently mobilized and carried offshore with a large fraction of it being deposited in the Texas Mud Blanket.  The work builds on the analysis of sea-bottom sediment samples collected in 2017 during flooding associated with Hurricane Harvey.  This new program will include two sampling cruises to augment already collected data. The first cruise will entail acquisition of ~25 cores that will indicate sediment deposition and transport in the near-shore region near the Brazos River mouth.  Preliminary work indicates that much of the initial deposition of Brazos River sediment occurred east of the original sampling region.   The second cruise in will collect additional Brazos region cores and expand sampling into the Texas Mud Blanket, with the goal of documenting changes in Brazos sediment deposition from the Hurricane Harvey flooding.  During both cruises, complementary hydrography data will be collected. This includes water column velocities and suspended sediment loads. Provenance of individual layers, within the sediment samples and box cores, will be determined by digital photos and x-radiographs of intact core slabs that show sediment fabric and structures.  To differentiate Gulf of Mexico from Brazos River sediments, sub-samples of collected cores will be geochemically analyzed and profiled for short-lived-radioisotope geochronology, water content, grainsize distribution, and mercury and carbonate content.  These indicators will help identify the origin of the sediments deposited in the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is focused on understanding processes that control where microbes live and how they respond to changes in local conditions. A tree exists in a given location if it can survive both the environmental conditions and interactions with its neighbors at that location, and its seedlings may disperse to new locations with new environmental conditions. Unlike trees, microbes frequently migrate as whole communities and in tandem with their environment, often merging with other microbial communities along with their respective environments. For instance, wind movement of soil particles across the landscape or human handshakes result in novel contact of previously separated microbial communities. This process is termed community coalescence. The confluence of two water bodies is a clear example of community coalescence, resulting in a new, united environment with novel interactions among the previously separate microbial communities. This research will experimentally identify how aquatic microbial communities interact and respond to the merger under different environmental conditions. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand how microbial communities from distinct habitats interact under community coalescence, with the following specific objectives: (1) Characterize the membership of microbial communities in the field and their activity at three distinct aquatic environments where coalescence occurs. (2) In the laboratory, track microbial community membership and activity in response to experimentally-imposed coalescence. (3) Analyze experimental data in the context of the patterns observed in the field. Unraveling mechanisms that determine community membership following a coalescence event is difficult, since the abiotic and biotic factors are intertwined. In order to understand the true community ecology of microbes, it is necessary to separate the environmental and biological factors that ultimately determine which organisms persist and which do not. To address these fundamental ecological questions, the research team developed a new approach to directly measure the effects of environmental factors and biotic interactions, independently and in combination, on coalesced communities. This project addresses fundamental concepts in community ecology, dispersal of a massive number of microorganisms in the context of aquatic systems, and directly disentangles biotic and abiotic factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are bicycles with a small battery-powered electric motor to assist the rider. Over 150 million e-bikes have been sold in Europe and Asia in the past ten years--in China's case, resulting in truly transformative transportation. This is the world's largest adoption of an alternative fuel vehicle. E-bikes are becoming more important in North America. However, there is little empirical evidence on the behavior of e-bike users and environmental sustainability impacts. The investigator team will refine and deploy a research study, using a combination of emerging hardware and software capabilities, to collect behavioral data from e-bike riders. The collected data will then be used to evaluate how large shifts in e-bike use will affect sustainability. The research in this GOALI project is enabled by an industry partner (Bosch). <br/><br/>The first objective of this research is to refine an instrumentation system (physical hardware and a mobile device application) tailored for e-bike users. This system includes a mix of onboard hardware and smartphone software to collect a host of data on energy and other vehicle telematics. The data collected by the instrumentation and mobile application will be sent to a platform with little to no input required by the user. Using that data, the second objective is to assess the riding behavior of e-bike users and the performance of e-bikes in meeting travel needs. The research team will conduct an empirical study, starting with at least 150-200 participants for one year. This collaboration with industry partners will collect vehicle telematics and rider behavior metrics with an aim toward modeling net travel changes between modes (mode shift and vehicle kilometers traveled). This objective will identify how e-bike use behaviors differ from relatively well known incumbent modes. The third objective is to investigate the life-cycle environmental impacts of e-bike ownership and use, relying on the Department of Energy's GREET LCA model. Coupling the behavioral models with LCA models will provide a methodologically novel assessment of the impact of this new mode. This study will inform local and state policy and planning efforts related to the growth of e-bikes and their influence on environmental policy goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their obvious environmental advantages, large-scale integration of renewable energy faces a number of technical difficulties.  These challenges are linked to the fact that the availability of renewable energy, i.e., wind and sunlight, depends on nature rather than the controllable process of burning a fuel.  This project develops innovative software tools that enable the deployment of flexible transmission, which is a cost-effective solution to address these challenges.  As a result of these developments, system operators will be able to benefit from a new resource that was not available to them before.  Particularly, this project aims to employ flexible transmission in order to alleviate the uncertainty and intermittency of renewable energy resources, and facilitate higher levels of renewable energy production.  With the help of efficient mathematical modeling and high-performance computing, the models developed in this project are fast and appropriate for real-time operation.  As renewable energy is economical and emission-free, this project will have a significant positive impact on the national health, prosperity, and welfare.  Additionally, this project will integrate computational methods and algorithm development in power engineering education to fill a much-needed gap in power engineering curriculum.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to enable frequent utilization of flexible transmission for one of the largest and most complex cyber-physical system that exists today: the North American power grid.  Co-optimization of flexible transmission and generation dispatch is not possible yet due to the computational burden of the underlying mathematical problem.  Specifically, transmission flexibility, in the form of controllable impedance, introduces non-convexities to power system operation that are challenging to handle within the limited available computational time.  This project substantially reduces such computational burden through a novel and fast optimization technique, which exploits the mathematical structure of power flows.  Consequently, utilization of flexible transmission can become possible which can help reduce the operation cost and improve the system reliability.  This project also aims to mitigate the intermittencies and uncertainties associated with renewable generation by utilizing transmission flexibility. It employs stochastic optimization as the mathematical framework to model renewable energy uncertainties, and optimizes flexible transmission and controllable generation as the decision variables.  Algorithm decomposition and high-performance computing are employed to reduce the solution time required for stochastic optimization in order to ensure fast and efficient computation.  This is an essential component of the project as the computational time available for real-time operation is less than five minutes. The education component of this project enriches the power engineering curriculum, by developing educational modules, on computational methods, algorithm design, and high-performance computing for power engineering students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This vast ocean around Antarctica is the primary location where the waters that fill the deep ocean are brought to the surface where they interact with the atmosphere and with sea ice.  Because of this unique role in the global climate system, the physical and biological processes that occur in the Southern Ocean have a disproportionately large impact on the properties of the global ocean, including the amount of heat and carbon dioxide that is trapped in the deep ocean for hundreds to thousands of years.  Extremely sparse observations of both the Southern Ocean?s circulation structure and biological properties, such as nutrient and biomass concentrations, have presented a significant barrier to understanding the modification of near surface waters and their subsequent exchange with the deep ocean. In recent years, the SOCCOM (Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling) project has used innovative robotic technologies, namely autonomous profiling floats, to provide observations of biogeochemical properties in the Southern Ocean with unprecedented coverage in space and time.  This advance marks a step change in our ability to mechanistically understand the Southern Ocean?s role in the global carbon cycle but many of the physical and biological processes responsible for generating the observed biogeochemical distributions are not adequately captured by the floats because of their relatively coarse sampling interval (10 days).  In this project, two ocean gliders will be piloted to track individual floats in order to measure the oceanic circulation features that impact exchange between the surface and interior ocean.  Gliders sample the upper 1000 meters of the ocean once every 4 to 5 hours and are able to resolve variations in fluid motion on time scales of about a day. On these scales, the variability of vertical velocities are quite large and thus the circulation at these shorter temporal and smaller spatial scales significantly influences the vertical transport of ocean properties.  An improved characterization of motions at these scales, and their impact on heat and carbon transport, will lead to a better understanding of the role the Southern Ocean plays in the global carbon cycle.<br/><br/>Two autonomous ocean gliders will be deployed in the Indian sector of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, coincident with one or more semi-Lagrangian Argo floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors through the SOCCOM project. The gliders will be piloted to track the Argo float for a period of at least four months, resolving the mesoscale and submesoscale structure surrounding the float as well as variability occurring at periods shorter than the float?s 10-day sampling interval. Measurements of the upper ocean hydrographic and velocity fields will permit an analysis of hydrodynamical instabilities within the mixed layer and their impact on vertical transport and exchange across the base of the mixed layer.  The glider data will also be combined with the float observations and remote sensing products to derive vertical tracer fluxes, with the goal of quantifying the partitioning of export between sinking and advective pathways.  Ultimately, this project will provide observations of the physical processes that contribute to high-frequency spatial and temporal variability in Southern Ocean tracer distributions and will provide a significant step towards describing the mechanisms that influence physical and biogeochemical distributions and transport pathways in the Southern Ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wave breaking is an important source of turbulence and mixing at the ocean surface, including the turbulent exchange of gasses and heat between the ocean and the atmosphere.  Wave breaking is also a hazard to navigation and safe passage for vessels at sea.  The key question is ""how much energy is lost when waves break?"".  This lost energy is both an important parameter for accurate wave forecasts and for prescribing ocean-atmosphere exchange.  Recent work has suggested that the quantity and size of bubbles generated during wave breaking are the key controls on the energy dissipation and thus the strength of breaking.  This project will use field observations and computer models to verify this dependence, with application to improve wave forecasting and ocean-atmosphere coupling. The proposed work will support a postdoctoral researcher and contribute to public outreach with specific contributions to the annual Discovery Days event at the University of Washington, that reaches 10,000 students from regional K-12 schools.<br/><br/>The technical approach of the project is to measure wave breaking in the open ocean with freely drifting buoys that are equipped with motion sensors, turbulence profilers, and cameras for bubble recording. The proposed work builds on recent results using the Surface Wave Instrument Float with Tracking (SWIFT) drifters to measure the turbulent dissipation rate beneath breaking waves and a VOF-based (volume of fluid) Eulerian-Eulerian polydisperse two-fluid model to simulate the two-phase bubbly flow. Previous results suggest that dissipation by bubbles may be an increasingly large fraction of the total wave breaking dissipation during high sea states. The measurements to be carried in this project will be analyzed to determine the time evolution of the bubbles, as well as the turbulence and motion associated with individual breaking waves. The data will be used to test a recent formulation that scales the total dissipation with the time integral of the bubble plume volume. Further, a related formulation that scales bubble plume depth with the area of foam patches visible at the ocean surface will be evaluated. Improvement of the latter formulation will allow estimates of plume volume and infer dissipation remotely. The formulation derived will be compared with other estimates for dissipation, which include: the Phillips breaking crest distribution, equilibrium wind input, and in situ measurements of turbulent dissipation. The proposed work will also examine the effects of intermittence and the consequences of sparsely sampled field observations. These measurements will be compared with the high resolution, two-fluid model simulations of the breaking process. This approach will enable a more complete investigation of breaking wave conditions and an assessment of the inherent sparseness of the observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current methods to achieve cellular resolution are invasive (e.g., blood test or tissue biopsy), and non-invasive imaging modalities do not achieve cellular resolution. The principal goal of this Expeditions project is to develop computational imaging systems for non-invasive bio-imaging, deep beneath the skin, and at cellular-level resolutions. This project has the potential to fundamentally impact healthcare and medicine, by enabling live views of cross sections of human anatomy, simply by pointing a camera at any part of the body. This would put individual users at the center of their healthcare experience and make them true partners in their healthcare delivery. The health imaging devices that result from this project will act as an important pillar in the personalized medicine revolution. This research expedition also holds the potential to launch new healthcare paradigms for chronic disease management, pediatrics, low-resource healthcare, and disaster medical care. Beyond healthcare, making progress on the problem of cellular-scale deep-tissue imaging using light will push the frontiers of the fundamental problem of inverse scattering, which impacts numerous areas of science and engineering. The order of magnitude advances made in inverse scattering and imaging through scattering media will have significant cross-cutting applications in diverse areas such as basic science, consumer imaging, automotive navigation, robotics, surveillance, atmospheric science, and material science. Finally, projects with a single, easy-to-appreciate, and high-impact goal have the potential to inspire the next generation of scientists, attract diverse set of students driven by humanitarian and social causes, and become a platform for inclusion and innovation.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate new computational imaging systems, to non-invasively image below the skin at tunable depths, in highly portable form-factors such as wearables or point-of-care devices. The main challenge is that light scatters as it travels through the human body, and in this process, the spatial information from different points within the body gets mixed up. A new concept, Computational Photo-Scatterography (CPS), is being applied in this project in order to computationally unravel the scattered photons in an imaging system, and allow creation of sharp images and accurate inferences. Recognizing that the brute-force complexity of unraveling scattered photons is prohibitively high, the project uses a computational co-design framework that leverages advances by team members from multiple domains: programmable illumination and optics, image sensors, machine learning, inverse graphics, and hybrid analog-digital computing.  The project will use machine learning (ML) instead of physics-based de-scattering to speed up the solution of the underlying inverse problem. A combination of physics-based inverse graphics algorithms, and ML algorithms combining deep learning and generative modeling will be used to estimate tissue scattering parameters -  motion due to blood flow induces time-variation in tissue parameters, which makes solving the inverse scattering problem more difficult. The project will use ML to create fast but approximate estimators, which will serve as accelerators for inverse scattering. The development of new sensors, able to capture the data necessary to reconstruct the structure of the tissue deep below the skin, constitutes the most important contribution of the project. These systems and algorithms will have the potential to break the current resolution limits of noninvasive bio-imaging by nearly two orders of magnitude, enabling cellular-level imaging at depths far beyond currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on one kind of elided construction, called Noun Phrase Ellipsis, in which the noun phrase (like ""key to the boxes"") is elided. The crucial part in understanding how this kind of structure works is to discern what kind of information can be retrieved from memory at the stage when the readers notice that something is missing. The studies proposed here aim to test longstanding questions in psycholinguistics: (1) what is the nature of memory representation; and (2) what information is retrieved from memory during active sentence processing?<br/><br/>By employing eye-tracking experiments, this project investigates the retrieval process in Noun Phrase Ellipsis, which we find includes detailed structural and morphological information. Pairing ellipsis constructions with agreement attraction should illuminate the process, distinguishing the observed effect from other syntactic structures.

The computational theory of pseudo-randomness originated in the foundations of cryptography in the early 1980s and has since developed into a rich sub-field of theoretical computer science in its own right. The notions and constructs studied in the theory of pseudo-randomness have implications for many different areas of research in computer science, communications, and mathematics, including cryptography, computational complexity, coding theory, additive number theory, metric embeddings, streaming and sketching algorithms, and graph theory.  The project puts high value on education, service to the research community, and wide dissemination of knowledge.  The research activities will be accompanied by and integrated with curriculum development, research advising, service, and outreach.  In addition, the research also relates to national priorities of importance to society, such as security and privacy.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project seeks to exploit new opportunities for progress on several fundamental questions, including: 1) The RL vs. L problem: trying to prove, unconditionally, that every randomized algorithm can be made deterministic with only a constant-factor loss in space efficiency; 2) Explicit constructions: seeking explicit load-balancing hash functions, batch codes, and depth-robust graphs that achieve substantial parameter improvements and have qualitative significance for applications, and 3) Applications: improving and extending the applications of pseudo-randomness to cryptography and data structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research is needed that moves beyond the current focus on protected areas to other human-modified landscapes to determine how wildlife and humans can coexist. This doctoral dissertation project combines behavioral, ecological, demographic, and genetic data from an endangered lemur species that lives in a landscape shared with humans, to assess how this species is affected by human activities. In addition to furthering knowledge about human-lemur dynamics, the project will provide a model for wildlife biologists and managers of protected areas to investigate human-wildlife dynamics more generally. As part of this project, investigators will train students in field and laboratory techniques, including behavioral data collection, wildlife surveys, and DNA extraction and amplification. Further, the project will contribute to public science outreach, international research collaborations, and primate conservation. <br/><br/>The investigators will conduct a fine-scale analysis of the impacts of human activities on the ecology of the Verreaux's sifaka, including how this lemur species responds to disturbances and which types of human activities are most threatening. Behavioral, demographic, and geographic data will be collected for sifakas living in areas subject to differing degrees of human disturbance. These investigations will be focused at Bez Mahafaly Special Reserve, a recently expanded protected area in southwest Madagascar that includes core conservation areas as well as areas of regulated human use. At a larger landscape scale, investigators will survey unprotected forest fragments in the Bez region and conduct landscape genetic analyses, using fecal DNA. These analyses will determine how sifakas move across the human-dominated landscape and how the structure of the sifaka population is influenced by patterns of human land use. Finally, investigators will combine long-term demographic data from the core sifaka population at Bez with data on sifaka movement into and out of the reserve to predict the population's future growth and stability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fortunately, with minimal human intervention, good data cleaning heuristics produce mostly reliable, usually actionable information from big, messy data.  For instance, analysts might automate their curation workflows by using classifiers to predict missing attribute values, or by using an entity-resolver to find and merge duplicate records.  Unfortunately, heuristics are also dangerous, as the result of heuristic curation is often taken as fact.  Serious mistakes like people being denied a loan due to someone else's bad credit, 12-year olds being identified as terrorists, or billion dollar investment errors, often result when low-confidence, or uncertain heuristic inferences are treated as truth.  Many principled tools like probabilistic databases already exist for automatically tracking potential errors in unreliable data, but these tools are not easy to use.  As a result, analysts more often resort to simply documenting potential errors and hoping that anyone using the data will realize the implications.  This proposal will enable data management systems that can query and organize uncertain data, without being hard to use.<br/> <br/>The specific aim of this proposal is to decouple the process of asking questions about uncertain data from mechanical concerns like why the data is uncertain, how the user wants to view uncertainty in query results, or which algorithms should be used.  To enable this sort of ""declarative uncertainty management,"" the project team will build on a system called Mimir that virtualizes uncertainty by augmenting data curation workflows (e.g., ETL pipelines) with a form of provenance capture through which heuristics can register alternative outputs (e.g., a schema matcher may register multiple potential matches).  This provenance can then be used to synthesize a wide range of different physical and visual representations of uncertainty in data and in query results.  To enable declarative uncertainty management, this proposal will address specific problems that fall into two general categories: (1) selecting and efficiently constructing qualitative summaries of uncertainty in query results, and (2) enhancing database query compilers and optimizers to support practical, efficient query processing over uncertain data.

In fact, TC prediction models and global weather prediction models are expected to merge in a near future. Turbulent mixing in the ocean surface layer under TCs effectively couples the ocean and atmosphere through air-sea exchanges of heat and momentum. This air-sea coupling is modulated by ocean surface waves (sea states) that are particularly complex and varied under TC conditions. Surface waves affect both one-dimensional (vertical mixing/diffusion), and three-dimensional  (upwelling and horizontal advection) processes in the upper ocean. The focus of this study is to advance ocean turbulent mixing schemes that explicitly include the impact of surface waves. Although similar efforts are underway in modeling centers worldwide, few of such efforts include extreme (TC) conditions. Results from this study will inform on the leading order impacts from surface waves on upper ocean processes in high wind conditions, on the benefits of coupling wave and ocean models, and on optimal approaches to implementing wave-dependent parameterizations. The proposed effort is timely and will immediately benefit both the regional and global weather and climate modeling communities. The results of the research will be integrated into the Hurricanes: Science and Society website that is currently used by tens of thousands of educators and students as well as the general public. In addition to their technical training, the graduate students will receive training from education and outreach professionals on how to translate complex scientific concepts into non-expert language.<br/><br/>This collaborative study will be carried out by combining state-of-the-art modeling and observational data obtained in previous field programs. Specifically, upper ocean responses to several historical Tropical Cyclones will be simulated using a coupled ocean-wave model that includes sea-state dependent Langmuir turbulence parameterizations and other significant surface wave impacts (the Stokes advection, the Coriolis Stokes force, the Stokes shear force, and the air-sea momentum flux budget). First, the model results will be used to constrain the wind stress and the drag coefficient. Next, the model results, with and without the wave effects, will be compared with observational data, including mixed layer temperature, current, and turbulence data. This investigation will clarify whether the Langmuir turbulence and other surface wave effects make leading order impacts on upper ocean responses to Tropical Cyclones, and whether their accurate prediction requires a fully coupled ocean-wave model with sea-state dependent parameterizations. This study will be conducted in close collaboration with NOAA/Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory scientists and will contribute to the NOAA research and coupled atmosphere-ocean model development involving the role of upper ocean mixing on climate and weather prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These sites reflect not only a record of subsistence, but contain valuable information about the past environment and how people interacted with it and each other. Due to the difficulty in excavating and transporting large amounts of shell, invertebrates are typically not included in zooarchaeological analysis which results in a lack of comparative data on the composition of vertebrates and invertebrates in shell matrix sites. This interdisciplinary research combines zooarchaeology and stable isotope geochemistry to understand the role of shellfish in the processes and practices that led to the formation of shell ring sites on the coastal southeastern US. As a prominent component of shell rings, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) will be the focus of a season of capture study that uses modern environmental data as a proxy for past environmental conditions. Further, understanding use patterns of oysters in the past has important implications for the management and conservation of the species today. Given the decline in oyster populations world-wide, archaeology is uniquely situated to provide a long-term, historical perspective on the human impact on the coast and the health and sustainability of its important resources. Results of this research will be shared globally, including a web-based guide outlining preparation techniques for geochemical analysis of oysters, implications of the findings for estuarine health, and value for archaeological research. Undergraduate student participants in the project will gain laboratory experience and training in zooarchaeological methods and stable isotope analysis.<br/><br/>Shell rings are a class of shell-matrix site in which form and function have been variously theorized as the products of either habitation, ceremonial practice or a combination of the two. Central to these theories is seasonality, wherein ceremonial sites would likely demonstrate seasonal use when compared to year-round habitation sites. Faunal remains are typically used to address the seasonal nature of these sites, however invertebrate remains are rarely included in analysis, limiting our understanding of combined vertebrate and invertebrate faunal use patterns. Under the direction of Dr. Susan deFrance, Co-PI Nicole Cannarozzi will investigate the differential formation and use of two Late Archaic Period Shell rings located on St. Catherines Island, Georgia by comparing the stable isotopic composition of the carbonate in modern and archaeological oysters from these sites. Over a two-year period, the Co-PI collected oysters and water samples from St. Catherines Island and measured water temperature and salinity. These data will be coupled with a comprehensive zooarchaeological analysis of vertebrates and invertebrates from column samples taken from various contexts within the two sites to understand faunal use, settlement patterns and depositional practices. This study highlights the value of interdisciplinary research in archaeology and will clarify our understanding of the timing of formation of shell matrix sites, faunal resource use and seasonal settlement and mobility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Starting in 2014, the US-led international project, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP), provides a continuous record of the full-water column, trans-basin fluxes of heat, mass and freshwater in the Sub-polar North Atlantic, in partnership with the UK, Netherlands, Canada, Germany and China. Data from the first 21 months of the full OSNAP observing system has been used to produce an initial time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes for the Sub-polar basin. These preliminary results reveal a highly variable overturning in the basin, interior pathways for overflow waters, surprisingly energetic boundary current systems on timescales from days to months, and a strong overflow plume in the Iceland Basin. The additional two years of OSNAP observations will cover a time frame sufficient to make comparisons with other overturning time series and optimize the OSNAP measurement system--all necessary tasks prior to a request for longer term measurements. This component of OSNAP (OSNAP West) is for the western array across the Labrador Sea between Greenland and Canada in coordination with Germany and Canada. The sub-goal for OSNAP is to quantify the structure and transport of the West Greenland boundary current system and determine the nature of its variability and shelf-slope exchange. In addition, the overflow water pathways throughout the subpolar region and the mechanisms responsible for their variability will be studied by analyzing the subsurface float data collected since 2014 and the output of high-resolution ocean circulation models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data from the first 21 months of the full OSNAP observing system has been used to produce an initial time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes for the Sub-polar basin. These preliminary results reveal a highly variable overturning in the basin, interior pathways for overflow waters, surprisingly energetic boundary current systems on timescales from days to months, and a strong overflow plume in the Iceland Basin. The additional two years of OSNAP observations will cover a time frame sufficient to make comparisons with other overturning time series and optimize the OSNAP measurement system--all necessary tasks prior to a request for longer term measurements. This component of OSNAP (OSNAP East) is for the eastern array between Greenland and Scotland in coordination with the UK and the Netherlands. The US contribution includes the East Greenland inshore and offshore arrays, the Iceland Basin array, and the integration of all OSNAP measurements. The sub-goal for OSNAP East is to quantify the structure and transport of the boundary currents off the east coast of Greenland and within the Iceland Basin, as well as determine their variability and forcing mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Auction methods are widely used by governments and private firms. For example, web-based electronic reverse auctions are increasing used as a procurement method by Federal agencies. At the same time, agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of the Treasury use auctions to sell everything from Treasury bills to oil and gas leases. This project will use game theory to find auction rules that will perform well in a wide range of situations. It seeks to develop rules that will work well when bidders place the same value on the auctioned good but have different information about the exact value. The project advances the basic science of auction theory, and will lead to better procedures for public procurement and better methods for generating public funds from the sale of natural resources such as timber, oil, and gas. The methodological component of the project could lead to the development of more efficient online trading platforms. The project therefore benefits the U.S. economy.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is to characterize revenue maximizing auctions when bidders have a common valuation for the good being sold. This research will develop new theories of optimal robust auctions that provide favorable revenue guarantees across different models of bidder beliefs and across different kinds of equilibrium behavior. Existing theories identify optimal auction designs that are highly sensitive to modeling assumptions. This project will develop auction designs that are less sensitive to model misspecification. Besides advancing the theory of optimal auctions, the project will also develop and demonstrate methods for designing mechanisms in models with rich information or potentially complex equilibrium strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the current understanding of the drivers of such changes is limited, making an investigation of overturning in the Sub-polar region a key ocean research priority. This field program explicitly addresses this gap. Furthermore, by engaging the larger international community studying the North Atlantic, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) is playing a key role in catalyzing scientific progress by promoting international collaborations, synthesis, and the sharing of resources and by training future generations. Key to the latter is a network of early career scientists whose professional growth will continue to be facilitated through targeted activities that have been tested and improved during OSNAP's initial phase. Graduate students and post-docs will be trained in seagoing operations and in the processing and analysis of observational data.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this field project, in conjunction with other measurements in the North Atlantic, is to establish determination of the linkage between intermediate and deep water formation and the overturning circulation--a connection that is present in climate models, but has yet to be observed.

On the other hand, modern data analysis is highly adaptive. Large parts of modern machine learning perform model selection as a function of the data by iteratively tuning hyper-parameters, and exploratory data analysis is conducted to suggest hypotheses, which are then validated on the same data sets used to discover them. This kind of adaptivity is often referred to as p-hacking, and blamed in part for the surprising prevalence of non-reproducible science in some empirical fields. This project aims to develop rigorous tools and methodologies to perform statistically valid data analysis in the adaptive setting, drawing on techniques from statistics, information theory, differential privacy, and stable algorithm design. <br/><br/>The technical goals of this project include coming up with: 1) information-theoretic measures that characterize the degree to which a worst-case data analysis can over-fit, given an interaction with a dataset; 2) models for data analysts that move beyond the worst-case setting, and; 3) empirical investigations that bridge the gap between theory and practice. The problem of adaptive data analysis (also called post-selection inference, or selective inference) has attracted attention in both computer science and statistics over the past several years, but from relatively disjoint communities. Part of the aim of this project is to integrate these two lines of work. The team of researchers on this project span departments of computer science, statistics, and biomedical data science. In addition to attempting to unify these two areas, the broader impacts of this research will be to make science more reliable, and reduce the prevalence of ""over-fitting"" and ""false discovery.""

Diatoms float in the surface ocean as part of a group of organisms collectively called phytoplankton. There are thousands of different species of diatoms distributed across the global ocean.  A famous oceanographer Henry Bigelow once said ""All fish is diatoms"" reflecting the importance of diatoms as the base of the food chain that supports the world's largest fisheries. Despite their small size, diatom photosynthesis produces 20% of the oxygen on earth each year. That's more than all of the tropical rainforests on land. The major objective of the research is to understand how the metabolic differences among diatom species affects the amount of diatom organic carbon that is carried, or exported, from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. As diatoms are photosynthesizers like green plants, their biological carbon comes from converting carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater from the atmosphere into organic forms.  Diatoms also require a series of other nurtrients supplied by the ocean such as nitrogen and phosphorous and, uniquely for diatoms, the silicon used to construct their glass shells.  This research will investigate how genetic and physiological differences among diatoms influence how each species react to changes in nutrient levels in the ocean and how those shifts affect the export of diatom carbon to the deep sea. The link between diatoms' physiological response and their carbon export comes about because shifts in physiology affect diatom attributes like how fast they sink and how tasty they are to predators. So if we can relate the physiological condition of different diatoms to the food-web pathways followed by different species, we can ultimately use knowledge of diatom physiological status and food web structure to predict how much diatom carbon gets to the deep sea. The research involves investigators with expertise in the physiology and genomics of diatoms and in the ocean's chemistry. The work will initially take place in the subarctic North Pacific in conjunction with the NASA Export Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field program. The EXPORTS program is using a wide variety of methods to quantify the export and fate of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the upper ocean. The research supports the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research will also serve as the basis for activities aimed at K-12 and junior high school students. <br/><br/>The research will broadly impact our understanding of the biology of the biological pump (the transport of photosynthetically fixed organic carbon to the deep sea) by forming a mechanistic basis for predicting the export of diatom carbon. It is hypothesized that the type and degree of diatom physiological stress are vital aspects of ecosystem state that drive export. To test this hypothesis, the genetic composition, rates of nutrient use and growth response of diatom communities will be evaluated and supported with measurements of silicon and iron stress to evaluate stress as a predictor of the path of diatom carbon export. The subarctic N. Pacific ecosystem is characterized as high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) due to low iron (Fe) levels that are primary controllers constraining phytoplankton utilization of other nutrients. It has been a paradigm in low Fe, HNLC systems that diatoms grow at elevated Si:C and Si:N ratios and should be efficiently exported as particles significantly enriched in Si relative to C. However, Fe limitation also alters diatoms species composition and the high Si demand imposed by low Fe can drive HNLC regions to Si limitation or Si/Fe co-limitation. Thus, the degree of Si and/or Fe stress in HNLC waters can all alter diatom taxonomic composition, the elemental composition of diatom cells, and the path cells follow through the food web ultimately altering diatom carbon export.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Driven by portable devices in the mobile internet industry and the cost reduction requirements in Internet of Things (IOT), integrated circuit chips are becoming thinner and more flexible, whereas the working environments expose them to more extreme conditions. This trend creates increasing challenges and reducing reliability due to their higher inclination to failure.

It also offers solutions to pressing problems on energy, environmental sustainability, and resources that shape our society.  This research program is designed to boost the chemistry community's capacity to address these challenges by transforming the process that creates underlying innovation. The research promotes a shift away from trial-and-error searches and towards rational design.  These combine traditional chemical research with modern data science by introducing tools such as machine learning into the chemical context.  This project enables and advances this emerging field by building a cyberinfrastructure that makes data-driven research a viable and widely accessible proposition for the chemistry community, and thereby an integral part of the chemical enterprise.  Tools and methods developed in this research provide the means for the large-scale exploration of chemical space and for a better understanding of the hidden mechanisms that determine the behavior of complex chemical systems.  These insights can potentially accelerate, streamline, and ultimately transform the chemical development process.  The project also tackles the concomitant need to adapt education to this new research landscape in order to adequately equip the next generation of scientists and engineers, to build a competent and skilled workforce for the cutting-edge R&D of the future, and to ensure the competitiveness of US students in the international job market.  By promoting minority participation in this promising field, it contributes to a sustained push towards equal opportunity in our society.  This project thus promotes the progress of science and advances prosperity and welfare as stated by NSF's mission.<br/><br/>While there is growing agreement on the value of data-driven discovery and rational design, this approach is still far from being a mainstay of everyday research in the chemistry community.  This work addresses three key obstacles: (i) data-driven research is beyond the scope and reach of most chemists due to a lack of available and accessible tools, (ii) many fundamental and practical questions on how to make data science work for chemical research remain unresolved, and (iii) data science is not part of the formal training of chemists, and much of the community thus lacks the necessary experience and expertise to utilize it.  This research centers around the creation of an open, general-purpose software ecosystem that fuses in silico modeling, virtual high-throughput screening, and big data analytics (i.e., the use of machine learning, informatics, and database technology for the validation, mining, and modeling of resulting data sets) into an integrated research infrastructure.  A key consideration is to make this ecosystem as comprehensive, robust, and user-friendly as possible, so that it can readily be employed by interested researchers without the need for extensive expert knowledge.  It also serves as a development platform and testbed for innovation in the underlying methods, algorithms, and protocols, i.e., it allows the community to systematically and efficiently evaluate the utility and performance of different techniques, including new ones that are being introduced as part of this project.  A meta machine learning approach is being developed to establish guidelines and best practices that provide added value to the cyberinfrastructure.  The work is driven by concrete molecular design problems, which serve to demonstrate the efficacy of the overall approach.  The educational challenges that arise from the qualitative novelty of data-driven research and its inherent interdisciplinarity are addressesed by leveraging a new graduate program in Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering for cross-cutting course and curricular developments, the creation of interactive teaching materials, and a skill-building hackathon initiative.  This award is jointly made with the Division of Chemistry's, Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flexibility of these rhythmic networks is essential for organisms to alter their behavioral output to meet changing demands. An important aspect of network flexibility is that neurons can rapidly switch their participation between networks. Modulatory inputs that project to rhythmic networks can induce neuronal switching through the release of chemical messengers. These chemical messengers alter network activity through their modulatory actions on the properties of neurons and on the synaptic connections between neurons. Determining how individual modulatory actions combine to elicit switching is a major challenge in the field of neuroscience. Small well-defined networks are instrumental in bridging the gap between cellular-level actions and whole network output. In particular, the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) provides access to all network components as well as modulatory inputs to networks, and enables manipulation of individual neuronal properties and synaptic connections. This proposal uses the STNS to identify fundamental cellular mechanisms by which modulatory inputs switch neuronal participation between rhythmic networks. This includes the use of hybrid biological-computational networks to dissect the contributions of individual modulatory actions. This project also advances scientific discovery and learning for graduate and undergraduate students through training in the research lab of the principal investigator and in advanced lab-based courses. Underrepresented groups continue to be incorporated into the lab's research through partnerships with university and elementary school level STEM minority participation programs.<br/> <br/>Interestingly, neuronal switching can include neurons that switch between single and dual network activity. This switching can result in a single neuron expressing two activity patterns at two different frequencies. There is some evidence that modulatory inputs can elicit switching through their actions on synapses and neuronal properties. However, the complex interplay of electrical coupling, chemical synapses, and neuronal membrane properties has limited research at the network level. An identified modulatory input in the STNS causes a neuron to partially decouple from its electrically coupled partners in one network and simultaneously participate in a second network. The objectives of this proposal are to determine how modulatory actions, individually and collectively, regulate switching between a single and a dual network state. These objectives are achieved using a combination of electrophysiological and computational approaches, including hybrid networks in which biological and model neurons are coupled with the dynamic clamp technique. This project aims to identify novel mechanisms by which modulatory actions enable a neuron to become an active contributor to: 1) rhythm generation for two rhythms simultaneously, despite their occurrence at different frequencies, and 2) coordination among different network neurons. Determining these mechanisms will provide new insights into how electrical and chemical synapses can interact with neuronal membrane properties to regulate participation between networks. Increased understanding of how electrical coupling interacts with other network properties also provides a framework for future biological and computational studies in other rhythmic neural networks including those in larger, less accessible systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the complex relationships between form, function, and environment is essential for reconstructing the behaviors and habitats of past species. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate how populations of wild mountain gorillas living in ecologically distinct habitats may differ in their patterns of movement (locomotor behavior). This information will help contextualize the observable skeletal variation in apes and inform our inferences about locomotion in fossil apes and humans. The project will involve interdisciplinary and international collaborations, broaden the participation of under-represented groups in STEM, and provide research mentorship to undergraduate students. The researchers will engage with the public on topics related to human evolution and our closest living relatives, the African apes.<br/><br/>Paleoanthropologists have long debated how our early ancestors moved, especially in terms of how they first began walking upright on two legs, and how much time they may have spent in the trees. While more fossils, and more species, have been added to the hominin family tree, there is still limited knowledge about how closely related species and populations may have differed in terms of habitats and locomotion. Data on the locomotion of living ape populations can advance our understanding of the form-function relationships between locomotor behavior and skeletal features, allowing more informed inferences from the ape and human fossil record. The researchers will investigate how the locomotor behavior of two populations of mountain gorillas differs, in terms of the frequency of key locomotor behaviors and limb and joint motions. The study will use traditional observational methods to quantify the relative frequency of different postural and locomotor behaviors, and place into context the frequency of locomotor behaviors (e.g., vertical climbing and below-branch suspension) in comparison to other great apes. The video-based motion analysis (kinematics) will implement new field-based methods for capturing motion data, providing some of the first 3D kinematic data on apes in their natural environment. Kinematic analysis will quantify the joint postures and movements used during locomotion, offering new quantitative data for interpreting the functional role of skeletal features often used to infer locomotor capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multifunctional reconfigurable antenna (MRA) technology targeted in this project enables a single antenna element to dynamically change its frequency band, radiation pattern and polarization properties, which directly impact the radio-frequency (RF) coverage, capacity, and quality of service achieved by any wireless network. Machine-to-machine communications, Internet of Things applications, satellite communications, radar-based sensing, and tactical military communications are just a few of the areas that will benefit from the results of this work. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for use in 802.11ac/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications. 5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity. Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands, where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage, increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta prototypes of two MRA array modules containing the hardware and control algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with WLAN and 5G small-cell modems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerical models of tsunami generation and propagations are used in support of warning systems and for the creation of inundation maps for hazard assessment. Tsunamis can be attributed to seismic (i.e., earthquakes and submarine landslides) or non-seismic sources (i.e., volcanic eruptions). The latter are prevalent in some areas around the world (e.g., Aleutian arc for US West Coast).  Our understanding of tsunami generation from mechanisms such as earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic collapse, has largely resulted from devastating events (e.g., Papua New Guinea, 1998; Indian Ocean, 2004; Japan, 2011), which combined have caused over 300,000 fatalities and US $30B of damage.  Due to lack of a major recent event, eruption generated tsunamis (the focus of this study) remain largely under-studied. In this multi-disciplinary study, the US/UK team will perform collaborative field and modeling research, to improve our understanding of tsunamis generated by volcanic eruptions, especially those from large-volume, caldera-forming events close to the sea, which are among the most devastating geohazards. Work will focus on the 1883 Krakatau eruption-generated tsunami, which caused over 33,000 fatalities in Indonesia. Although this eruption was well studied, there is still controversy over the tsunami generation mechanism and, since 1883, apart from a surge of interest during its 100-year anniversary, there has been little new data, which would be a basis for a major project on the event. The new understanding/modeling resulting from this project will improve tsunami hazard assessment and warning from such sources, and could improve operational tsunami hazard assessment and inundation mapping work as tsunami warning systems for non-seismic sources with significant implication in population safety. Project results will be disseminated to the scientific and broader communities at professional conferences, in peer-reviewed journals, by building an extensive website (with project metadata, news, podcasts/videos, and auxiliary information), and through the visualization of scientific data (targeting a K-12 audience). A workshop will be organized in Indonesia at the outset to engage local people and scientists (support from Newton funds is being sought). There will be active collaboration with colleagues at Greek/Caribbean/Mediterranean-based institutions/organizations, facing similar eruption-tsunami risks.<br/><br/>As a large-volume, caldera-forming event Krakatau is representative of similar other well studied historical events (e.g., 3500BP Santorini and 7500BP Kikai), and includes diverse tsunami generating mechanisms: pyroclastic density current (PDC) discharges into the sea, caldera collapse, and explosions. It also has an exceptional eruption and tsunami record from observations at the time. The objectives of the study are to: 1) apply improved numerical models of tsunamis from volcanic eruption mechanisms (including seafloor deposits), mainly PDC and caldera collapse; 2) perform new field surveys of on land tsunami sediment deposits, to discriminate individual tsunami events and their impact; 3) perform new PDC field surveys, complementing a pilot offshore seismic database showing that individual PDC flows can be identified and mapped, and their runouts and volumes estimated; 4) use these estimates to understand physical properties of PDCs as they enter the sea; and 5) use the new data (sediment, PDC) as a basis for applying the new numerical tsunami models. Tsunami simulations will be carried out iteratively by comparing model outputs (inundation limits, runups; PDC deposits/runouts) with historical documentation of impacted areas along the coasts of Sumatra and Java, and both old and newly acquired PDC and sediment deposit field survey data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During free-choice learning in museums and science centers, visitor engagement shapes how learners interact with exhibits, navigate through exhibit spaces, and form attitudes, interests, and understanding of science. Recent advances in multimodal learning analytics are creating novel opportunities for expanding the range and richness of measures of visitor engagement in free-choice settings. In particular, multimodal learning analytics offer significant potential for integrating multiple data sources to devise a composite picture of visitors' cognitive, affective, and behavioral engagement. The project will center on providing a rich empirical account of meaningful visitor engagement with interactive tabletop science exhibits among individual visitors and small groups, as well as uncovering broader tidal patterns in visitor engagement that unfold across exhibit spaces. A key objective of the project is creating models and practitioner-focused learning analytic tools that will inform the best practices of exhibit designers and museum educators. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program.  As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, AISL funds research and innovative approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings.<br/><br/>The research team will conduct data-rich investigations of visitors' learning experiences with multimodal learning analytics that fuse the rich multichannel data streams produced by fully-instrumented exhibit spaces with the data-driven modeling functionalities afforded by recent advances in machine learning and educational data mining. The research team will conduct a series of visitor studies of naturalistic engagement in solo, dyad, and group interactions as visitors explore interactive tabletop science exhibits. The studies will utilize eye trackers to capture visitors' moment-to-moment attention, facial expression analysis and quantitative field observations to track visitors' emotional states, trace logs generated by exhibit software, as well as motion-tracking sensors and coded video recordings to capture visitors' behavioral interactions. The studies will also use conversation recordings and pre-post assessment measures to capture visitors' science understanding and inquiry processes. With these multimodal data streams as training data, the research team will use probabilistic and neural machine learning techniques to devise learning analytic models of visitor engagement. <br/><br/>The project will be conducted by a partnership between North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. The research team will 1) design a data-rich multimodal visitor study methodology, 2) create the Visitor Informatics Platform, a suite of open source software tools for multimodal visitor analytics, and 3) launch the Multimodal Visitor Data Warehouse, a curated visitor experience data archive. Together, the multimodal visitor study methodology, the Visitor Informatics Platform, and the Multimodal Visitor Data Warehouse will enable researchers and practitioners in the informal science education community to utilize multimodal learning analytics in their own informal learning environments. It is anticipated that the project will advance the field of informal STEM learning by extending and enriching measures of meaningful visitor engagement, expanding the evidence base for visitor experience design principles, and providing learning analytic tools to support museum educators. By enhancing understanding of the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dynamics underlying visitor experiences in science museums, informal science educators will be well-positioned to design learning experiences that are more effective and engaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vigorous growth of such clouds is fueled by the convective available potential energy (CAPE) of the atmosphere. Formally CAPE is the amount of work that would be done by the buoyancy force on a saturated plume of air rising through the portion of the atmosphere in which it is lighter than the surrounding air, assuming that no ambient air mixes into the rising plume.  Weather forecasters routinely calculate CAPE from atmospheric temperature soundings and use it to predict the likelihood of severe convective storms.<br/><br/>Computer simulations of greenhouse-gas induced climate change commonly show large increases of CAPE with global mean temperature, a result which has raised concerns that thunderstorms may become more common or intense as a consequence of climate change.  But the reasons why CAPE should increase with global temperature are not clear, and the lack of a theory for the dependence of CAPE on temperature limits confidence in model results.<br/><br/>Under previous funding the PI's group developed a simple model which explains the dependence of CAPE on temperature.  But the theory assumes that the atmosphere is in a state of radiative-convective equilibrium, a state which approximates the condition of the atmosphere over warm tropical oceans.  The theory is compelling as a starting point but cannot be directly applied to understand CAPE change over land or at higher latitudes.  Work under this award thus seeks a more general understanding of the relationship between CAPE and global climate, including the effects of large-scale atmospheric circulation.  <br/><br/>The research is conducted through examination of climate model simulations produced for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, combined with experiments using a cloud resolving model on a limited domain to test hypotheses.  The role of atmospheric circulation is assessed through calculation and analysis of moist mean available potential energy (MAPE), the maximum amount of kinetic energy that can be reversibly produced from the mean state of the atmosphere by transforming to a lower energy reference state. The MAPE analysis seeks to relate the mean state of the atmosphere in middle and high latitudes to its potential to generate CAPE through large-scale circulations.  The impact of land surface conditions on CAPE is another focus of the research, as the strong diurnal cycle of temperature and moisture plays a key role in the development of convection over land. Further work considers the impact of changes in CAPE on the Walker circulation, a large-scale overturning circulation between the western and eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>The work has societal as well as scientific value given the damaging effects of convective storms, including hail, lightning, tornados, and flash floods, along with indications that their intensity or frequency of occurrence may increase due to climate change. Results with practical implications are shared with interested parties through workshops and other venues, and research results are incorporated into classroom teaching and other educational activities.  In addition, the project provides support and training to a graduate student, thereby providing for the future work force in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike ""regular matter"", Dark Energy seems to act against gravity and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. This is very confusing, and to explain it, we may have to re-write particle physics or perhaps even the laws of gravity. The best way to answer the question ""What is Dark Energy?"" is to measure the expansion of the Universe farther back in time. <br/><br/>Recently astronomers realized that radio telescopes have the potential to make this measurement better than any other type of telescope. This has never been attempted before, and we are now building telescopes to achieve this goal. However, to be successful we need to understand the telescope ""beam"" (like a beam of light, a telescope points at one place and focuses there, and we must know what that beam looks like on the sky). For this CAREER grant, the PI is building radio sources to put on quadcopter drones to fly above the telescope. Using the radio telescope data, the location of the drone (with special position sensors), and some new analysis techniques, we will make a map of our telescope beam. The end result will be an important measurement that helps us understand Dark Energy better. <br/><br/>The accelerated expansion of the Universe was discovered from supernova measurements in 1998 and no fundamental theories for this acceleration have yet been experimentally verified. As a result, cosmologists inserted a new component (""Dark Energy"") into our cosmological models, but the underlying theories to explain the accelerated expansion involve either (i) a modification to General Relativity or (ii) a new particle which would predict a unique time dependence of the expansion rate. Either would revolutionize our current models of fundamental theories of physics. To answer these questions we must measure the expansion history of the Universe across the past 11 billion years and pin down the influence of Dark Energy on the expansion. The most promising path for this comes from measurements of galaxies (measuring > 100, 000 galaxies across a wide swath of the sky). Unfortunately, current and next-generation optical galaxy surveys are restricted in how far back in time they can see due to limitations in detector technology. <br/><br/>Radio telescopes do not have these limitations, and offer a promising solution to make radio surveys of galaxies across most of cosmic time. This measurement has never been attempted before and we are now building radio telescopes designed to achieve this goal. However, we already know that to be successful we must understand our telescope characteristics extremely well, in particular the telescope ""beam"" (like a beam of light, a telescope points at one place and focuses there, and we must know what that beam looks like on the sky). For this CAREER grant, the PI is developing a beam mapper using a quadcopter drone. The PI's team will fly a radio source on the drone above the telescopes and use the radio data and drone position to make a map of the beam. This requires developing a stabilized noise source to be flown on the drone, improved sensors for better drone position accuracy, and new analysis techniques - particularly a mathematical transformation to use measurements made near the dish and infer what they look like on the sky. The end result will be an important measurement for cosmology radio telescopes and a beam mapping technique that is demonstrated to work at the high precision required for Dark Energy science goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are bicycles with a small battery-powered electric motor to assist the rider. Over 150 million e-bikes have been sold in Europe and Asia in the past ten years--in China's case, truly transformative transportation. This is the world's largest adoption of an alternative fuel vehicle. E-bikes are becoming more important in North America. However, there is little empirical evidence on the behavior of e-bike users and environmental sustainability impacts. The investigator team will refine and deploy a research study, using a combination of emerging hardware and software capabilities, to collect behavioral data from e-bike riders. The collected data will then be used to evaluate how large shifts in e-bike use will affect sustainability. The research in this GOALI project is enabled by an industry partner (Bosch). <br/><br/>The first objective of this research is to refine an instrumentation system (physical hardware and a mobile device application) tailored for e-bike users. This system includes a mix of onboard hardware and smartphone software to collect a host of data on energy and other vehicle telematics. The data collected by the instrumentation and mobile application will be sent to a platform with little to no input required by the user. Using that data, the second objective is to assess the riding behavior of e-bike users and the performance of e-bikes in meeting travel needs. The research team will conduct an empirical study, starting with at least 150-200 participants for one year. This collaboration with industry partners will collect vehicle telematics and rider behavior metrics with an aim toward modeling net travel changes between modes (mode shift and vehicle kilometers traveled). This objective will identify how e-bike use behaviors differ from relatively well known incumbent modes. The third objective is to investigate the life-cycle environmental impacts of e-bike ownership and use, relying on the Department of Energy's GREET LCA model. Coupling the behavioral models with LCA models will provide a methodologically novel assessment of the impact of this new mode. This study will inform local and state policy and planning efforts related to the growth of e-bikes and their influence on environmental policy goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particular area of interest is the rate of exchange of gases such as carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide, which play important roles in Earth's climate. Understanding and modeling air-sea exchange on a global scale requires understanding of how gas exchange rates vary in response to a number of factors such as temperature, wind speed, and the presence of surface chemical films (known as surfactants) in the ocean. Over the past 25 years, major advances have been made in understanding air-sea gas exchange in the open ocean, mainly due to improvements in methodologyand a number of successful process studies. However, some important questions remain, such as what happens near coastal areas (including inland seas), and how surfactants affect gas exchange. The Baltic Sea Gas Exchange Experiment (Baltic GasEx) is a collaboration between scientists from the US and Germany designed to address these questions. Participants in Baltic GasEx will measure the air-sea gas exchange rates with different techniques in the Baltic Sea before and after the spring bloom, when concentrations and compositions of surfactants will be different. The expeditions will be conducted on a German ship (Alkor), with the ultimate goal of quantifying the relationship between wind speed and gas exchange in an inland sea, and understanding the impact of surfactants on air-sea gas exchange. The project will involve significant international collaboration, public education and outreach through both participating U.S. institutions, and substantial student training in partnership with the international collaborators.<br/><br/>NSF funding will support helium-3 and sulfur hexafluoride measurements during Baltic GasEx to determine the gas exchange rate. German colleagues are independently funded to quantify surfactants with AC voltammetry, surface tension, and sum frequency generation; to determine chemical characteristics of the micro layer; and to estimate the gas exchange rate using eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2 and DMS. The proposed experiment is designed to address the question of whether open ocean wind speed/gas exchange parameterizations can be applied to inland seas like the Baltic. Also, the effect of surfactants on gas exchange has been studied extensively in the laboratory, but there is little direct field evidence for the effect of surfactants on gas exchange. The proposed experiment, with expeditions at times with both high and low surfactant concentrations, should shed new light on the effect of natural surfactants on gas exchange. Finally, some wind speed/gas exchange parameterizations proposed for the Baltic Sea appear to be higher than typical open ocean parameterizations. These are typically based on eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2. However, in open ocean experiments where both the helium-3/sulfur hexafluoride approach and eddy covariance of CO2 have been deployed, there seems to be a discrepancy between gas transfer velocities measured with the two techniques. This experiment should show whether a similar difference in gas transfer velocities measured via these two techniques also exists in the Baltic Sea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As photosynthetic organisms, phytoplankton directly take up dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to synthesize their tissues using energy from the sun.  In addition to carbon (C), essential nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) are required by these primary producers.  While dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) is the preferred form of P because it is a small enough molecule that phytoplankton can directly absorb it, in the sunlit surface waters of the ocean the concentration of DIP can be drawn down to limiting levels.  In this situation, the larger dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) molecules can become available through enzyme hydrolysis reactions, which convert DOP to DIP.  There was mounting evidence that DOP can play a crucial role in supporting primary production in the ocean, yet very little is known about the nature of the DOP pool.  There are many analytical impediments to gaining information about the chemical structure and composition of DOP, and without knowledge of its composition there is no basis for evaluating the potential bioavailability of DOP to primary producers. The proposed work will employ a unique combination of methods to gain novel insight into the composition and bioavailability of DOP.  Field and laboratory (culture) nutrient addition incubation experiments will target the drivers of DOP variability, information crucial to resolving models of primary production in the ocean. Results of this work will be transformative for understanding DOP composition, DOP variability in space and time, and microbial control on the nature of the marine DOP pool.  <br/><br/>This proposal will support a postdoctoral scholar, two undergraduate students and two undergraduate students. Recruitment of undergraduate students will focus on entraining Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, through SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science)and related venues. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international meetings.  We also propose to conduct outreach to middle schools, including bringing The Artistic Oceanographer Program, an interactive inquiry-based program targeting middle school age science and art standards by integrating concepts in ocean science literacy with art, to local middle schools in New York and Hawaii.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed work will provide foundational information on the way DOP molecular characteristics translate into P-bioavailability to marine microorganisms, and in turn how microorganisms growing under different dissolved inorganic nitrogen: dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIN:DIP) impact the composition and bioavailability of DOP.  A newly developed sequential ultrafiltration (SUF) method will be applied to samples collected along a natural P-gradient in the western North Atlantic. The SUF method quantitatively segregates and concentrates DOP into 4 molecular weight size classes, which can be subjected to bioavailability assays using phosphohydrolytic enzymes, and to liquid chromotography-mass spectrometry to provide detailed compositional information.  Using these combined methods we will probe in situ DOP, the evolution of in situ DOP during shipboard incubations under different DIN:DIP, and the composition and bioavailability of DOP produced by organisms isolated from key stations along the natural phosphate gradient.  Contrast of in situ patterns to those developed in controlled culture experiments using field isolates will be achieved by identifying cellular shifts in organic phosphorus biosynthesis pathways, and tracing how such shifts impact DOP composition.  The combined methodological approach will provide unparalleled insight into DOP composition and bioavailability, addressing this major knowledge gap.  Results of this work will be transformative for understanding DOP composition, DOP variability in space and time, and microbial control on the nature of the marine DOP pool.  Such information is a prerequisite to building ecosystem models that capture the influence of P biogeochemistry on primary production and carbon cycling in aquatic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumption of organic material produced by the algae in deeper waters or in sediments consumes oxygen, leading to low-oxygen ""dead zones"" in many places like the northern Gulf of Mexico. This process of nutrient input, algal growth, and loss of oxygen is called eutrophication. Consumption of the organic matter also releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the water, and contributes directly and indirectly to ocean acidification. In order to understand and predict this impact on acidification, it is important to understand how much of the organic matter degradation occurs in the water column versus in the sediments, how variable it is between seasons and years, and how it is affected by processes such as storms that disturb the bottom sediments. In this project, investigators from three institutions along with their graduate and undergraduate students will conduct a combination of field observations and computer modeling to address these questions in the northern Gulf of Mexico. They will share their results with the public through local outreach activities, and with secondary school students in Louisiana through partnerships and curriculum development with local teachers.<br/><br/>The proposed research will use a combined observational and numerical modeling approach to better understand the role of shelf sediment in driving bottom water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH dynamics and acidification at seasonal scales. Past and current studies have not addressed this mechanism. This current lack of knowledge makes it difficult to construct a comprehensive carbon budget for this region. The proposed research will (i) quantify the role of benthic fluxes in DIC production leading to acidification in the bottom water; (ii) determine the importance of the seasonally changing benthic DIC flux in acidifying the bottom water; and (iii) explore the importance of episodic resuspension events in modulating benthic fluxes of DIC. Seasonal sampling will be carried out in Louisiana shelf using state of the art benthic lander platform to record in situ sediment and bottom water oxygen consumption rates, organic matter remineralization rates, sediment oxygen penetration depths, benthic fluxes of DIC and accompanying pH drop. Bottom current velocities and turbidity will also be recorded in conjunction with sediment porewater and water column sampling. Complementing these detailed near-bed and seabed observations, we will utilize a recently developed coupled hydrodynamics, sediment transport and biogeochemistry model (HydroBioSed) to scale up observed estimates of benthic fluxes to an annual scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past studies have shown sub-ice shelf ecosystems to change in response to altered oceanographic processes resulting from ice-shelve retreat. However, information on community changes and ecosystem structure under ice shelves are limited because sub-ice-shelf ecosystems have either been sampled many years after ice-shelf breakout, or have been sampled through small boreholes, yielding extremely limited spatial information. The recent breakout of the A-68 iceberg from the Larsen C ice shelf in the western Weddell Sea provides an opportunity to use a ship-based study to evaluate benthic communities and water column characteristics in an area recently vacated by a large overlying ice shelf. The opportunity will allow spatial assessments at the time of transition from an under ice-shelf environment to one initially exposed to conditions more typical of a coastal Antarctic marine setting. <br/><br/>This RAPID project will help determine the state of a coastal Antarctic ecosystem newly exposed from ice-shelf cover and will aid in understanding of rates of community change during transition. The project will conduct a 10-day field program, allowing contrasts to be made of phytoplankton and seafloor megafaunal communities in areas recently exposed by ice-shelf loss to areas exposed for many decades. The project will be undertaken in a collaborative manner with the South Korean Antarctic Agency, KOPRI, by participating in a cruise in March/May 2018. Combining new information in the area of Larsen C with existing observations after the Larsen A and B ice shelf breakups further to the north, the project is expected to generate a dataset that can elucidate fundamental processes of planktonic and benthic community development in transition from food-poor to food-rich ecosystems. The project will provide field experience to two graduate students, a post-doctoral associate and an undergraduate student.

Collaboration with South American colleagues is planned as is extensive student involvement.<br/><br/>This project aims to employ classical dendrochronological techniques to generate new tropical tree-ring chronologies that are annually resolved and absolutely dated. Radiocarbon measurements (14-Carbon) will ensure accurate dating assessments. Thus, successful tree species will be selected to improve the 14-Carbon curve for the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting tree-ring series will be used to reconstruct past climate variability and regional to large--scale atmospheric dynamics for the last several centuries. The specific aims of the project are to improve understanding of: (1) the spatiotemporal variability of the South American summer monsoon (SASM); (2) long-term interactions between El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the SASM; and (3) the impact of volcanic forcing on past hydroclimate of the tropical Andes.<br/><br/>The research aims to provide significant advances in the science of tropical dendrochronology by developing a tree-ring network for the tropical Andes in Peru and Bolivia, a region with exceedingly scarce coverage of high-resolution terrestrial paleo-records. While tree rings have been extensively used in temperate climates, the tropics remain relatively unexplored due to the difficulty, in particular, of identifying consistent wood layers (tree rings) corresponding to seasonal or annual growing periods. The Central Andes are an ideal region for overcoming these difficulties, due to the pronounced precipitation seasonality and diverse forests.<br/><br/>The tropical Andes are a hotspot for biodiversity and its geographic position makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change. It also contains nearly all the tropical glaciers on the globe, and recent, widespread glacial retreat is causing a rapid decline in hydrological reserves.  This decline, in combination with increasing water demand due to population growth and economic expansion poses an enormous challenge for water availability, biodiversity and food security. The complex topography of the Andean Cordillera leads to a climate that is characterized by strong zonal and vertical precipitation gradients. Moisture influx from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon basin is modulated by the SASM and ENSO. The scientific understanding of this variability is challenged by the scarcity of long instrumental observations, which also limits the ability to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections over this region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current methods to achieve cellular resolution are invasive (e.g., blood test or tissue biopsy), and non-invasive imaging modalities do not achieve cellular resolution. The principal goal of this Expeditions project is to develop computational imaging systems for non-invasive bio-imaging, deep beneath the skin, and at cellular-level resolutions. This project has the potential to fundamentally impact healthcare and medicine, by enabling live views of cross sections of human anatomy, simply by pointing a camera at any part of the body. This would put individual users at the center of their healthcare experience and make them true partners in their healthcare delivery. The health imaging devices that result from this project will act as an important pillar in the personalized medicine revolution. This research expedition also holds the potential to launch new healthcare paradigms for chronic disease management, pediatrics, low-resource healthcare, and disaster medical care. Beyond healthcare, making progress on the problem of cellular-scale deep-tissue imaging using light will push the frontiers of the fundamental problem of inverse scattering, which impacts numerous areas of science and engineering. The order of magnitude advances made in inverse scattering and imaging through scattering media will have significant cross-cutting applications in diverse areas such as basic science, consumer imaging, automotive navigation, robotics, surveillance, atmospheric science, and material science. Finally, projects with a single, easy-to-appreciate, and high-impact goal have the potential to inspire the next generation of scientists, attract diverse set of students driven by humanitarian and social causes, and become a platform for inclusion and innovation.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate new computational imaging systems, to non-invasively image below the skin at tunable depths, in highly portable form-factors such as wearables or point-of-care devices. The main challenge is that light scatters as it travels through the human body, and in this process, the spatial information from different points within the body gets mixed up. A new concept, Computational Photo-Scatterography (CPS), is being applied in this project in order to computationally unravel the scattered photons in an imaging system, and allow creation of sharp images and accurate inferences. Recognizing that the brute-force complexity of unraveling scattered photons is prohibitively high, the project uses a computational co-design framework that leverages advances by team members from multiple domains: programmable illumination and optics, image sensors, machine learning, inverse graphics, and hybrid analog-digital computing.  The project will use machine learning (ML) instead of physics-based de-scattering to speed up the solution of the underlying inverse problem. A combination of physics-based inverse graphics algorithms, and ML algorithms combining deep learning and generative modeling will be used to estimate tissue scattering parameters -  motion due to blood flow induces time-variation in tissue parameters, which makes solving the inverse scattering problem more difficult. The project will use ML to create fast but approximate estimators, which will serve as accelerators for inverse scattering. The development of new sensors, able to capture the data necessary to reconstruct the structure of the tissue deep below the skin, constitutes the most important contribution of the project. These systems and algorithms will have the potential to break the current resolution limits of noninvasive bio-imaging by nearly two orders of magnitude, enabling cellular-level imaging at depths far beyond currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout education, images are used to clearly convey complex ideas and to stimulate curiosity and interest.  Likewise, investigations in the biological sciences and in medicine invariably require clear pictures of cells, tissues, and organs to discover mechanisms of life and to detect and understand the complex pathological processes of disease. Therefore, imaging is the centerpiece for this REU Site, serving as a bridge between education, engineering, the biological sciences, and medicine. Students gain an advanced skillset in state-of-the-art imaging technologies and interdisciplinary research that they can carry with them to graduate school. They are exposed to the breadth of imaging techniques and medical applications while simultaneously focusing on a specific project at the forefront of biology and medical science. This program applies literature-supported mentorship and training strategies to directly address pipeline leaks for the transition of under-represented groups to graduate degree programs in engineering or related programs. The program also provides enrichment of technical skills, professionalism, and career-readiness. The program is assessed and refined in real-time to continually improve the student experience and value. <br/><br/>This REU Site is dedicated to inspiring and training undergraduates in STEM fields through a summer experience in biomedical imaging research. The goal is to create a coherent interdisciplinary program centered on the visualization of biology and human tissues at all scales, and for students to develop a network of role models, mentors, and peers to support and encourage their transition to graduate school. Undergraduate sophomores and juniors in a variety of STEM disciplines will be recruited with special efforts directed toward females and under-represented minorities at minority-serving institutions and small colleges with limited research opportunities. Students begin this 10-week summer program with a 3-day ""Bioimaging Bootcamp"" to provide foundational knowledge in biology, imaging, and microscopy through lectures, demonstrations, lab activities, and tours, together with social introductions. Students then engage in intensive research projects in imaging and biological visualization, closely mentored by a faculty member and graduate student. All research projects, ranging from imaging single molecules using fluorescence microscopy to MRI-based imaging of the brain in living mammals, have three essential elements: (1) imaging and/or microscopy, (2) a hypothesis-driven analysis of biological samples, and (3) an analytical or computational component. Students also have unique clinical medical imaging immersion experiences, share experiences with their cohort through biweekly social activities, attend research seminars and professional development sessions, and interact with participants in other REUs on campus to expand their network. Summer achievements culminate in poster and oral presentations at a campus undergraduate research symposium that draws undergraduate researchers from throughout the Midwest, as well as the submission of an abstract to the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Annual Meeting, where they reconvene in the Fall for continued education, networking, and career-enriching opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like many elements taken up by marine life, its concentrations in seawater are very low; however, Cu has a distribution in the water column that is different from other biologically essential elements.  This difference may be attributed to the presence of a residual fraction in seawater that is virtually inert.  This project seeks to understand what this material is, why it is so unreactive, and how it can eventually be <br/>'cracked"" and re-enter the biological cycle.  A scientist from the University of Southern California (USC) will characterize the Cu chemistry during the US GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect (PMT) cruise.  This cruise is a north-south transect from Alaska to Tahiti that spans a wide range of water depths, temperatures, biology, and chemistry.   The Cu measurements will be made alongside many other trace elements that have different chemistries. By comparing their behavior, coupled with the knowledge of each element?s chemical properties, the scientist will further our knowledge of what controls the behavior of Cu in the ocean.  Training of graduate students and outstanding undergraduates in the speciation techniques is planned. The graduate students will also mentor high school students from inner city schools through the USC Young Investigators Program.  The cruise and its findings will be incorporated into outreach activities and courses taught at USC, including a general education class for non-science majors.<br/><br/>A scientist from USC hypothesizes that non-labile complexes will predominate in high-scavenging regimes and that labile forms will accumulate in older deep waters above a non-labile background pool. To quantify the distribution and chemical properties, two different speciation techniques will be used based on competitive ligand exchange. The first, adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry, was used on previous GEOTRACES sections. The second is based on a ligand exchange, liquid/liquid partition methodology developed by the researcher. Partitioning leads to physical separation of fractions that are reactive or not with the competitive ligand allowing the exchangeability of strongly complexed copper by using Cu-65 as a tracer. The tracer enables much slower reactions to be studied experimentally. Samples will be analyzed using isotope dilution by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Samples will also be prepared for natural Cu isotope analysis of non-labile Cu by a colleague at USC (Seth John) to test the hypothesis that non-labile or semi-labile complexes contribute to the heavy isotope signature of dissolved Cu in seawater. The PMT enables high volume sample collection from deep waters at the terminus of the oceanic conveyor belt, along with data for particulate metals and isotope tracers of scavenging. Moreover, the relationship between labile and non-labile Cu can be studied over several distinct biomes, including high-nutrient, low chlorophyll regions and oligotrophic subtropical gyres along the PMT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low dimensional geometers study the existence of Brauer classes on components of so-called character varieties and their ramification patterns to discern attributes of knot complements. Classical algebraists study the Brauer group in its role as a directory of division algebras over a field. There are many open and difficult questions in this classic view of the Brauer Group; are all division algebras of prime degree cyclic? Do there exist non-crossed product division algebras of prime exponent? Is the n-torsion subgroup generated by the classes of cyclic algebras of degree dividing n? Algebraic geometers study the Brauer group as an important invariant of a scheme arising from tale cohomology. This point of view goes back to the 1960's and Grothendieck, who suggested problems that are still actively being investigated.

Consumption of organic material produced by the algae in deeper waters or in sediments consumes oxygen, leading to low-oxygen ""dead zones"" in many places like the northern Gulf of Mexico. This process of nutrient input, algal growth, and loss of oxygen is called eutrophication. Consumption of the organic matter also releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the water, and contributes directly and indirectly to ocean acidification. In order to understand and predict this impact on acidification, it is important to understand how much of the organic matter degradation occurs in the water column versus in the sediments, how variable it is between seasons and years, and how it is affected by processes such as storms that disturb the bottom sediments. In this project, investigators from three institutions along with their graduate and undergraduate students will conduct a combination of field observations and computer modeling to address these questions in the northern Gulf of Mexico. They will share their results with the public through local outreach activities, and with secondary school students in Louisiana through partnerships and curriculum development with local teachers.<br/><br/>The proposed research will use a combined observational and numerical modeling approach to better understand the role of shelf sediment in driving bottom water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH dynamics and acidification at seasonal scales. Past and current studies have not addressed this mechanism. This current lack of knowledge makes it difficult to construct a comprehensive carbon budget for this region. The proposed research will (i) quantify the role of benthic fluxes in DIC production leading to acidification in the bottom water; (ii) determine the importance of the seasonally changing benthic DIC flux in acidifying the bottom water; and (iii) explore the importance of episodic resuspension events in modulating benthic fluxes of DIC. Seasonal sampling will be carried out in Louisiana shelf using state of the art benthic lander platform to record in situ sediment and bottom water oxygen consumption rates, organic matter remineralization rates, sediment oxygen penetration depths, benthic fluxes of DIC and accompanying pH drop. Bottom current velocities and turbidity will also be recorded in conjunction with sediment porewater and water column sampling. Complementing these detailed near-bed and seabed observations, we will utilize a recently developed coupled hydrodynamics, sediment transport and biogeochemistry model (HydroBioSed) to scale up observed estimates of benthic fluxes to an annual scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support the fluid dynamics research and applications community, this project seeks to engage the community in order to conceptualize a future institute, the Computational Fluid Dynamics Software Infrastructure (CFDSI), that will broadly develop, share, and apply computational tools for the generation and analysis of fluid dynamics data from both experimental and computational sources.  After its conceptualization, CFDSI will create and extend tools for problem definition, solution, and analysis of both computational and experimental investigations. The primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of computational tools and data resources through a rich and extensible set of software components that can be integrated into a wide range of existing fluid dynamics analysis tools. By improving the efficiency of tools and their ease of use, the ability for scientists and engineers to accurately predict and understand how complex fluid flows behave will be enhanced, having a significant impact on design, innovation, and discovery across the vast range of applications where fluid dynamics plays a role. CFDSI even has the potential to impact on K-12, undergraduate and graduate education by making a wide variety of resources available to students for fluid dynamics investigations.<br/><br/>The conceptualized institute will make a wide variety of powerful simulation, data, and analysis resources available to the fluid dynamics research community by lowering or eliminating barriers associated with the adoption and use of these resources. The software infrastructure will have a number of positive impacts on the fluid dynamics research community. To do so, CFDSI will connect the best research in fluid dynamics to the best research in data science/analytics within a highly sustainable software development environment. Specifically, CFDSI will: 1) enhance the dissemination of fluid dynamics data resources and advances in CFD modeling, 2) facilitate collaboration in fluid dynamics research, especially between computational and experimental researchers, 3) enable detailed comparisons between different data sources and detailed validation of computational models, 4) ease the use of advanced CFD models, methods, and codes in new and complex applications, 5) facilitate advanced analytics, such as uncertainty quantification, data compression, and optimization, 6) provide students access to advanced CFD methods and data resources, both computational and experimental, to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education in fluid dynamics, 7) improve the sustainability of current and future CFD software, and 8) facilitate the management of the growing body of fluid dynamics data sets. These outcomes will greatly enhance the effectiveness and productivity of research in fluid dynamics. In particular, they will transform the conduct of fluid dynamics research by: 1) making it more collaborative, 2) enhancing the credibility of research results, 3) enabling discovery, 4) reducing the cost of pursuing new research questions, and 5) diversifying and widening the fluid dynamics community through lowering the barriers associated with accessing and adopting CFD codes and large data sets. Software components will be designed for both analysis of experimental and computational databases as well as direct integration into CFD codes. The latter will enable in situ data analytics to address the growing chasm between data creation rate (solver performance) and data storage rate/volume (I/O resources). After conceptualization and implementation, CFDSI will enable more effective fluid dynamics research and thus impact the wide variety of application domains in which fluid dynamics is critical including manufacturing climate, environment, health, transportation, propulsion, and power generation (including conventional, alternative, and nuclear sources) which will, in turn, strongly impact our economy. Additionally, CFDSI will provide the capability for immersive simulations and experiments that will close the loop on idea, insight, discovery, and design through establishing links to in situ data analytics and problem redefinition during ongoing simulations or experiments. Finally, CFDSI will impact other problem domains governed by partial differential equations (e.g. solid mechanics) by serving as a model and starting point for similar domain-specific software infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as genetic datasets rapidly grow in size due to technological advances, a number of hurdles arise when trying to estimate such relationships. Though many methods have been developed to address these challenges, one source of error that is not accounted for by available methods is non-random mating in ancient populations. Because individuals generally do not mate randomly, and because population and species relationships are used to answer diverse research questions from basic science to epidemiology, addressing this source of error is critical. The primary goal of this project is to design statistical methods for estimating population and species relationships that account for non-random mating in ancient populations, thereby increasing the accuracy of estimation. Moreover, it is of high priority that both the scientific community and the public are engaged in the advances of this project. To this end, the researchers will make all approaches developed during this project freely available for use by the wider scientific community. Also, the researchers will work with K-12 students in hands-on activities for learning why and how to build population and species relationships through the Penn State Science-U program. Finally, the researchers will engage indigenous peoples as part of the Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics (SING) Workshop which examines the use of genomic data in science and society.<br/><br/>Ancestral structure, which has been uncovered in many diverse species, can skew gene tree frequencies, thereby hindering the performance of methods for estimating species trees. This research seeks to develop novel likelihood methods that can infer phylogenies under such scenarios, and apply these methods to test evolutionary hypotheses about ancestral structure and gene flow in several model and non-model organisms. The model organisms considered will be mouse, yeast, and mosquito, for which previous studies have observed skewed gene tree frequencies that were attributed to gene flow through hybridization, but may instead be the result of ancestral structure. The researchers will also apply these methods to a non-model coral system, which is of particular interest because morphological and fossil data provide evidence of hybridization, suggesting that this system may exhibit skewed gene tree frequencies. Application to these systems will serve to elucidate and refine knowledge of the events shaping the evolution of these lineages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Targeted drug delivery is one of the most promising approaches which relies on nanoparticles (NPs) that carry and release drugs.  The therapeutic efficacy of NP-based drug carriers is determined by the proper concentration of drug molecules at the lesion site.  NPs need to be delivered directly to the diseased tissues while minimizing their uptake by other tissues, thereby reducing the potential harm to healthy tissue.  Therefore, the design of these NPs and hence the efficacy of the targeted drug delivery could be significantly improved by understanding how the drugs carried by NPs are transported and dispersed in human body.  This project proposes a set of computational tools to model and investigate the transport and dispersion of NPs in human vasculature.  This, in turn, can provide better imaging sensitivity, therapeutic efficacy and lower toxicity of NP-based drug carriers.  The multidisciplinary nature of the project also brings together concepts from biology, engineering and computer science to educate the next generation of computational biologists, scientists and engineers. This research, thus, aligns with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare. <br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to create a hybrid finite element and molecular dynamics computational approach for modeling NP transport and adhesion in human vasculature.  The realistic geometry of vascular network and fluid dynamics of blood flow are accurately captured through the finite element model.  The microscopic interactions between NPs and red blood cells within blood flow and adhesion of NPs to vessel wall are resolved through the molecular dynamics simulation.  A robust and efficient coupling interface is built to couple the finite element and molecular dynamics solvers.  Specifically, this project aims to 1) create a multiscale and multiphysics computational model for predicting the vascular dynamics of NPs under the influence of realistic geometrical and physiochemical features of human vasculature; 2) craft an interface coupling technique that enhances computational accuracy and predictability by coupling the finite element and molecular dynamics solvers; 3) build testsuits for multiscale and multiphysics simulations for coupled solution error and convergence analysis; and 4) advance the current cyberinfrastructure to accelerate the material design process and enrich the cyber-enabled materials design community.  Such a computational method can be used to explore how the vascular dynamics of NPs will be affected by their size, shape, surface and stiffness properties, as well as complex geometry of human vasculature.  The simulation results can further guide experimentalists to design NP-mediated drug delivery platforms that optimally accumulate within diseased tissue to provide better imaging sensitivity, therapeutic efficacy and lower toxicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past studies have shown sub-ice shelf ecosystems to change in response to altered oceanographic processes resulting from ice-shelve retreat. However, information on community changes and ecosystem structure under ice shelves are limited because sub-ice-shelf ecosystems have either been sampled many years after ice-shelf breakout, or have been sampled through small boreholes, yielding extremely limited spatial information. The recent breakout of the A-68 iceberg from the Larsen C ice shelf in the western Weddell Sea provides an opportunity to use a ship-based study to evaluate benthic communities and water column characteristics in an area recently vacated by a large overlying ice shelf.  The opportunity will allow spatial assessments at the time of transition from an under ice-shelf environment to one initially exposed to conditions more typical of a coastal Antarctic marine setting.   <br/> <br/>This RAPID project will help determine the state of a coastal Antarctic ecosystem newly exposed from ice-shelf cover and will aid in understanding of rates of community change during transition.  The project will conduct a 10-day field program, allowing contrasts to be made of phytoplankton and seafloor megafaunal communities in areas recently exposed by ice-shelf loss to areas exposed for many decades.  The project will be undertaken in a collaborative manner with the South Korean Antarctic Agency, KOPRI, by participating in a cruise in March/May 2018.  Combining new information in the area of Larsen C with existing observations after the Larsen A and B ice shelf breakups further to the north, the project is expected to generate a dataset that can elucidate fundamental processes of planktonic and benthic community development in transition from food-poor to food-rich ecosystems.

These crowds are composed of regular citizens. The potential of crowdsourcing has been proven in fields such as environmental sciences, transportation systems, and social sciences. Well-known examples include the mobile applications for the community-based traffic and navigation, which help drivers take the most efficient routes based on information provided by other drivers. Some other crowdsourced applications are the periodic measurement of environmental variables, monitoring of roads, traffic, and civil infrastructure. A crowdsourced system may be a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), which includes incentive mechanisms to encourage user participation in a given task. The typical elements of such a system are the data buyers, contributors and a platform for data storage and processing. The contributors may take the form of people who use their smartphones for data collection or autonomous vehicles with the attached sensors. These contributors have natural patterns of daily movement, which covers only specific paths in the target area at specific times. However, a sensing task may require data from all parts of the target area in different times to ensure representative sampling. Therefore, coverage in terms of both space and time may be critical for crowdsourced applications. This proposal addresses the problem of spatial and temporal coverage for sampling in a target area, in particular the coverage of isolated sub-regions where participants' density is very low. This problem is tackled by an incentive mechanism that dynamically assigns compensation for data collection in the sub-regions of the target area based on the density of the contributors in that sub-region. To achieve this goal, a sensing market is modeled using a game-theoretic approach. In the sensing market, a data buyer announces a task per sub-region and the corresponding compensation. Then, the interested participants who decide to visit that region, submit their current locations and final destinations as well as the amount of time they are willing to spend on the sensing task. Similar to any other market, the members of a CS market want to maximize their utilities. The contributors maximize their utility by strategizing their trajectories while data buyers maximize their utility by predicting the contributors' behavior and setting the optimal rewards per sub-region. <br/><br/>The resulting information of the proposed incentive mechanism may be leveraged by people and other rational participants such as autonomous vehicles to better plan their daily activities. For example, individuals can avoid environmental conditions that represent a risk for their health or change their daily commute to produce the lowest stress level. Other potential applications include autonomous vehicle scheduling and navigation, smart robots navigation and smart utilization of transportation resources. The proposed project will facilitate and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration among the disciplines of computer science, transportation engineering and environmental science. Specifically, interdisciplinary courses and laboratories will be developed while employing peer-to-peer Web technology, such as Wiki pages, to facilitate instant and direct access to ideas and data related to the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How does influence propagate in social networks? How do the utilization of transportation options and the cost of ridership in a city change during the day and throughout the week? How does knowledge evolve? Formulating these questions as programs is currently beyond the skills of most data scientists. Executing such programs poses tremendous efficiency challenges, especially for graphs with billions of edges, and with non-trivial evolution rates.  Much research and engineering effort today goes into developing sophisticated graph analytics and their efficient implementations, both stand-alone and in scope of data processing platforms. Yet, systematic support for querying and analysis of evolving graphs is still lacking. This support is urgently needed, due both to the scalability challenges inherent in evolving graph analysis, and to considerations of usability and ease of dissemination. This project will fill this gap by establishing the fundamental principles of effective modeling and efficient analysis of evolving graphs, and by making results available to the community of use in an open-source platform called Portal.<br/><br/>This project will build on the state of the art in temporal data management, making the principles and techniques that were developed over decades of research and practice in that domain available to evolving graph applications. The project will develop: (1) a data model for evolving graphs and an expressive compositional algebra; (2) an efficient implementation of the data structures and of the algebraic operations, together with any necessary algebraic primitives and physical representations / access methods, in scope of a distributed data-parallel framework; (3) a declarative query language that supports concise specification of sophisticated graph analysis tasks, and a query optimizer that generates efficient query execution plans; (4) a principled evaluation methodology of usability and efficiency, based on real and synthetic datasets and analysis tasks.  This project will impact research and practice in data management, by contributing novel representation, analysis and benchmarking methods for evolving graph data.  Results of this project will help incorporate sophisticated evolving graph analysis into larger applications, and will enable scaling up to modern volumes. The Portal framework will support computational and data scientists who work with evolving graphs in social network analysis, knowledge management and network traffic analysis. A prominent set of use cases for this work will come from data science for social-good applications, including urban homelessness and analysis of transportation utilization and cost in cities.

This eight-week summer research program is open to college juniors and seniors who are interested in learning quantitative methods and carrying out research on intriguing applications of math to their day-to-day lives. It encourages students from minority institutions and/or students from underrepresented groups who come from economically disadvantaged families as well as from local community colleges to apply. The summer program begins with four weeks of concentrated coursework on topics specific to mathematical and computational statistics, and theoretical biology at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level. The daily coursework is paired with coordinated computer labs and collaborative study sessions with graduate student teaching assistants and faculty present. Students are trained in leading computer software such as MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, Netlogo, and R. During the second half of the program the students are asked to take what they have learned and apply it to group research projects of their choice with help from mentors. These projects are written as technical reports and students give a research presentation on their work/results at ASU during the final week of the program. The students also create posters of their projects that they present first at ASU and then again at the national SACNAS Conference and the Joint Mathematics Meetings. In summary, the exciting MTBI environment generates innovative research projects, leads to the achievement of significant scientific results within a summer, and motivates undergraduate students to pursue higher studies.<br/>  <br/>The objectives of the MTBI Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates program are to encourage and facilitate the access to the successful completion of graduate studies by mostly underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate students at the interface of mathematics and life and social sciences. The MTBI summer program at ASU exposes undergraduates to scientific research by introducing them to methods in applied mathematics, training them on well-known modeling software and letting them address relevant questions in theoretical biology. The program faculty is composed of first-rate minority, non-minority and international researchers, both  male and female to teach, advise, and mentor MTBI students. All have active research programs. MTBI not only supports an environment in which high quality undergraduate research is recognized and expected but also provides opportunities for students to collaborate on their research with excellent researchers from around the country and world.

However, current methods to achieve cellular resolution are invasive (e.g., blood test or tissue biopsy), and non-invasive imaging modalities do not achieve cellular resolution. The principal goal of this Expeditions project is to develop computational imaging systems for non-invasive bio-imaging, deep beneath the skin, and at cellular-level resolutions. This project has the potential to fundamentally impact healthcare and medicine, by enabling live views of cross sections of human anatomy, simply by pointing a camera at any part of the body. This would put individual users at the center of their healthcare experience and make them true partners in their healthcare delivery. The health imaging devices that result from this project will act as an important pillar in the personalized medicine revolution. This research expedition also holds the potential to launch new healthcare paradigms for chronic disease management, pediatrics, low-resource healthcare, and disaster medical care. Beyond healthcare, making progress on the problem of cellular-scale deep-tissue imaging using light will push the frontiers of the fundamental problem of inverse scattering, which impacts numerous areas of science and engineering. The order of magnitude advances made in inverse scattering and imaging through scattering media will have significant cross-cutting applications in diverse areas such as basic science, consumer imaging, automotive navigation, robotics, surveillance, atmospheric science, and material science. Finally, projects with a single, easy-to-appreciate, and high-impact goal have the potential to inspire the next generation of scientists, attract diverse set of students driven by humanitarian and social causes, and become a platform for inclusion and innovation.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate new computational imaging systems, to non-invasively image below the skin at tunable depths, in highly portable form-factors such as wearables or point-of-care devices. The main challenge is that light scatters as it travels through the human body, and in this process, the spatial information from different points within the body gets mixed up. A new concept, Computational Photo-Scatterography (CPS), is being applied in this project in order to computationally unravel the scattered photons in an imaging system, and allow creation of sharp images and accurate inferences. Recognizing that the brute-force complexity of unraveling scattered photons is prohibitively high, the project uses a computational co-design framework that leverages advances by team members from multiple domains: programmable illumination and optics, image sensors, machine learning, inverse graphics, and hybrid analog-digital computing.  The project will use machine learning (ML) instead of physics-based de-scattering to speed up the solution of the underlying inverse problem. A combination of physics-based inverse graphics algorithms, and ML algorithms combining deep learning and generative modeling will be used to estimate tissue scattering parameters -  motion due to blood flow induces time-variation in tissue parameters, which makes solving the inverse scattering problem more difficult. The project will use ML to create fast but approximate estimators, which will serve as accelerators for inverse scattering. The development of new sensors, able to capture the data necessary to reconstruct the structure of the tissue deep below the skin, constitutes the most important contribution of the project. These systems and algorithms will have the potential to break the current resolution limits of noninvasive bio-imaging by nearly two orders of magnitude, enabling cellular-level imaging at depths far beyond currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will address the national demand for qualified STEM teachers in Arizona. This shortage is a result of two primary factors: the lack of qualified candidates entering the profession and the retention of qualified candidates who become teachers and leave the profession within two years. This Track 1 Noyce project will address this shortage by implementing a mentorship program to guide the development of new teachers at Title I schools in two high-need districts in the Phoenix, AZ region. Arizona State University will support this project through: (1) preparing 24 new highly qualified teachers (with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field) to become a certified K - 8 teacher while earning a Master's degree; (2) retaining middle school mathematics and science teachers through a three-year induction program; and (3) training teachers in teaching practices that are known to support STEM career paths for underrepresented groups (minorities and women). As part of the project, Noyce Scholars will be prepared to use curriculum materials that incorporate state-of-the-art engineering practices.  Scholars will use these materials in engineering summer camps for middle school students and their families.<br/><br/>Developing Resilient STEM Teachers for High-Need Middle Schools will provide one-year Noyce stipends to two cohorts of 12 students. The project will produce 24 highly qualified mathematics and science middle school teachers who can positively impact students in high-need schools. As a form of teacher development, Noyce scholars will teach in an on-campus engineering summer camp. Additionally, the project will include a teacher induction mentorship program focused on improving teacher quality through professional development. Through placement of expert teachers in high-need districts, the project has the potential to positively affect more than 3,600 students each year after the grant concludes. Middle school students will benefit by receiving a quality education from teachers who are trained to be leaders in STEM. With a quality classroom experience, students will be more likely to pursue STEM courses as they progress into high school and to acquire the knowledge needed to thrive in STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recognizing that the brute-force complexity of unraveling scattered photons is prohibitively high, the project uses a computational co-design framework that leverages advances by team members from multiple domains: programmable illumination and optics, image sensors, machine learning, inverse graphics, and hybrid analog-digital computing.  The project will use machine learning (ML) instead of physics-based de-scattering to speed up the solution of the underlying inverse problem. A combination of physics-based inverse graphics algorithms, and ML algorithms combining deep learning and generative modeling will be used to estimate tissue scattering parameters -  motion due to blood flow induces time-variation in tissue parameters, which makes solving the inverse scattering problem more difficult. The project will use ML to create fast but approximate estimators, which will serve as accelerators for inverse scattering. The development of new sensors, able to capture the data necessary to reconstruct the structure of the tissue deep below the skin, constitutes the most important contribution of the project. These systems and algorithms will have the potential to break the current resolution limits of noninvasive bio-imaging by nearly two orders of magnitude, enabling cellular-level imaging at depths far beyond currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organic molecule-based semiconductors have many potential applications, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and light harvesting photovoltaics (solar panels).  How the molecules come together to form materials is not well understood, in part because existing measurement tools are too slow to capture the fast formation events.  Professor Wong overcomes this problem by using a specialized laser system that is capable of rapid measurement. The measurement of properties that directly impact the function of a material will provide feedback for rational materials design, and possibly more efficient and economical LEDs and photovoltaics.  The graduate student researchers engaged in this project are gaining experience in a variety of disciplines, including physical chemistry, laser and optical instrument design, and computer simulations.   The concepts of instrument design are also being shared with UO undergraduate students and local community college students via a virtual instrument simulation program.<br/><br/>This project is focusing on the dynamics of exciton formation, singlet fission, and charge transfer processes in organic semiconducting materials.  Of particular interest are the photo-physical processes that occur during molecular aggregate formation. An in situ transient absorption spectrometer is constructed by using a tilted pump pulse to spatially encode its arrival time at the sample. A second laser pulse probes these excited regions simultaneously, thus measuring absorption at a range pump-probe time delays in parallel. The spectrometer is incorporated into a solution deposition apparatus for optical interrogation during thin-film formation.  A model of how molecular aggregation affects the rates of singlet fission and charge transfer processes is being developed. The production of molecular aggregates with designer properties is demonstrated by judiciously changing the environmental conditions during the aggregation process, informed by insights from the aggregation model. The scientific broader impacts of this work will be the extended application of transient absorption to non-equilibrium chemical systems. This is a valuable real-time diagnostic tool for understanding the physical phenomena that underpin chemical and materials synthesis, tightening the feedback loop and accelerating progress towards designer electronic materials. The measurements yield a deeper understanding of how molecular interactions impact singlet fission and charge transfer rates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Animal intelligence is composed largely of specialized abilities that respond to specific pressures in the environment. However, many recent discoveries suggest that non-specific, general intelligence, similar to IQ in humans, also evolves. Most hypotheses about the evolution of intelligence suggest that general intelligence evolves as a side effect of selection for more specialized cognitive abilities. In contrast, the Cognitive Buffer hypothesis suggests that general intelligence is directly favored by natural selection when animals are coping with novel environments. Urban environments are evolutionarily novel to most animals today, and present them with many new cognitive challenges. This work tests predictions of the Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis by presenting wild spotted hyenas living in rural, urban, and transitional habitats in Africa with a battery of simple tests, much like IQ testing in humans. Performance on each specific task in the test battery will be compared among hyenas in the three habitat types, but a general intelligence measure will also be calculated from the individual test scores, and related to the strength of natural selection acting in each habitat. This work will permit determination of whether or not the strength of selection on general intelligence varies among ancestral, historically urban and rapidly-urbanizing environments. Broader impacts include international training of students, working closely with film crews to create television documentaries, and production of a children's book on hyena research.<br/><br/>The evolution of intelligence represents one of the greatest challenges in biology. Animal intelligence is composed largely of specialized abilities evolving in response to specific selection pressures, but recent work suggests that domain-general processes also evolve. The Cognitive Buffer hypothesis posits that general intelligence is favored directly by natural selection to help animals cope with novel environments. Urban environments are evolutionarily novel to most animals, presenting them with many new cognitive challenges. Here, predictions of the Cognitive Buffer hypothesis will be tested in the context of urbanization by presenting a test battery, focusing on seven elementary cognitive abilities, to 175 wild spotted hyenas occupying rural, urban, and transitional habitats in Africa. Performance on each specific task will be compared among the 3 habitat types, but a psychometric factor-analytical approach will also permit statistical derivation of a general intelligence measure, g, for individuals within each habitat type, and elucidation of the structure of hyena intelligence. Because data are available in each habitat on survival and reproduction, the strength of selection on g can be compared among the three different environments. Comparing selection gradients on g among habitat types permits assessment of the strength of directional selection acting on general intelligence in each environment. This work permits determination of whether the strength of selection on g varies among ancestral, historically urban and rapidly-urbanizing environments.

Scientists also see the same actions in the Sun, the other smaller and larger planets in our Solar System, as well as in other stars and planets found orbiting other stars.  Rotation clearly affects the spread of heat, chemical compositions, and physical processes.  It can drive circulation on the large scales we see from planets to stars.  The ""Rotating Convection: from the Lab to the Stars"" meeting will bring together an international group of people who study different aspects of rotating convection to review the current state of this field, and plan future studies.  The conference will last five days and have talks and posters mixed with group discussions.  This conference will serve the national interest by promoting the progress of science when plans are made to coordinate future scientific studies of rotating convection to be most productive.  Funding will support the travel of early-career participants from the United States.<br/><br/>Rotation directly influences convection by affecting the transport rates of heat, chemical species, and angular momentum.  It can therefore drive large-scale circulations, and large-scale inhomogeneities. The interaction of rotation and convection is complex and takes different forms depending on the parameter regime considered (e.g. high momentum/heat transfer oceanic convection compared to intermediate atmospheric and planetary convection, to low stellar convection).  Understanding the complexity of fluid motions that derive from this interaction is a longstanding problem that can only be studied through a combination of experimental, numerical, mathematical and observational research.  The principal goal of this workshop is to identify fundamental questions to be addressed in rotating convection research, and develop a research agenda for the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Growing evidence for the persistence of agriculture through periods of population collapse and environmental change suggests that the transition to food production is a tipping point from which human populations cannot return, but at least one case study provides evidence to the contrary. The Fremont in the Basin-Plateau region of Western North America farmed maize for nearly a millennium, from about 1550-650 years ago (AD 450-1350), then abandoned agriculture and their farming villages a few centuries prior to European contact. Farming ceased earlier in some regions of the Fremont landscape than in others but by AD 1350 most of the characteristics of settlement pattern that identified the Fremont as an archaeological complex were no longer present.  At European contact groups living in the eastern Great Basin and on the northern Colorado Plateau had returned to mobile hunting and gathering. Reasons for both the origin and demise of Fremont farming have been hotly debated, but a consensus is lacking. This project will generate extensive data on diet, climate and demography in order to address the rise, spatiotemporal variation in reliance on maize and fall of the Fremont complex, which will serve as a model system to explore the dynamics that lead to agricultural collapse. <br/><br/><br/>Several approaches will be used to reconstruct the variables that likely determined the investment of Fremont populations in maize agriculture and their decision to return to foraging. Demography - the size and distribution of human populations - is one critical factor.  Summed radiocarbon dates from Fremont contexts will be used as a proxy for prehistoric population densities. Research has shown population growth puts pressure on wild resources and can be a driver of reliance on domesticates. Thus, variation in the size and structure of local Fremont populations may address variation in reliance on maize. Modeling agricultural suitability will further inform this work. Key climatic variables that affect maize productivity such as precipitation, growing degree days, soil moisture and soil chemistry are critical to the success of maize farming. Modern data will be temporally adjusted with tree-ring chronologies to reconstruct paleo-climate across the Fremont region. Finally the bone chemistry of a large collection of Fremont individuals will be analyzed to determine spatiotemporal variation in the dietary importance of maize.  Once all the data are assembled the relative influence of each factor will be evaluated. The resulting analyses will examine how an individual's reliance on maize agriculture varied as a function of each explanatory variable while holding time, space and other confounds constant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The findings will enhance caregivers' and educators' understanding of the impact of the everyday language environments encountered by bilingual children on their language development. <br/><br/>With multilingual schools and families becoming increasingly common in the US, children experience significant fluctuations in their language environments, both at home and at school. Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of the different linguistic environments on children's language development. To understand how language environment affects children's language abilities, the researchers will recruit Spanish-English bilingual children ages 6 to 9 to complete phonological and lexical production and perception tasks in English. Immediately prior to completing these tasks, children will be presented with stories in English, Spanish, or Spanish-accented English. Measures of phonological and lexical processing after each exposure type will be compared. The children will also complete language assessments in English and Spanish for a full language profile. Comparison of exposure effects on production vs. perception as well as comparison of changes at the word (lexical access) and sound (phonological) level will directly illustrate how language exposure affects language ability in bilingual children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the United States, the largest bilingual population consists of individuals from Hispanic backgrounds who speak both English and Spanish. The educational outcomes of Hispanic children lag behind those of their non-Hispanic peers. This achievement gap starts as early as the age of 3 years and persists well into the middle-school years. One of the most significant predictors of academic outcomes is vocabulary knowledge, yet we know very little about the process by which children actually learn words. Monolingual and bilingual children tend to come from distinctive learning environments, both socially and linguistically, and it is possible that they rely on different strategies when learning words. Hence, it is crucial to investigate how learning occurs in children who do not share the same learning environment. This research will help develop successful educational strategies and intervention techniques designed for young bilingual children, with the potential of narrowing the achievement gap. Furthermore, the findings will be useful to parents, teachers, and clinicians in suggesting how best to enable learning in all children. Theoretically, the project will enhance the understanding of language learning mechanisms and how they might be shaped by experience.<br/><br/>Research suggests that infants and children exploit social-pragmatic cues during language learning. However, prior work has primarily tested English-speaking monolingual children. Yet, because bilingual and monolingual children occupy distinct socio-linguistic environments, they may exploit such cues differently. In two experiments, the investigators will examine the use of verbal and non-verbal social-pragmatic cues in novel word learning in 4-5 year old English-speaking monolingual children and Spanish-English bilingual children. In all experiments, a visual world eye-tracking paradigm will be employed in a laboratory setting to assess learning. In Experiment 1, the investigators will examine the impact of eye-gaze (a social-pragmatic non-verbal cue) and speaker reliability (a social-pragmatic verbal cue) on word learning in bilingual and monolingual children. This will allow researchers to identify whether monolingual and bilingual children are differentially sensitive to verbal and non-verbal social cues during word- learning. The research project will also investigate the impact of multiple cues on word-learning. In natural learning environments, children are typically presented with more than one cue to help them learn words. For instance, along with social-pragmatic cues, children also readily use linguistic cues to support their word learning. While some studies in monolingual children have specifically investigated the interplay between social and linguistic cues, it remains unclear how the presence of multiple cues influences word learning in bilingual children. Thus, in Experiment 2, the researchers will examine the combined impact of mutual exclusivity (a linguistic cue) and eye-gaze on word-learning in monolingual and bilingual children. The findings will shed light on how linguistic and non-linguistic cues are utilized together by children during word-learning, and whether these cues are weighed differently by monolingual and bilingual children."

It is a central component of genetic material and cellular membranes and is integral to energy production and regulating enzyme activity. In the marine environment, P occurs as inorganic (Pi) and dissolved organic (DOP) forms; the availability and concentration of these different forms of P is an important control on marine phytoplankton growth. Marine phytoplankton are single-celled photosynthetic organisms and can be both prokaryotic bacteria and eukaryotic plants. While Pi is the preferred form of P for marine phytoplankton, in large regions of the oceans it is at such low levels that it restricts phytoplankton growth. In these regions, DOP is the most important P source. The composition of the DOP pool can generally be divided into two major groups: P esters and phosphonates. All marine phytoplankton are capable of using P esters to support growth; in contrast, phosphonates have only been shown to be an important source of P in the nutrition of bacteria to date. This project will determine the ability of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton to use phosphonates as a source of P for growth. Genomic analyses will determine the metabolic response of eukaryotic phytoplankton species to growth on phosphonates as well as the relevance of phosphonate use by natural populations. It is critical to understand the metabolic capabilities of phytoplankton which control marine nutrient cycling. In addition, the project is of great value in understanding the potential impacts of a changing ocean on phytoplankton growth. The project supports reseach opportunities for undergraduates from a local community college as well as hands-on enrichment programs for an afterschool program that serves a diverse student population. <br/><br/>Comprising up to 10% of the marine DOP pool, phosphonates have been shown to be a dynamic P pool both being assimilated and produced by marine photosynthetic bacteria. The ability of eukaryotic phytoplankton to supplement their growth with phosphonates remains vastly unexplored. Several eukaryotic phytoplankton species have been shown to use glyphosate, a chemically synthesized herbicidal phosphonate, as a P source; it remains unknown if open ocean eukaryotic phytoplankton can utilize phosphonates found naturally in the marine environment. Preliminary experiments suggest at least some eukaryotic phytoplankton are able to directly utilize extracellular phosphonates. This project characterizes the pervasiveness of phosphonate utilization within eukaryotic phytoplankton lineages and identifies the cellular underpinnings that support the acquisition of and growth on naturally occuring phosphonates. The project uses whole-cell transcriptomics and functional gene complementation assays, in addition to phylogenetic analyses, to understand the bioavailability of phosphonates and relevance of phosphonate utilization by natural eukaryotic phytoplankton populations. It is critical to understand the metabolic capabilities of phytoplankton which control marine biogeochemical cycles. This is especially important given the prediction that future oceans may become more stratified which could increase the importance of DOP, including phosphonates, in supporting phytoplankton growth."

This research develops a more principled understanding and approach to algorithm design that automatically accounts for sensitivity to parameter choice, robustness to noise, and other sources of uncertainty. This approach enables algorithms to be engineered in a way that guarantees performance and safety, which is similar to how airplanes, skyscrapers, and computer hardware are built.<br/><br/>Iterative algorithms may be viewed as dynamical systems with feedback. In gradient-based descent methods, for example, gradients are evaluated at each step and used to compute subsequent iterates. By treating algorithms as control systems, this research leverages tools from robust control (specifically: integral quadratic constraints, graphical methods, and semidefinite representation) to analyze and ultimately synthesize a variety of algorithms under different assumptions in an efficient, scalable, and systematic manner. This research also involves collaborative efforts in the areas of graph structure learning of gene regulatory networks and interactive machine learning, which serve to test and validate new algorithm designs."

As a result, CAM plants are increasingly being recognized as among the world's most important crops for food, fodder, fiber, and fuel, as well as being key drivers of ecosystem function in dry regions. CAM photosynthesis also stands out as an example of complex trait evolution, with over 60 independent evolutionary origins, and occurrence in more than 33 families of vascular plants. Exploiting the productive potential of CAM for human enterprise while protecting CAM plants in naturally occurring environments requires the integration of a broad range of biological disciplines. To promote this integration, this conference will bring together a diverse group of scientists to discuss the evolution, ecology, functional biology, genomics and engineering of CAM traits and species. The outcomes of the conference will be highly relevant for ongoing efforts to select traits in succulent CAM species used for food crops and biofuels, and for conservation and management of highly threatened arid, semi-arid, or tropical ecosystems in the face of rapid environmental change. Discoveries from the conference will be translated into outreach and broad dissemination to the public, policy makers, land managers, and the scientific community.<br/><br/>CAM photosynthesis was a leading topic in plant biology research in the two decades after its discovery in the 1960s. However, once the biochemical details of carbon flow in CAM photosynthetic pathways had been established, further progress in CAM research was dependent on application of molecular-genetic and phylogenetic, and isotopic approaches to investigate these metabolic adaptations.  In recent years, significant advances in molecular phylogenetics, high throughput sequencing, and isotopic physiology have reinvigorated CAM research and contributed to major new initiatives in CAM evolution, the development of novel C3 photosynthesis and CAM bioenergy crops, and the engineering of CAM pathways in non-CAM crop species for improved climate resiliency. These initiatives are now producing exciting results, and due to the overlapping nature of disciplines in the modern era of biology, they need to be presented in a forum where experts and students from across the research spectrum can consider their significance. This conference aims to accelerate this momentum by providing a forum for face-to-face interactions among a wide range of plant biologists. In doing so, the conference will accelerate the pace of discovery and promote synergistic interactions that will maximize the potential for highly novel, transformative discoveries with immediate significance towards commercial application and the conservation of natural ecosystems."

Similar to the first workshop (Konza Prairie - 2016), a solid grounding in scientific research in ecophysiology will be achieved on-hands training, collegiality and interactive data collection. A key need exists for broad training in ecophysiology, as many graduate students have limited exposure to diverse ecophysiology equipment, techniques, and data interpretation. Phys-Fest 2 will fill this need through mentored research, close interaction with faculty instructors, and evening activities designed to teach effective science communication skills. Phys-Fest 2 will be hosted by the Holden Arboretum, a species-diverse, mature deciduous forest near Cleveland, OH. Holden Arboretum contains a suspended canopy walk and an emergent tower, both of which provide an 'in-canopy experience' to workshop participants. Scheduling this workshop at Holden provides a unique scientific opportunity, insight into non-academic careers for students, and opportunities for public engagement with day visitors at the arboretum. <br/>	<br/>This workshop (Phys-Fest 2) will focus on plant ecophysiology and deviate from the typical conference format of short presentations and posters.  Here, participants will collaborate using replicate pieces of equipment to measure leaf-level and whole-plant physiology in four broad categories: plant hydraulics, gas exchange, fluorescence, and thermal/hyperspectral imaging. Measurements will be taken at multiple canopy heights on replicated trees in conjunction with a distributed instrument array including NDVI, PRI, leaf wetness, canopy temperature, and microclimate sensors. This strategy will facilitate in-canopy physiological measurements, such as monitoring the response of forest tree canopies to diurnal variations. These measurements will demonstrate fundamental ecophysiological canopy processes, provide direct linkages to gradients in canopy microclimate, and will be useful for scaling processes at sub-canopy dynamics in deciduous forests. The organization of Phys-Fest 2 is specifically designed to promote networking and meaningful interactions among participants. Two types of training in science communication in the evenings of day 2 and 3 will be held. Holden Arboretum staff will provide short workshops on engaging public audiences and in science outreach and policy. Using the information learned during this training, student participants will interact with Holden visitors during the day with the goal of engaging a public audience, and disseminating ecophysiology principles in forest canopy research. Finally, course accomplishments will be disseminated through four media outlets at the Holden Arboretum: social media, print, video, and on-site interpretative materials."

Evidence is rapidly mounting indicating that these co-occurring periods of precipitation deficit and warm temperatures are likely to increase over the next century and pose a serious threat to biodiversity and the critical services these ecosystems provide society. While the impacts of a warmer and drier future on these and similar ecosystems are expected to be severe, some species and ecological communities may be more vulnerable to these changes than others.  Understanding the factors that drive differences in vulnerability is one of the preeminent scientific and societal challenges of our time as this knowledge is essential for prioritizing conservation efforts and for identifying practical adaptation strategies that can conserve or enhance critical services these ecosystems provide society under changing environmental conditions.  To address this need, this project develops linked infrastructure at the UC Sierra Foothill Research and Extension Center (SFREC) that will allow researchers to (1) measure how exposure to drought and elevated air temperatures varies over time and across the topographically complex landscapes and (2) experimentally apply different levels of drought and air temperature to key plant communities and species that are critical drivers of services these ecosystems provide society. The infrastructure developed here not only allows multiple lines of new research around drought and warming impacts to be pursued but does so while greatly reducing start-up costs for researchers, thus overcoming a major barrier to greater participation in climate change research by students and scientists from underrepresented institutions.  This project also adds key capacity to expand K-12 STEM education and science content training for educators to diverse and rural agricultural communities in northern California having markedly less access to STEM and science education training opportunities than most areas in the state.<br/><br/>While the need to deploy an integrated framework for assessing species vulnerability to climate change is widely acknowledged, globally we have minimal field infrastructure that allows us to simultaneously assess impacts due to climate change exposure and impacts due to climate change sensitivity. To address this need, this project establishes linked research infrastructure distributed across the University of California Sierra Foothill Research and Extension Center (SFREC, http://sfrec.ucanr.edu/) that supports continuous measurements on local exposure to climate change and experimental assessment of multiple factors that drive variation in species sensitivity to these changes.  Specifically, this research infrastructure includes (1) a distributed wireless network of meteorological and hydrological sensors to measure and model how regional climate exposure is modified by topographic complexity and (2) a distributed field system for experimental manipulations of precipitation and warming that will provide researchers extensive ability to develop mechanistic understanding of factors (e.g. ecophysiological traits, genetic diversity, plasticity) and interactions (competition, biological invasions, soil microbial community) that ultimately drive variation in species and population sensitivity to climate change.  The wireless mesh system will be constructed using commercially available wireless technology and environmental sensors. This system also will allow future researchers the ability to add project specific sensors. For experimental manipulations of field conditions, experimental warming will be achieved using large (7 x 7 m) passive warming structures designed to minimizes airflow disruption and provide sufficient space for multiple experiments to be run simultaneously in a cost-effective manner.  Precipitation manipulations will be achieved using a polycarbonate roof system coupled to an automated precipitation redistribution system that will allow researchers to increase or decrease precipitation inputs relative to ambient inputs on an hourly basis. This infrastructure extends our current global research capacity by providing researchers an experimental framework to establish mechanistic and causal linkages between regional climate change and local changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function. This research infrastructure also provides an unparalleled ability to test and model conservation benefits of various biodiversity management tools and strategies. Ultimately this infrastructure should support major positive steps for biodiversity conservation in these and similar Mediterranean systems across the globe."

The technology for electronic devices has been on a rapidly rising trajectory since the 1960s with the ability to fabricate ever smaller silicon transistors (`Moore's Law'), with today's device sizes in the nanometer range. With the rise of nanotechnology, atom-by-atom quantum simulations of emerging materials are becoming increasingly important to reliably supplement the current experimental investigations. Modeling and simulations of atomic systems are essential to assist the everyday work of numerous engineers and scientists and can universally impact a wide range of disciplines (engineering, physics, chemistry, and biology) spanning the technological fields of computing, sensing and energy. This project will accelerate the development of quantum technologies and their impacts in the global economy. A new software will be produced to help capture many fundamental quantum effects which are increasingly important in nanotechnology for exploring and prototyping new revolutionary electronic materials and devices.<br/><br/>This project aims at developing and offering a new open source software, NESSIE, that can address the modern challenges encountered in material and device nano-engineering applications.  NESSIE will use the most cost-effective method to perform excited states calculations, the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), in conjunction with a novel combination of numerical algorithms and physical and mathematical modeling techniques.  NESSIE will be capable of performing excited-state TDDFT calculations using full-potential (all-electron) in real-space (using finite element) and real-time. A new hierarchical parallelization strategy will allow NESSIE to tackle unprecedented atomistic finite size systems at this level of theory. The outcome of this project will open new perspectives for addressing the numerical challenges in real-time TDDFT excited-states calculations to operate the full range of electronic spectroscopy, and study the nanoscopic many-body effects in arbitrary complex molecules and very large-scale finite-size nanostructures. It is expected that the NESSIE software and associated numerical components will become a new valuable new tool for the scientific community, that could be applied to investigate the fundamental electronic properties of numerous nanostructured materials.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

Participants work in teams of four under the supervision of the PIs. An experienced research mentor and a junior faculty member lead each team. The REU site at LU aims to increase research opportunities for students at institutions where undergraduate research opportunities are limited or nonexistent. By recruiting underrepresented minorities, veterans and community college students, students are empowered to pursue degrees in STEM and to transition to advanced study or careers in STEM. The benefits of participating in a structured research program extend beyond the technical knowledge that students gain. Students increase writing and oral communication skills and are exposed to professional development opportunities in attending conferences to present their work. Furthermore, the faculty advisors continue to serve as mentors for the students beyond the ten weeks of the program. Each year, many students transfer to LU after having completed two-year degrees at local community colleges. The REU site at LU creates an opportunity for participants from local community colleges to meet other STEM students who successfully made the transition to a four-year university. Finally, pairing experienced research mentors with less experienced co-mentors on each research project gives the co-mentors the tools necessary to establish or expand undergraduate research programs.<br/> <br/>The intellectual focus of this program is on interdisciplinary research at the crossroads of mathematics, statistics and computer science. In many applications, dimension reduction is imperative for efficient manipulation of massive quantities of high-dimensional data. Dimension reduction using matrix factorizations and graph theory can be used to ascertain the underlying structure of the data and to find correlations among the data attributes. Interest is increasing in the study of graph theory, singular value decomposition (SVD) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) due to applications in various research areas of mathematics and computer science. SVD and NMF are both unsupervised learning tools currently used in big data analytics.  REU participants will gain exposure to the challenges and opportunities associated with big data. Students are introduced to the three Vs of big data: Volume, Variety, Velocity. Volume refers to the sheer quantity of the data, Variety refers to the different types of data, and Velocity refers to the speed of processing the data.  Students are allotted the opportunity to participate in (1) theoretical research, with students investigating properties of graph theory, SVD and NMF to generate conjectures, prove theorems, and investigate existing algorithms; and (2) programming related research, with students performing experiments on matrix factorizations and graph theory and writing algorithms to process large data sets."

The purpose of this project is to leverage ongoing efforts related to science education and the current emergency and disaster recovery landscape in Puerto Rico. The Yale Ciencia Initiative, in collaboration with Ciencia Puerto Rico, working with the Department of Education of Puerto Rico will develop culturally relevant project-based science lesson plans that incorporate the disaster context that can be implemented both inside and outside of the traditional classroom. The project will allow displaced students to continue learning under the guidance of teachers, parents or social workers.  The project will train educators in the use of disaster-related problem-based lessons and assess project implementation and the impact of the lessons. The final outcome of this aim will be a lesson plan template and implementation guidelines for other jurisdictions faced by natural disasters. The project will result in enhanced infrastructure for education by developing tools and implementation guidelines that other jurisdictions may use to develop their own lesson plans in advance of natural disasters, so as to assure continuity of learning.<br/><br/>The project will assess implementation through observations and rubrics, surveys for parents, educators and students, and focus groups with each of these populations. To assess the impact of contextualized PBL lessons, the project will collect survey data, before and after the educational intervention, to measure changes in students' content knowledge, as well as in attitudes that are predictive of engagement in science learning. Results will be compared to matched control groups that receive either the standard curriculum, which are not contextualized to the disaster and that does not include PBL, or a PBL lesson plan that does not incorporate the disaster or the cultural context. At least 30 educators and 200 7th grade students will be exposed during the project period to the contextualized PBL lesson plan. The resulting feasibility analysis will inform other jurisdictions preparing their educational systems for natural disasters and provide evidence for the use of contextualized lesson plans that incorporate PBL in disaster recovery settings.

This research project collects time-critical, ephemeral data consisting of observations of erosion, sediment redistribution, and coral reef structure damage at Cane Bay on St Croix in the US Virgin Islands. This location was picked because it was at or near the center of both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria when they were at their maximum strength. It is also the location of another major hurricane strike (i.e., Hurricane Hugo) in 1989.  Data like that collected for the present project were also collected for Hurricane Hugo, allowing comparisons to be made and comprehensive modeling of the impact major storms have on carbonate production, bioerosion, and sediment export in a modern reef system.  Land and marine photographic images, as well as other data will be collected to provide high quality measurements of sediment removal by each storm.  These data, as well as historical data from Hurricane Hugo, will be used to model storm related sediment transport in the area over the past century. Broader impacts of the work include partnership with researchers at the US Geological Survey, production of an educational video based on overcoming reef-building misconceptions, and improving knowledge of the impacts of major storms on coral reefs which will help inform and improve reef management.<br/><br/>Carbonate production and carbonate cycling in modern reefs is due to a balance between the secretion of calcite by corals and coralline algae and the breakdown and removal of the physical structure of the reef by biological and physical means. While the biologically related components of this equation have been intensively studied, a missing part of the equation is sediment export, a parameter that is presently poorly understood and quantified.  A key set of data documenting sediment export in a reef system was collected in Cane Bay at St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands just after Hurricane Hugo. Additional data was collected during fair weather conditions on the island for comparison. This new project collects similar data to that collected after Hurricane Hugo. It will allow a quantitative comparison between the various storms and an assessment of sediment export. Goals will be to characterize sediment removal from the northwestern insular shelf of St. Croix. Modeling, to be carried out by a collaborator from the US Geological Survey, will be focused on determining the relative roles of bottom shear versus storm surge during major storms in exporting sediment from coral reefs in tropical carbonate systems."

Because of limited laboratory availability, the cosmogenic nuclide community has remained small. Providing a national sample preparation facility will catalyze the inclusion of new and different scientists, increasing the number and diversity of projects involving these isotopes - a catalyst for transformative research. Supporting a community facility for sample processing and research training has numerous different broader impacts. 1) It directly addresses a current bottleneck in cosmogenic nuclide studies: the extraction of 10Be and 26Al from rock, soil, and sediment that precedes isotopic measurement. 2) It broadens participation by providing open access to a state-of-the-art processing facility for the many students and faculty who do not have such a facility at their home institutions. 3) The outreach program, supported by the experience of Semken and Whittaker, goes directly to faculty and students at institutions serving minority communities and the seed grant program brings faculty/student teams from Historically Black Colleges and Universities as well as Tribal Colleges to the laboratory for meaningful collaboration and hands-on training. 4) Technician support will provide for research training in isotopic clean lab methods for students, researchers, faculty, and young investigators in a variety of geoscience disciplines through lab residencies, lab consultancies, a yearly training course for those wishing to adopt these methods or start a similar laboratory."

These products from the workshop will be disseminated to a wide variety of stakeholders, so as to inform public policy and enhance national security.<br/><br/>The proposed interdisciplinary workshop addresses the human aspect of cybersecurity in organizational settings, focusing both on employees with cybersecurity-relevant jobs (e.g., analysts working in Security Operations Centers) and the end-users of technology (i.e., essentially all employees in the organization). Workshop attendees will include organizational science researchers and practitioners who study topics relevant to cybersecurity at the micro (e.g., individual employee or end-user), meso (e.g., team or multiteam system), and macro (e.g., organization or country) levels of analysis, along with cybersecurity researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The absence of direct communication between the organizational sciences and cybersecurity has arguably harmed both fields, and so the workshop will focus on cross-pollination, identification of roadblocks, and the joint development of a future agenda. To that end, the workshop will include keynote presentations (targeted at various levels of analysis), interdisciplinary reactions to keynote presentations, panel discussions, information sharing exercises, breakout groups on specific interdisciplinary topics (e.g., insider threat, collaboration in multiteam systems), and semi-structured networking opportunities. The workshop aims to identify and overcome barriers to collaboration between the organizational sciences and cybersecurity, identify avenues for external funding as well as various publication outlets for research at the intersection of the two disciplines (e.g., high-impact organizational science journals, high-impact cybersecurity journals, ?translational? outlets aimed at disseminating organizational science research to cybersecurity policymakers and managers), and develop a concrete agenda for future interdisciplinary research. Deliverables from the workshop will include: (1) a website containing the workshop program, speakers? (and other attendees?) names and biographical information, background reading on the organizational sciences and cybersecurity, and copies of workshop presentations; (2) an overall technical report (also made available on the workshop website) delineating the conclusions, recommendations, and research agenda generated during the workshop; and (3) a press release and a flier containing information and a link to the overall report."

The reservoir consists of previously unknown iron superoxides which could suddenly release its excessive oxygen.  In the present project, the team will further explore the different types of iron superoxides, the conditions for the explosive oxygen release, and the consequences of oxygen eruptions.  The sporadic eruptions provide a new, unified mechanism for answering questions on a list of seemingly unrelated past events that occurred during Earth's 4.6 billion years history and shaped the present living planet.  Where did the oxygen in the air come from?  What caused the mass extinctions that killed the dinosaurs and ushered in the mammals?  What was the driving force that pushed all continents to merge into a single supercontinent, and later pulled the supercontinent apart to form individual continents?   From understanding the Earth's Past and Present, we may gain insights into the Earth's Future.<br/><br/>The investigator's recent discovery of high P-T iron superoxides, FeO2 and FeO2Hx with the pyrite-type Pa3 structure has suggested potential paradigm changes in mineral physics and geodynamics of the deep lower mantle.  The team proposes to further investigate the high P-T mineral physics properties of the superoxides, including the incorporation of other major components such as MgO2, AlO2 and SiO2 into the Pa3 iron superoxide, its interactions with silicate bridgmanite and post-perovskite, its electronic and magnetic spin states, and its valence states of iron and oxygen. The team will search for other stable structural types in addition to Pa3 for firon-based superoxides with the apparent Fe oxidation state >3+, and determine their elastic wave velocities for comparison for comparison with seismic observations in the deep Earth.  The team's previous research suggested the existence of a massive amount of oxygen-rich patches at the core-mantle boundary. This research will investigate the metastability of such giant oxygen reservoirs, and the consequences when the stored oxygen is released, particularly the resulting geodynamics of the super plate tectonics that may explain the origin of merging and rifting of supercontinents."

This project reinforces the mandate of the Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, which called for stakeholders, including Native American activists, to act together to ""declare to preserve, protect and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice and develop"" these languages. The TCUs in Montana have been offering Native American language courses to encourage the sustainability of Native languages. This collaborative project between the University of Montana (UM) and one of the TCUs, Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC), aims to support the efforts of Montana TCUs by enriching language instructors' and activists' experience through an exchange of ideas and knowledge with instructors and training partners from UM, CDKC and the American Indian Language Institute (AILDI) of the University of Arizona. The proposed activities foster a positive relationship across institutions and will help identify current issues that may become the focus of future training workshops. The project's broader impacts include building the capacity of language documentation programs at Montana TCUs, enhancing STEM education through technology utilized in language documentation and education, and serving underrepresented populations who often have difficulty accessing training due to the remoteness of their locations. <br/><br/><br/>This collaborative project seeks to cultivate common ground for communication across institutional boundaries. It aims to promote the idea that an increased knowledge of linguistics, as a science, can benefit TCU programs related to indigenous language sustainability as well as the idea that linguistics can benefit from community input. A collaborative team, consisting of four language activists from indigenous communities and four non-indigenous linguists, will travel to TCUs in Montana to learn about the current efforts and future goals of their language activities. The collaborative team will then host meetings with selected participants from the Montana TCUs for further discussions. Results will be compiled from these activities feed into future documentation research and indigenous language education through workshops that will circulate the information back to indigenous communities. These project outcomes have the potential to implement indigenous ways of knowing into language documentation projects."

These systems are interrelated: The semantic memory system allows one to construct representations of the features and details making up an experience, and the episodic memory system binds these semantic representations to a unique spatiotemporal context. Despite the critical importance of these systems, there are major gaps in our knowledge regarding the nature of the neural and cognitive mechanisms that allow us to flexibly access, manipulate, and retrieve episodic and semantic memories.  With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Sean Polyn of Vanderbilt University is developing the Control of Semantic and Episodic Memory (CSEM) model, a novel theory designed to explain the how the brain mediates episodic and semantic memory search and retrieval.  This project will involve undergraduate students, graduate students, and research staff at every level: data analysis, theory development, and presentation of results to the broader scientific community.  The project's objectives will make key contributions to infrastructure for research and education, as the simulation software and the database of anonymized behavioral and neural data will be distributed to the broader scientific and academic community via the internet, along with a repository of behavioral and neural analysis tools.<br/><br/>The CSEM model is a computational model of human memory designed to test hypotheses regarding the specific mechanisms carried out by particular brain regions in the storage, retrieval, and flexible use of semantic and episodic memories.  The research team will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity as participants perform semantic and episodic memory tasks.  Multivariate pattern analysis, representational similarity analysis, and advanced statistical techniques will be used to characterize the representational structure and dynamics of neural activity, supporting the development of functional, mechanistic computational models of the cognitive system of participants as they perform the memory tasks.  The first study examines neural signals for evidence of an integrative contextual representation that allows information about recent experiences to persist in neural activity patterns.  The second study examines how the neural system constructs a retrieval cue that can be used to target particular sets of memories.  The third study examines how memories interfere with one another during retrieval, and the mechanisms used by the neural system to resolve this interference.  Data from these experiments will support the development of a unified theoretical framework to understand how general-purpose executive processes control the semantic and episodic memory systems to give rise to flexible, goal-directed behavior."

Shannon's influential ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication"" established such a theory for one-way communications. Coding theory has subsequently produced computationally efficient methods for reliable data transmissions over unreliable channels. While error correcting codes have transformed communication technologies over the decades, modern communication settings often go beyond one-way transmissions and instead require many interleaved rounds of interactive communication. The development of interactive equivalents of good error correcting codes for such modern systems is a much harder task, which has attracted attention recently and witnessed encouraging initial successes. This project will further advance the fundamental questions underlying possibilities, limitations, and theoretical underpinnings of reliable interactive communication in the presence of noise, and thus contribute to a solid mathematical and computational theory of reliable interactive communication. The project also has a strong educational component which supports several initiatives to stimulate undergraduates, graduate students, the scientific community, and the general public through education and outreach.<br/><br/>The project attacks a diverse set of ""classical"" questions, such as determining the fundamental communication rate limits for error correction in interactive communications, and explicit constructions of tree codes, a powerful but elusive type of online code.

The objective of this proposal is to request partial support for the registration and accommodation expenses of US-based undergraduate and graduate students traveling to the conference. Beginning in 2010, PECI is the oldest annual, student-run IEEE international conference about power and energy technology. PECI is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) approved conference and technically co-sponsored by PES, PELS, and IAS professional societies of IEEE. The conference is organized by the IEEE PES/PELS/IAS Joint Graduate Student Chapter at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is advised by faculty in the Power and Energy area of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. PECI has become a perfect place in the Midwest for industry and academic researchers to discuss future power and energy topics such as renewable energy, machines for electric transportation, smart grid reliability, security of cyber-physical systems, and power electronics for emerging technologies. Thus, the intellectual merit of PECI are the student focused nature of the conference, from the student led steering committee to all technical and presentations, and the high quality publications and posters from student attendees.<br/><br/>PECI was founded for three key reasons: 1) to provide students in the Midwest an opportunity to participate in a research conference, 2) to provide a forum for students in the Midwest to present their research progress and outcomes for feedback to a technical audience of peers, industry professional, and 3) to inspire both undergraduate and graduate students to pursue careers in power and energy STEM fields. While PECI impact has expanded over the last eight years to include participants from around the world, we have retained our Midwest roots and mission statement by encouraging participation from Midwest universities, especially undergraduate students for the poster session. By attending PECI students benefit from closer interactions with experts, professors, and industry professionals and<br/>potentially receive advice or mentorship for their future career. In addition to student technical presentations and posters, students also learn about the mega-trends in power and energy and cutting edge research from three industry leaders and experts, who deliver keynote presentations and tours of a local microgrid research facility and new ECE building. Moreover, the importance of pursuing a career in power and energy is highlighted by a special careers session involving industry presentations about research demands for power and energy companies and a panel discussion regarding what a career in industry, a national laboratory, academia, or government would entail. With support from NSF, PECI seeks to reach a wider audience with this impact by encouraging participation from a larger number of<br/>Midwest and US schools, especially schools that do not offer a Ph.D. degree."

However, about 2% of the general population have deficits in face perception. What makes some people good at recognizing faces and others bad at it? Scientists have identified brain regions involved in perceiving faces. Additionally, behavioral research has shown that face perception is ""holistic"". That is, perception of the whole face, all at once, is better than that of individual facial features. However, it is unknown what neural computations underlie this holistic perception of faces. Because holistic face processing requires spatial integration across face parts, the goal of the research is to examine whether such processing relies on spatial integration by neurons in face-selective brain. Additionally, the research will determine if individual differences in neuronal spatial integration predict individual differences in face recognition ability. This project is expected to impact society in several ways. Understanding the neural mechanisms of face recognition could improve measurement, enhance diagnosis, and ultimately improve the wellbeing of individuals with deficits in face recognition. The project will also develop research infrastructure by making publicly available the new methods and computational tools for measurement and modeling of brain responses. The project intends to advance the participation and education of women in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The research program addresses important gaps in knowledge by leveraging cutting-edge neuroimaging and computational approaches, including population receptive field (pRF) modeling and hierarchical convolution neural networks, together with behavioral measurements of face perception. In particular, the pRF approach offers a unique opportunity to operationalize and measure spatial processing and attentional effects on face perception in a computational framework. Thus, the research (i) will advance understanding of the neural mechanisms of face perception by quantifying spatial aspects of face processing and attention, (ii) will uncover how spatial integration of different face stimuli, under differing attentional demands explains individual differences in face perception abilities, and (iii) will generate an up-to-date and neurally accurate computational model of human face perception."

This project reinforces the mandate of the Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, which called for stakeholders, including Native American activists, to act together to ""declare to preserve, protect and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice and develop"" these languages. The TCUs in Montana have been offering Native American language courses to encourage the sustainability of Native languages. This collaborative project between the University of Montana (UM) and one of the TCUs, Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC), aims to support the efforts of Montana TCUs by enriching language instructors' and activists' experience through an exchange of ideas and knowledge with instructors and training partners from UM, CDKC and the American Indian Language Institute (AILDI) of the University of Arizona. The proposed activities foster a positive relationship across institutions and will help identify current issues that may become the focus of future training workshops. The project's broader impacts include building the capacity of language documentation programs at Montana TCUs, enhancing STEM education through technology utilized in language documentation and education, and serving underrepresented populations who often have difficulty accessing training due to the remoteness of their locations. <br/><br/>This collaborative project seeks to cultivate common ground for communication across institutional boundaries. It aims to promote the idea that an increased knowledge of linguistics, as a science, can benefit TCU programs related to indigenous language sustainability as well as the idea that linguistics can benefit from community input. The indigenous languages spoken in Montana are from four different families: Algonquian, Salishan, Siouan, and Kootenai, an isolate. Because of this, the proposed project will advance our knowledge of the linguistics of these languages. The project is also innovative in applying collaboration among linguists and community language researchers, a method known as Community Based Research (CBR) in a way that fosters and enhances our understanding of these languages' phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax and semantics through the lens of traditional environmental knowledge and ethnosciences. A collaborative team, consisting of four language activists from indigenous communities and four non-indigenous linguists, will travel to TCUs in Montana to learn about the current efforts and future goals of their language activities. The collaborative team will then host meetings with selected participants from the Montana TCUs for further discussions. Results will be compiled from these activities feed into future documentation research and indigenous language education through workshops that will circulate the information back to indigenous communities. These project outcomes have the potential to implement indigenous ways of knowing into language documentation projects."

The field of marine silicon isotope biogeochemistry is about 20 years old having been pioneered by the lead investigator in the early 1990s. The UC Santa Barbara facility remains the only capability for such measurements in the U.S., although the field has grown to where over 18 laboratories from 8 countries are now measuring silicon isotopes in marine systems. Silicon isotopes are a powerful tool for understanding the marine silica cycle and the contribution of plankton with silica shells to marine biogeochemistry. Variations in isotopes of silicon in biogenic silica and in dissolved silicic acid are used to constrain net silica production rates in the modern ocean. Measurement of the isotopic composition of diatom frustules and of sponge spicules recovered from marine sediments are used to reconstruct the history of diatom productivity in surface waters and changes in deep water silicic acid content over geologic time. <br/><br/>For this second-generation silicon isotope system, the investigator is partnering with Nu Instruments, Ltd. to create a commercially available instrument based on the Nu Perspective isotope ratio mass spectrometer, with a custom inlet system resulting from modifying the Nu Carb and/or the Eurovector pyrolysis inlet system(s). The two main goals for the new instrument are 1) to increase sample throughput by a factor of four and 2) to lower sample size by an order of magnitude. To meet these goals both acid and thermal decomposition of silicon fluorides to generate the analyte SiF4 gas will be explored. The second generation system should be faster, as or more precise, and much easier to use for the novice compared to the original prototype and compared to alternatives like MC-ICP-MS. Success in this development will restore routine measurements of isotopes of silicon from marine systems in the United States. By partnering with Nu Instruments, a commercial instrument will be produced that will be available to all at relatively low cost compared to competing technologies like MC-ICP-MS, contributing to national and international capacity building in this field. Finally, achieving higher sample throughput would both lower costs and facilitate the ability to make the proposed instrument available to others, further accelerating progress in the field."

Consequently, lack of iron in large regions of the global ocean limits phytoplankton growth and commercial fisheries. Ocean acidification (OA) is the ongoing decrease in seawater pH due to the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. OA is predicted to affect seawater chemistry by reducing the concentration of carbonate ions. Carbonate ions are required for  phytoplankton to take up iron from their environment, which suggests that OA might inhibit iron nutrition. Further complicating the scenario, pH changes affect iron chemistry in seawater, such that OA is predicted to shift the relative abundance of various forms of iron. But despite these expectations, little is known about how the changes in ocean chemistry due to OA will impact the availability of iron to phytoplankton. Changes in phytoplankton iron uptake and associated growth rates would likely have large effects on how the ocean captures atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This has important consequences for ecosystem productivity and for global cycles of critical chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their chemistry. This project aims to help us understand how shifts in seawater pH and the chemistry of dissolved inorganic carbon will affect both iron uptake rates and iron acquisition strategies in the laboratory and in natural communities. This project also includes development of educational outreach activities which target primary school students in the areas of microbiology, biogeochemical cycles and current global change topics. These science outreach activities  benefit from collaborations with the following San Diego-based organizations: the League of Extraordinary Scientists and Engineers (LXS), The Birch Aquarium at Scripps (BAS), and The Ocean Discovery Institute (ODI).<br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the differential sensitivity of diatom iron acquisition strategies to changes in seawater pH and carbonate chemistry. Ultimately a more thorough and detailed mechanistic understanding of diatom iron uptake pathways will facilitate a much-improved ability to forecast the impact of anticipated changes in ocean pH and inorganic carbon chemistry on rates of iron uptake by diatoms. This critical biogeochemical issue is addressed through trace metal clean manipulation experiments incorporating state-of-the-art analytical methodology to probe phytoplankton cellular physiology and biogeochemistry in laboratory cultures and natural communities. In the first year, laboratory experiments with a model pennate diatom leverage a collection of targeted knockout transgenic lines to evaluate the substrate specificity and relative importance of distinct iron assimilation pathways under a range of pCO2 and iron availability conditions. Additionally, quantitation of mRNA and proteins for key diatom iron assimilation pathways in natural communities in the Southern California Current further clarify the relative importance and sensitivity of distinct iron assimilation pathways in relation to pCO2 and iron availability. In year two a Lagrangian study of iron uptake rates and associated mRNA and protein abundance is performed on upwelled high pCO2 water over the course of offshore advection. Additionally, the investigators are conducting mesocosm experiments using naturally elevated high pCO2 seawater as well as laboratory experiments on multiplex knockout lines.  Year three is dedicated to data analyses and overall project synthesis. Overall aims of the research activities include, 1) development and validation of a refined conceptual model of iron uptake in key marine phytoplankton and subsequent utilization of the model to characterize the sensitivity of distinct iron uptake pathways to the effects of ocean acidification, and 2) determination of the effects of acidification on iron uptake, and quantification of the relative contribution of distinct iron acquisition pathways in high pCO2 phytoplankton communities."

Discovering how infants develop the ability to categorize is important for advancing scientific knowledge about early cognitive development. This project will analyze the rapid development of categorization that occurs in mid- to late-infancy. Multiple measures will be used to determine: (1) the effects of attention on categorization in early development, and (2) areas of the brain involved in categorization in infancy. This research will illuminate how attention influences infant categorization and will use neuroimaging to identify areas of the brain involved in categorization at different ages in infancy. This project will have broader impacts by providing insight into long-standing debates about the basic nature of categorization throughout the life-span and by providing many important training opportunities. Several graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in developmental cognitive neuroscience, which will increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Additionally, the research team will actively engage in community outreach to increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science.  <br/><br/>This project has three major aims that will be addressed in two experiments on 6-, 9-, and 12-month-old infants. Aim 1 is to determine the effects of attention on infant categorization of faces and objects, using simultaneous measures of heart rate changes associated with attention and electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of attention and categorization. Aim 2 is to determine how learning conditions affect infant attention and categorization, by varying the learning conditions infants experience prior to EEG testing. Aim 3 is to determine which areas of the brain are involved in categorization in infancy, using computational modeling of EEG data.  Infants are expected to show enhanced brain activity involved in categorization during attention, and areas of prefrontal cortex are expected to be involved in categorization only in older infants with more advanced categorization skills."

Macaulay2 is developed through an ""app"" model: individual researchers write packages with specialized capabilities that are then made available (for free) through Macaulay2's website, for use by other researchers. These workshops provide a setting where groups of less-experienced programmers learn to develop high quality packages with the support of Macaulay2's core developers. In addition, the workshop includes professional development activities for early career mathematicians, including opportunities to speak on their own research, and panel discussions on jobs and developing a research program. More details are available at the conference website: https://juliettebruce.github.io/M2-Wisconsin-2018/ <br/><br/>At last count, Macaulay2 had 119 built-in packages, many of which have been developed at workshops such as this. The capabilities of Macaulay2 grow in response to research interests of the community, and this allows Macaulay2 to quickly create and distribute resources for new and emerging fields. At this workshop, the packages to be developed will include: FI-modules, Schur functors of complexes, the simplex method, random monomial ideals, and more. In addition, this meeting will be unique among Macaulay2 workshops because it will engage researchers from number theory and applied algebra, which have not been traditional foci of Macaulay2's development. This presents a unique opportunity for Macaulay2 to develop capabilities that will be useful to those communities."

Among the effects of continental drift are the formation of mountain belts and volcanoes, the spread and extinction of biodiversity, and changes in climate at the local and global scales. Continents on Earth may move via one of two fundamentally different processes. The more familiar mechanism, known as plate tectonics, involves the differential motion of continents relative to each other. The second, less well-understood process is known as true polar wander (TPW), wherein the entire Earth rotates as a single unit such that the location of the present pole is transferred to a lower latitude. Theoretical studies show that TPW should have strong effects on the global environment, including regional sea-level changes of >100 m and drift of land surface across multiple, contrasting climate zones. However, the cause, rate, and even the existence of large-scale TPW events in Earth history have been controversial. Here we will measure the magnetism of rocks from the Late Jurassic (~165-150 million years before present) and pursue theoretical geodynamical computations to characterize the motion of the Earth during this most recent proposed episode of TPW. The results will have important implications for understanding the drivers of observed sea-level and climate changes throughout geologic time and for elucidating a fundamental process by which the global geography of the Earth evolves.<br/><br/>This project is divided into two closely coupled parts that use complementary techniques to understand Jurassic TPW. First, the investigators will collect paleomagnetic rock samples from the La Negra Formation of Northern Chile and the Chon Aike province of Patagonian Argentina to quantify the position of continents during the 165-150 million year ago (Ma) interval, which has been identified by previous studies as the most recent time interval of potentially large amplitude (about 30 degrees) TPW. These rock units represent the most continuous deposits of igneous rocks from the candidate TPW interval, which implies the highest likelihood of recovering high precision paleogeographical information using paleomagnetic techniques. As part of this experimental component of this project, the team will collect samples for geochronological analysis using Ar-Ar and U-Pb in zircon techniques, which would provide more reliable rates of motion during this time span. Second, they will simulate the polar wander of the Earth using existing geodynamical code that accounts for the motion of mass anomalies in the mantle and lateral variations in the lithospheric strength of the Earth. A second, coupled geodynamical code will compute the expected changes in regional sea-level caused by the TPW motion. Combined with experimental data, these models will narrow the range of possible drivers of Late Jurassic TPW and evaluate its potential effect on records of climate and sea-level."

Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies."

Total organic carbon and pyrogenic carbon (i.e. derived from burned biomass) will be measured in these samples and compared with quantities of these components in water of these streams prior to the fire, and in streams of adjoining watersheds not affected by the fire. The objective of these measurements is to determine the influence of fire on the supply and composition of dissolved organic matter to the ocean. In particular, the investigator wishes to know whether dissolved pyrogenic carbon will be exported to the ocean as this is a controversial scientific subject. If dissolved pyrogenic C is as abundant and mobile as recent studies suggest, it may have a strong impact on marine chemistry, long-term C cycling and associated climate changes and pollutant transport. On the other hand, if pyrogenic C is not detected in the creeks draining these burned watershed in amounts greater than that of the unburned watersheds, biogeochemists will have to question the methods currently used as markers for fire-produced organic matter. Another important impact of the project will be to provide the opportunity for a graduate student to add a field component to his dissertation research on dissolved pyrogenic carbon.<br/><br/>While knowledge of the properties of pyrogenic solids has increased in recent years, there has been relatively little study of the properties and cycling of pyrogenic dissolved organic matter. The method most commonly used for pyrogenic dissolved organic carbon (pyDOC) analysis involves the oxidation of condensed aromatic constituents into smaller, quantifiable monomers (i.e., benzenepolycarboxylic acids or BPCAs).  Using this method, it has been suggested that pyDOC represents a constant proportion of riverine DOC globally (~10% pyDOC/DOC). This conclusion is problematic since one would expect this ratio to vary with regional climate and burning regimes. It may be that all these previous measurements were made in fairly large rivers, i.e. large watersheds, so the effects of fire have been hidden by other variations in biomass growth, precipitation etc. Also, pyC may be continually released from charcoals made during past fires. The Thomas fire of December 2017 provides an ideal scenario for detecting and characterizing pyC export from terrestrial to marine systems. There are several short-run creeks draining coastal catchments along the Santa Barbara Channel that have small watershed completely within the burned area, and similar creeks in several adjoining watershed that saw no fire for the past 60 years due to fire suppression. The investigator also has access to water samples that have been in storage from these creeks taken prior to the Thomas fire. There is probably no better scenario for detecting indisputable evidence for, or against, the claim of significant export of pyrogenic C to the ocean, as well as quantifying that export flux if it exists."

That is, given that the phonetic motivations for a sound change may be present in multiple phonological environments (the adjacent sounds), why is the change observed in one environment and not the others? This project will address this question through an examination of /s/-retraction, an ongoing sound change in American English in which /s/ is pronounced as /sh/ in /str/ words (such that 'street' is pronounced as 'shtreet') but rarely in /spr/ and /skr/ words ('scream' is not pronounced as 'shcream' and 'spree' is not pronounced as 'shpree'). The results of this project will most directly influence the scientific understanding of /s/-retraction narrowly and sound change and its initiation and propagation more broadly, but can potentially contribute to developments in related fields and industries. By examining individual variation, these findings may offer insights into first and/or second language acquisition and may aid in the development of speech recognition systems that are faster and more accurate for a greater number of users, especially those with non-standard accents.<br/><br/>This project will examine participants' production and perception of /s/ in these environments in order to better understand the observed asymmetries in /s/-retraction. For this project, participants will listen to auditory prompts containing /s/ in different phonological environments corresponding to visually presented images, and in turn give oral instructions for the computer to select the correct image. This design has two important components: firstly, it is a lexical decision task, meaning that the participant has to select the best meaning (represented by the images) given the possibly ambiguous or unexpected acoustic signal (auditory instructions). Secondly, the task encourages phonetic accommodation, the process by which a speaker begins to sound more like their interlocutor (the model talker giving instructions), which can provide insight into how sound changes propagate across a speech community. Throughout the experiment, three simultaneous measurements will be collected: audio recording, ultrasound imaging of the tongue, and eye gaze tracking. Ultrasound imaging will elucidate the varying articulations of /s/ in different phonological environments and will also provide novel evidence for the articulatory reality of phonetic accommodation. Eye gaze measurements will provide information about listeners' use of /s/ variation in real time. These measurements will be collected simultaneously in order to examine the relationship between participants' production and perception of /s/ in these environments."

It fills a research gap by focusing on extreme heat in rural and agricultural communities. Extreme heat events are a risk to public health, livestock, crops, and economies. This study will examine two different approaches to rural adaptation to extreme heat. While rural communities in each place face similar climate-related challenges, there are crucial differences in the roles that rural landowners take within environmental and climate change governance. This study will compare the extreme heat adaptation measures that are taking shape in two places to understand how national and state-level policies interact with local cultures and values to create distinctive approaches. The study will lead to recommendations and best practice examples that will be of interest to emergency planners, policy makers, local governments, and rural residents. <br/><br/>The research uses an interpretative and comparative case study approach, focusing on two regions.  Data will be gathered to answer the following research questions: 1) What factors are shaping the extreme heat adaptation policies in each region? 2) How do local knowledge and social orders shape the implementation of climate adaptation programs that are developed on the regional/national scale? 3) What role do and could local actors play in shaping the response strategies to environmental hazards, such as heat, and their implementation ? and how can their stronger involvement as community leaders strengthen these solutions? Data collection will involve participant observation of public meetings and hearings, an analysis of public records and publicly available materials/data, and interviews. Interviews will be conducted with three different categories of participants: regulators and policymakers (such as policy analysts, adaptation program coordinators, public officials), scientists and agricultural professionals, and rural residents (such as local community leaders, advocates, participants in public meetings). The results of this investigation will make a novel contribution by revealing how the problem of extreme heat is being addressed in rural communities that have locally-specific challenges and priorities."

Advanced lithium batteries for vehicles and energy storage could improve domestic energy security, but their use is mainly limited by undesirable chemical side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface.  This project seeks to fundamentally understand the reactions at this interface during battery operation.   This fundamental understanding will help resolve the issues of battery stability and overall battery performance. The education and outreach activities associated with this project are to (i) provide hands-on experience to high school students and middle school students, (ii) engage undergraduate students in cutting-edge research activities with strong emphasis on the involvement of underrepresented students in STEM and (iii) provide innovation and entrepreneurship exposure to graduate students.<br/><br/>While Li-S batteries have been extensively explored, many aspects of the mechanisms of polysulfide redox reactions at solid/liquid electrolyte interfaces remain unclear. In the absence of detailed mechanistic understanding, rational design of electrode architectures has been difficult. The technical objective of this project is to map the temporal and spatial evolution of polysulfide speciation during the charge/discharge process in a Li-S battery through use of in-situ scanning electrochemical microscopy methods coupled with Raman spectroscopy (SECM-Raman). The research program is underpinned by two guiding hypotheses; (1) measuring interfacial properties will allow for mechanistic elucidation of (electro)chemical reaction pathways and provide information on kinetics of polysulfide dissolution-disproportionation-precipitation and (2) elucidating the reaction mechanism will control the electrochemical interface and thereby polysulfide-shuttle with an appropriate material design. The successful completion of the project is expected to (i) enhance fundamental understanding of interactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface at the nanoscale level with high spatiotemporal resolution using a new analytical tool, (ii) map the interaction of polysulfides with the electrode surface and with electrolyte solvents under transient conditions with a high temporal resolution,  and (iii) define the role of catalysts and the rate-limiting step in the overall polysulfide redox process to assess superior performance of materials for Li-S batteries.

This impacts almost every field of modern human life, such as health care, military applications, smart cities, transportation, networks, etc. To quickly analyse and organise such huge amounts of data, one needs to develop space and time efficient algorithms, that accelerate the search for information while minimising memory requirements. This project aims to develop space-efficient similarity filters, which quickly filter out queries that have very little similarity from the records existing in the database. This has applications in security, databases, machine learning, file systems, vision, pattern recognition, compression and networks. Apart from the targeted impact of these applications to society, this project also aims at producing the next generation of researchers and promoting under-represented groups in science and technology. Minority undergraduate and high school students will be involved in this project. Queens College, CUNY is a diverse institution, representing a wide range of ethnic minorities and has 28% Hispanic students. In an effort to engage more undergraduate students and women in research (Queens College has roughly 56% female students), the PI plans to offer a new course that develops an understanding of approximate membership and similarity search data structures in the setting of big data.<br/><br/><br/>Similarity searching is a fundamental problem in this context, where a massive data of records needs to be organised so as to answer quickly queries of the form: given a record, is it similar to some record in the data? Similarity search, modeled as near(est) neighbor search (NNS) is an important and well-studied problem with numerous applications: Given a set P of n points lying in some d-dimensional metric space, the goal is to preprocess P so as to return for a given query point q the point p in P that is closest to q. Exact versions of this problem are hard to solve, and all solutions to the approximate version of the problem require superlinear (more than nd) space. This space usage is prohibitive for many big data settings, where not just n, but d could be huge (e.g., the number of pixels in an image). This project is aimed at developing the theory and applications of Similarity Filters, which are decision (yes/no) based data structures. Given a query q, a (c, r)-similarity filter always returns yes if q is within a distance r of some input point, and returns no with a small error probability (thus some false positives are allowed) if all input points are at least cr away from the query. Recent results from the researcher shows that such filters can be built with sublinear (asymptotically less than nd) space. The project takes on two tasks: 1) to understand the approximation factor-space-query tradeoff for similarity filters, developing tight upper and lower bounds, especially in the sublinear space regime, and 2) to develop I/O efficient Similarity Filters and nearest neighbor data structures, akin to quotient or cascade filters for the approximate membership problem (where the in-RAM Bloom Filter is the standard data structure, used in many networking applications). The overarching goal is to use similarity filters on RAM in conjunction with a disk-based data structure: faraway queries will be filtered quickly, and nearby queries will have their neighbor(s) returned following a slower but cache friendly search. The availability of such a two-layered space-and-time-efficient data structure will greatly boost the scope of applications when the amount of data is massive, especially in databases, networks, security and machine learning."

This doctoral dissertation project will investigate fundamental questions about the role of human mitochondrial (mtDNA) variation in human evolution by focusing on mitochondrial metabolism and its association with infection risk. Different mtDNA lineages vary in the extent of their energy production and corresponding amounts of damaging reaction oxygen species (ROS) created by this process. The levels of ROS may create different thresholds for the development of health problems associated with mitochondrial damage. The results of this study will provide insights into the role of adaptation in human energy metabolism and the biological trade-offs involved with human-pathogen evolution. This project will support graduate and undergraduate training in molecular anthropological methods, and the findings of this project may inform public health research focused on disease risk in modern human populations.<br/><br/>The researchers will assess whether mtDNA lineages are associated with increased or decreased cancer risk in women infected with human papilloma virus. Samples for genetic analysis of mtDNA lineage and viral typing will be obtained from women in the Philadelphia area. Demographic and health variables will be incorporated into a logistic regression model to assess the effect of mtDNA lineage. The relationships among geographic variants of the two most common high-risk types of human papilloma virus, cervical cancer precursors, and mtDNA lineage status will be further examined to explore possible host-virus co-evolution."

Einstein's general relativity, which is currently our best description of gravity, is fundamentally incompatible with quantum mechanics.  It is therefore imperative that we subject gravity to the most stringent tests available. Lunar laser ranging (LLR), in which short laser pulses launched from a telescope are bounced off reflectors placed on the moon by U.S. astronauts and Soviet landers, has for decades produced some of the leading tests of gravity by mapping the shape of the lunar orbit to high precision. Since 2006, an experiment called APOLLO (the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation) has been collecting the best LLR data in the world, in terms of both data volume and precision. In 2016, an upgrade allowed APOLLO to guarantee accuracy at the millimeter level - the first time this capability has existed anywhere.  This project will capitalize on this new capability.  Besides its fundamental impact to all areas of cosmology, this project has a strong footprint in training students and in communicating the excitement of science to the public.<br/><br/>This effort seeks to collect the first-ever set of millimeter-accurate LLR data using APOLLO.  Besides continuing to collect the most accurate LLR data ever obtained, this involves developing techniques to calibrate APOLLO range data against the newly-installed absolute calibration system and to characterize APOLLO performance and systematic errors.  Additionally, site geodetic measurements will be collected by an on-site superconducting gravimeter and a nearby global positioning system station, incorporating these data into the LLR analysis in order to constrain motion of the ground."

As such, the impact of extratropical climate on tropical climate has remained largely unexplored. The goal of this project is to investigate the extratropical impact on tropical climate with the focus on quantifying extratropical influences of tropical climate and its variability. The project will use a novel modeling approach called Regional Coupled Data Assimilation (RCDA) approach, which combines coupled data assimilation with coupled climate dynamics, to assess and understand the extratropical climate impact on tropical climate for the real world. In RCDA, observations in the extratropics are assimilated in climate models while the tropical ocean-atmosphere processes remain fully coupled. This allows the quantitative assessment and understanding of the extratropical impacts on both tropical climatology and tropical climate variability, such as ENSO. The research team will also explore the extratropical impact on the tropical bias in coupled general circulation models. <br/><br/>The funded research represents a systematic study of the extratropical impact on tropical climate and tropical climate variability that combines coupled data assimilation with coupled climate dynamics.

Consequently, lack of iron in large regions of the global ocean limits phytoplankton growth and commercial fisheries. Ocean acidification (OA) is the ongoing decrease in seawater pH due to the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. OA is predicted to affect seawater chemistry by reducing the concentration of carbonate ions. Carbonate ions are required for  phytoplankton to take up iron from their environment, which suggests that OA might inhibit iron nutrition. Further complicating the scenario, pH changes affect iron chemistry in seawater, such that OA is predicted to shift the relative abundance of various forms of iron. But despite these expectations, little is known about how the changes in ocean chemistry due to OA will impact the availability of iron to phytoplankton. Changes in phytoplankton iron uptake and associated growth rates would likely have large effects on how the ocean captures atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This has important consequences for ecosystem productivity and for global cycles of critical chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their chemistry. This project aims to help us understand how shifts in seawater pH and the chemistry of dissolved inorganic carbon will affect both iron uptake rates and iron acquisition strategies in the laboratory and in natural communities. This project also includes development of educational outreach activities which target primary school students in the areas of microbiology, biogeochemical cycles and current global change topics. These science outreach activities  benefit from collaborations with the following San Diego-based organizations: the League of Extraordinary Scientists and Engineers (LXS), The Birch Aquarium at Scripps (BAS), and The Ocean Discovery Institute (ODI).<br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the differential sensitivity of diatom iron acquisition strategies to changes in seawater pH and carbonate chemistry. Ultimately a more thorough and detailed mechanistic understanding of diatom iron uptake pathways will facilitate a much-improved ability to forecast the impact of anticipated changes in ocean pH and inorganic carbon chemistry on rates of iron uptake by diatoms. This critical biogeochemical issue is addressed through trace metal clean manipulation experiments incorporating state-of-the-art analytical methodology to probe phytoplankton cellular physiology and biogeochemistry in laboratory cultures and natural communities. In the first year, laboratory experiments with a model pennate diatom leverage a collection of targeted knockout transgenic lines to evaluate the substrate specificity and relative importance of distinct iron assimilation pathways under a range of pCO2 and iron availability conditions. Additionally, quantitation of mRNA and proteins for key diatom iron assimilation pathways in natural communities in the Southern California Current further clarify the relative importance and sensitivity of distinct iron assimilation pathways in relation to pCO2 and iron availability. In year two a Lagrangian study of iron uptake rates and associated mRNA and protein abundance is performed on upwelled high pCO2 water over the course of offshore advection. Additionally, the investigators are conducting mesocosm experiments using naturally elevated high pCO2 seawater as well as laboratory experiments on multiplex knockout lines.  Year three is dedicated to data analyses and overall project synthesis. Overall aims of the research activities include, 1) development and validation of a refined conceptual model of iron uptake in key marine phytoplankton and subsequent utilization of the model to characterize the sensitivity of distinct iron uptake pathways to the effects of ocean acidification, and 2) determination of the effects of acidification on iron uptake, and quantification of the relative contribution of distinct iron acquisition pathways in high pCO2 phytoplankton communities."

Interpretability helps human experts ascertain whether machine learning systems, trained on technical objective functions, have sensible outputs despite unmodeled unknowns. For example, a clinical decision support system will never know all of a patient's history, nor may it know which of many side effects a specific patient is willing to tolerate. An important challenge, then, is how to design machine learning systems that both predict well and provide explanation.  Within this broad challenge, this work develops techniques for domain-targeted interpretability, finding summaries of high-dimensional data that are relevant for making decisions.  The proposed work focuses on healthcare applications, where interpretable models are essential to safety.  However, the project aims to produce foundational learning algorithms applicable to a range of scientific and social domains.  The developed methods will be tested on real problems in personalizing treatment recommendations and prognoses for sepsis, depression, and autism spectrum disorder. Thus, the successful completion of the work will impact both interpretable machine learning and clinical science.  All software developed in the course of the project will be freely shared.  The educational component of the proposed work will educate early elementary students about the impact of statistics in medicine and educate policy-makers and legal scholars on how a right to explanation might be regulated in the context of machine learning, such as clinical decision support systems. PI Doshi-Velez also engages high school students, undergraduates, women, and researchers from underserved areas in her lab.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed work addresses a specific challenge common in scientific settings: domain-targeted interpretability. In many scientific domains, unsupervised generative models are used by domain experts to understand patterns in the data, but as the dimensionality of data grow, the most salient patterns in the data may not be relevant for the specific investigation. For example, a psychiatrist may find the strongest signals in the data from his patient cohort come from diabetes and heart disease, which may not be relevant for choosing therapies for depression.  The proposed work leverages synergies in explaining domain-relevant patterns in the data and performing well on domain-relevant tasks to achieve domain-targeted interpretability. It defines a task-constrained approach to domain-targeted interpretability and develops essential inference techniques, develops extensions to sequential decision making, and defines extensions to improve downstream task performance while retaining interpretabilty.  While there is a large body of work on making unsupervised learning models also useful for downstream tasks, none of these approaches truly manage the trade-offs between providing an interpretation of data and task performance. The proposed work addresses these shortcomings to make domain-targeted interpretability and task performance synergistic goals, and proposes a number of innovations to solve the proposed objective. Innovations include combining an existing rich literature on inference traditional unsupervised models with modern inference techniques and directly searching for dimensions or patterns relevant to the downstream task."

A quick eyebrow frown from a student will inform the teacher of possible confusion. A tilt of the head may show doubt during negotiation. A patient's smile dynamics can even predict their future recovery. This project will build innovative technologies to allow computers to understand subtle nonverbal behaviors of human users. The main novelty of this project will be in its capacity to learn the inherent variability between individuals on how nonverbal behaviors are expressed. The same emotion can be expressed very differently by different people. A nonverbal signature is how a specific person gestures visually when talking with other people. By recognizing these nonverbal communicative behaviors such as facial expressions, head gestures and eye contact, computers and mobile devices will be able to better understand the user's emotions and affective states. In mental health treatment, the developed technologies have the potential to change how doctors assess disorders with new behavioral objective measures and possibily to predict eventual relapse for the patient. For researchers and animators of virtual characters (e.g., movie studies), the nonverbal signatures will enable an ""a la carte"" selection of the virtual human nonverbal signature that best aligns with the character's profile and personality. In education and online learning, the student's nonverbal signature will help to assess engagement and perceive affective states related to success in learning.   <br/><br/>This project will advocate a novel paradigm for learning visual representations of human nonverbal behaviors: a major focus on intra-personal variability followed by analysis of group structures and eventual learning of visual representations generalizable across the population. The research methodology will be motivated by well-studied concepts of idiosyncrasy in nonverbal behavior expressions. The project will introduce the concept of nonverbal signatures which are low-dimensional computational representations of an individual's nonverbal behaviors contextualized by the verbal content and affective context. This project will address four fundamental research challenges: (1) personalized nonverbal embedding -- learning computational representations that summarize the individual variations in nonverbal appearance, (2) learning nonverbal signatures -- contextualizing the nonverbal behaviors with verbal and affective cues to learn more effective representations, (3) signature portfolio analysis -- discovering structure, prototypes and idiosyncrasy from a collection of nonverbal signatures, and (4) generalized nonverbal representations -- learning generalizable nonverbal representations able to adapt to new individuals.

Some jobs have relationships with people at the core of their work where these relationships require an emotional connection between workers and their charges.  Teachers, therapists, primary care physicians, even prison guards each depend on relationships in service to a larger goal: children learning, patients healing, prisons secure. Connective labor captures the relational work between practitioner and recipient, using their emotional connection to produce an outcome.  Existing research documents the importance of work involving relationships for valuable outcomes in arenas from schools to hospitals; these proven impacts of connective labor make its scarcity, uneven distribution or unreliable performance a social problem. Yet its emotional nature resists efforts to make it more systematic or automated. This research will provide new information to policymakers and the public about connective labor: its variation, its value, and the costs and benefits of making it more systematic, scaling it up, or delivering it by non-human agents. The project will also contribute to ongoing public debates and policy deliberations about automation and work involving relationships, by providing a new visibility for connective labor and the kind of standards and technology that support its excellence. <br/><br/>The goals of the project are: to distill the common practices and principles that comprise connective labor, for practitioners as well as the program administrators and artificial intelligence (AI) engineers who would systematize their work; investigate how workers experience different kinds of systematization, from checklists to robotics; and evaluate how such systematization affects connective labor. Research includes 95 in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations with connective laborers in fields focused on security and/or control, e.g. police; with low-wage workers in home health care; and with what might be called systematizers, e.g., administrators. The results of the study will document characteristics of different kinds of connective labor, outline the risks and rewards of the various ways these are systematized, and explain differing stances towards this work."

Among the effects of continental drift are the formation of mountain belts and volcanoes, the spread and extinction of biodiversity, and changes in climate at the local and global scales. Continents on Earth may move via one of two fundamentally different processes. The more familiar mechanism, known as plate tectonics, involves the differential motion of continents relative to each other. The second, less well-understood process is known as true polar wander (TPW), wherein the entire Earth rotates as a single unit such that the location of the present pole is transferred to a lower latitude. Theoretical studies show that TPW should have strong effects on the global environment, including regional sea-level changes of >100 m and drift of land surface across multiple, contrasting climate zones. However, the cause, rate, and even the existence of large-scale TPW events in Earth history have been controversial. Here we will measure the magnetism of rocks from the Late Jurassic (~165-150 million years before present) and pursue theoretical geodynamical computations to characterize the motion of the Earth during this most recent proposed episode of TPW. The results will have important implications for understanding the drivers of observed sea-level and climate changes throughout geologic time and for elucidating a fundamental process by which the global geography of the Earth evolves.<br/><br/>This project is divided into two closely coupled parts that use complementary techniques to understand Jurassic TPW. First, the investigators will collect paleomagnetic rock samples from the La Negra Formation of Northern Chile and the Chon Aike province of Patagonian Argentina to quantify the position of continents during the 165-150 million year ago (Ma) interval, which has been identified by previous studies as the most recent time interval of potentially large amplitude (about 30 degrees) TPW. These rock units represent the most continuous deposits of igneous rocks from the candidate TPW interval, which implies the highest likelihood of recovering high precision paleogeographical information using paleomagnetic techniques. As part of this experimental component of this project, the team will collect samples for geochronological analysis using Ar-Ar and U-Pb in zircon techniques, which would provide more reliable rates of motion during this time span. Second, they will simulate the polar wander of the Earth using existing geodynamical code that accounts for the motion of mass anomalies in the mantle and lateral variations in the lithospheric strength of the Earth. A second, coupled geodynamical code will compute the expected changes in regional sea-level caused by the TPW motion. Combined with experimental data, these models will narrow the range of possible drivers of Late Jurassic TPW and evaluate its potential effect on records of climate and sea-level."

Grotesque visuals are frequently used in persuasive messages to depict dire need and influence concern for the welfare of others. Yet, little is known about the potential for disgust to motivate prosocial behavior. Increasing reliance on the goodwill of private citizens to mitigate social ills, and the important role persuasive messages play in motivating such behavior, heightens the need for inquiries into the effects and potential consequences of persuasive strategies employing visceral emotion. In addition to informing our understanding of the persuasive potential of disgust, this research contributes to basic knowledge about how moral action is motivated within individuals by exploring the interaction of emotive and cognitive factors.<br/><br/>Emotion research has often connected disgust to anti-social judgments and rejection behavior. Disgust inductions in these studies are, however, usually incidental or irrelevant to the decision task. In contrast, integral emotion inductions, such as the depiction of disease in a persuasive appeal, are triggered by the decision situation and are relevant to the decision task. Therefore, integral disgust may have different effects on message processing and behavioral outcomes. This research explores processes by which disgust may trigger prosocial responses. A key features of these controlled experiments include the use of the classic ""dictator game"" to measure behavior and social judgment tasks to explore potential unintended consequences of disgust in the context of prosocial persuasion. <br/>A first experiment tests the assumption that disgust is insensitive to context by examining information processing effects when disgust cues are used in a prosocial persuasive message (integral emotion) compared to when disgust cues are not connected to the decision-making context (incidental emotion). A subsequent experiment compares the differential effects of grotesque versus clean portrayals of need and tests for a sleeper effect of disgust. Whereas, study 1 addresses the question of whether persuasive arguments may alter emotional appraisals, study 2 examines whether these responses change over time."

The recent proliferation of ESM promises to create better opportunities for generative collaborations, yet organizations struggle to establish fully active systems and reap the promised benefits.  Following the paradigm of persuasive system design, this project aims to build and evaluate a feedback system, the Cyberinfrastructure for Smart Innovation (CSI). The CSI extracts near real-time data from groups inside the ESM, visualizes their social dynamics and activities, and suggests actions beneficial to their generativity. Research will be carried out in three phases: Phase 1: Create a fundamental understanding and predictive models of distinct forms of generative collaborations and their effectiveness through the algorithmic curation and statistical analysis of six years of ESM archival data from the partner organization, Steelcase Inc.; Phase 2: Develop a suite of design guidelines for the CSI using formative and summative user-centered research methods; Phase 3: Evaluate the causal impact of the CSI on generative collaborations, through quasi-experiments within real-world innovation teams at Steelcase and self-reported evaluations with a sample of its client organizations. <br/><br/>Enterprise Social Media represent an essential research context given the innumerable anecdotal claims about the merits of ESM for generativity, but there is a pronounced lack of scientific research validating such claims and explaining when and how these merits occur. This research project aims to make five major intellectual contributions: (1) Improved understanding of the multilevel antecedents of generative collaborations in ESM; (2) Expansion of existing organization science literatures by providing unobtrusive, mixed-method, and sociotechnical insights into processes of generative collaborations; (3) Extension of extant ESM research on the actual impact of these systems; (4) Production of the proposed persuasive feedback system (CSI) intended to foster improved ESM-based generative collaborations; (5) Rigorous empirical testing of the causal effect of the CSI on generativity in real-world groups. An integrated education and research program will include a new research seminar where students will work to adapt the CSI for improving the effectiveness of group work in problem-based learning settings, thereby creating a second, non-industry testbed for the CSI and enabling the discovery of fundamental theoretical principles that abstract from generative collaboration to learning contexts."

Imagine using genomic data and clinical traits to accurately predict  risk for preterm birth early in gestation, or a college student's risk for future heart attacks, and tailoring preventative measures to the specific risk mechanisms. This research addresses a core theme of machine learning methods applied to scientific data: how to robustly and efficiently build predictive models using complex hidden structure in high dimensional data with limited numbers of samples, as is common in genomic and biomedical data. This proposal addresses a number of fundamental questions: How to use correlation among features to share strength across limited numbers of samples? How to test for causality of an observation in a cell on disease? How to encode biological structure in nonlinear functions? These fundamental questions in applied machine learning and statistical genetics will be addressed through the creation of hierarchical models and methods for computationally tractable analyses. These projects will enable recovery of genomic signals with predictive ability essential for personalized medicine.  The PI also plans active engagement with underrepresented minorities in computer science and making publicly available software.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop computationally tractable structured hierarchical models to find complex signals in genomic data that are hidden to current methods that will be used to build predictive models using existing genomic study data, and to use these predictive variants to precisely quantify disease risk for each patient. Success of these goals impacts personalized medicine, enabling a complete understanding of the genetic regulators of disease and making individual-specific disease risk prediction and treatment a reality. Although linear models have been used to analyze scientific data for 125 years, these methods assume unlimited availability of samples and simple linear structure, and fail to recover variants with more complex associations. In genomic data, predictive signal is often compositional, including linear, sparse, low-rank, or nonlinear structure. This proposed research will drastically shift current scientific data analysis by developing efficient methods that recover predictive genetic variants with complex effects. This research is organized around three integrated projects. 1) High-dimensional correlations. Current methods for correlation do not exploit multiple, correlated traits to improve power to find relationships between two high-dimensional sets of observations. The PI will develop computationally tractable models and robust inference methods for structured latent variable models in the presence of substantial observation noise. 2) Sparse, nonlinear regression for prediction by exploiting nonaddictive effects. Standard predictive models for genomics assume that associations are sparse and additive across predictors; nonlinear terms are not regularized appropriately. The PI will develop a predictive model that robustly recovers variants with additive and nonadditive effects. 3) Causal inference to study the mechanism of genetic regulation of disease. Current models of causal inference in genomics make unrealistic assumptions and fail to exploit modern machine learning approaches to nonlinearity, regularization, and approximate inference. The PI will develop a hierarchical model for causal analysis to pinpoint the cellular mechanisms of disease."

This will make it possible to know the concentration of several heavy metals at any given time so that treatment chemicals used to remove those metals can be metered precisely.  Current treatment methods typically rely on infrequent sampling of wastewater streams and time-delayed, labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Without the ability to measure continuously, wastewater treatment is adjusted based on periodic averages and estimated peak discharges.  To reduce the risk of regulatory violation, most wastewater treatment systems use twice the volume of treatment chemicals than might otherwise be needed.  With the ability to measure metal concentrations continuously and automatically, wastewater treatment can be controlled in real time, cutting treatment chemical costs, solid waste costs and measurement labor costs by more than 50%.  Continuous measurement also reduces the risk of regulatory violations by > 90%, in turn reducing the potential costs of remediation and compliance as well as improving environmental conditions for the general public.     <br/><br/>The key outcome of Phase I research was the successful development of 15 new chemosensors permanently bound to a substrate, each with a unique response to zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel and tin. In Phase II, responses from an array of chemosensors will be fully characterized with a prototype instrument developed for commercial use in different industrial environments.  With that instrument, a mathematical model will be constructed to accurately convert sensor responses into scientific units of measure for multiple dissolved metals. The lower limit of detection for existing sensors ranges from 5 ppb to 50 ppb.  In parallel with analytical modeling work, chemosensor synthesis work continues to lower the limit of detection to 1 ppb, extend sensor life beyond 6 months, and broaden the portfolio of sensors to improve metal selectivity.  In the future, this new class of bonded chemosensors may be extended to determine the concentration of phosphates and many other species that are currently sampled occasionally and measured with lab instruments.  For applications where continuous measurement is important, this unique family of chemosensors offers great potential for real-time process control in a variety of industrial applications."

This five-day meeting and the associated Research Seminar brings together researchers to present results and engage in discussions on the cell and circuit properties of thalamocortical interactions, and build on these to explore their roles in cognition and behavior and how their dysfunction manifests in disease. This conference represents a rare opportunity for neuroscientists interested in thalamocortical interactions to exchange new results, hypotheses, and ideas at many levels, from cellular through systems to cognitive and clinical. With respect to broader impacts, this meeting will benefit the larger community in multiple ways. First, it will help train and inspire the next generation of scientists by exposing students and postdoctoral fellows to exciting science and scientists. Second, special emphasis will be given to junior faculty. Finally, a concerted effort will be made to recruit scientists from under-represented groups and targeted mentoring sessions will help the junior scientists in their career paths.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this meeting derives from its small size, which promotes interactions between participants, and the assembly of many top scientists whose research spans thalamocortical interactions across multiple sensory modalities, emphasizing the commonalities. This combination leads to fruitful comparative analyses, raises new questions about underlying mechanisms and often leads to new collaborations. By maximizing both formal discussion and informal interactions, the Gordon Conference and Research Seminar will highlight exciting new developments that have implications both for a basic understanding of the emergent properties of neural circuits as well as pathologies that involve thalamocortical disruptions. This is especially timely because this field has been expanding significantly with the recent appreciation that the thalamus plays an ongoing and critical role in cortical functioning."

The researcher takes up the questions by looking at the what it means to reconstitute a place, not just as a physical location but as site where people can once again feel at home. In the wake of multiple disasters that have torn people from their homes and damaged communities throughout the United States, people are asking if they can return, if they should return, if indeed there is a community to return to. It is critical that policy makers and social scientists better understand what it will take to put people's lives back together, not just as households but also as communities. <br/><br/>The research will be carried out by University of Kentucky anthropology doctoral student, Pathmanesan Sanmugeswaran, who is supervised by Dr. Mark Whitaker. The research takes a comparative design approach.  The researcher has identified two post-disaster communities in Sri Lanka. One community was totally destroyed and the inhabitants are returning to rebuild after 26 years, and the other was physically damaged and social disrupted but nonetheless remained intact. This contrast in an otherwise similar socio-cultural and geographic environmental context provides a scientifically useful and rare experimental opportunity that would not be available in the United States, although the results will be generalizable to many other contexts. Data will be gathered through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and cultural mapping. Sampling will be structured to represent the full range of socio-cultural variation, including caste, gender, and age. Particular attention will be paid to how traditional notions of community, which centered around combined ideas of community and religion, are remade in the two contrasting post-disaster situations."

Students pursuing associates degrees in biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, and engineering will be supported while at MDC.  Through program activities, including mentoring, the students will be encouraged to transfer to an upper-division baccalaureate program, and provided support for that transition. STEM-Mia will support students with GPAs of at least 3.0 who are enrolled full-time at MDC. In addition to scholarships, the program includes the following high-impact practices: undergraduate research experiences; advising and mentoring by STEM faculty; implementation of academic pathways and early alert systems; year-round STEM colloquia; and extensive assistance in transfer to four-year institutions. STEM-Mia will broaden the participation of Hispanics and other underrepresented students, including first generation-in-college students in STEM fields and careers. In addition, it will present a model for other two-year Hispanic-Serving Institutions that are interested in increasing student participation, retention, and success in STEM. More importantly, the project will help address the critical STEM workforce crisis, by graduating increasing numbers of well-trained and competent professionals in these fields.<br/><br/>The Leadership Team will conduct a curricular redesign of two interdisciplinary courses focused on transferring to four-year institutions and STEM content infused with social cognitive career theory (SCCT)-based interventions.

Machining is a critical approach for the production of high-technology and high value-added products that impact most industries. However, the machine tool industry is under significant international pressure; the hollowing out of machining capability represents a direct threat to national security as well as economic well-being of the United States. The purpose of this workshop is to identify fundamental research needs that will support a resurgence of the US machine tool and expansion of domestic machining capacity. The workshop will bring together key thought leaders from academia, industry, government agencies, trade organizations, and national laboratories for an intensive meeting to identify and prioritize research needs in machining and machine tools.<br/><br/>The workshop will last 1.5 days, and will include thought leaders from industry, government and academe to address the future of machining and machine tools as well as the research accomplishments to date and the basic research needs. Invited speakers will make presentations regarding the future needs for machining capabilities and capacities. Further invited speakers will address funding perspectives, both in terms of needs and the prognosis for funding support. Speakers will be recruited from industry, academe, and government in order to obtain a broad perspective. The objectives of the workshop are to: (1) review the state-of-the-art in basic research in machining; (2) examine future prospects of machine tools and machining; (3) share perspectives on machining from funding agencies such as Department of Defense (DoD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and NSF; (4) identify needs, gaps, and challenges facing the machining and machine tools topic areas, for both existing products and new enabled technologies; and (5) formulate recommendations for basic research initiatives."

This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed."

Advances over the past decades have now enabled one major component of this question to be rigorously addressed by modern neuroscientific tools. That is, how does the brain give rise to perceptual awareness of sensory stimuli? In particular, there has been a concerted effort by neuroscientists and psychologists to unravel the neural bases of visual perceptual awareness. Currently, one major open question is whether regions in the human frontal cortex directly contribute to the content of visual perceptual awareness or, alternatively, are only involved in the maintenance and manipulation of perceptual information represented in posterior visual cortices. With the support of this NSF CAREER award, Dr. Biyu He will address this question and develop a framework for understanding large-scale brain dynamics underlying visual perceptual awareness. To this end, the project combines visual psychophysics, state-of-the-art multimodal human brain imaging, noninvasive brain stimulation and computational modeling. The outcome of this work will lead to a better understanding of the biological basis of human perceptual awareness in both normative and clinical populations. The educational activities supported by this award are intended to stimulate scientific interest and enthusiasm in neuroscience in student populations, and increase the use of computational neuroscience and state-of-the-art multimodal imaging tools in human neuroscience research. <br/><br/>The research objective of this proposal is to tackle a central question in neuroscience: How does the brain give rise to perceptual awareness of sensory stimuli? To investigate this question, the research group will combine psychophysics, multi-modal brain imaging, and noninvasive brain stimulation in humans, facilitated by computational modeling, and use vision as the model system. Specifically, the following questions are addressed: 1) Do neural activities in frontal regions contribute to perceptual content when stimulus ambiguity must be resolved? 2) Do neural activities in frontal regions contribute to gating the access to awareness by a particular piece of visual information? The central hypothesis is that large-scale brain activity during conscious visual perception exhibits initial-state-dependent, robust, transient dynamics shaped by the interactions between frontal and visual cortices. The experimental approach features recording of brain activity at whole-brain and large-scale network levels using a combination of ultra-high-field (7 Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electrocorticography (ECoG) to leverage the high spatial or high temporal resolution of each modality, and to further manipulate brain activity using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). These studies will have a major impact for understanding how brain systems coordinate to generate perceptual awareness of environmental input."

Understanding language processes from their computational to their neural bases is essential for advancing critical national goals in education, in the medical treatment of language disorders and hearing loss, and in the creation of analytic approaches that will boost U.S. competitiveness in science and engineering, public and private sector research and development, and national security.<br/><br/>The project will connect electrophysiological and computational approaches for understanding human brain language processing. A first aim is to advance the effectiveness of electrophysiological tools for investigating language computations in the brain during comprehension. Language processes unfold rapidly, on a time scale of fractions of a second, and electrical recordings of brain activity are able to track this fast time course. A second aim is to develop frameworks for creating novel applications and approaches, such as the integration of machine learning methods with measures of brain electrical activity to obtain highly selective views of brain processes supporting specific aspects of language understanding. A third aim is to evaluate three main functions in linguistic computation that are being shown to be amenable to study using electrophysiological recordings, namely combinatorial processing, bilingualism, and predictive processing during language comprehension and production. The project will also provide training in leading-edge methods, thus supporting national efforts to develop the work force, and enhance science education and scientific rigor."

The view that culture is a critical resource for poverty alleviation among indigenous communities has become so widespread that some organizations, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank, compel nation-states to participate in these initiatives. Despite the prevalence of such development schemes, the communities targeted continue to face high indices of poverty and vulnerability. This research sets out to understand why such inequalities remain entrenched, and how that entrenchment varies among communities. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, will test whether current investments in such heritage-based development initiatives contribute to or impede economic welfare objectives in three different contexts. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations interested in development and poverty alleviation efforts.<br/><br/>Ana Hasemann, under the supervision of Dr. Monica Udvardy of the University of Kentucky, will explore whether participation in heritage commercialization and development efforts contributes to economic welfare. This research will be conducted in three Lenca communities located in Southwest Honduras, which are chosen because of their extensive participation in development initiatives. The researcher has engaged in preliminary fieldwork in the region, has gained familiarity with national legislation and development bureaucracy, and has acquired significant contacts with local informants since 2008. The researcher will conduct prolonged visits in each community, during which she will collect information through interviews, surveys, and personal narratives, in order to empirically explore and identify how indigenous women and their communities respond to and negotiate their participation in development interventions. Findings from this research will ascertain the importance of public policy on heritage and culture as driving forces in local development, which is sometimes the only means of survival for poor communities. They will also provide insight into how the political and economic agendas of contemporary national governments and transnational organizations influence the degree of attention paid to ethnic/minority peoples, their livelihoods, and their development."

To address this challenge, this research draws inspiration from recent developments in memory image forensics (in particular a recently introduced technique called guided execution), which has provided rapid evidence collection and crime investigation capabilities currently unparalleled in APT investigation.  This research is developing an integrated framework, called GEMINI, which shifts the goal of modern memory forensics from the investigation of physical-world crimes to APT campaigns. Based on the analysis of only a single memory image --- collected from an Android device after an attack is suspected --- GEMINI provides the following set of APT investigation capabilities: (1) Based on exploratory guided execution techniques, GEMINI can search for and re-create previously enacted APT attack stages. (2) Beyond investigating prior attack execution, GEMINI enables the revelation of hidden/potential future attack behaviors by 'puppeteering' their executing with pre-staged memory image data. (3) After exploring future payloads, GEMINI can further leverage its guided execution capabilities for the remediation of the observed attack strategies.<br/><br/>This work directly contributes to national security by advancing research in and developing techniques for the investigation of APT campaigns targeting mobile devices.

The objective is to stimulate the interest of Native American students in STEM related fields.<br/><br/>The project develops a cationic polymerization process for vinyl ethers that is regulated by visible light through the reversible oxidation of a polymer chain end with a photocatalyst.  Precise spatial and temporal control over polymer chain growth is achieved by the photoinitiated reversible formation of a propagating cation.  This cationic polymerization process is being used in combination with other photocontrolled radical polymerization processes to enable switching between different polymerization mechanisms. Monomer selectivity in situ is achieved by modulating the wavelength of irradiation. This protocol provides control over polymer sequence with an external stimulus and allows the synthesis of previously inaccessible polymer structures. Additionally, similar strategies are being developed for photocontrolled polymerization of epoxides, thus extending the scope and expanding the practicality of this approach. Synthetic polymers are of importance in all aspects of modern life and have facilitated major societal advances. Innovative synthetic methods are required to enable the synthesis of complex materials with unknown function. Photocontrolled cationic processes allow for the development of new polymeric structures with previously inaccessible architectures. Importantly, high levels of spatial and temporal control gained in photocontrolled polymerizations facilitate the application of these new methods in fields such as lithography, coatings, and biology. This award enables the establishment of a polymer science camp on the Flathead Indian Reservation in collaboration with the Salish and Kootenai College. This summer camp introduces Native American students to research activities at an early age in order to increase their interest and participation in STEM fields. Additionally, through workshops for teachers on the Flathead Indian Reservation the quality of STEM related education increases for elementary and middle school Native American students. These efforts contribute to creating a diverse STEM workforce in the United States."

More than half of the United States? greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation and electricity production. Lithium-ion batteries are a promising technology to facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable power generation that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the high cost of lithium-ion batteries threatens the commercial viability of clean technologies. This Phase II project will develop manufacturing process technologies that reduce the capital and operating costs of the most expensive step in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Low-cost batteries will push electric vehicles towards widespread commercial adoption. Electrification of mass-transit buses will improve urban air quality, especially for the low-income population located near bus depots. Large-scale battery systems enabled by low-cost batteries will turn renewable power generation such as solar and wind from periodic energy sources into on-demand energy sources to alleviate our dependence on fossil-fuels. This Phase II project will help lithium-ion batteries become a key technology in the successful departure from oil dependence, combat of climate change, and the United States? energy security.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for deeper understanding of the fundamental science behind the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. SEI layer quality is a key determinant of long-term battery reliability, performance, and safety, but the underlying electrochemistry that governs SEI composition and evolution remains poorly understood. This Phase II project will develop novel, in-situ diagnostics to directly measure the evolution, performance, and characteristics of the SEI layer as it is formed during lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Deeper insight into the complex morphology of the SEI layer will advance much-needed industry knowledge of battery performance, quality, and longevity. Additionally, there is a sizeable body of work in modeling the degradation of batteries throughout their lifecycle. With improved cell-level traceability, the manufacturing insights enabled by this Phase II project will expand the current understanding of the ?ideal battery? at the beginning of life and complement ongoing work on how batteries degrade over time. This insight opens the door for quality control in battery manufacturing based on more direct quality metrics such as longevity and reliability rather than indirect metrics such as beginning of life capacity."

The proposed REU Site will i) expose undergraduate students to hands-on research experiences in security and software development and testing, ii) enhance their research experience, iii) promote their interests in research, and iv) seed their desire to pursue advanced degrees and careers in CS. The project aims to increase the number of students that pursue graduate studies by exposing students to exciting and attainable research goals, giving them the opportunity to build their resumes with research experiences and publications, and providing a supportive community of peers and mentors that encourage them to be successful. By introducing competition and collaboration as drivers for research innovation, the project intends to achieve a unique and cohesive undergraduate research experience that entices students to pursue graduate studies. Students will gain a background to learn state-of-the-art technical knowledge, the ability to think independently, and the confidence to work on challenging problems. As a result, they will be better prepared to enter the graduate school pipeline. The project's broader significance and importance are that it trains three diverse cohorts of ten students recruited from minorities and underrepresented groups including female students. <br/><br/>The project's intellectual merits are that it exposes students to an intense research experience that combines security and software development and testing research with emerging technologies (i.e., web, mobile, and wearable applications) as artifacts used for evaluation of the different research techniques. The intellectual merit of this REU site is reflected in each individual research project, which has interesting and crucial applications that participants can easily identify with. Some projects, designed for highly talented students, seek to advance knowledge and understanding by addressing unsolved problems. Others seek to employ security and testing techniques to solve the real-world problems. The projects will also apply an intellectual approach to encourage students through active learning, free and open exchange of ideas, team spirit, and recognition and rewards for achievements. Specifically, the objectives are to foster i) creative and independent thinking, ii) problem-solving skills and hands-on experience, iii) enthusiasm and confidence, and iv) critical thinking, communication and organization skills. The student projects are designed to include individual and collaborative tasks that foster a strong connection to the group and a better understanding of the larger context of their work. Students work in collaborative teams that explore research questions and innovations in the areas of message integrity, computation on encrypted data for different resource-constrained devices, test suite prioritization, and test suite reduction. The students will investigate cryptographic algorithms and protocols that are suitable for mobile and wearable environments and aim to achieve end-to-end message level integrity and to support computing on encrypted data. They will also conduct empirical studies that hypothesize about the fault detection effectiveness of test suite reduction and test suite prioritization by coverage-based metrics. Empirical studies examine the techniques in the context of emerging technologies (web, mobile, wearable, etc.)."

It also represents an ecosystem under immediate risk for biodiversity change as a result of energy industry use of new horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies. The deep shale biosphere stores an abundance of methane and other oil hydrocarbons that provide carbon and energy resources for microorganisms both within the shale and along its bounding formations. The extreme conditions encountered within these rocks include the absence of light for photosynthesis, sub-micron pore-spaces, elevated temperatures, high pressures, and brine fluid chemistry. Each of these environmental factors may strongly influence the origin, adaptation and function of the microbial population. The Marcellus and Utica-Point Pleasant shale within the Appalachian basin of West Virginia and Ohio is one of the largest unconventional reserves in the U.S. This shale will serve as a case study to broadly characterize the microbial biodiversity and function in black shale and its bounding rock interfaces. Research objectives include inferring the origin of microbial life with respect to geologic history of these formations, exploring how microorganisms have adapted to the current deep biosphere environment, and investigating the metabolic strategies used to sequester nutrient resources given the extreme environmental conditions encountered in this ecosystem. <br/><br/>The investigators will undertake the first genomic survey of indigenous microbial populations in shale and its interfaces. This research will greatly expand our knowledge of microbial life and function in shale prior to broad-scale environmental disturbance as a result of energy exploitation. The project will also provide further insight into microbial carbon cycling in the deep terrestrial biosphere. The project participants will develop exhibit materials for local venues (e.g. schools, libraries, museums) where the broader public can get to know the residents of the deep subsurface, learn about their characteristics and preferences, match microbes with their deep-sea cousins, and witness what this research has revealed about community structure before and after drilling.

Increasingly, countries of the Global South are leading the way. For example, China and India have been at the forefront of commercial activities in sub-Saharan Africa. These investments have generated needed jobs for poor countries but they also have produced controversies about labor practices. One question that has arisen is whether national and international labor codes are being ignored to give businesses unfair advantages while also victimizing workers. However, surprisingly little is known about how the situation plays out on the ground, at the work sites where workers and foreign supervisors actually engage. The research supported by this award will help to fill this knowledge gap. This research is in the United States' national interest because the U.S. government and investors need to know that they are playing on a level playing field. It also is essential to better understand the contexts that determine the effectiveness of U.S. foreign aid investments.<br/><br/>This fourteen month empirical ethnographic study will be carried out by University of California, Davis, anthropology doctoral student, Justin L. Haruyama, under the supervision of Dr. James H. Smith. The research will be conducted in two Chinese-operated coal mines in southern Zambia: one operated by a Chinese state-owned enterprise and the other privately owned by five Chinese brothers. Both of these mines hire managers primarily from China while recruiting their ordinary workforces exclusively from Zambia and neighboring African countries. The research will examine how actors from different racial, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds at the mines understand and affect each other. This will illuminate the broader social consequences and capitalist transformations at work in everyday encounters around the extraction of coal. The researcher will also pay close attention to historical experience, as preliminary research has shown that the sometimes-traumatic encounters with colonialism, socialism, and neoliberalism experienced by participants from both Zambia and China continue to have profound reverberations in their actions and discourses at the mines today. Data will be collected through a mixed-methods approach, including archival research, participant observation, census and structured survey interviews, and the collection of life histories. Results from this research will improve understanding of how contemporary international capitalist investments are affecting the lives of ordinary people, and how they are reshaping business environments and capitalist culture in many African countries."

Acrylate is a mostly overlooked by-product of a very well-studied process through which a compound known as DMSP (dimethylsulfoniopropionate), a compound produced by phytoplankton, is converted to the gas dimethylsulfide (known as DMS). This process is an important part of understanding the marine cycling of sulfur, and DMS plays a role in cloud formation and climate. Thus, these aspects of the conversion of DMSP to DMS have received considerable attention. On the other hand, very little is known about acrylate concentrations, fluxes, or impacts in the oceans, even though it is produced during the conversion of DMSP to DMS.  Acrylate concentrations and fluxes should at times be substantial, especially in shallow-water coral reefs or during blooms of DMSP-rich phytoplankton that are common throughout the world's oceans and often harmful or toxic. It is likely that acrylate is a reactive form of marine organic matter that significantly impacts the carbon cycle and ecology of the upper ocean. This project will foster research and educational opportunities for undergraduates and one graduate student through several avenues including field work with international collaborators, attendance at national and local meetings, mentoring, preparing for and delivering college-level lectures, and presentations made to the general public at forums such as Syracuse's Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, media communications, web-based data bases, and presentations at scientific meetings, public forums and in the classroom. <br/> <br/>A three-year project is proposed to study the effect of sunlight on the formation and loss of acrylate in seawater, to model these processes in the water column, and to determine if photoproduction and photolysis are important pathways in the marine acrylate cycle in a shallow-water coral reef. Four objectives are planned to carry out this research: (1) synthesize radiocarbon-labeled DMSP as a source of radiocarbon-labeled acrylate for photolysis and uptake studies; (2) conduct laboratory experiments using a solar simulator to study the photolysis and photoproduction of acrylate in water and seawater under varying conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, oxygen concentration); (3) determine temperature and wavelength-dependent quantum yields for acrylate photolysis and acrylate photoproduction in seawater using a monochromatic irradiation system; and (4) conduct a field study at the Richard Gump Research Station to determine rates of photolysis, photoproduction and microbial consumption of acrylate in a shallow-water coral reef."

(3) ""How can we understand the geometry of networks?""  Questions (1) and (2) can be reformulated as isoperimetric problems.  One example of an isoperimetric problem asks for the shape of a fence of fixed length that encloses the most area (the answer being a circular fence, which was known since ancient times).  The specific isoperimetric problems the principal investigator studies can be phrased as probabilistic problems, and this project develops some new tools from calculus to deal with these problems.  Different versions of Question (1) have been studied extensively by game theorists in the 1950s and 1960s, but investigations in theoretical computer science in the last two decades have given renewed interest for Questions (1), (2), and (3).  Generally speaking, theoretical computer science finds ways for computers to solve problems as quickly and as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>This project develops two analytic tools in probability: the calculus of variations and curvature.  Several recent isoperimetric problems in probability and theoretical computer science such as (1) and (2) ask for the Euclidean sets of smallest Gaussian perimeter and fixed Gaussian volume.  A breakthrough result of Choksi and Sternberg from 2007 allows the calculus of variations to be applied to these optimization problems, though others have not yet used variational tools for these problems.  The principal investigator will also develop theories of curvature for hypercontractive and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.  For a Riemannian manifold, Ricci curvature bounds imply logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, a result of Bakry and Emery from 1985.  In this project, different notions of Ricci curvature on random graphs will be investigated. Theories of Ricci curvature for noncommutative logarithmic Sobolev inequalities will also be investigated."

This proposal will address three of these fundamental questions: (1) how are birds adjusting their song to the urban environment?; (2) how has song urbanization affected signal information?; and (3) are urban songs adaptive? To address these questions, this study will employ behavioral, ecological and mechanistic modeling approaches, using an established NSF model organism for behavioral studies, white-crowned sparrows. Meeting the proposal's objectives will transform the state of understanding of urban-dependent selection on mating behaviors and, more broadly, the adaptations of species that persist in urban environments.

Web apps and software marketplaces have made it easier than ever before to distribute software to anyone and anywhere. However, writing good smartphone apps remains challenging. Developers must anticipate and adapt to numerous different devices and users, and to the changing conditions and environments caused by mobility. One minute the network is fast and free, the next it is slow and metered. The importance of adaptation to successful mobile apps is well understood. However, little language and system support exists to help developers create and improve adaptive mobile apps.<br/>This project investigates a new system enabling the next generation of adaptive apps. Central to the approach is a new language construct that allows developers to express flexibility within their source code. This allows decisions that today must be made during development to be deferred, and leaves flexibility that can be harnessed to enable adaptation. Intelligently utilizing flexibility exposed by developers requires novel approaches to automated pre-deployment testing and dynamic adaptation policy generation. The project also explores how to guide developers toward useful flexibility, and how flexibility should be managed and exposed in current and next-generation programming languages.<br/><br/>The integrated educational plan also explores how to harness flexibility, but uses it to adapt online courses to make them more effective. Beginning with a concept library containing overlapping and self-reinforcing lessons, the project explores two forms of flexibility. Lessons can be reordered to express different prerequisites, and within each lesson multiple explanations an be used for different students. Integrated quiz results and other forms f feedback will be used to determine the success or failure of different approaches. These new personalized learning techniques will be applied to an existing online course on the internet created by the investigator."

Recently, vendors have introduced a new memory called high-bandwidth memory (HBM) as an approach to alleviate this bottleneck.  This project will develop an algorithmic foundation for using HBM.  The project has the potential for a broad economic, technological, and scientific impact, since industry has an investment in this technology and many of the nation's strategic codes are being run on HBM-capable machines.  The PIs will integrate research with education at the graduate and undergraduate levels by training PhD, MS, and honors program BS students in cross-cutting issues encompassing algorithm design, high-performance software, and processor architecture. <br/> <br/>The new approach offered by vendors is to bond memory (HBM) directly to the processor chip, which allows for more connections, enabling higher bandwidth.

HBM does not cleanly fit in the standard memory hierarchy.  This project will develop a foundational understanding of how to algorithmically design codes for HBM enhanced architectures. Overcoming these intellectual challenges to achieve multi-core scalability using HBM requires new algorithms, models, and abstractions, spearheaded by this collaboration between researchers who study hardware issues, high performance computing challenges, and theoretical modeling and analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells must communicate with each other in order to form tissues and ultimately establish a body plan. In contrast to animals, plant cells are surrounded by walls permanently locking cells to their sister cells. Thus, tissue formation and cell-to-cell communication is quite different in plants compared to animals. To negotiate the permanence of the wall, plants have evolved intricate channels that mediate movement of molecules between cells. While these channels were identified in the 1800s, it has been very challenging to understand how these channels function, and what determines whether they are open or closed. The research here will capitalize on findings that a protein named myosin VIII is found near these channels during very specific stages of development. Plants lacking this protein exhibit patterning defects that likely result from impaired cell-to-cell communication. By investigating the nature of how this molecule interacts with the channels, this research will provide much needed insights into regulation of cell-to-cell communication, and have broad implications for the fields of plant cell and developmental biology. Including undergraduates from both a primarily undergraduate institution as well as a research university will further broaden the impact of the research. The undergraduates will work together to incorporate quantitative cellular modeling and molecular cell biology to answer fundamental questions in cell-to-cell communication. Additionally, a program for middle-school aged girls will be developed to encourage the participation of women in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Plasmodesmata, the channels that connect plant cells to mediate cell-to-cell communication, are poorly understood at the molecular level. These channels have been challenging to study because they are absolutely essential for plant viability and development. This project will investigate this critical developmental problem in the cell and developmental biological plant model, the moss Physcomitrella patens. P. patens is uniquely suited for these studies as it has a simple body plan that is highly amenable to cell biological and genetic manipulation. This research will build upon the development of a moss line that contains a single myosin VIII protein, an actin-based molecular motor, which localizes to plasmodesmata at only one cross wall at a particular stage of development, providing a long-needed genetic and cellular system to study how actin and myosin may regulate the conductance of plasmodesmata. Using a combination of quantitative microscopy and computational modeling, this project will determine whether myosin VIII has an impact on the movement of molecules between cells. Taking advantage of myosin VIII as a molecular handle, the proposed research will identify new pathways regulating plasmodesmata function, ultimately impacting patterning and development. Since myosin VIII and actin are highly conserved between moss and seed plants, these studies are expected to identify evolutionarily ancient mechanisms controlling cell-to-cell communication and tissue patterning."

Effective response to this public health challenge necessitates adoption of an ""outside-the-box"" strategy for the de novo design of novel classes of microbicides. The goal of this NSF Career award is to develop a novel self-assembling antimicrobial nanofiber (SAAN) platform for safer and more effective therapeutic administration of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) compared to conventional treatment options. Systematic engineering of SAANs has minimized host cell cytotoxicity, improved their protease-resistance and their antimicrobial activity against broad-spectrum bacteria. The success of the proposed work will open new avenues for AMP-based antimicrobial therapy to treat a variety of infectious diseases found in both civilian hospitals and military facilities. The fundamental knowledge developed from the proposed research activities will provide a powerful new glossary of fundamental design principles for the synthesis and deployment of AMPs. It will have a transformative impact on the multi-billion-dollar research focused on conventional antibiotics and AMPs by re-engineering and ""re-formatting"" thousands of available AMPs in the peptide databank to form SAANs, thereby greatly boosting their therapeutic potential. The multidisciplinary research involving chemistry, microbiology, engineering, nanoscience, and pharmaceutical sciences provides ample opportunities to train and educate students at all levels. The fundamental biomaterials design, supramolecular chemistry and antimicrobial delivery principle will be integrated into various research and educational activities, particularly through summer research opportunities provided to high school students to promote their scientific research interests and enhance their career awareness. Educational partnership with local high school will be established to provide summer research internship to high school teachers to incorporate the fundamental knowledge of the proposed research into various high school curriculum.<br/><br/><br/>Technical section:<br/><br/>The discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has brought tremendous opportunities to overcome the prevalence of bacterial resistance to commonly used antibiotics due to their direct action against bacterial membrane. However, despite AMPs' exceptional bactericidal activity in vitro, their susceptibility to proteases, limited circulation half-lives and severe host cell toxicity represent critical hurdles to their widespread use. This CAREER award supported by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Clarkson University focuses on a new paradigm of Self-Assembled Antimicrobial Nanofibers (SAANs) as a vehicle-free AMP delivery system to alleviate the drawback associated with conventional AMPs. In SAANs, AMPs serve as both therapeutics and key structural components to program and direct the assembly through highly specific intermolecular interactions. Through the proposed work, we will build a toolbox of cationic de novo designed peptides with expanded chemical functionality by which to construct various SAANs families, and explore the effect of new functional groups on the molecular and supramolecular packing of SAANs, antimicrobial activity and hemocompatibility. Fundamental knowledge about the structure-activity relationship is essential for the design of new antimicrobial nanomaterials with precise control over molecular structure, nanostructure, stimuli-responsive antimicrobial activity and exquisite biocompatibility. The impact of this proposal lies in that SAANs could potentially be established as a new and unique AMP delivery platform with well-defined filamentous structure and the ease of incorporating multi-therapeutics for combinatorial antimicrobial and chemotherapy to treat various human diseases. The proposed project will integrate supramolecular chemistry, biomaterials design and antimicrobial delivery principles and techniques with various education and outreach activities for students at all levels."

The award is cofunded by the Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.  Bioenergy transduction, a type of energy transport in which the form of the energy also changes, is one of the most fascinating aspects of life.  Biomolecular motors and pumps transduce energy from one form to the other with remarkable efficiency. The study of energy transduction in biomolecular ion pumps involves developing quantum mechanical and classical models that properly describe the energetics and efficiency of ion transport through the interior of a transmembrane protein. The problem of macromolecular assembly, which underlies many fascinating biological processes such as the formation of muscle fiber, requires the development of effective coarse-grained models that strike the balance of computational efficiency and biophysical specificity. The project offers research opportunities for students at all levels who wish to work at the intersection of chemistry, biology and engineering.  Dr. Cui is actively engaged with programs aimed at broadening participation in physical and biological science by members of under-represented minorities.<br/><br/><br/>For the problem of ion pumping, by adopting the minimum free energy path approach and a multi-layer Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QMMM) model, Cui and co-workers can significantly improve the accuracy and sampling for the study of long-range proton transfers in complex biomolecules compared to previous efforts. By adopting the chemical potential equalization scheme to represent the polarization of different QM regions, they can properly describe ion transport through the interior of a transmembrane protein that is rich in polar and charged motifs. This computational framework represents the first attempt to include the membrane potential in QM/MM type of simulations. For the problem of coiled-coil assembly, which describes a broad class of problems in which the proper assembly of biomolecules relies critically on a limited degree of flexibility in their structures, their proposed multipolar coarse-grained model makes a natural connection between atomistic and coarse-grained representations with a transparent framework for parameterization. Compared to continuum mechanics models, this model can access similar length and time scales but can be efficiently studied using standard molecular simulation software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These disabilities include reduced mobility, hearing loss, and respiratory problems. There is currently no cure for OI, and treatments relying on the use of bisphosphonates have questionable efficacy. With improved management, these children now progress to adulthood, where the challenge of age-related fractures occurs. There is therefore a critical need for fundamental, quantitative research into bone that can then support the development of new, effective treatments.  More effective treatments will enhance the quality of life of people with OI. As fracture and fragility are the main symptoms of OI, this CAREER proposal aims to first understand what features of OI bone make it more susceptible to fracture and then evaluate the efficacy of current therapies.  This will be done by examining the actual bone resistance to fracture. Combining rigorous fracture mechanics experiments with high-resolution imaging and innovative computational models, this project will examine the relation between structure, composition, and mechanics of the bone in OI with and without treatment.  This will then reveal the mechanisms of crack propagation in OI bone at an unprecedented detail.  It will also provide a foundation for the development of improved therapies that target the key properties in bone that will affect bone fragility.  The techniques developed through this project can be applied to any bone fragility disease, which will further advance the development of effective therapies for these conditions.  Improved outcomes for individuals with these disorders has the potential for substantial economic, health and welfare benefits to society.  The educational plan of this CAREER plan promotes training, mentoring and learning of diverse students, representing the next-generation of engineers. By broad outreach activities connected with research, we will inspire and attract children, students at any age and the general public to STEM disciplines.  These include social media videos about bone mechanics, learning modules for K12 students, and inviting young adults with OI to participate in workshops to learn about the latest research and bone mechanics in general.<br/><br/>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that causes an extreme susceptibility to spontaneous fracture which then progresses such that skeletal deformities and severe disabilities result.  Current treatments involve the use of bisphosphonates; however, their efficacy has not yet been demonstrated.  By combining cutting edge experimental techniques for the analysis of fracture mechanics with high resolution imaging and novel finite element models, this project will investigate the relationship between structure, composition, and mechanics in OI bone with and without treatment.  Improved understanding of the fracture mechanisms associated with OI and the factors that cause the fracture susceptibility will support the development of improved therapies that can then target those aspects of bone structure and molecular organization. The educational component of this project seeks to increase understanding of bone mechanics and its importance, both among engineering students and the public.  A combination of formal and informal educational activities will reach undergraduate and graduate engineering students, K12 students, and the general public.

For example, prey often spend less time feeding and more time watching out for predators, which comes with the cost of lower food intake and thus slower growth. Such ""non-consumptive effects"" (NCEs) have been described for a wide range of terrestrial and marine prey species, from elk to clams, but mostly in short-term (< 1 month) experiments. These prior results suggest that in some cases, the behavioral changes (NCEs) have a bigger effect on prey populations than consumption by predators (CEs). However, those short-term, controlled experiments may artificially inflate the perceived importance of NCEs. Over longer time periods, prey may adapt or become acclimated to predation risk, and NCEs may become less important. Additionally, environmental variability (e.g., differences in the availability of the prey's food between study sites) may have a bigger effect on prey populations than NCEs do. This project will use a combination of short- (months) and long-term (years) field experiments and mathematical models to evaluate the role of NCEs on Florida oyster reefs. The prey species in this study is the eastern oyster, an important marine resource in the southeast US for harvesting and habitat creation; the main oyster predator is a mud crab. In this study, results from mathematical models of oyster populations will be compared to experimental data from the field to see whether including NCEs in the model leads to better model predictions. Better understanding of NCEs in oysters should improve management of that important marine resource. Furthermore, the mathematical model will be used to develop broader, generalizable conclusions about the importance of NCEs that could be applied to other important prey species. This project will provide data useful for oyster resource management, will support public education regarding the ecological importance of NCEs, and will enhance the scientific engagement of underrepresented groups in the study region. The project will support a partnership with the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve in Florida, including data sharing, sponsoring an oyster management symposium, and funding the development of multimedia scientific outreach materials at the reserve that will be used by a large and diverse population of K-12 students in the surrounding community. The project will train a postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, two undergraduate students, and research results will be disseminated by those students and the principal investigators at scientific conferences, in journal publications, and in online content through an ongoing partnership with a Florida public television station. <br/><br/>Predators can alter prey population dynamics by causing fear-based shifts in prey traits (nonconsumptive effect, NCE). The importance of NCEs for prey populations -relative to direct consumption by predators (consumptive effects, CEs) -remains uncertain, particularly because short-term studies of NCEs cannot estimate their effect over multiple prey generations. This project addresses that knowledge gap by combining short- and long-term field experiments with population models to investigate the importance of NCEs on oyster population dynamics in a Florida estuary. The central question is whether accounting for NCEs improves the ability to predict long-term trends in oyster population abundance. Several types of NCEs are present in this system: exposure to water containing predator odors reduces oyster larval recruitment and causes juvenile oysters to increase shell thickness, reducing their somatic growth. In addition to CEs and NCEs , environmental gradients in stress, food, and propagule delivery are also present in this system. Those environmental factors can have strong effects on post-settlement survivorship, growth, and recruitment of oysters, so the relative importance of predator CEs and NCEs may vary along those spatial gradients as well. This project will consist of four components. (1) A series of short-term field experiments to test how NCEs vary with predator density and environmental variables, and whether one of the NCEs (increased shell thickness) actually reduces vulnerability to predators. (2) A population model, parameterized using experimental results; model simulations will quantify how the relative importance of NCEs should vary over time, space, and environmental gradients. (3) A longer-term (3.5 year) field experiment; the results from this experiment will be compared to model predictions to test whether accounting for NCEs improves predictions of long-term variation in oyster population dynamics. (4) A general form of the model will be developed to broadly investigate the effect of NCEs on non-equilibrium, transient population dynamics. By combining models and field experiments, this project will bridge the gap between the theoretical understanding of how NCEs affect population dynamics and empirical tests of that theory, advancing the field towards the goal of predicting how multiple interacting factors structure communities."

Statistics and data analysis plays an increasingly important role in modern society. Without the ability to work with data (e.g. organize, represent, summarize and model) it is impossible to adequately understand and begin to solve major social issues and it is difficult to make important decisions regarding personal health, finances, and political choices. This CAREER project seeks to develop frameworks for understanding how students learn to represent, model, and organize data as part of their understanding of statistics and data analysis. In addition, it will result in tools for undergraduate statistics instruction to better support statistics teaching and learning for undergraduates. This work will inform educational strategies in the statistics classroom for all students.<br/><br/>The project features a research-based investigation of new curricular approaches to undergraduate statistics teaching and learning with extensive use of software for learning about data organization, representation, modeling and simulation.  This project should enhance and complement an existing research-based curriculum, CATALST (Change Agents for Teaching and Learning Statistics) that incorporates technology for students' learning.  This project intends to investigate conjectures made within the statistics education community about the advantages of using technology to teach statistical inference from a modeling and simulation approach as well as using technology for data detective work (organizing, representing and summarizing data). The collection of rich data gathered in classrooms that explores the ways students use technology to construct models and run simulations to answer statistical questions or to use technology to organize, represent and interpret data sets will allow the principal investigator to construct models of students' statistical learning and understanding. The data to be collected includes classroom observations and video, student interviews, and assessments of student learning. The principal investigator has integrated research and education as part of this CAREER award by investigating classes she teaches and by integrating mentoring of graduate students as statistics education researchers throughout the project."

Experimental studies and mechanical models have revealed how certain body shapes maximize swimming and feeding ability of the fish, in response to ecological factors such as predator presence or habitat and food availability, or in response to environment conditions such as water temperature and salinity. However, very little is known about how these ecological and environmental factors interact to explain fish body shape over evolutionary time-scales.  This research will test hypotheses of the ecological, environmental and functional drivers of body form evolution across teleost fishes using a dataset of body shape diversity that will be generated from approximately 7,500 fish species.  The project also will help to digitize the fish collections of several natural history museums making the information collected freely available to the public. Approximately 40 undergraduate students will receive training in fundamental research skills and will work together to design and execute an ambitious group research project based on the data they help to collect. Beyond illuminating the mechanisms by which life diversifies, in particular the process of convergent evolution whereby independent fish lineages have evolved similar body shapes, this study will provide the basis for identifying functional groups of fish, which are used for assessing aquatic ecosystem health.<br/><br/>This research will use a phylogenetic comparative approach to reconstruct the history of ecological shifts and biological innovations and their impact on trends in teleost shape diversity. Body-shape, including regions vital for swimming and prey-capture performance, will be estimated from approximately 20,000 teleost specimens using geometric morphometrics and linear measurements on lateral and dorsal views. The teleost ecomorphospace generated will provide the context for exploring the nature of exceptional adaptive radiations, such as the African rift lake cichlids. Large databases of biological, environmental and ecological and functional traits will be assembled from the scientific literature and museum records. Morphological convergence, novelty, and the ecological, environmental and functional factors associated with them, will be identified using an adaptive landscape approach using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models in a robust phylogenetic framework. The project will test predictions based on biomechanical and physiological models as well as experimental evidence that the most streamlined shapes will evolve in teleosts that rely more on ram feeding and body-caudal propulsion, feed on small elusive prey, or live in environments that are less complex, have high flow, low salinity, or high dissolved oxygen contents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As an example, this Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) project will design new material systems that simultaneously optimize for dielectric response and mechanical durability, a combination currently not achievable but necessary for high voltage electrical transmission and conversion. These new materials will have a significant economic impact on society because they will enable higher efficiency generation and transmission of electricity.  More broadly, this new design approach will result in new nanostructured polymer material systems that will impact a wide range of industries such as energy, consumer electronics, and manufacturing.  To ensure broad access to this work, the data, tools and models developed will be integrated and shared through an open data resource, NanoMine. The team will interact with the scientific community to create an integrated virtual organization of designers and researchers to test and improve the models. Educational components will reach undergraduate and graduate communities via interdisciplinary cluster programs at the two institutions, and provide undergraduate research opportunities and web based instructional modules and workshops.<br/><br/>The research is based on a central research hypothesis that using a data-driven approach, grounded in physics, allows integration of models that bridge length scales from angstroms to millimeters to predict dielectric and mechanical properties to enable the design and optimization of new materials. Data, algorithms and models will be integrated into the new and growing nanocomposite data resource NanoMine to address challenges in data-driven material design. This research will result in advancements in three areas. First, integrating a broad set of literature data and targeted experiments with multiscale methods will enable the development of interphase models to predict local polymer properties near interfaces considered critical for modeling polymer composites. Second, a hybrid approach utilizing machine-learning to bridge length scales between physics-based modeling domains will be used to create meaningful multiscale processing-structure-property relationship work flows. And, third, a Bayesian inference approach will utilize the knowledge contained in a dataset as a prior probability distribution and guide 'on-demand' computer simulations and physical experiments to accelerate the search of optimal material designs.

The enzymes can be used in an aqueous solution that can be applied to food during cleaning and processing to remove biofilm-forming microbes. The use of a safe and green enzyme-based disinfectant is important because of the rising frequency of food-borne illness and associated outbreaks linked to microbial contamination from pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella. In addition, these enzymes offer an opportunity to replace harsh chemical cleaning agents with biocompatible, safe and green alternatives.<br/><br/>This project will result in afamily of cleaning products formulated for a wide range of uses in cleaning of produce and other packaged foods. The uniqueness of the enzyme-based cleaning products are (1) ability to engineer specificity and target a broad range of microbial biofilms, (2) ability to select enzymes that retain activity under actual cleaning conditions, (3) ability to discriminate between pathogen and non-pathogen microbial biofilms, (4) demonstrated methods for high-yield production and (5) providing a safe, biocompatible alternative to current chemical cleaning agents. Collectively these features provide a new, green and targeted alternative to current industry standard chemical disinfectants such as peracetic acid in this market space. <br/><br/>This project addresses key gaps in knowledge required to translate this technology to the marketplace. Chemical disinfectants and mechanical disruption often have limited efficacy against microbial biofilms, allowing potential pathogens to persist in processing environments despite cleaning and cause foodborne illness. Furthemore, biofilm chemical structure is often complex and heterogeneous due to the presence of multiple microbes present within a biofilm community. This technology addresses both of these gaps by engineering enzymes that can degrade chemically heterogeneous biofilms, and can act synergistically with other cleaning methods or alone to enhance removal of microbial pathogens present during food processing. In particular, the project utilizes some leading industry partners such as Highland Fresh Technologies who will assist in designing and simulating actual process conditions under which application testing can be performed to determine amount per use and method of application. Also, production costs during scale-up will be calculated to identify critical costs associated with the final product. Additionally, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students working on this project will receivetechnology translation expertise, working to answer critical questions necessary to identify production costs, business plan development as well as direct exposure to key industry partners to design and execute key testing of products."

Plummeting costs of new forms of data collection and storage and the proliferation of ""big data"" have increased the need for merging such databases as researchers and statistical agencies struggle to integrate carefully curated datasets with messy and incomplete data from historical, administrative, and commercial sources.  The methods developed in this project will facilitate the successful integration of different data sources, thus generating new resources for future research.  These combined data sources may also provide some alternatives to expensive survey data collection in an era of declining response rates.  Freely available software will be developed and stored in a public repository.<br/><br/>The increasing desire to deploy probabilistic record linkage has spurred significant research into various components of the process, such as how to compare records, how to reduce the number of record comparisons to keep the problem computationally feasible, how to quantify the weight of evidence for or against a link between records, and how to ultimately generate a merged database.  Often these components are studied in isolation from each other and from the ultimate goal of making inferences using the merged files.  This research project will take a more holistic view of the record linkage process in order to advance the state of the art.  The project has two primary goals. The first goal is to develop new models for record linkage that incorporate the impact of preprocessing methods that reduce the total number of record pairs to be evaluated.  While widely deployed and well motivated, these methods have effects on subsequent modeling that are not well understood.  The second goal is to enhance understanding of uncertainty and error throughout the process and to develop imputation methods for propagating error due to uncertain record links and other missing data, such as item nonresponse in a survey. These methods will be designed with an eye toward large applications that require new computational approaches.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology."

Furthermore, the team will engage in Design-Based Research and use a co-design approach in which multiple stakeholder, including preschool teachers, parents, children, and advisors, are directly and actively involved in the development and iterative pilot testing of digital and hands-on activities. This will ensure that design decisions link home and school learning, take into account the interests of young children, and address the needs and strengths of preschool programs and culturally diverse families. Researchers will conduct observations and interviews and make assessments of children's learning using evidence centered design learning tasks developed as part of this study and conduct mixed method analyses.

This project addresses both challenges simultaneously, seeking (i) to demonstrate how a robust operationalization of privacy can lead to meaningful PbD and (ii) to contribute methodological insight by engaging with ongoing research and development in the area of small data applications, namely, systems that advance wellness and personal productivity by utilizing digital traces from individuals' day-to-day activities, such as e-mail, grocery shopping, TV watching, transportation, mobile devices, and so forth. Adopting the definition of privacy as contextual integrity, the project will focus on selected small-data applications currently ""on the drawing board"" in PI Deborah Estrin's Small Data lab. With these design cases, the project rises to one of the PbD challenges, namely consideration of privacy early on in development and, as a research enterprise, its primary aim is to uncover more and less productive methodological approaches for doing so, resulting in system characteristics well correlated with privacy requirements. <br/><br/>At the same time, the project will provide invaluable insight into how to operationalize contextual integrity, which conceives of privacy as appropriate flow of personal information, modeling appropriate flow as conformance with context-specific informational norms, which, prescribe (and prohibit) information flows according to three parameters: actors (subject, sender, recipient), information types, and transmission principles (functional constraints on flow). Adopting contextual integrity as an operational definition means that researchers will assess privacy properties by carefully mapping data flows, and evaluating these flows in terms of the context of application and use. The project also extends past work on formal representations of informational norms by demonstrating how they may be integrated into design practices.  In addition to its substantive contributions this project embodies an innovative collaborative model -- a novel pairing of a computer scientist, Deborah Estrin (Cornell), with a philosopher, Helen Nissenbaum (NYU), in an equal partnership to forge technologies that embody meaningful privacy."

Race and gender do make a difference, however, when these online disclosures lead to acts of cyberaggression. The PIs' previous work revealed that some youths are resistant to cyberaggression and that there are differences in perceptions of cyberbullying among youths from different cultural and racial backgrounds.  This research aims to explore the relationship between youths' self-disclosures, cultural backgrounds, and their perceptions of cyberaggression.<br/><br/>The PIs conduct a longitudinal, interdisciplinary study that builds upon their ongoing cyberaggression pattern recognition research by: 1) using surveys and focus groups to test and refine their theories about self-disclosure, perception, cultural difference, and cyberaggression communication patterns, 2) using machine learning to develop detection and response technologies for use in applications designed to protect youths, 3) using focus groups to evaluate the applications, and 4) making the data collected from this project available to the research community. This work is important to understand the role of self-disclosure in cybervictmization among youths, and provides the theoretical groundwork for the development of effective response strategies that can be employed by youths when they are attacked online. The data from this study will provide a rich source of material for other researchers in both computer science and in the social and behavior sciences."

It happens to be useful and natural to make ""time"" itself more abstract and replace it with any other discrete system of symmetries, say of some object (such symmetries form what is a called a discrete group). In the case of a very chaotic physical system, one cannot effectively predict its future state. This fact gives rise to an important quantity, the entropy of the system, that measures how unpredictable it is. Entropy was originally defined directly within an information theoretic context, but it turns out that, if one views it instead from the perspective of a statistical mechanics formalism, the scope of entropy theory is increased to encompass a very large class of groups known as ""sofic groups."" Seen through this new lens, entropy becomes a measurement of how many finitary approximations the physical system has. The general question of how well an infinitary process can be approximated by a finitary one is a fundamental question of scientific inquiry, and the class of sofic groups includes many natural examples coming from geometry and number theory. This project also sheds light on the connection to physics that is inherent in its statistical mechanical and information theoretic origins. Moreover, the subject has proven to have interesting links to diverse areas of mathematics, including the following: functional analysis, ergodic theory, combinatorics, and operator algebras. Many of the links are direct consequences of the principal investigator's research.  The project is part of ongoing activity to strengthen and understand such connections.<br/><br/>This project revolves around three main problems. The first is to understand the orbit equivalence consequences of positive or complete positive entropy for actions of nonamenable groups. For example, the principal investigator has shown that actions with complete positive entropy are strongly ergodic and that positive entropy actions are not weakly compact. He seeks to prove that actions with compete positive entropy are solidly ergodic, as defined by Chifan and Ioana, which will give further indication of the Bernoulli-like behavior that these actions exhibit. Part of the interest in this objective is that it places the theory of entropy for actions of nonamenable groups in stark contrast to the study of entropy for actions of amenable groups, where it is impossible to derive any orbit equivalence consequences of entropy. These consequences of complete positive entropy apply to algebraic actions (i.e., actions on compact groups by automorphisms), for the principal investigator can already demonstrate that algebraic actions related to invertible convolution operators have complete positive entropy. A second problem is concerned with investigating the entropy theory of algebraic actions of equivalence relations, which is joint work with Lewis Bowen and Dylan Airey. One aim of this part of the project is to generalize the principal investigator's results on entropy and Fuglede-Kadison determinants from the group case to the equivalence relation case. Lastly, the principal investigator will further the connections between dynamics and operator algebras by defining sofic entropy for actions on operator algebras."

The project will expand an existing research practice partnership (RPP) focused on increasing computational making (i.e. the integration of design, coding, and making to create interactive artifacts) learning opportunities for middle grade youth living in the Chicago Bronzeville community. By adding a school-day component, the project will focus on curating, developing, and implementing instructional materials that integrate computational making learning activities into middle grade (6-8) classrooms. Grounded in the prior work of the Digital Youth Network (DYN), the project approach will create an ecosystem to support student development of digital media literacies. By creating a learning ecosystem that creates a context where CS/CT literacies are accessible, relevant, and valued, the project will create the motivation for students to seek opportunities to deepen and showcase their developing CS/CT skills within a supportive community of peers, mentors, teachers, and families. The project will address national and local conversations by providing a living example of how to bring together a cohort of schools, informal learning providers, and academics to create and implement an intro to computational making middle school strategy. This strategy will blend together learning activities designed to develop core computational making skills, with content-focused projects (e.g. math, science, social studies, literacy and art), and community showcases designed to support and grow student and family understanding and engagement in the diversity of ways to use computer science and computational thinking to create, develop, and control interactive artifacts that have meaning in everyday life.<br/><br/>The Bronzeville Fusion Network RPP team will work to address two shared questions: (1) How can we foster a community learning environment, anchored within schools, that recognizes, supports, and promotes computational literacies as a desirable and accessible form of social capital by educators, youth, and families? (2) How do these community level connections impact youth CS/CT learning opportunities, participation, social networks, knowledge, and understanding? To address these questions the RPP team will leverage existing quality CS/CT resources (e.g. tools, programs, curriculum, especially those that are free and research-based), existing local infrastructure and policies (e.g. online learning platforms, professional development models), and programmable interactive electronics (e.g. sensors, arduinos, makey makey) to create culturally meaningful computational making learning opportunities that connect middle school learners to quality opportunities in ways that work and that are sustainable. To accomplish this goal, the project will systematically engage in hyperlocal work in Bronzeville, a Chicago community on the southside of Chicago, representing approximately 119,000 residents. The project will work with schools, educators and leaders from local community organizations to collaboratively explore, curate, and organize existing national CS/CT learning resources into culturally meaningful blended learning activities and modules intentionally designed to engage Bronzeville youth in exploring and discovering the essential role of CS/CT literacies in making the interactive objects students use daily. We will also use a networked strategy in Bronzeville, capitalizing on a citywide online learning platform that brings together face-to-face and online learning resources to support students, families, and teachers in finding and participating in formal and informal activities designed to increase student engagement in academics and enrichment activities, allowing youth to develop portfolios of work and participation and to see and comment on the interactive artifacts created by peers. While this work will focus within the Bronzeville community, all of the curricular and learning resources developed through this RPP will be deployed at a broader city level through this online platform."

The goal of this project is to understand how, in this organism, stem cells can be re-programmed to regenerate a head rather than a tail. This project will generate for the community both scientific resources (for example databases of DNA and protein sequences) and educational resources, including kits that can be used by both schools and universities as aids to teaching stem cell biology.

Professor Seidel is a member of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  This project aims to advance the field of asymmetric catalysis on a fundamental level through exploration of conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of substrate activation. Asymmetric catalysis is the development of small molecules that can achieve high selectivity in chemical reactions - producing a specific product in high prurity. Chiral molecules have a right-handed and left-handed version.  These two mirror image molecules are described as enantiomers. A major goal of this resesarch is the development of reactions that produce enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral ion pairs.  Novel Brnsted acids and hydrogen bond donor catalysts are used to facilitate unprecedented enantioselective processes and address challenging problems. Multifunctional catalysts are being used as a means to achieve enzyme-like catalysis under mild reaction conditions.  The research provides an excellent training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and preparing them for future careers in industry or academia. There is a strong commitment to engage a diverse group of students carrying out this research. <br/><br/>The ability to prepare complex chiral molecules in the most cost-effective way possible is directly dependent on the availability of sustainable synthetic methodologies.  The new synthetic methods that are emerging from this work provide enhanced access to biologically significant, chiral nitrogen containing compounds such as amines, amides, lactams, amino acids and indole containing substances that, in turn, help advance the chemical industry.  Furthermore, this project provides an ideal training ground to prepare the next generation of researchers in the chemical sciences. Students working on this project gain expertise in modern synthetic methods and laboratory techniques while being exposed to an intellectually stimulating and challenging environment that will prepare them for future careers."

One of the important unanswered questions in astronomy is how these galaxies formed and how they change in time.  Our current understanding of structure in the universe suggests that a large galaxy like the Milky Way should actually host a larger number of dwarf satellites than we observe.  To examine whether this is universal or merely a property of our local group, this program will conduct a detailed census of the regions surrounding two of our nearest galactic neighbors.  They will survey two types of galaxy -  spiral, like the Milky Way, and a large elliptical galaxy - and then measure the basic properties of these newly discovered systems. This involves a collaborative effort between three institutions and will use some of the largest and best ground-based telescopes.  All three PIs are active in education and public outreach. PI Sand's institution, Texas Tech University, has a new astrophysics research group and undergraduate concentration.  The science in this proposal will help establish TTU's astrophysics program and reach out to the larger Lubbock community.  In particular, two undergraduate astrophysics students will spend summers in California doing research for the program, allowing them to interact with the larger astrophysics community. PI Guhathakurta is very actively involved with several programs that provide mentoring and research experiences for high-school students.  <br/><br/>The three PIs, along with a postdoctoral researcher and students, will address the observed lack of faint dwarf galaxies associated with the Milky Way and M31 (compared Lambda-CDM  predictions for small-scale structure formation).  Using the Magellan and Keck telescopes, they will conduct a panoramic imaging study to measure the stellar stream and dwarf galaxy content in NGC 253, a Milky Way-like spiral in a filamentary environment, and NGC 5128, a massive central elliptical galaxy.  They will also use Keck+Diemos and newly-developed coaddition techniques to obtain spectra of tidal streams and dwarf galaxies.  If successful, this would enable kinematic and metallicity studies for the first time outside the local group."

This is due to intrinsic hardware latencies from mechanical rotors or electronic phase shifters, or excessive computation time from digital signal processing.  These limitations can fundamentally be overcome by transforming imaging concepts from optics into microwaves, enabling a microwave panoramic camera (MPC). The knowledge and understanding of such integration will lead to a novel category of radars and imaging sensors that can be used for a wide range of sensing applications. The proposed MPC will be applied, in particular, to automotive radar to provide driver assistance, making driving safer and more convenient.  The fast sensing speed and panoramic FOV enabled by MPC-based radars will provide early warning of potential collisions to drivers. Furthermore, the ultrafast frame rate of MPCs will allow differentiation of objects by detecting their Doppler signatures.  With a panoramic FOV, MPCs can also be used in autonomous driving systems requiring constant monitoring of road situations.  The educational component of the proposed work will integrate advanced automotive technologies into undergraduate education by engaging community college students in the Metro Detroit area.   It will be conducted through the University Bound Program, a State of Michigan King-Chavez-Parks (KCP) Initiative.  Community college students, especially those from underrepresented groups, will be encouraged to participate in research activities in antenna and microwave engineering essential for today's automotive radar imaging sensors and telematics. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to transform spectrally encoded confocal microscopy, a fiber-based optical imaging method for high-speed scanning, into the microwave and millimeter-wave regime. This integration will enable the proposed microwave panoramic camera with ultrafast scanning speed and a panoramic field of view. The technical approach relies on the creation of transmission-line based microwave metamaterials, also known as composite right/left-handed transmission lines. By tailoring microwave metamaterials to form a frequency scanned array, a two-dimensional frequency-to-space mapping mechanism can be realized.  Utilizing the two-dimensional angular mapping scheme along with the range information obtained from the reflected signal will result in an image of the scene in three dimensions.  This research will demonstrate the capability to capture a three-dimensional microwave image with 180-degree FOV in both azimuth and elevation, with a frame-rate speed of 1 MHz.  The fast frame refresh rate will allow any Doppler and micro-Doppler effects of moving objects to be captured and exploited for target recognition and identification. Furthermore, by engineering the dispersion characteristics of microwave metamaterials, the proposed MPC can be designed to work in multiple bands, making it feasible to perform dual-band operations for radar systems, such as 24 GHz and 77 GHz automotive radar sensors."

More than a decade of research in hardware security has resulted in a plethora of solutions for these problems, but many of these solutions address specific attack models and, hence, are not universally applicable. This project breaks this barrier by developing hardware design approaches that are both provably secure and applicable across the entire hardware industry for differing businesses and threat models.

The study will identify patterns of successes and failures of Hispanic STEM transfer students and identify factors related to effectiveness of interventions to promote transfer, retention, and graduation of Hispanic STEM undergraduates. This synthesis will contribute to achieving PCAST recommendations for a million more STEM graduates by 2018, supporting efforts within federal agencies to improve the success of under-represented students in STEM, and increasing knowledge about what works based on a comprehensive synthesis of published research.    <br/><br/>The research question guiding this systematic review is: What student and contextual characteristics and interventions have prior studies identified as supporting successful transfer and STEM bachelor's degree completion of Hispanic students who matriculate at two-year institutions?  A preliminary scoping review of several databases yielded 1,328 potential sources to inform this systematic review to develop a framework specific to Hispanic STEM transfer students.  Most retention and transfer work has been based on a framework of social integration. A good example of this framework is: Vincent Tinto, ""Leaving college: Rethinking the causes and cures of student attrition,"" Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993.  This perspective has been found by some to be less relevant to Hispanic students.  An example is the work of Tatiana Melguizo, ""Are community colleges an alternative path for Hispanic students to attain a bachelor's degree?"" Teachers College Record, Volume 110, No. 12, 2008."

Therefore, cell behavior on such surfaces significantly deviate from their in vivo counterparts. There is a pressing need to incorporate the ECM characteristics into stem cell culture technologies. The goal of this research is to advance next-generation cell culture technologies by investigating nanotopographical memory effects of stem cells.<br/><br/>ECM/substrate nanotopography and stiffness critically influence numerous developmental, physiological and pathological processes in vivo, and have a profound influence on cell behavior and stem cell fate decision in vitro.  It is hypothesized that stem cells can retain nanotopographical information from past culture environments and the nanotopographical memory can influence future fate decision of stem cells. The objective of the proposed research is to test this hypothesis and to delineate the underlying mechanism of nanotopographical memory effects. Three research objectives using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) as model cells are proposed to study the nanotopographical memory effects: (1) Regulate Yes-associated protein (YAP) intracellular localization by using nanotopography, (2) Validate nanotopographical memory effects, and (3) Delineate the underlying mechanism of nanotopographical memory effects. This research will advance the understanding of cellular mechanotransduction and stem cell plasticity during developmental and pathological processes.

Such force sensing, monitoring, and mapping are of great interest in smart system-driven healthcare, robotics and military applications. A variety of electronic and optical tactile sensors have been developed to approach the desirable tactile sensing imager with high spatial resolution and great flexibility. However, the major drawback of the state-of-the-art tactile sensors is low spatial resolutions due to their fundamental limitations on the sensor pixel size on the order of sub-centimeter/millimeter. In this work, the investigators will leverage recent advances in quantum-inspired photonics to develop a high spatial resolution tactile sensing system with highly scalable sensor pixels that can monitor strain response at a microscale. Its integration with smart phones can create a compact and portable tactile sensor platform overcoming barriers in low spatial resolution, high cost, and high instrumental complexity of the state-of-the-art tactile sensors. This research is closely integrated with the existing educational activities, providing both undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge science and technology in an innovative way. The investigators also provide educational outreach activities to promote the interests and participations of K-12 students and broaden the participations from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>The primary focus of this research project is to develop novel planar optical systems with optical exceptional points and arrange them on a flexible plastic platform in a chessboard configuration for high spatial resolution tactile sensing and imaging. The optical exceptional point structures, due to their planar nature, can support highly scalable fabrication using the widely used photolithography technique with spatial resolution down to even the microscale in a large area. Based upon a flexible plastic platform, this microscale tactile sensing imager can not only perform high-throughput real-time microscopic strain detection, but also enable simultaneous strain and temperature measurement with a microscopic resolution. The tactile sensor platform can be further integrated with portable electronic devices (e.g. hand-held smart phones), which would create a compact and portable tactile sensor imager platform for real-time detection in microbiology and healthcare, for example, the detection of mechanical properties of biomolecules. The principal investigators have highly complementary expertise in optics theory, advanced micro/nanofabrication technology, and device integration to design and fabricate the unique portable high spatial resolution tactile sensing platform based on novel optical exceptional point structures. The realized tactile sensing systems are expected to represent an important technological breakthrough in strain sensing, mapping and monitoring at a microscale with sensitivities orders of magnitude better than the state-of-the-art tactile sensors."

Construction and infrastructure projects consist of interconnected networks of people, equipment, and materials. Most often, finding optimal work strategies, and making timely operational decisions that lead to maximum productivity while minimizing project completion cost and time is not trivial. Unlike manufacturing and industrial systems, construction projects involve dynamic (constantly evolving) layouts, complex resource interactions, uncertainties in workflows and processes, and unforeseen conditions that can result in deviations from plans and unwanted delays. Figures show that only 30 percent of construction projects finish on time and within budget. Therefore, the accuracy and timeliness of operational-level decision-making in construction projects is of utmost importance. This award supports fundamental research to enhance construction decision-making accuracy by reducing uncertainties through the seamless integration of process-level data into decision-making. This will be achieved by building the theoretical foundation and significantly advancing the current state of construction simulation modeling through enabling real-time interaction with a simulation model as the real project evolves, and communicating the simulation output through a feedback loop to steer the events in the real project. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and the society since it leads to better decision-making which results in reducing waste, rework, cost, time, and ensures safety. The multi-disciplinary nature of this project will help broaden participation of underrepresented and diverse student groups in integrated research and pedagogical activities, and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The knowledge-based simulation modeling framework in this project enables process-level models to autonomously learn from and adapt to ever-changing and evolving construction systems. Process-level knowledge that serves as the input of such simulation models is obtained from ubiquitous sensory data that describe relationships, interactions, and uncertainty attributes of field processes, and enable the generation and maintenance of more accurate simulation models. In doing so, some scientific barriers are yet to be overcome to realize the full accreditation and application of this framework. The research team will design and test methods that draw from data mining, machine learning, forecasting, and control to fill the existing knowledge gaps in capturing and mining complex data and meta-data from equipment and human crew interactions. The resulting process-level knowledge will be rich enough to describe, model, analyze, and project the uncertainties of construction systems at any point in time and consequently help adjust resource allocations and operational scenarios on the job site."

Real-life survey data often are unrepresentative due to selection bias and nonresponse.  Existing methods for adjusting for known differences between the sample and population from which the sample is drawn have some advantages but also practical limitations.  Classical weights are subject to large variability and can result in unstable estimators, while regression approaches present computational and modeling challenges.  The new framework developed by these investigators will allow adjustment for selection bias and nonresponse as well as improvements in design-respecting inference.  Using this approach, survey analysts will be able to properly account for non-ignorable design issues in the regression framework, and practitioners who conduct surveys in government, academic, commercial, and non-profit sectors will be able to construct statistically efficient survey weights in a routine manner.  This new framework may be applicable to problems resulting from the newly emerging explosion of ""big data,"" such as integration of surveys from multiple sources, analysis of streaming data, and respondent-driven sampling.  The project will develop software that can be accessed by the general research community. <br/><br/>This research project will connect survey weighting with poststratification under the framework of MRP.  In MRP, data are partially pooled during the modeling process and then local estimates are combined via poststratification to obtain the population inference.  This smoothed estimation borrows information from neighboring poststratification cells and allows flexible multilevel modeling strategies that have the potential to be robust to model misspecification.  The project generalizes MRP to handle weighting adjustments for regression, deep interactions, calibration for non-census variables, complex survey design, multistage sampling, multiple survey frames, and other complications that arise in real-world survey analysis.  The new methods will be applied to two ongoing surveys, the New York Longitudinal Poverty Measure study and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study.  Computations will be performed using the open source Bayesian program Stan and will be freely disseminated.

The concept of a phase of matter allows one to account for drastically different physical properties in systems made out of the same underlying constituents, e.g. the liquid and solid ice forms of water.  Solid state materials can also typically come in one of several phases - e.g. metal versus insulator, or magnetic versus non-magnetic - and much of their usefulness derives from exploiting the different physical properties characteristic of such phases.  A theoretical framework for understanding the organization of constituents of materials into phases, ""ordering"" that materials undergo when they transform into a phase, was established over 50 years ago and had proven extremely successful until exotic new phases - called fractional quantum Hall effect states - were discovered.  These states, found when electrons are confined to two dimensions and are placed in large perpendicular magnetic fields, did not fit into the old theoretical framework and possess striking new physical properties that currently go under the name of ""topological order"". <br/> <br/>This research is aimed to advance fundamental understanding of topological phases and how the classification of topologically ordered phases is enriched when additional symmetries are present.  For example: topological insulators, which differ from ordinary insulators by the necessary existence of a metallic state at the surface, can exist because reversing the direction of time leads to a state that looks the same as the original one. This time reversal symmetry is not obeyed by a simple ferromagnet for which time reversal flips the direction of magnetism.  The research will address important questions:  What interesting properties can arise with other symmetries present, or with combinations of such symmetries?  How robust are they?  Are there any such phases that have no analogue in conventional solid-state materials?  Can the quantum mechanical connectedness of spatially separated parts of such phases be exploited to store or manipulate quantum information for future information technology?  The PI will investigate these questions using analytical techniques and novel mathematical methods.<br/><br/>This award also supports education and outreach activities including: the development of a new one-semester course focused on topological order at the advanced graduate students level; the PI will present lectures related to the research area to high school students through a program organized at Stony Brook university; the PI will organize a once-a-month physics lecture series aimed at the broader community, which will bring in outside speakers to introduce the audience to cutting-edge research in this and related fields.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education to identify and classify new phases of matter, termed topological phases, with a specific focus on how symmetries enrich possible topological phases.  Although topological order is robust and independent of any global symmetries, the inclusion of symmetries can lead to additional phases, for example the recently discovered topological insulators, which are robust only when time reversal symmetry is present.  The PI will use analytical techniques, including those from algebraic topology, to pursue several research directions:<br/><br/>1) Classifying symmetry-enriched phases for physically realistic symmetry groups, e.g. continuous, anti-unitary, and spatial symmetries, generalizing results for finite discrete symmetry groups.<br/>2) Classifying both symmetry-enriched and symmetry-protected phases involving fundamental fermion degrees of freedom.  This research will focus on the stability of such phases accessible through the band framework, as well as on the search for inherently strongly interacting phases.<br/>3) Constructing many-body invariants, which distinguish among the states in such a classification.  In particular, the PI will explore the connection between non-trivial symmetry-protected phases and anomalies in one lower dimension.<br/>4) Constructing a unified mathematical framework, based on topological quantum field theory, to tackle the above classification problems.<br/><br/>This award also supports education and outreach activities including: the development of a new one-semester course focused on topological order at the advanced graduate students level; the PI will present lectures related to the research area to high school students through a program organized at Stony Brook university; the PI will organize a once-a-month physics lecture series aimed at the broader community, which will bring in outside speakers to introduce the audience to cutting-edge research in this and related fields."

Interactions among engineering, organizational, and behavioral factors and incentives determine building energy use and related environmental sustainability, and potentially cause divergence between true energy performance and theoretically possible performance. There has been increasing investment in energy efficient commercial building designs and technologies. Among the studies that conduct statistical post-occupancy evaluations (POE), there has been debate about whether ""green"" commercial buildings (i.e. LEED buildings) actually save energy or not, and this casts doubt on their energy sustainability. Evaluating the true energy performance of green commercial buildings requires empirical analysis of long data histories and larger sample sizes. To understand a complete picture of energy sustainability, social factors such as organizational management and occupant behaviors, as well as environmental and economic impacts of energy use, must be studied. Additionally, evaluating the effects of these factors on the timing of building energy use (i.e. peak hours versus non-peak hours) is essential to understand environmental (i.e. carbon) costs of electricity consumption. This project will conduct such holistic energy sustainability analysis using a comprehensive building energy dataset in a city (Phoenix) that is typical of energy use patterns in many of the world's rapidly growing hot and dry urban areas. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project will: 1) provide reliable statistical evidence of the true energy performance of green commercial buildings based on large datasets; 2) quantify the impact of green commercial buildings on power grid load profiles and electricity generation fuel mix; 3) apply surveys to quantify engineering, organizational, and behavioral factors that determine observed building energy performance; and 4) evaluate the systemic environmental and economic impacts of green commercial buildings in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The project will advance engineering research into energy sustainability of green commercial buildings through a novel ""big data"" empirical approach. First, this project will analyze much larger and reliable datasets of commercial buildings than previously studied, including historical electricity consumption and other key building level attributes. The dataset contains more than 700 Energy Star and LEED commercial buildings, and more than 17,000 total commercial electric customers. Second, compared to existing POE studies, this project adopts more rigorous and advanced statistical analysis including matching, panel regression, and nonparametric modelling. Importantly, this project uses much more credible control groups. Third, this project will provide the first empirically reliable evidence of how green building technologies impact environmental footprints by time of day and season, which are critical for determining environmental costs associated with electricity consumption. Finally, this project will empirically explore the interrelated factors in the coupled human-environmental systems including engineering (e.g. technical reliability and compatibility), organizational (e.g. principal-agent problem), and behavioral (e.g. bounded rationality) factors that influence the observed energy performance of commercial buildings and the impact on environmental sustainability. The insights produced may be directly implemented by practitioners including state energy policy makers, city environment planners, energy service companies, building engineers, building owners, and utility companies."

The films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy using tetra(germyl)methane (4GeMe) as a precursor, which is synthesized in electronic grade by the team. The specific tasks are: (1) Experimental verification of band anticrossing in Ge:C and related alloys; (2) ab-initio simulations of band structure and desirable compositions for Ge:C materials; (3) Growth of highly crystalline Ge:C with minimal interstitials or other unwanted defects; and (4) Growth with pseudo/surfactants for substitutional C, and demonstrating direct bandgap emission. The advantage of the 4GeMe precursor is that it pre-bonds each C atom to four Ge atoms, preventing undesirable carbon-carbon bonds at the substrate surface. By eliminating these defects, this study provides direct experimental demonstration on highly mismatched alloys with small bandgaps and enables the predictive modeling to design related highly mismatched alloys with high optical gain and suppressed Auger recombination. This experiment and theory combined project closes the knowledge gap between the thin film growth and modeling of the Ge:C thin film systems, and provides  a chemical route to grow highly crystalline Ge:C with direct bandgap and high optical gain."

However, progress depends upon innovative policy solutions to society's problems. The transmission of laws and regulations across political boundaries averts a conflict between the incentives for innovation and consistency.  The current project will offer a database that allows the tracking of the spread of policies through the US states. The database will be disseminated through project webpages. The web interface will also include advanced analytics that illuminate the pathways through which policies spread. Users will be able to download the data and software for their own custom analysis of policy transmission in the US states. <br/><br/>Policy diffusion has been a topic of focus across the social sciences for several decades, but due to limitations of data and computational technology, researchers have not taken a comprehensive look at patterns of diffusion across many different policies. The investigators propose to combine cutting-edge methods of text and network analysis to understand how policies, as represented in digitized text, spread through networks connecting the American states. The investigators will develop both data and computational methods that address the most pressing limitations to the study of policy diffusion networks. The project will result in two key contributions: (1) a comprehensive source of data with which to track the movement of policies from one state government to another, across three governing branches, and (2) a user-friendly, open source software package for understanding and visualizing diffusion networks from digitized records of policies. These resources will help researchers, public officials, advocacy groups, and other relevant stakeholders understand how to balance the competing goals of innovation and consistency in public policy."

Some strategies take the form of overt and direct criticism of states to punish and deter repression of citizens, known as ""naming and shaming"".  Other strategies involve positive cooperation with governments to change legal and de facto protections of rights and freedoms. To date, we know little about which strategy is more effective, because systematic research on this topic has ignored direct collaboration between these organizations and states. Instead, there has been a recent explosion in the number of social science studies examining the efficacy of contentious strategies.  This research will provide new insight into whether such cooperative strategies are an effective means to improve human rights and social conditions.<br/> <br/>This project is the first to analyze the large-scale digital communications from human rights non-governmental organizations (HR NGOs) to understand the specific issues and contexts where cooperation can be successfully implemented. The researchers will demonstrate the usefulness of this approach through quantitative text analysis procedure analyzing a wide range of digitally available information (i.e. press releases, published reports, newsletters, and social media posts from multiple HR NGOs).  These are an especially rich source of information as they contain both cooperative and confrontational signals to states. The research team plans to build theoretically informed models that predict 1) the issues and circumstances that provide incentives for government-HR NGO partnerships versus public criticism known as ""naming and shaming,"" and 2) when particular HR NGO strategies ultimately lead to the desired changes in state behavior. This research has the potential to enhance the well-being of society by providing a better understanding of strategies that improve human rights performance around the world.  It is also poised to make an important contribution in helping to foster collaboration between the social sciences and other STEM disciplines."

Projects are now beginning to measure the internal structure and motions in these fascinating systems, and so the time is right to carry out theoretical work capable of understanding these observations.  This project will produce a comprehensive suite of galaxy merger simulations and turn them into simulated images and velocity maps to guide the interpretation of forthcoming data.  The research connects a primarily undergraduate institution with cutting edge, world class theorists and observers, providing valuable experiences for under-represented college and high school students.<br/><br/>This research will employ state-of-the-art numerical simulations to investigate the internal structure and kinematics of interacting galaxies.  For the first time, observations in the Local Universe are measuring these characteristics with exquisite detail, and for a large number of systems, using deep imaging and integral-field spectroscopy.  The PI and collaborators will use the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) model to construct a comprehensive suite of galaxy merger simulations, resolving Giant Molecular Clouds and the Interstellar Medium, and directly implementing star-formation and feedback physics.  Post-processing by radiative-transfer codes will create synthetic images resembling real galaxies, which will be classified both visually and with automated schemes.  Along with kinematic maps, these will support planned observational projects.  This three-pronged design of visual, automated and kinematic classification will help to overcome any obstacles.  All theoretical tools have been fully tested, and undergraduate mentoring plans already exist using two postdocs and a graduate student.  Considerable efforts are being made to recruit under-represented students from local state universities and community colleges, using two existing frameworks, and allowing them to work with a world-class team of theorists and observers.  The project also involves high school teachers and students from the local under-served Hispanic community, aided by the PI's native language being Spanish."

However, a wide range of evidence now demonstrates that this theory is not able to explain how many people make certain specific kinds of decisions -- for example, the highest price someone is willing to pay for an object is often lower than the lowest price he or she is willing to accept to go without the same object. This award will fund the PI's continued efforts to develop alternative models of behavior based on the idea that individuals may not be able to compare all options; in other words, people have incomplete preferences. The PI plans to consider whether and how this theory can account for a range of document decision making behaviors. He also plans to conduct decision making experiments in a lab environment to test hypotheses drawn from the theory. The results will advance our scientific understanding of this kind of human decision-making, and could be useful to businesses and governments that need to predict how individuals will respond to new products and policies.<br/><br/>The research will focus on developing a model in which subjects' preferences may be incomplete, and using that model to analyze several specific biases in decision making: the gap between willingness to accept and willingness to pay, certainty effects, decision in stochastic environments, and intertemporal choice. The goal is to provide axiomatic characterizations of models in which subjects chose to randomize, including a special case where the desire to randomize comes from the agents' uncertainty about her own utility of consumption. The project will also include work on preferences on lotteries over consumption streams and will introduce an axiom that captures aversion to variability of consumption over time."

The importance of understanding the reasons for this condition at a fundamental level is very significant, since this condition that can sometimes result in deaths.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to advance the fundamental knowledge of biological fluid dynamics in prediction and control of human snoring through a combined physiology-based modeling, physics-based simulation, analysis, verification, and optimization approach. This approach is also applicable to a wide range of engineering and biological systems, such as noise reduction and phonation. There are mainly two objectives: (1) to develop a methodology for unveiling the flow physics and sound-producing mechanism of biological fluid-structure coupling problems and (2) to use the methodology for the investigation of optimal intervention procedures in order to ease the vortex-induced snore symptoms towards a better quality of life. The proposed work is highly interdisciplinary and involves fundamental scientific problems in the fields of biology, physics, physiology, and engineering. Snoring is an audible sign coded with richness of information about human respiratory functions. The sound comes from a complex interaction between compliant airway structures and the transient vortex shedding which is induced by the narrowing of the airway passage. However, the specific snore source mechanisms are still elusive, despite the significant in vitro and clinical efforts. Physics-based numerical investigation of the snore source will promise to quantify the relationship between the nonlinear response of the flexible airways and the respiratory vortex dynamics for sound generation. Currently, snore source diagnosis relies on expensive and time-consuming procedures that are outsourced to special analytical laboratories. Such challenges in performing in vivo and in vitro snore diagnosis will make the numerical methods ideal investigative tools. The PIs propose to systematically study the snore-producing mechanisms of different age and gender groups, paying particular attention to the underlying physics of biological fluid-structure interaction and associated sound sources. This is to be accomplished through the use of a combined modeling, simulation, analysis, validation, and optimization approach. The findings from the proposed research could provide pre-surgical guidelines for alleviating the apnea-causing factors by minimizing sound production of the system. Findings from this work could be used by acoustic experts and respiratory therapists for understanding the sound source production and control from its biological origin. The theories developed from this research will promote accurate diagnosis of snore sources and effective treatment of patients with snoring or other respiratory disorders. The research work will also be the central theme in a multi-level education program in which: (1) PIs will continue to provide summer undergraduate research experience to attract and retain engineering students from under-represented groups; (2) the proposed methodology will be incorporated into the PIs' existing graduate level course on bio-inspired flow and respiratory aerosol dynamics; and (3) an educational lab curriculum in snore specialty will be developed to provide multi-disciplinary training and research opportunities for high-school and college students and to support biomedical and bio-inspired engineering programs in both University of Virginia and Central Michigan University"

Both technical and conceptual limits have prevented the collection and analysis of rich empirical datasets with high temporal frequency over large spatial extents necessary to investigate how changes to seasonal precipitation patterns are affecting food security.  This research project will transform both methodological and conceptual frameworks for assessing the sustainability of dryland agricultural systems.  The research will bring new understanding of how dryland farmers adapt to within-season variability in climate and how those adaptations affect their current and future resilience to climate variability and climate change.  Project findings will improve forecast models used to monitor and predict the sustainability of water-dependent agricultural systems.  By marrying the simple idea of cell phone adoption with state-of-art research in data science, crop prediction, and environmental/social monitoring, the project will advance and accelerate scientific understanding of an important global sustainability problem.<br/><br/>This project will focus on characterizing the nature and impact of intra-seasonal smallholder decision making on adaptation to climate variability in semi-arid agricultural systems. Specifically, the research addresses three critical research questions: (1) How do intra-seasonal dynamics of both the environment and social systems shape farmer adaptive capacity? (2) To what extent does intra-seasonal decision making enable farmers to adapt to climate uncertainty? and (3) How can intra-seasonal data improve the ability to model, predict, and improve adaptation to climate variability in ways that enhance food security?  The research team will integrate physical models of hydrological and agricultural dynamics with real-time environmental data and weekly farmer decision making in individual fields.  These real-time data are obtained from previously-developed novel cellular-based environmental sensing pods coupled to real-time reports of farmer decision making submitted via cell phones.  The team will use a combination of environmental and social data to develop a suite of modeling tools for understanding how climate variability impacts the sustainability of agricultural systems in the study regions.  The research team also will develop modeling tools for improved forecasts of food security capable of producing new understandings of the intra-seasonal dynamics of both social and environmental processes. Although the test bed for this research is the Southern Province of Zambia and portions of the Rift Valley and Central Provinces of Kenya centered around the Laikipia District, the results may well be broadly applicable to other semi-arid and arid regions of the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Buildings are the largest sector and therefore an attractive target of these efforts: current Federal sustainability goals mandate that 50% of U.S.commercial buildings become net-zero energy by 2050. A range of options exists to achieve this goal, but financial concerns require a data-driven, empirically-validated approach. However, critical gaps exist in the energy and water measurement technology, and indoorclimate control science, needed to benchmark competing options, prioritize efficiency investments, and ensure occupant comfort.<br/><br/>To address these challenges, this project proposes a new kind of ""peel-and-stick"" sensor that can be affixed to everyday objects to infer their contributions to whole-building resource consumption. To use the sensors, occupants or building managers simply tag end loads like a ceiling light, shower head, or range top. The sensors monitor the ambient conditions around a load and, using statistical methods,correlate those conditions with readings from existing electricity, gas, or water meters, providing individual estimates without intrusive metering. The sensors are built from integrated circuit technology laminated into smart labels, so they are small, inexpensive, and easy-to-deploy. The sensors are powered by the same ambient signals they sense, eliminating the need for periodic battery replacement or wall power. Collectively, these properties address cost and coverage challenges, and enable scalable deployment and widespread adoption.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal stems from the insight that the transfer and use of energy (and other resources) usually emits energy, often in a different domain, and that this emitted energy is often enough to intermittently power simple, energy-harvesting sensors whose duty cycle is proportional to the energy being transferred or used. Hence, the mere activation rate of the sensors signalsthe underlying energy use. The power-proportional relationship between usage activity and side channel harvesting, when coupled with state-of-the art, millimeter-scale, nano-power chips and whole-house or panel-level meters, enables small and inexpensive sensor tags that are pervasively distributed with unbounded lifetimes. But, networking and tasking them, and making sense of their data, requires a fundamental rethinking of low-power communications, control, and data fusion to abstract the intermittent, unreliable, and noisy sensor infrastructure into actionable information.<br/><br/>This project's broader impact stems from an integrated program of education, research, and outreach that (i) creates a smart objects focused curriculum whose classroom projects are motivated by research needs, (ii) provides research experiences for undergraduates and<br/>underrepresented minorities, (iii) mentors students on all aspects of successful research from articulating hypotheses to peer-reviewing papers,(iv) disseminates teaching materials on embedded systems and research pedagogy, (v) produces students who bridge disciplines,operating at the intersection of measurement science, information technology, and sustainability policy, and (vi) translates scientific discovery and technical knowledge into beneficial commercial products through industry outreach and internships, and (vii) engages with the National Labs to ensure that the research addresses pressing problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
