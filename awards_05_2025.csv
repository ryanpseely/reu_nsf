However, comprehensive studies of floral scents across many tropical plant species and their insect pollinators are scarce. This IRES program provides U.S. undergraduates and graduate students an opportunity to engage in collaborative international research in Colombia while addressing key questions in tropical pollination biology and evolutionary ecology. Students receive mentorship and training from researchers at four Colombian universities, the Missouri Botanical Garden and Case Western Reserve University. This program increases access to international research experiences for U.S. students, inspires students? interest in pursuing science careers and trains the next generation of global scientists. Findings from student research projects contribute to our understanding of how floral scent preferences of insect pollinators influence tropical plants coexistence and diversification.<br/><br/>Insect pollinators exhibit preferences for distinct floral scents, often specializing on a subset of available flowers. In tropical forests, where many species coexist and flower simultaneously, even subtle differences in floral scents can enhance pollinator constancy and contribute to the formation of reproductive barriers. This project investigates how pollinator specialization, through floral scent preferences, influences ecological interactions among coexisting species and shapes diversification patterns in tropical plants, using the genus Anthurium as a study system. This IRES program provides a high-quality international collaborative research experience to cohorts of six U.S. students each year. Each student participates in three program elements, a virtual pre-departure program focused on preparations for international travel and research, an eight-week international research experience in Colombia where students take part in training bootcamps and perform data collection in field sites, and a virtual post-travel program focused on career development, data analysis, and research dissemination. Students receive mentorship and training from researchers at four Colombian universities and U.S.-based researchers at the Missouri Botanical Garden and Case Western Reserve University. Each Colombian researcher supervises and mentors one to two students per year. Results from student projects help in understanding the role of floral scents in attracting, maintaining fidelity, and ensuring specificity of insect pollinators, as well as demonstrate how ecological interactions between tropical plants and their pollinators can translate into distinctive patterns of diversification. These results advance our understanding of fundamental questions in tropical plant pollination biology and evolutionary ecology, with potential practical applications for the Anthurium horticultural industry. This program aims to expand access to international research experiences for students with limited research opportunities, increase student interest in pursuing science careers by promoting academic and professional preparedness, and train the next generation of global scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. The marine subsurface biosphere is the least explored biome on Earth. Studying microbes that live in this vast habitat enhances our understanding of global biogeochemical cycles and can support efforts to store excess carbon in seafloor sediment. Mounting evidence suggests eukaryotes are ecologically important in marine sediments, yet limited sampling of subseafloor eukaryotes has made it difficult to estimate their contributions to nutrient cycling and their potential to sequester sunken organic matter (OM) into the sediment. Investigating these microbes is critical as the composition of subsurface sediment changes. Increasing terrestrial runoff is adding more land-derived OM to marine sediments, and microbes? response to inputs of different origin may impact the global carbon cycle. To address these questions, the fellow will analyze microbial communities in sediment cores collected along a transect from the shallow Puerto Rico continental shelf to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. The results will provide critical data needed to identify which seafloor zones are most likely to permanently store sunken carbon. Undergraduate and high school students will be mentored throughout the project, and a new museum exhibit will be created to share these discoveries with the public at the Woods Hole Ocean Science Discovery Center.<br/><br/>The communities in ten sediment cores spanning all major oceanic water-depth zones (sublittoral, bathyal, abyssal and hadal) will be characterized down to 10 meters below the seafloor. The fellow will first determine the extent of terrestrial OM deposition along the Puerto Rico continental slope, quantifying its incorporation into marine sediments using carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements alongside radioanalytical total sedimentation rate analysis. This dataset, combined with core depth and porewater nutrient data collected during coring, provides essential ecological context. DNA will then be extracted from sediment samples and marker gene sequencing, or metabarcoding, will be used to describe the subsurface eukaryotic community structure along this continental shelf gradient. Extracted RNA and metatranscriptomics will be used to examine eukaryotic activities, assessing their potential for carbon remineralization and contribution to global carbon cycling. These results will address significant gaps in our knowledge of carbon distribution and cycling on Earth, and how these may change as OM inputs to marine sediment increase. Additionally, the project will provide the fellow with advanced training in bioinformatics and subsurface biology and geophysics, as well as hands-on teaching experience through hosting an on-site workshop and the publication of related methodological materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop will bring together 35 early-career mathematicians to facilitate collaborative research and training. The workshop will provide an unparalleled opportunity for young researchers who use the tools of homotopy theory to develop long-lasting and meaningful international collaborations. The award will allow US-based researchers to be involved in this unique opportunity.  The organizers have secured funding for the conference through the ICMS covering most conference costs and this National Science Foundation grant will specifically fund travel to the conference for US-based mathematicians. Participation of US-based mathematicians will be beneficial to the progress of not only homotopy theory research in the US, but also to mathematical progress in many adjacent disciplines.  <br/><br/>Homotopical techniques originated in algebraic topology and homological algebra, but in recent years more broad applications of homotopy theory abound. For example, homotopical tools and ideas play a major work in the influential work of Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze on  integral p-adic Hodge theory; work of Scholze?Clausen on condensed mathematics; work of Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel on the Kervaire invariant one problem; and a resolution of a conjecture of Grothendieck by Carlson?Haine?Wolf. These examples highlight the timeliness and importance of promoting research collaborations amongst young homotopy theorists. With this in mind, the conference will be organized to provide a research collaboration launching pad for participants. The conference will feature thirteen talks by participants, providing an opportunity for participants to share and discuss their work to their peers. Amongst the speakers are the four invited early-career speakers: Robert Burklund (Copenhagen), Peter Haine (Berkeley), Alice Hedenlund (Uppsala), and Lucy Yang (Columbia). <br/><br/>The conference will also include two mini-courses by Clark Barwick and Piotr Pstr?gowski. The mini-course topics will bring participants to the forefront of these active research areas, creating a pathway to engage new scholars. There will be two evening lightning sessions, where participants can give ten- to fifteen-minute talks showcasing their research, and there will be a poster session on Monday. The conference schedule will also allow ample time for informal discussion.

The growing asymmetry in the cost of executing such attacks, which are conducted by organized crime and nation-state actors, versus defending against them has created a critical vulnerability that not only threatens individuals, but also technology companies, financial institutions, and the national security of the United States. This project uses defensive artificial intelligence technology to address this imbalance by intercepting, tracing, and aggregating the largest source of information about social engineering attacks as they happen, providing a valuable, real time data stream for the cybersecurity industry, government, and consumer protection initiatives. The successful commercialization of the proposed technology will help shift the cybersecurity paradigm from reactive damage control to proactive prevention, reducing fraud-related expenditures, enhancing consumer confidence, and providing a critical layer of protection against the fastest-growing form of cybercrime.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the growing threat of social engineering cyber-attacks, which exploit human vulnerabilities rather than technological weaknesses to commit fraud, conduct espionage, and manipulate organizations. Traditional cybersecurity measures struggle to detect and mitigate these attacks due to their conversational and psychological nature, leaving individuals, businesses, and government agencies at risk. The opportunity lies in developing an automated, scalable intelligence-gathering system capable of infiltrating and mapping cybercriminal networks in real time. This project proposes a novel approach using interactive artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot investigators, powered by large language models (LLMs), to engage with social engineering scammers and trace their tactics, techniques, and procedures across platforms. By simulating potential victims, these chatbot investigators will extract structured intelligence from attackers while maintaining consistency over extended time periods. Key research objectives include developing novel natural language processing techniques to create an AI agent that can autonomously engage with social engineering threats and a system capable of deploying chatbot networks across a wide variety of communication surfaces for large-scale threat intelligence. The anticipated results include a robust, scalable system for cyber threat mapping, significantly improving the ability to detect, analyze, and counteract social engineering scams at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disinfection helps keep the water safe and clean. However, some disinfection byproducts (DBPs) can be harmful. These DBPs form when water treatment plants use chemicals like chlorine to kill germs. There are many different DBPs, and identifying all of them would be costly and difficult for water treatment plants. This project will use machine learning (ML) to identify the toxicity of DBPs in drinking water and develop strategies for reducing the presence of high-risk DBPs in drinking water treatment. The results from the project will improve drinking water safety and public health. The project will train students to use AI and data to solve problems of water quality. The project will mentor graduate and undergraduate students at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, preparing them for future careers in science, engineering, and data science.<br/><br/>Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are a group of chemicals formed during the water disinfection process when disinfectants such as chlorine react with organic matter in water.

The considerable number of DBPs, coupled with limited data on their occurrence and toxicity, complicates efforts to determine which DBPs should be prioritized for future studies and regulations. Current methods for assessing DBP risks rely on limited occurrence and toxicological data and thus face challenges in effectively identifying which DBPs need the most attention. This project will integrate machine learning (ML) and laboratory experiments to (1) create a databases for both regulated and unregulated DBPs, addressing critical gaps in available occurrence and toxicity data, (2) prioritize high-risk DBPs by analyzing their occurrence frequency, levels, and toxicity, based on their potential health impacts, and (3) develop predictive tools for high-risk DBPs, enabling more informed decision-making for future regulations and water treatment strategies. The results of the project will contribute to minimizing harmful DBPs in drinking water and improving public health. The educational activities from this project include creating student-led STEM summer camps for K-12 students, developing scaffolded educational modules to develop ML literacy in students, and conducting workshops for students on navigating graduate studies. The successful completion of this project will help advance the design and implementation of data-driven solutions in environmental engineering, contributing to improved water quality, public health, and the development of future scientific leaders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The imminent opening of the northern oceans to navigation, science, and industry is an event of historical significance. Governments, corporations and communities are already planning for these changes. Of particular interest are undersea deposits of critical minerals essential to the supply chains of semiconductors and other technologies used in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and energy transitions. While it is certain that a new rush to the North is well underway, we know little about: 1) the wider dimensions of seafloor critical mineral mining in the Arctic; 2) how its hazards, risks, and benefits are being understood and distributed; and 3) how planning for this maritime industry is related to the national security concerns, infrastructure development, and economic changes that are shaping Arctic futures. More social scientific research is needed into these topics of broad importance for the United States. <br/><br/>This planning project supports the activities needed to organize a future study about the initiation of undersea critical mineral mining in the new Arctic maritime frontier. It answers the questions: Why is the rise of this maritime industry significant and deserving of social scientific research? And what will it take to launch the first longitudinal and interdisciplinary study about the ways that undersea critical mineral mining and its impacts are coming into focus along the Western Alaskan coast? To assess the feasibility for later research, this planning project identifies high priority issues for investigation and tests how to build a team of experts and stakeholders best suited to explore these concerns. This project will thus advance understandings of all four priority areas of the U.S. Arctic Research Plan 2022-2026, as it lays the foundation for successful research into issues related to complex systemic interactions, community resilience and health, risk and hazard mitigation, and economies and livelihoods in the Arctic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding why this is happening, and how we can help, requires long-term data on their interactions with plants. However, historical records of these relationships are rare. The research team has uncovered a unique dataset from over 50 years ago, documenting thousands of plant-pollinator interactions across California, from coastal regions to mountain peaks. By revisiting these locations and comparing past and present data, the team will investigate how pollinator communities have changed over time and which species are most at risk. This study is the first to examine multiple locations, providing critical insights into how long-term environmental change reshapes communities. By making data publicly available and collaborating with community scientists, the research will help ensure ongoing monitoring of pollinators in California. The study will also provide hands-on learning experiences for students and volunteers, fostering the next generation of environmental scientists. Given California?s role as a global bee biodiversity hotspot and key pollinator-dependent agricultural area, the insights gained from this research will have far-reaching implications for pollinator conservation and food security.<br/>The research will provide the first multi-site, longitudinal study of the interacting effects of environmental change stressors on plant-pollinator interactions. The research will answer three key questions: (1) How have plant and pollinator communities changed over the past half-century? (2) Do certain species? interaction patterns make them more vulnerable to environmental changes? (3) How can public interest in pollinators help engage and educate future conservationists?   To address these questions, the researchers will facilitate community and student involvement in testing hypotheses related to the theories of interacting stressors, biodiversity, and ecosystem function and how species interactions affect population vulnerability.  The research will use standardized surveys, network analyses, and structural equation modeling to quantify 50-year changes in plant?pollinator communities.  Because the research investigates communities of plants and pollinators, two ecologically distinct and ubiquitous taxa across terrestrial ecosystem, this proposed research will yield a generalizable framework for understanding the influence of environmental change across other interacting species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing networks on urban resilience are often shaped by their regional, disciplinary and social contexts. The objectives this AccelNet Implementation (Phase 1) project are to (i) build strategic links among disciplinarily and geographically comprehensive U.S. and international networks, called Resilient-NET, to synergize complementary scientific expertise, and provide its members the critical access to data, platforms, pilot projects and research capabilities, and (ii) prepare the U.S. students and early-career researchers to solve future urban resilience problems, strengthen their global leadership skills through collaborations. Major networks to be connected include the Singapore-Switzerland-Netherlands network on future urban resilience, U.S. Extreme Events Research (EER) networks, International and U.S. networks in AI research, U.S. geospatial research network, U.S. logistics and supply chain resilience network, and Global South network. This project will generate an OPEN-NET platform for data sharing, focused research groups and projects, annual workshops, bi-annual symposiums, major workforce development activities including scholar/student visit. By consolidating a roadmap towards future resilient urban eco systems and nurturing future workforce in urban resilience, Resilient-NET will make long-lasting impacts on the livability and economic viability of future U.S. cities with a scope and magnitude beyond the capabilities of a single research community.<br/><br/>Resilient-NET will take a holistic perspective with a special focus on the complex interactions among technology, people and environment. (i) The technology aspect (i.e., the New Dimension) will focus on the increasingly prevalent integration of AI-enabled systems into urban infrastructure and mobility systems. At the dawn of large-scale AI implementations in the next decade, the proposed activities will identify inherent vulnerabilities and key performance characteristics for AI-enabled urban systems, ensure resilience of emerging urban mobility systems, and identify a research agenda for effective and safe system-system interactions. (ii) The people aspect (i.e., the Missing Puzzle) will enhance our understanding on the increasingly complex interactions between humans and technology, as a singular focus on the technology aspect will not automatically build resilience into our societies.  (iii) The environment aspect (i.e., the Uncertainty Accelerator) will focus on the increasingly frequent extreme natural events that simultaneously impose vulnerabilities and uncertainties on urban socio-technical systems, and will identify the solutions for data-driven disaster preparedness, urban digital twin, and the predictive capabilities for compound cascading extreme natural events. In summary, the integrated techno-socio-climate approach adopted by this project will enable our societies as well as research communities to better understand the complicated technology-human interactions, identify research gaps, priorities and solutions in trustworthy AI technologies and quantitative social resilience research for different social entities in relation to infrastructural resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-term goal is to develop new ways to change and repair brain circuits, which will help understand how to treat brain disorders. The project will use zebrafish larvae as a model system to demonstrate that signals can be transferred from a healthy brain to a damaged one with the goal of rebuilding the malfunctioning circuits. The project will engage students and the public in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) activities. Local high school students will help build novel brain interfaces to demonstrate control over zebrafish movement. College students will create interfaces to demonstrate signal transfer between zebrafish and robots. These activities will be shared through educational videos and outreach events that will allow the community to learn more about neurons and brain.

The project will develop a new method to manipulate neural circuit development by transferring and replicating neural signals from one brain to another using an optogenetic actuator and a neural activity indicator in zebrafish larvae and demonstrate a functionally and structurally replicated brain. By demonstrating the feasibility of replicating neural signals and mitigating malfunctioning circuits in zebrafish larvae, this research will lay the groundwork for future research in the field of neural circuit restoration.

These conferences will bring together graduate students working on their masters or Ph.D.s, postdoctoral researchers, early-career researchers, and established experts in Quantum Symmetries to catalyze research progress by disseminating recent discoveries in the field, sharing open problems, hosting new and ongoing collaborations, and mentoring early-career participants. By creating a network of researchers amongst the participants, the conference series will strengthen ties between regional institutions and support the breadth of subtopics being investigated in the region as well as the range of personnel performing these investigations. The topic of these conferences is Quantum Symmetry broadly viewed, but anchored in the mathematics modeling quantum behavior with the goal of advancing knowledge in Quantum Symmetry.<br/><br/>Quantum Symmetry is a fundamental concept that permeates mathematics and physics, providing deep connections between topological, conformal, and more general quantum field theories and algebraic structures such as vertex operator algebras, Hopf algebras, tensor categories, and higher categories. These areas of mathematics study the structures which give rise to precise models for quantum behavior and are crucial for progress in applications such as quantum computing and error correction, enhanced encryption, and resolving the physical models of quantum mechanics with Einstein?s theory of relativity.

Soil animals, such as nematodes (small roundworms), play a critical role in ecosystem functions, including decomposition, which influences carbon and nutrient cycling. However, environmental changes, such as soil warming, may disrupt nematode characteristics (traits) and, in turn, alter the essential functions they perform. Understanding how nematode traits and their associated gene expression respond to warming is key to predicting shifts in soil processes that regulate ecosystem health. This project investigates how long-term soil warming affects the traits and gene expression of fungal-feeding nematodes (fungivores) and aims to establish predictive links between nematode traits and decomposition. By identifying these relationships, this research will improve our ability to anticipate how environmental change influences soil biological processes, with broader implications for soil fertility, carbon storage, and ecosystem resilience.<br/><br/>The project has three primary objectives: (1) determine how long-term soil warming alters key fungivore nematode traits, including body size, lifespan, and reproductive rates; (2) assess how warming influences the expression of genes corresponding to these traits; and (3) examine how nematode phenotypic variation affects decomposition, a key ecosystem function. Research will take place at the Prospect Hill Soil Warming Experiment at Harvard Forest, one of the longest-running soil warming studies in the world.

These microorganisms use a series of enzymes, called cascade enzymes, to break down pollutants step by step into less toxic end products. However, this process is slow and often allows toxic intermediates to accumulate. The goal of this CAREER project is to make biodegradation more efficient. The project will develop a new biotechnology, called protein nano-compartment (PNC)-based cargo encapsulation. Cascade enzymes will be encapsulated within PNCs, which will enable the enzymes to degrade pollutants and intermediates at similar rates. Toxic intermediates will not accumulate in the environment. The research will be integrated with education of students from middle schools and colleges. Successful completion of this project will create a more efficient, robust, and faster environmental remediation technology to protect human and environmental health. <br/><br/>This CAREER project plans to apply PNC-based enzyme co-localization to accelerate biodegradation efficiency in removing organic water contaminants. The central hypothesis is that attaching enzymes with affinity tags of varying molecular properties will allow their tunable co-localization within PNCs, thereby enabling optimization and enhancement of the kinetics and stability of enzyme cascades for contaminant degradation. The study will integrate techniques in biodegradation, synthetic biology, and metabolic flux analysis to systematically characterize the effect of PNC co-localization on enzyme cascade efficiency. The proposed work will establish quantitative correlations between affinity tag properties and enzyme encapsulation efficiency. Building on these correlations, the study will explore how to strategically control the co-localization of biodegradative cascade enzymes within PNCs and analyze how this co-localization affects their kinetics in contaminant removal and stability against environmental factors under controlled in vitro conditions. Lastly, the PNC co-localization of biodegradative cascade enzymes will be assessed under cellular environments, and isotope-labeled metabolic flux analysis will be employed to develop a fundamental understanding of how the in vivo co-localization affects the rate, flux, and specificity of organic contaminant biodegradation in cells. The project includes an education plan aiming to 1) foster the education of college students in STEM and their participation in environmental engineering; 2) educate and train next-generation environmental engineers on the fundamentals, real-world applications, and opportunities of PNC encapsulation and biodegradation; and 3) promote public awareness and understanding of biodegradation as a sustainable solution for environmental protection and remediation. These educational activities will be integrated throughout to improve academic success and broaden participation of college students in research, stimulate STEM interest in 6-12 graders, train a future workforce on biodegradation through research projects, and build a biodegradation website for public education and outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These novel hybrid nanostructures have great potential for quantum information science (QIS) for two key reasons. Firstly, these quantum bits (qubits) can be initiated with light; and secondly, they can support long-lived, coherent spin-active states. The latter is important for information storage at the quantum level and is enabled by the fact that carbon and silicon are light elements with low spin-orbit coupling. Professor Tang and her team will vary the electronic coupling between the silicon QD and organic radical by molecularly engineering their covalent bridge, as well as the conjugated framework of the radical. This synthetic flexibility may allow experimental access to new physics and advance the field by establishing the physical parameters affecting the exchange coupling between the nanocrystal and radical needed to create higher order excited states useful as qubits. Importantly, students working on this project will be exposed to a broad swath of experiments with state-of-the-art equipment conducting spectroscopic and structural characterization in an interdisciplinary environment. This rigorous training is valuable for a career in science and engineering, critical for boosting domestic manufacturing in the United States. All this excitement about qubits for QIS will be shared with students from Whittier elementary school in Salt Lake City school district via a series of chemical demonstrations.<br/><br/>With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Tang of the University of Utah is studying the synthesis and characterization of silicon nanocrystals covalently functionalized with molecular radicals which are designed to systematically tune the resultant exchange coupling all the way from the weak, to the intermediate and finally to the strong coupling regimes. Here, graduate students will systematically toggle between saturated, aliphatic and unsaturated, conjugated bridges, swapping between meta- and para- linkages, varying the distance between both the nanocrystal and radicals like 1,3-bisdiphenylene-2-phenylallyl (BDPA) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO). This approach will vary both the state energies and frontier molecular orbital levels of the radicals anchored on the silicon QD. Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy will be used to chart the trajectory of photogenerated spin-states of triplets initially created in the Si QDs, subsequent coupling to the doublet states on the radicals, and evolution to the strongly coupled triplet-doublet and triplet-quartet states. Steady-state and time-resolved optical measurements will establish the rate and yields of photogenerated species.

Human activities are changing many aspects of the Earth?s environment. This includes changes to the chemical makeup of the atmosphere and soils, the frequency of events like fire and drought, the rate at which species go extinct, and the spread of weeds, pests, and pathogens. Many of these changes directly affect ecosystems and their ability to provide important services on which humans depend. The effects of environmental change occur over many decades and may vary through time. Predicting the effect of these changes depends on long-term experiments. Long-term feedbacks between organisms and the environment can make these changes stronger, weaker, or even reverse them. For example, soils under retired farmlands keep getting more fertile and store more atmospheric carbon for decades, but how fast this happens depends on the diversity of plant species in the area. Researchers at the Cedar Creek Long-Term Ecological Research Program (CDR) will collect long-term data in retired agricultural lands, prairies, savannas, and forests. These data will be combined with mathematical models to better understand how ecosystems respond to many environmental changes happening at the same time. CDR?s education and outreach team along with the Cedar Creek field station staff will continue to work with community partners to recruit, train, and support a STEM workforce. The project will create opportunities for K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students, educators, policy makers, and the public. These opportunities include school field trips, a high school internship program, and onsite apprenticeships that provide training in science education.<br/><br/>Researchers at CDR LTER will use long-term observations and experiments, theory, and models to achieve a mechanistic and predictive understanding of the role of plant biodiversity change, including lags and feedbacks, in determining ecosystem responses to a changing environment. This understanding will be achieved by leveraging CDR?s long-term research platforms that, taken together, manipulate or observe plant biodiversity under ambient and experimentally altered environmental conditions in a range of terrestrial ecosystems to document responses across scales, from leaf-scale physiology to the whole ecosystem scale. This hypothesis-based work will advance knowledge by maintaining CDR?s many research platforms and by starting four new experiments strategically positioned to resolve critical knowledge gaps about community assembly and organism-environment feedbacks. CDR scientists also will start collecting new data on carbon dynamics in directly comparable treatments spanning existing research platforms. In addition, researchers will use ecological theory, modeling, multi-site experiments, and synthesis activities to increase the generality of the insights arising from CDR site-based studies. Taken together, these projects will reveal when and why multi-decadal lags and long-term feedbacks occur as well as the role of biodiversity change on lags and feedbacks to ecosystem functioning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically, when light hits a material, it follows well-known ?bright? pathways that are easy to detect. However, light can also take much weaker, hidden routes known as ?dark transitions.? Understanding these lesser-known processes could lead to important scientific breakthroughs. To investigate these effects, the research team will use special materials called metasurfaces?engineered nanostructures made from extremely small particles with unique abilities to control light. These metasurfaces will help the researchers detect dark transitions in molecules containing a metal called ruthenium. By shining light on these molecules and using sensitive tools to observe their response, the team will aim to understand how energy moves within them. This research could help scientists develop better ways to use light for sustainable energy, next-generation electronics, and the design of new materials. The project will also support science education and workforce development in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.

In optical frequencies, most light?matter interactions are dominated by electric dipole transitions, while magnetic dipole transitions are generally considered ""spin-forbidden"" or ""dark."" Typically, spin-forbidden magnetic dipole transitions in molecular systems, such as those from the ground singlet state to the excited triplet state, are enabled by introducing spin-orbit coupling to break the selection rules. In this project, the transition from the ground singlet state to the excited triplet state in molecular systems will be excited using the enhanced magnetic field of high refractive index dielectric nanoparticles and metasurfaces. The research team will perform photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation, time-resolved photoluminescence, and transient pump?probe X-ray absorption spectroscopy to measure the emission spectra, lifetimes, and oxidation states associated with the direct emission from the triplet to the singlet state in ruthenium complexes and to study their charge dynamics. Molecular light emission is typically limited to an internal quantum yield of approximately 25 percent through singlet?singlet transitions, while about 75 percent of the decay pathways are spin-forbidden singlet?triplet transitions. Therefore, direct excitation of triplet states through magnetic field enhancement would represent a breakthrough in molecular excitation and could open new directions for the application of triplet states in energy conversion and chemical reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By accurately modeling relationships and structures within data via graphs, today machine learning over graphs (LoGs) plays a vital role in various applications. However, LoG introduces additional hyperparameters such as graph topologies and nodal embeddings into the already complicated neural network training processes. Traditionally, LoG approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph. However, this process becomes prohibitively expensive in large models and high-dimensional data regimes, and the performance of LoGs highly depends on the choice of these hyperparameters. To address these challenges, the project puts forth a unified bi-level optimization-based training framework for LoGs with automatic selection of hyperparameters. The project also supports the education and diversity goals of the NSF by integrating LoGs research advances into machine learning courses taught in University of California at Irvine and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, making cutting-edge LoGs techniques more accessible to a wider range of researchers and students, fostering innovation and inclusivity in the scientific community.<br/><br/>Towards this goal, this project aims to develop a bi-level optimization (BLO) framework for trustworthy and efficient LoG, called BLoG.

Photovoltaic energy technology lasts 30+ years with little maintenance. This project is focused on improving its efficiency at converting solar energy into electricity. Two concerns with PV technology are that the conversion efficiency remains low in commercial panels, at about 20%, and that 90% of the panels are made from Si, where China has a stranglehold on raw Si, with 98% of raw Si coming from China. This is a national security concern. PV Technology based on CdTe is a promising alternative to Si, but it needs a higher efficiency to reduce costs. In this project, we propose investigating  a new material system, an alloys of CdSe and CdS,  and a novel device structure to make high efficiency tandem cells. Simulations show that the new device, in a tandem cell arrangement with the currently produced CdTe solar cells, is capable of making 35% efficiency cells without using Si, thereby increasing the efficiency of CdTe solar cells by about 40%.<br/>The new PV material system is an alloy of CdS and CdSe [Cd(S, Se)] whose bandgap can be varied by changing the S:Se ratio. We are aiming to develop a PV material with a bandgap of ~2-2.1 eV which will act as the appropriate material for the higher gap cell with the existing Cd(Se,Te) cell acting as the lower gap cell in a 4-terminal tandem cell arrangement.  Simulations show that when combined with Cd(Se,Te) as the bottom cell, the new PV device, when optimized, can produce devices with 35+% conversion efficiency in production, a potential efficiency breakthrough for the Cd(Se,Te) technology which is currently the major thin film PV technology. The proposed technology does not use Si and is manufacturable using a technology (CSVT) similar to the currently used technology for Cd (Se,Te) cells. The research will focus on developing PV devices in the new material system [Cd(S,Se)]. The new material is a direct bandgap material with high absorption coefficient and thus, we can make thin film PV devices in a manner similar to devices in CdSe or CdTe. In the project, we will use appropriate p-type heterojunction materials such as p-a(Si,C):H and NiO to make p-n junction devices. Fundamental measurements of material and device properties will be an integral part of the project.

Shimizu's work is inspired by biological systems that can form well-defined, low-energy assemblies as well as higher-energy structures. The Shimizu group will study how these small macrocycles assemble and use different strategies to control their growth, size, and stability.  The aim is to develop precise control over the nanotubes, which can then be used to study how size impacts chemical processes, especially those triggered by light. This work could potentially provide innovative tools and unlock new applications in electronic and smart materials.  This project also emphasizes education and mentorship at all academic levels.  It promotes public interest in science through a chemistry demonstration program that visits South Carolina K-12 classrooms, supports a summer tutorial series for graduate students, and offers hands-on research opportunities for students from high school to Ph.D. candidates.  These efforts will help recruit a skilled workforce and prepare future scientists to address emerging challenges in science and technology.  <br/> <br/>Professor Linda Shimizu's team will study the pathway complexity in the supramolecular assembly of urea macrocycles.  Specifically, her group will target three innovative objectives: 1. They will examine the mechanisms of supramolecular polymerization in different solvents to regulate the size, dispersity, and dynamics of the assemblies of bis-urea macrocycles in solution.  2. They will develop templates to stabilize aggregates of specific sizes and investigate methods to maintain kinetically trapped and meta-stable states.  Seeded living polymerization will be employed to produce nanotubes with precise lengths. 3. Professor Shimizu will investigate how nanotube length impacts chemical processes, including photoinduced radical formation, molecular guest exchange, and reactions within these nanotubes. This work will address fundamental questions about energetic landscapes in supramolecular assembly.  Establishing control over meta-stable states and tuning assembly-disassembly dynamics will enable transitions between supramolecular polymers, nanotubular host-guest complexes, and monomers. Achieving this precision will advance our knowledge of assembly dynamics, provide innovative tools to study processes at the nanoscale, and unlock new applications in electronic and smart materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across grasslands, plants store most of the carbon that they consume from the atmosphere in their roots and the substances that roots secrete. Despite their critical role, plant roots are understudied. This NSF-CAREER grant will explore the effect of extreme precipitation and nutrient deposition on root growth, and the consequences of root expansion in the context of a changing environment. The project will involve an interdisciplinary team that includes graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, in addition to the principal investigator and his collaborators. The team will test the novel hypothesis that the response of root productivity to precipitation extremes depends on the nature of the response of root productivity to water availability. Mechanisms to be tested include root-system expansion through partnership with fungi, and root-system contraction when eaten by soil nematode worms. The team will use multiple approaches including greenhouse and lab experiments, as well as large-scale field experiments. This research will be of broad societal value because it will enable a better understanding of grassland ecosystems and their role in the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>This CAREER grant builds upon previous work on aboveground responses to precipitation and nutrient availability manipulations by turning previous concepts, hypotheses, and mechanisms upside down and centering empirical tests on belowground processes in three hierarchical steps. First, it explores mechanisms behind the effect of precipitation variability on root productivity related to the shape of the relationship between root growth and water availability as stated by the Jensen inequality. Second, it incorporates nitrogen availability and tests for interactions that change the shape of such relationships altering the net root productivity response to precipitation variability. And third, it considers the effect of symbiotic associations between root and soil fungi that may enhance root fitness and nutrient uptake in contrast to root herbivory by nematodes that reduces the capacity of roots to uptake water and nutrients. In addition, the project considers structural differences among grassland ecosystems by testing the applicability of experimental findings across grassland types globally. This work will integrate a comprehensive education plan using multiple approaches from undergraduate courses to student mentoring at all levels (high school through graduate students) and dissemination of results to land managers and scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While this convergence has undoubtedly enhanced efficiency, the widespread reliance on a limited set of specialized products and services has given rise to many single points of system vulnerability. Such concentration of risk amplifies the potential fallout from security breaches, especially since attackers have strong incentives to specifically attack such products and services. This project seeks to develop improved measures of financial sector cyber risk. The findings should have an immediate and direct impact on measuring and mitigating systemic (i.e., system-wide) cyber risk. It will also provide insights, providing guidance for data that should be gathered in the U.S. and beyond in future to evaluate and quantify systemic cyber risk. The findings could also help the comparatively new cyber insurance market measure and quantify correlated cyber risk. <br/><br/>This project takes an important step in defining and empirically measuring systemic cyber risk. Systemic risk and cyber risk are first measured separately. Then, they are combined to examine key research questions about systemic cyber risk. Product-level systemic cyber risk occurs when there is concentration among technology suppliers and the products of those suppliers exhibit significant numbers of vulnerabilities, product exploits and/or publicly observed attacks. Firm-level systemic cyber risk occurs when dominant firms in a sector employ few security controls. Since cyberspace is so complex, the project develops several different methods for measuring systemic risk and uses them to provide various measures of systemic cyber risk by sectors and firms. The project leverages comprehensive data on firms and the technologies from the Spiceworks Company Intelligence Database (CIDB), which reports over 11,000 IT infrastructure products at the site and firm level for multiple years.

This is controlled by complex neural circuits that are interconnected through long cable-like structures called axons. One important group of axons arises from serotonin-producing brain cells, which integrate with circuits throughout the nervous system to modulate behaviors such as mood, sleep, appetite, and cognition. Ultimately, these behavioral outputs are determined by the precise growth and wiring of axons. Recent work by the PI and others in the field has shown that serotonin-producing brain cells use serotonin itself to help shape its axons during early stages of development. This research will utilize cutting-edge genetic tools available in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, to understand how this molecular mechanism works inside the cells, how it shapes circuits in the brain, and how it impacts behavioral output. The fruit fly nervous system is built with the same basic components, which assemble and direct neural activities as they do in the human nervous system. The knowledge gained will therefore provide insight into how abnormal serotonin exposure during development can lead to behavioral disorders in humans. These studies will provide students with multidisciplinary research experiences in genetics, cellular biology, and neuroscience through paid research positions. By reducing financial barriers to undergraduate research at an institute serving large populations of low-income and first-generation college students, this project advances the NSF mission to grow a diverse STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Preliminary in vitro experiments indicate the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A initiates signaling events that autoregulate serotonergic axon outgrowth. The first objective of this project is to determine the intracellular mechanisms 5-HT1A engages using genetic and pharmacological manipulation of candidate serotonin signaling pathways in primary Drosophila serotonergic neurons paired with morphometric analysis of axon outgrowth and live cell imaging of actin dynamics. The second objective of this project is to determine how autoregulation shapes anatomical circuits using a single serotonergic neuron (SP2-1) as a model. This neuron innervates the larval visual system and can be labeled selectively using existing genetic tools, allowing 3D reconstructions of the SP2-1 neuron under various experimental conditions. A novel anterograde trans-synaptic Brainbow labeling approach will be used to ask how changes in serotonin signaling alter connectivity of the SP2-1 neuron. The third objective is to understand how defects in serotonin autoregulation can alter behavioral outputs by manipulating serotonin signaling and correlating changes in SP2-1 morphology to changes in vision-based behaviors. These studies will provide the first molecular mechanism of serotonin autoregulation and its impact on the morphological and functional development of the serotonergic system. This research pipeline will also serve as a foundation for future research including analysis of different cell types and/or circuits, behavioral paradigms, other signaling molecules, and developmental stages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Legendrian links play a key role in the modern study of symplectic geometry in three and four dimensions. The project seeks to develop and explore new algebraic structures associated to Legendrian links, by combining an established framework, developed over the past few decades, with recent ideas from other areas of mathematics such as combinatorics and algebraic geometry. This research will create new algebraic structures that can be applied to answer some long-unsolved questions in symplectic geometry. The Principal Investigator will also train future mathematicians through his work organizing undergraduate summer research programs at Duke University and other extracurricular activities for students.<br/><br/>The project is built around an algebraic invariant of Legendrian links called Legendrian contact homology, which was originally developed roughly three decades ago and has emerged as one of the premier tools in modern symplectic topology. The Principal Investigator will develop a number of interrelated enhancements of Legendrian contact homology. Some are combinatorial in nature, including a quantization of Legendrian contact homology that has a conjectural relationship to mirror symmetry; others are more geometric, including a topological stable homotopy type that lifts Legendrian contact homology into the realm of Floer homotopy theory. These enhancements, which can be viewed as strengthened versions of existing invariants, are motivated by recently-discovered connections between symplectic geometry and other mathematical areas such as cluster theory in combinatorics. This project will apply the enhanced invariants to study open questions in symplectic topology, notably the question of classifying certain surfaces in four dimensions, called Lagrangian fillings, with prescribed boundary conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on 2-dimensional spaces called surfaces, which are fundamental in many areas of mathematics.  Surfaces can be flat, like a piece of paper, or curved, like the outside of a ball, a donut, or a saddle, and the various shapes they take often strongly constrain the shapes of the higher dimensional spaces in which they live.  The educational portion of this project involves a variety of activities aimed at recruiting and supporting marginalized students into mathematics.  The first part continues a series of workshops featuring mini-courses by early career speakers from underrepresented groups on their cutting-edge research aimed at graduate students.

This disease can progress unnoticed until vision loss occurs. This CAREER project aims to create innovative tools to unlock how glaucoma affects the nerve cells in the eye and to explore ways to detect and treat the disease earlier. The research includes developing a model that mimics glaucoma in animal eyes, using non-invasive technology to monitor nerve health, and applying advanced computer programs to analyze the data. These efforts will help uncover the cause of glaucoma and identify early signs of the disease. The educational aspect of this project will promote eye health awareness through hands-on workshops for K-12 students and new online resources, such as videos that teach at-home eye exercises. The project also includes developing teaching modules for college students to foster a learning environment accessible to all students. Through partnerships with local schools, industry, and community programs, this work aims to inspire future scientists, engineers, and healthcare professionals while contributing to new solutions for glaucoma care.<br/><br/>This CAREER project aims to address key gaps in understanding glaucoma-induced neurodegeneration by developing an integrated platform combining bioengineering tools and neurobiological studies. The platform will include (1) an injectable microbead-based in vivo flow occlusion model to replicate glaucoma-like conditions and achieve sustained intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation, (2) a non-invasive electroretinogram (ERG) recording system to monitor retinal neural activity longitudinally, and (3) artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted algorithms for unbiased analysis of electrophysiological data. These tools will be applied to investigate the mechanisms driving retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and disruptions in lateral inhibition within the retina?s vision signal transduction pathway. The project will focus on optimizing biointerfaces in the flow occlusion model for reliable IOP elevation, advancing ERG systems for continuous monitoring of neural changes, and using AI to identify early-stage glaucoma biomarkers. Additionally, pharmacological and genetic regulation of specific inhibitory neuron populations will be combined with ERG and IOP monitoring to study how hyperactivation of inhibitory neurons contributes to RGC loss. The resulting platform will provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of glaucoma, enabling earlier detection and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

Hartgerink of Rice University aims to reveal the atomic structure of collagen, the most abundant protein in the human body. Collagen is a remarkable protein which undergoes multiple levels of assembly. The beautiful final product controls an incredibly wide range of biological behavior including tissue integrity, cancer metastasis, wound healing, effective response to viral and bacterial invaders, and even weight regulation. Amazingly, despite early studies dating back to the 1950?s, collagen is very poorly understood. Without an accurate structure, advances in all these areas will be limited. The research team has recently discovered that bundled collagen can take on a never-before-observed shape. The team will explore the circumstances under which this novel shape is formed, undertaking studies with potential to reveal the mysteries of collagen superstructure that have evaded sight for over seventy years. This work expects to lay out chemical methods allowing scientists to mimic biological materials, which may lead to breakthroughs in tissue regeneration, immunology, and cancer research. This program will also serve as the basis to train the next generation of scientists including graduate students pursuing a PhD, undergraduates pursuing Chemistry and Bioscience degrees, and enhancing the pipeline of STEM focused students by engaging high school students and their teachers from Houston area schools.<br/><br/>Recent discoveries by the Hartgerink lab related to collagen structure suggest that the fundamental structural unit ? the collagen triple helix ? can adopt a much wider range of superhelical twists than previously appreciated. This research will study the extent to which the superhelical pitch can be altered, its impact on the self-assembly of high molecular weight complexes, and the sequential circumstances in which this surprising flexibility is observed. The hypothesis is that superhelical unwinding is more likely to occur under the following conditions: 1) when helix-helix packing forces are significant, 2) at or near discontinuities in the required (Xaa-Yaa-Gly)n primary sequence of collagens, 3) at or near the N- and C- termini of a protein, 4) in regions with a low fraction of proline in the Xaa position, or in circumstances that combine two or more of the above. To test these hypotheses, the sequences of natural collagen in which one or more of the criteria above are present will be examined, and, using sequence-structure rules elucidated in this way, the de novo design of these unusual collagen assemblies will be performed. This project will make use of extensive solid-phase peptide synthesis, which allows for the high frequency incorporation of hydroxyproline, which is not genetically encoded. These peptides will be assessed for their ability to self-assemble into all varieties of triple helices using circular dichroism polarimetry and their ability to form higher-order assemblies first by size exclusion chromatography and, subsequently, by methods which allow for atomic precision including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy. The fundamental chemistry knowledge gained from this research is expected to expand the current understanding of collagen assembly, which could have transformative effects in a range of biomedical applications and materials science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This protective function is primarily mediated by specialized proteins known as mucins, characterized by long, repetitive segments extensively covered with sugar molecules essential for their function. Recent advances in DNA sequencing now enable precise investigation of these repeats at the genetic level. This research focuses on mucin-1 (MUC1), a crucial component of the mucus barrier in the uterus. MUC1 acts as a gatekeeper for pregnancy as successful implantation of a fertilized embryo into the uterine wall requires the reduction of this barrier. The number of repeat segments within the MUC1 gene are known to vary substantially between individuals, influencing the size of the resulting MUC1 protein. However, the impact of this genetic variation on the structure of the attached sugars, the mucus barrier, and pregnancy remains unexplored. By examining how variations in these repeats affect the structural and functional properties of the MUC1 protein, this project aims to deepen our understanding of complex genetic and protein variations, ultimately shedding new light on human evolution and pregnancy biology. The fellow will mentor students at Yale University, training them in evolutionary genetics and biochemistry techniques. Additionally, public engagement through science communication events will broaden public understanding of genetics and enhance scientific literacy.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to elucidate the evolutionary origins, genetic mechanisms, and functional consequences associated with variation in MUC1 exonic variable number tandem repeats (eVNTRs). Utilizing long-read sequencing data from global human populations and multiple primate species, this research will clarify the mutational processes and evolutionary forces driving MUC1 repeat copy number variation. Functional experiments leveraging advanced biochemical and mass spectrometry approaches will determine how different MUC1 eVNTR alleles influence encoded protein glycosylation and molecular structure, mucus barrier integrity, and cellular adhesion properties important for embryo implantation. Collectively, this integrative approach will reveal how previously hidden genetic variation influences biological function at molecular and cellular levels, while broadly enhancing understanding of pregnancy biology. The fellow will train undergraduate and graduate students in bioinformatics and mass spectrometry techniques related to the project and will host public seminars to promote broader appreciation of the importance of basic science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, water scarcity in some regions is creating a need for new methods to produce clean water from a variety of sources including wastewater and seawater. This project will investigate an innovative distillation process for water purification that can produce safe, high-quality water using less energy than other conventional processes use. The key innovation in the project is to use pressure instead of heat to distill water, which has the potential to reduce energy use by a factor of ten. Pressure-driven distillation will require a new class of water treatment membranes that can remove salt and contaminants from challenging water sources.  The research team will build on its preliminary results to develop high-performance membranes suitable for pressure-driven distillation.  The deployment of innovative water systems will require a skilled workforce. The project team will conduct project-based learning modules on water scarcity for high school students and will involve undergraduate students in the research. Overall, the project will foster both the technological innovation and skilled workforce needed to secure a sustainable water future. <br/><br/>Addressing water scarcity requires efficiently treating impaired water sources, such as wastewater and saline water, to remove nearly all dissolved constituents. The goal of this CAREER project is to reinvent distillation as an efficient, pressure-driven process for advanced water treatment. Conventional distillation processes are driven by heat and have poor energy efficiency in water treatment. The central hypothesis of this work is that membranes with tailored surface structures and an ultrathin air layer will facilitate pressure-driven distillation in a more efficient, selective, and robust way than conventional processes. The objectives of the project are to (1) explore distillation membranes that resist wetting under applied pressure, (2) evaluate the maximum water permeability for distillation membranes, and (3) conduct application-relevant testing with high performance composite membranes. These goals will be carried out using advanced material fabrication methods, experimental performance characterization, and new modeling techniques. The project will contribute to the scientific foundation for a new class of water treatment membranes that produce higher-quality water with less energy than conventional systems. The project will also develop fundamental knowledge on wetting physics and evaporation phenomena. Education and outreach efforts will support the training of the next generation of water engineers by developing hands-on water treatment modules for high schools in communities impacted by water scarcity.

This places an urgent need for efficient utilization of available electric power, considering 80% of the total generated electric power is expected to flow through power electronics by 2030. The development of innovative and extremely efficient power electronics is critical for incumbent ubiquitous applications as well as new applications such as grid-connected solar inverters, electric cars etc. Furthermore, this will aid in enhancing economic and technical competitiveness of the U.S. At the heart of every power conversion process is a transistor which governs the form-factor, efficiency, and overall system performance. Therefore, the power semiconductor transistor is a key enabler of extremely energy-efficient power electronics. The emerging electrification needs 1.7 to 10 kV power semiconductor transistors which cannot be served by incumbent solutions. The key objective of this NSF proposal is to demonstrate Ultra-wide band gap transistors up to 10 kV breakdown voltage with ~10x lower on-state resistance compared to the incumbent (SiC) technology and perform a detailed investigation to understand the physical mechanisms which governs transistor operation and reliability. To achieve these objectives, multiple innovative approaches will be utilized, resulting in numerous first-of-its-kind studies and demonstrations.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Savanna ecosystems, defined by the coexistence of trees and grasses, cover approximately 20% of the world?s land surface and provide substantial economic and environmental value. Many savannas are undergoing dramatic changes in tree cover driven by human activity, which has already resulted in altered livestock forage, degraded wildlife habitat, and changes in landscape resource (e.g., carbon) storage. Predicting future changes in tree cover requires understanding how different tree species will respond to environmental change. For example, changes in rainfall or consumption by herbivores may cause savanna trees to allocate resources differently between growth, defense (such as thorns), and storage. This project will quantify how tree resource allocation varies across species in an African savanna and determine how these strategies scale up to drive changes in tree cover and species composition across environmental gradients. As part of the project, the fellow will also host workshops and training sessions for undergraduate and graduate students interested in ecology at several local institutions in Indiana.<br/><br/>Using a combination of experimental, modeling, and remote sensing approaches, the fellow will address 3 aims: (1) quantify how rainfall and herbivory interact to shape the carbon allocation strategies of dominant savanna tree species, (2) assess how variation in carbon allocation strategies scale up to shape tree population trajectories under various rainfall and herbivory regimes, and (3) use high-resolution light detection and ranging data to map temporal and spatial changes in aboveground carbon density as a function of rainfall, herbivore abundance, and topography. To address these aims, the fellow will use a common garden experiment and field surveys conducted within a long-term herbivore exclusion experiment in Kenya to characterize species-specific carbon allocation strategies across tree size classes. The fellow will then integrate the physiological measurements with long-term demographic data to investigate how species-specific strategies influence community-level responses to variation in rainfall and herbivory. Finally, the fellow will use remote sensing data to map carbon density across a 20,000-ha savanna ecosystem. The fellow will receive training in process-based models and remote sensing techniques.

However, most existing BCIs are designed for specific applications. They capture neural activity from a specific brain region associated with a given task, extract key features from the recorded signals, and translate them into the user?s intent. The decoded information is transmitted as commands for discrete goal selection or continuous control of assistive devices. Even within the same application, BCI technologies vary significantly depending on the user?s communication and control capabilities. As a result, the current BCI ecosystem is fragmented and lacks flexibility, necessitating a more adaptable solution that supports multiple applications simultaneously. This research aims to address these limitations by introducing a ubiquitous BCI (uBCI) framework ? a versatile system designed to enhance both cognitive and motor functions through advanced neural signal processing and an energy-efficient digital architecture. Unlike conventional BCIs, which rely on a single brain region and predefined features, the uBCI system analyzes signals from multiple brain regions, leveraging diverse neural features for real-time, accurate decoding of user intent. The uBCI framework enables both discrete goal selection and continuous control, ensuring long-term reliability in neural signal interpretation for practical applications. Beyond its scientific contributions, this research has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people affected by neurological disorders. Educational initiatives include the 'Brain Chips' outreach program, which engages high school students; the integration of research findings into the Computer Engineering curriculum at San Diego State University; open-access dissemination of research results; and community engagement through workshops at the Disability Center San Diego. <br/><br/>The uBCI framework is built on a robust technological foundation that ensures adaptability, efficiency, and seamless integration across multiple applications. The system integrates a custom digital integrated circuit for in vivo processing with a programmable processor featuring a heterogeneous architecture for in silico processing. To evaluate efficiency, the system's components are implemented and tested on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), communicating wirelessly via Bluetooth. The uBCI is validated and optimized using neural datasets from human and non-human primates, along with prosthetic testing on the humanoid Baxter Robot System. By optimizing neural signal processing algorithms and associated digital circuits across in vivo (biological) and in silico (computational) domains, this project advances fundamental BCI research while bridging the gap between laboratory prototypes and real-world deployment, paving the way for scalable and user-adaptive neural interfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to biology in innovative ways. Invasive species threaten ecosystems, native species, crops and people in many ways. As environments change and invasive species? ranges expand, these threats have become an urgent issue. Understanding the role that viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens play in the success or failure of species invasions is crucial for mitigating the damage anticipated in the coming years. Wild rodents in New England can help answer this question. European rodents arrived in New England in the 1600s, bringing pathogens with them that native rodents had never encountered, and encountering pathogens endemic to native rodents for the first time. How these pathogens influenced native and invasive rodent populations can be uncovered using genomics. By observing changes in wild and invasive rodent population dynamics and genomes over the past 400 years and corresponding evolutionary changes in the pathogens, this project will provide a more interconnected understanding of if and how pathogens contribute to invasion success. The fellow will develop invasive species informational sessions for farming communities, provide active learning opportunities in genomics for 4th grade classes in Vermont, and mentor undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will test the Pathogen Release, Pathogen Spillover, and Pathogen Spillback hypotheses through the incorporation of rodent population size estimates, adaptation at Pathogen-Interacting Protein (PIP) sites in the host genomes, and phylogenetic and functional analyses of the most common pathogens detected. To do so, the fellow will generate a time transect of native and invasive rodent metagenomes. The time transect of rodent populations will identify the timing of invasion-related population demographic shifts in native and invasive rodents of interest. Host genome adaptations in these populations will then be analyzed, focusing on selective sweeps at PIP genes to determine the associations of specific candidate pathogens with these demographic shifts. Finally, pathogen genomes recovered from historic and modern host specimens will be analyzed in conjunction with PIP selection to directly connect reciprocal coadaptation between pathogens and rodent hosts at candidate genomic loci that may have contributed to invasion success. These results will advance our understanding of species invasions in the past and present, potentially informing measures to mitigate the negative impacts of invasive species in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the various pathways to create quantum computers, nanofabricated electrical circuits made from metals with zero resistance, also known as superconductors, form a promising platform. However, these superconducting qubits are highly sensitive to environmental noise, which limits their performance. By employing Fourier engineering, where information is redundantly encoded in higher harmonics of the quantum states in space and time, the PI will design and fabricate novel quantum circuits that are resilient against information loss. A central feature of these Fourier qubits is that they possess multiple circuit nodes, leading to complex circuit potentials with intrinsic error protection. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the logical operation and scalability of these qubits in proof-of-concept experimental devices. These devices can pave the way for robust superconducting quantum processors and open new routes toward solving challenging computational problems in academia and beyond. In parallel with the research efforts, the PI?s integrated education and outreach program intends to bridge the gap between engineering studies and quantum sciences. By emphasizing the engineering aspects of designing quantum devices, broadly disseminating lecture notes of new quantum engineering classes, and enhancing the exposure of communities to quantum engineering education, this program will lead to a paradigm shift in training the next generation of the quantum workforce.<br/><br/>This work will develop a quantum engineering program that focuses on the experimental realization of new types of superconducting circuits and strengthen the quantum education of engineering students in tandem. The PI will engineer controllable quantum Fourier qubits that are immune to decoherence and develop classical analogs of these qubits to introduce engineering students to quantum hardware. The research will evolve along two directions. First, the PI will focus on engineering multi-mode circuits, where multiple potential valleys in the phase space of the superconducting wavefunction will host protected quantum states. At the initial stage of the research, exploration of new circuit topologies using numerical methods will play a crucial role. After identifying the circuit layout, the devices will be simulated, nanofabricated, and characterized. The PI will demonstrate extended qubit lifetimes and high-fidelity control of the qubit states. The second research direction of the proposal focuses on active Fourier qubits, where protection arises from strongly oscillating the external parameters of a well-established quantum circuit, the fluxonium. As part of the project, single- and two-qubit operations will be characterized to demonstrate the feasibility of active Fourier qubits in quantum processors. The research projects are strongly tied to quantum engineering education and outreach because the realization of the classical counterparts of Fourier qubits, as multi-mode complex mechanical oscillators, form engaging research projects for undergraduate students and help demystify convoluted quantum concepts for engineers interested in quantum research. Furthermore, the PI will improve the quantum engineering curriculum by developing engineering-focused approaches, with hands-on components in a fabrication facility, to introduce students from broad backgrounds to the cutting-edge techniques of the quantum industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NOM plays significant roles in many biogeochemical/environmental processes and in almost all cases, these processes involve redox (oxidation-reduction) reactions that occur on the surfaces of particulate materials such as minerals and microbes. To characterize these reactions, the project will use a suite of electrochemical methods to measure electron transfer to and from samples of NOM with varying size and shape. The results will have a wide range of potential applications, including modeling of air pollution, management of agricultural soils, and optimization of drinking water disinfection. As well as graduate students, the project team will include interns from several nearby colleges that have strong programs for including undergraduate students in research.<br/><br/>Reactions of NOM with the surfaces of minerals (and microbes) require sufficient proximity between the redox-active moieties in NOM and redox-active sites on the surface. This proximity is strongly dependent on the size and shape of the NOM, which can vary from discrete monomers to unfolded polymers to aggregates and other supramolecular structures like micelles. These effects can be studied electrochemically, since electrode response to NOM also is an interfacial process that is strongly dependent on NOM size/shape. The overarching technical objective of the proposed project will be to determine qualitative and quantitative relationships between the size and structure of NOM and its redox potentials, kinetics, and capacities using a complementary suite of electrochemical methods that allows for resolution of the many complex interactions involved. In the process, we expect to address several fundamental, cross-cutting issues regarding NOM redox chemistry, including that its bulk redox properties are the net effect of multiple redox active moieties that are linked by intra-molecular transfer, and that its capacity for electron exchange/storage reflects both labile and kinetically-limited components to varying degrees depending on operational factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most bacteria grow well on glucose, which contains 6 carbon atoms per molecule (C6). Certain bacteria, referred to as acetogens, can grow on single-carbon (C1) molecules. For example, acetogens can grow on carbon monoxide, or methanol. These compounds can be produced from carbon dioxide. There is a catch; acetogens grow very poorly or not at all in the presence of oxygen. Also, because C1 compounds are not energy-rich, acetogens generally have limited synthetic capabilities. Acetogens could be useful in the renewable production of fuels and chemicals. Achieving this will require reengineering certain aspects of their metabolism. There are two key objectives of this project. One is understanding the regulation of carbon metabolism. The second is to use the insight gained make acetogens a more effective producer of valuable fuels and chemicals. In parallel with these technical objectives, outreach to local high-school students will introduce them to the concept of microbial cell factories. Undergraduates will be provided an opportunity for hands-on experience with bioprocessing in a unit operations lab course. The objective is to equip them for future careers in a robust US bioeconomy.<br/><br/>Acetogens are obligate anaerobic bacteria that dwell in energy-poor environments near the thermodynamic limit of life, making a living by converting C1 substrates into acetate through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The high energetic efficiency of this pathway, coupled with recent progress developing advanced genetic tools for these organisms, have made acetogens attractive microbes for the renewable production of biofuels and biochemicals. The major challenge is that, as anaerobes, acetogens growing on a single C1 compound are severely energy limited. Thus, while they can produce low-value compounds, efforts to expand the product profile to higher value products from pathways that demand more cellular energy have been met with minimal success. Some acetogens can simultaneously consume multiple different C1 substrates, or a C1 substrate and sugars. Interestingly, even when the second substrate is provided only at low levels as a ?dopant?, this can result in drastic improvements in growth rate and productivity. The overall research goals of this CAREER project are to i) understand the metabolic and regulatory mechanisms by which acetogens synergistically leverage multiple substrates simultaneously to overcome growth limitations, then ii) learn how to harness this to direct C1 flux to higher-value products than have previously been possible. An approach that combines isotopic tracer experiments, cofactor perturbation, and transcriptomics will be applied to probe the mechanisms underlying substrate doping.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using northern temperate forests as a model system, this research will experimentally test the biotic soil environment as a mechanism of successional replacement in forests. Tree mortality is accelerating across many forest types, creating new opportunities for forest regeneration, and results from this project can be used to improve predictions of future forest composition.

This research focuses on the temporal dynamics of soilborne microbiota associated with dead trees (hereafter soil legacies). Negative feedback between plants and soil microbes can maintain diversity within and among plant species, but how these interactions change across multiple host-generations remains unknown. Through a reciprocal transplant experiment, microbial metabarcoding, and mathematical modeling, the fellow will quantify the specificity of soil legacies at multiple ecological levels, the temporal dynamics of mutualists versus pathogens after host-plant death, and the coexistence implications for soil legacies on competing plant species. These complementary approaches will provide novel insights into the role of antecedent states on the functioning of ecological systems. This research promotes the training goals of the fellow including, developing molecular ecology skills, managing multi-factor greenhouse experiments, and teaching and mentoring.

Recent observations in the Bering and Chukchi seas have identified large populations of Alexandrium catenella, a saxitoxin-producing, harmful species of phytoplankton. A. catenella germinates from cysts on the seabed as water warms during spring and summer and enters the vegetative stage where they grow and reproduce in the water column, forming a harmful algal bloom (HAB). When the water cools and daylight wanes in autumn the vegetative cells then form dormant cysts, which sink to the seabed. Recent warming of ocean temperatures in the Pacific Arctic, and along the coast of Alaska in particular, presents a distinct threat since A. catenella germination and growth rates increase with increasing temperature.<br/><br/>This project aims to help in understanding the evolving biophysical environment of the Bering and Chukchi seas for decision making related to food security for humans that consume seafood from the region. The project?s key objectives are to identify the major pathways and ?hotspots? of A. catenella in the Pacific Arctic. This project will use the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), which includes ocean, sea ice, atmosphere, and biogeochemistry models, and expand it with a life cycle model of A. catenella.  The expanded model (RASM-HAB) will be used to identify the upstream source regions for the observed cyst accumulation on the Chukchi seabed, which is the largest and most highly concentrated cyst deposition region ever observed in the world ocean. RASM-HAB is uniquely poised to aid understanding of the physical conditions affecting the germination, growth, and advection of HABs due its demonstrated ability to simulate the ocean, sea ice, atmosphere, and biogeochemistry of the Pacific Arctic with high fidelity. RASM?s domain includes the North Pacific, pan-Arctic, and North Atlantic, including many areas where HAB observations do not exist, such as the western Chukchi Sea, where high concentrations of A. catenella are expected. Model runs covering the previous four decades will provide information on the past interannual variability in HABs and long-term trends. Finally, 6-month forecasts of physical, biological, and HAB conditions will be completed and assessed for reliability as a proof-of-concept. This work is important because it will improve understanding and potentially prediction of changing germination, growth rates, and movement of HABs in a region of high biological productivity, which provides food resources for Alaskan and greater US populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there has been progress in understanding this important biological transition that occurred millions of years ago, the exact processes that allowed single cells to aggregate into complex organisms composed by different cell types and differentiated tissues (as seen in most plants and animals), remain unclear. Becoming multicellular brings a series of new challenges, for example reduced nutrient accessibility to individual cells that can easily lead to cell death and the need for fundamental tasks to be divided across different cells. Using yeast as a model system, this project will investigate the genetic, molecular, and physiological steps involved in transitioning from existing as single cells into complex cell aggregates, that gave rise to the multitude of life forms present today. This research will provide crucial insights into the origin of complex life, as well as shed light into the processes involved in major biological transitions. This project will create a web portal that will facilitate the sharing of strains, data, and detailed methodological protocols that will facilitate the use of the yeast system by the broader community and the general public. It will also provide yeast evolution kits to high school and college classrooms, providing unique opportunities for students to witness and document evolution in action. <br/><br/>The Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE) will provide a powerful approach to investigate the transition between single- and multi-celled life forms.

ODNs and ORNs are segments of DNA and RNA molecules, respectively. Long ONs are essential in a wide range of fields, including synthetic biology, protein engineering, gene editing, mRNA therapeutics, gene therapy, nucleic acid vaccines, and computational digital data storage. These fields are closely related to numerous sectors of our society, encompassing energy, environment, agriculture, medicine, and national security. The successful development of the proposed long ON synthesis technologies will enhance the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of projects in these fields. This multidisciplinary research requires a wide range of technical skills such as organic synthesis, surface chemistry, automated DNA and RNA synthesis, NMR, MS, capillary electrophoresis, HPLC, cloning, and DNA and RNA sequencing. During the funding period, Ph.D. students and undergraduate researchers will have the opportunity to acquire these skills through their involvement in the project. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop technologies for the de novo synthesis of long ONs. Currently, the longest chemically synthesized ODNs and ORNs are limited to approximately 200-mers and 120-mers, respectively. Longer ONs must be produced using biological methods such as PCR assembly, ligation, and in vitro transcription. These biological methods, however, suffer from drawbacks including long turnaround times, high labor demands, and error susceptibility.  More seriously, they are unable to synthesize ONs containing difficult elements such as long repeats, unusually stable higher-order structures, high or low GC content, and site-specific modifications. Recently, the Michigan Tech team achieved direct de novo synthesis of 400-mer ODNs. Building upon this foundation, they will extend the boundaries of chemical ON synthesis to beyond 2,000-mer ODNs and 200-mer ORNs. To achieve these objectives, they will explore novel solid supports for ODN and ORN syntheses and the use of the powerful catching-by-polymerization (CBP) method for the isolation of the low-percentage, yet sufficient quantities, of ONs. The ONs will be rigorously characterized involving techniques such as HPLC, MS, gel electrophoresis, enzymatic digestion, PCR, cloning, and DNA and RNA sequencing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sodium-ion batteries are not yet ready for grid applications due to limitations around battery lifetime, especially calendar lifetime and temperature stability, which is the key problem that this project will address using a low-cost electrolyte that is designed specifically for sodium-ion batteries. The global market for sodium-ion batteries for grid applications is projected at $4.1-8.2 billion by 2030, and is projected to grow rapidly through 2050 and beyond. A solution to the sodium-ion battery lifetime challenge will position the United States as a global leader in the nascent but rapidly-growing market, which is expected to yield significant economic and job development. Moreover, this innovation will enhance the scientific understanding of sodium-ion battery electrolyte and interphase chemistry, providing an enabling solution for the sodium-ion market as a whole.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is centered on the development of electrolyte and interphase chemistries specifically tailored to the requirements of sodium-ion battery chemistry, which varies in several ways from the more mature lithium-ion battery chemistry. These novel and tailored electrolyte chemistries will provide a drop-in solution to the cycle and calendar life challenges, while achieving low-costs via an innovative and simple synthesis process. Moreover, this electrolyte chemistry has shown promise as a fire-extinguishing liquid, which may drive substantial safety improvements for large grid applications where fires are a significant concern. The primary objectives of this project are enabling this synthesis process to achieve high electrolyte quality, rationally designing the electrolyte formulation for a specific sodium-ion battery cell design that is most interesting for grid applications, and validating the combination of these breakthrough innovations in prototype battery cells that are of interest to grid energy storage system customers. This project will demonstrate the synthesis process for an optimized electrolyte chemistry and full cell performance results at a commercially-relevant scale to validate the commercial viability of these innovations at a suitable level to attract follow-on investment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, when therapy is available, it involves debilitating side effects, including other life-threatening conditions. The primary healthcare objectives, therefore, are early, noninvasive accurate diagnosis and effective therapeutic intervention without harmful side effects. Here a cross-disciplinary scientific team led by a pharmaceutical chemist and an engineer from two universities will develop and study the fundamental science behind a single clinical implement with the dual aim of improved diagnostic ultrasound imaging and targeted therapy which becomes active only in the target region. The team aims at synthesizing nanometer-size polymeric particles. They are similar in structure to body cells and can carry therapeutics to target areas evading the body?s defense system. The particles are chemically engineered to implode in a specific chemical environment found only in diseased conditions and deliver their cargo. The proposed research will systematically investigate the chemistry of these nanoparticles through experiments and theory to optimize their desired effects and the mechanism behind their ultrasound reflectivity. The principal investigators have proposed an array of educational activities involving high school interns, undergraduates, and Ph.D. students in multi-disciplinary projects with real-life clinical applications preparing them to enter the twenty-first-century workforce.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The objective of this proposal is to conduct foundational studies on polymer nanoparticles (polymersomes) that are programmed to release their encapsulated contents under specific biochemical environments common in diseases and simultaneously are responsive to ultrasound to allow imaging and ultrasound-assisted release. It uses reduced oxygen partial pressure as a model trigger for release. The proposed studies will develop the design principles of multimodal polymer nanoparticles for future applications in drug delivery to tumors and simultaneous ultrasound imaging. The team will optimize polymer design so that the resultant polymersomes become responsive to the reduced oxygen levels and release the encapsulated contents. The nanoparticles will be made to entrap air allowing simultaneous ultrasound imaging before their destruction. These echogenic content-bearing polymersomes will be tested in three-dimensional (3D) cultures of cancer cells containing hypoxic niches.

This project seeks to improve knowledge of tectonics by studying the deep structure beneath Africa, a continent that holds key clues about how the interior of the planet influences surface movements. Unusually hot mantle rocks are observed underneath Africa,  as well as the East African Rift System, the most prominent and active continental rift on the Earth. Taking advantage of these features, the project will  develop a detailed model of the deep structure beneath this continent. It will also  revise how its tectonic plates move, and explore interactions between the Earth?s outer shell with the deeper convecting mantle beneath Africa. The results of this research will help increase understanding of fundamental processes shaping our planet. For example, the findings may enhance earthquake hazard assessments, improve models of global plate motions, and provide relevant information to other aligned fields, such as geothermal exploration. This project uses advanced seismic and geodetic data to provide a more complete picture of Earth's dynamic interior.<br/><br/>This project will try to advance the understanding of plate tectonics by investigating how the African continent interacts with the underlying convecting mantle. Specifically, it will test a long-standing hypothesis that lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling modulates the influence of mantle convection on Africa?s surface motions, with broader implications for global tectonic processes. The research will integrate seismic and geodetic data from AfricaArray, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations, and other sources to develop open-access, high-resolution continental-scale models of the kinematics of Africa, crustal and lithospheric structure, upper mantle seismic properties?including azimuthal anisotropy?and key mantle discontinuities. To test this hypothesis, the project will enhance and leverage the capabilities of the open-source software ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Planetary Evolution, Convection, and Tectonics) to enable improved modeling of lithosphere-asthenosphere viscous coupling at a continental scale. A key objective is to determine whether lithospheric motion in Africa and its surroundings is only weakly coupled to the underlying convecting mantle due to an anomalously hot and low-viscosity upper asthenosphere. Beyond scientific contributions, the project has the following major broader impacts. It will support annual AfricaArray meetings in South Africa and enhance capacity-building efforts through workshops on data science, seismic and GNSS data processing, and access to streaming datasets. These workshops will follow well-established Carpentries lesson structures, with a focus on training new instructors.. An independent professional evaluation will make sure its impacts are maximized. Undergraduate researchers will contribute to the development of seismic tomography models  increasing their technical skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This site is chosen strategically because it is the site of the Department of Defense?s ?Next-Generation Microelectronics Manufacturing? facility, a state-of-the-art advanced electronics packaging center. While several recent meetings have focused on how science can be used to make better chips and microsystems, very few recent meetings have focused on how access to improved chips and microsystems can be used to advance scientific research. This workshop will bring together leading researchers from many different scientific fields alongside electronics packaging experts in government and industry to chart the future of electronics systems development to make better devices and sensors for U.S. scientific research. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The workshop will engage stakeholders from defense, national laboratories, universities, and industry to explore how this national investment in advanced packaging can be leveraged for research across a broad range of scientific disciplines, including but not limited to biotechnology, geophysics, astronomy, quantum and AI hardware, chemistry, and physics. Experts in these fields will learn from packaging experts what it is possible to achieve using advanced packaging. In addition, this workshop will allow advanced packaging experts and packaging facility directors to learn about the types of packaging architectures and technologies that will be demanded by scientific researchers in the future. This bidirectional exchange of expertise is both timely and critical because scientific research is often a leading-edge market that predicts what future industry needs might be. Therefore, this workshop will provide significant value both to researchers by allowing them to better plan for their future research, and to packaging prototyping facilities by allowing them to find new, future customers that will be willing to produce innovative designs and who are risk-tolerant during the prototyping phase of the development of new packaging technologies. Specific tracks for the conference include: (1) sensors and detectors for physical and chemical science, where the ability to build 3D stacks of interconnected sensors and readout circuits would drive down response time while improving resolution; (2) 3D heterogeneous integration for biomedical and environmental applications, where sensors need to be packaged with memory and logic on-chip for preprocessing of huge amounts of data prior to transmission to a wireless receiver; and (3) quantum and AI hardware, where integration of qubits and microwave-to-optical transduction chips has become stalled out with the limitations imposed by traditional packaging. The core goals of this workshop will be to: (1) nucleate a national academic userbase for the advanced semiconductor packaging facilities being developed now and (2) identify quick-win opportunities for scientific research that leverage these advanced packaging facilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

IBS symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and diarrhea. IBS is associated with psychological disorders such as anxiety and stress and affects 25-45 million people in the U.S. and 10-15% people worldwide. IBS significantly affects the quality of life of patients, resulting in days off work or missed school, and costs healthcare systems more than $30 billion/year. Doctors cannot diagnose IBS based on symptoms alone, as people who do not have this disease may also show similar symptoms, such as diarrhea and constipation, due to other causes. Currently IBS is diagnosed by the process of elimination, where patients often go through several tests to rule out other issues, and even then, there is a chance of misdiagnosis. This project aims to address this issue by offering a point-of-care diagnostic test using patient biomarkers for early diagnosis of this disease. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a point-of-care diagnostic test that can be used by gastroenterologists and physicians in clinical settings to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This solution is based on the detection of specific metabolites that are present only in the human patient samples with IBS using a paper-based assay. The test works by using special proteins that recognize and bind to certain target molecules (metabolites) in a sample. When this binding happens, the target molecules push out indicator compounds that were originally attached to the proteins. This change creates a color signal, which reveals which metabolites are present and in what amount. The resulting indicators are chromatographically separated using a paper device, allowing the results to be seen and interpreted visually. The test is expected to lead to definitive and rapid diagnosis of IBS, allowing timely and targeted approaches to managing the disease and improving patient care and well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These OICs play an important role in technologies such as catalysis, batteries, and shape-memory alloys. Their application space is limited, however, because these materials can only be prepared at high temperatures, often eroding control over important material parameters. Making the low-temperature synthesis of OICs possible requires a precise understanding of how atoms move within solid materials. This Faculty Early Career Award (CAREER) will support research in the laboratory of Dr. Anthony Shoji Hall at the Johns Hopkins University to examine pathways that allow for the control of atom movement at low temperatures and thereby enable the preparation of ordered intermetallic nanomaterials at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. By enabling the synthesis of these materials at low temperatures, this work will substantially broaden the application space of OICs because it now allows for more fine control over important materials parameters. Dr. Hall?s laboratory will actively share their scientific passion and discoveries with the broader community by engaging in outreach at inner-city Baltimore high schools and universities. The first activity will leverage an established program, STEM achievement in Baltimore elementary schools (SABES), to encourage elementary students to pursue a degree in STEM. This project will also create a new program to encourage URM high school students to pursue degrees in STEM and to improve the retainment of URM (under)graduate students in STEM careers.<br/> <br/>Technical Summary:<br/>Despite decades of intense research, OIC nanoparticles have failed to replace conventional nanomaterials due to (1) lack of low-temperature synthetic methods that can overcome slow solid-state diffusion rates which inhibits atomic ordering, (2) inability to tune composition and phase to optimize the desired application, and (3) lack of fundamental understanding needed for progress on these issues. The purpose of this CAREER proposal is to examine the phase transformations of low melting point alloys to higher melting point OICs richer in the nobler and more active metal at ambient temperature and pressure by removal of the less noble component (e.g., transforming PdBi2 to Pd3Bi, or CuZn4 to Cu5Zn8) via a process known as dealloying. Fundamental insights from this project will enable the rational development of OIC nanostructures for applications of technological relevance and improve our understanding of material stability under electrocatalytic conditions. To understand the origin of the electrochemical dealloying-mediated phase conversion process,  the PI will investigate the following objectives: (1) Elucidate the role of melting temperature on bulk diffusion and lattice reorganization. (2) Develop synthesis methods for controlled compositions of de-alloyed OICs. (3) Elucidate dealloying via in-situ spectroscopic methods. Materials made by this electrochemically mediated phase conversion process will be evaluated as anodes for Li-metal batteries to demonstrate the utility of the synthetic method. The broader impacts of this proposal will encourage underrepresented minority (URM) K-12 students and (under)graduate students to pursue careers in STEM through engagement in outreach programs.  URM students lack access to relatable role models in STEM fields because of underrepresentation. To address this issue, Dr. Hall will make himself available for informal ?coffee hour discussions? to serve as a mentor and role model for URM students (high school-aged, undergraduate, and graduate students) in the Baltimore area. The Hall group will also work with K-12 aged URM students on inquiry-based scientific projects by participating in the STEM Achievement in Baltimore Elementary Schools (SABES) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence that have led to significant discoveries in various physics applications, including the IceCube's observation of astrophysical neutrinos from the Galactic Plane. Here, we propose to use generative AI to transform the simulation of high-energy particle interactions, enabling faster and more efficient modeling. Traditional simulation methods require immense computational resources, with a single particle collision at high energies involving billions of calculations. By applying AI-driven techniques, we aim to dramatically accelerate these processes, reducing computational costs while preserving accuracy. The expected outcomes include advances in fundamental physics, fostering discoveries in astrophysics, and new applications in medical physics, such as radiation therapy. Beyond research, we will integrate the outcomes of this project into the successful augmented reality (AR) app ICEcuBEAR, using AI-generated particle showers to create interactive holograms. This will enhance physics education by bringing AR experiences into K-12 classrooms and after-school programs, introducing students to the fundamentals of particle physics in an engaging and accessible way.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary research will be carried out through a close collaboration between computer scientists and physicists, combining expertise in artificial intelligence, Monte Carlo simulations, and high-energy particle interactions. To achieve these advancements, we will develop graph-based generative AI models that efficiently simulate particle showers?cascades of secondary particles following high-energy collisions. Particle showers exhibit an inherent tree-like structure, where each parent particle branches into multiple secondary particles, forming a hierarchical pattern. Our approach will use generative models that preserve this structure, capturing complex correlations in particle interactions. Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) and diffusion-based AI provide a foundation for this work, as these methods are well-suited for learning structured dependencies in sequential data. By incorporating physics-informed constraints, we aim to improve simulation accuracy while dramatically reducing computational costs. This approach will enable faster and more precise event reconstruction?critical for time-domain multi-messenger follow-up and more effective background and signal modeling. Achieving a breakthrough in our simulations will allow these advances to be fully applied to neutrino source analyses, significantly increasing the overall sensitivity and discovery potential of neutrino observatories such as IceCube. Moreover, our refined simulation framework is expected to facilitate rare event searches by overcoming limitations due to insufficient background statistics or the prohibitive computational expense of accurate signal modeling, thereby enhancing discovery potential in both particle astrophysics and high-energy collider experiments. Expected outcomes also include open-source algorithms and software, as well as the application of this framework to high-energy neutrino analyses, such as those targeting neutrino discoveries at the Galactic Center with IceCube data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of the 20,000 airports in the U.S., only 500 are supported by ATC, leaving over 90% of airports without coordinated traffic separation. Each year, 15 to 25 mid-air collisions occur?most of them fatal?and many more near-misses go unreported. This project addresses that risk by developing a low-cost, tablet-based system that predicts aircraft maneuvers in high-risk airspace near airports. This innovation leverages advances in machine learning and aviation data analytics to enhance predictive accuracy, situating it in the field of aeronautical systems and human-machine interaction. The product will initially serve the general aviation market, targeting the 500,000 U.S. pilots who fly single-pilot aircraft. The value proposition lies in offering real-time, predictive situational awareness without requiring ground infrastructure. This creates a durable competitive advantage by filling a critical safety gap with a standalone, affordable solution. The company?s business model is based on a monthly or annual software subscription. By year three, the system aims to serve over 50,000 pilots, with success measured by adoption rates, incident reduction, and improved safety reporting metrics.<br/><br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and validate predictive algorithms for aircraft maneuvering within the airport environment, where existing traffic avoidance systems are significantly less effective. Current systems rely on ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance?Broadcast) data, using real-time GPS positions to extrapolate future aircraft trajectories based on current velocity and heading. While sufficient for enroute scenarios, this method fails in the airport environment due to frequent, nonlinear maneuvers required for takeoff, landing, and taxiing. The proposed research will leverage physics-based modeling and path prediction algorithms to generate probabilistic 4D trajectories (longitude, latitude, altitude, and time) independent of adherence to FAA-recommended visual traffic patterns, which are often not followed consistently at the 97% of U.S. airports lacking air traffic control. The research will use historical ADS-B data to train and tune the model, followed by real-time testing using live broadcast data. Performance metrics will include spatial and temporal prediction accuracy, as well as system efficacy in forecasting and mitigating potential mid-air conflicts. The anticipated outcome is a validated predictive model capable of delivering earlier and more accurate alerts to general aviation pilots, increasing safety near uncontrolled airports and advancing state-of-the-art predictive analytics in aviation safety systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrified interfaces are critical to a vast number of applications in engineering, chemistry, and life sciences.  The response of water to local electric fields at biological interfaces affects how proteins attach to other macromolecules (e.g., DNA) and to lipid membranes. The mobility of proteins critically depends on dynamical correlations of osmotic and electrostatic forces from hydrating waters which are also affected by the properties of cytosol and interfaces.  While their mobility is connected to random forces, how these forces contribute to observable diffusion of macromolecules and colloidal particles remains unclear. Similarly, surface water molecules can impact barriers to charge-transfer relevant to photosynthesis and respiration. Matyushov, with experimental colleagues, will pursue theoretical modeling of mechanisms of colloidal and protein mobility, electrified interfaces, and protein conductivity. The results of this work will be available to the community in the form of predictive computational algorithms and microscopic insights into physical mechanisms which are not possible to infer from direct laboratory measurements.

By testing this innovative approach on a real-world fiber-optic network in Chattanooga, built in collaboration with industry partners like the Electric Power Board (EPB) and IonQ, Inc., the project demonstrates how quantum science can move beyond laboratory experiments into practical, everyday use.

Many inhabited islands in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean are too small to be resolved in global climate models; thus, island decision makers often lack site-specific data needed to make informed decisions about current and future risks to their populations due to extreme weather events. This research explores the integration of high-resolution geographic and weather information to support planning for the protection and continuous operation of healthcare facilities for impacted populations. Using the island nation of Fiji as a pilot/testbed, this project combines state-of-the-art advances in machine learning and geospatial modeling and data on health facility access, infrastructure, and condition. The goal is better prediction of impacts on island chains of climate-driven hazards related to wind and rain/flooding. Key outcomes will be a decision-support platform to help health officials and practitioners assess and prepare for weather-related health infrastructure risks. It will also advance modeling capabilities in integrating health and weather data. Broader impacts will be improving the ability of island chains with far flung populations to respond to the health implication of  weather-related disasters. The work also directly engages atmospheric scientists with island chain health officials and decision makers, stakeholders which rarely work together. <br/><br/>This research develops cutting-edge, machine-learning-based, modeling tools for tropical cyclone weather events and integrates them with climate health vulnerability assessments. This will yield risk projections for health infrastructure for island chain populations. This project uses Fiji as a pilot/testbed, playing off already established relations between the science team and island health officials and decision makers. Research will involve development of computationally intensive generative tools that: (a) emulate tropical cyclone impacts, (b) downscale climate model data, and (c) statistically categorize extreme events. Researchers are part of a technical advisory group to the South Pacific Community which provides them with access to health facility information allowing the combination of that data with projections of cyclone frequency, intensity, and landfall. This will help decision makers better protect against damage and loss of health operations during tropical cyclone events. Projections will be embedded in a user-friend decision-support tool that allows visualization and analysis of high-risk areas and the distribution of climate risks to health infrastructure. The tools will be developed to ensure accessibility for health/medical practitioners and decision makers. They will combine machine-learning-enabled risk projections with empirical health infrastructure vulnerability data which can be used in other locations to develop similar contextually informed extreme weather-health data for island populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While collision processes between ions and neutral atoms in free space have received theoretical attention, a fully quantum mechanical description of such collisions that includes the ion confinement remains largely unexplored despite the fact that recent experimental advances have realized such systems in the lab. The research team will develop a fully quantum mechanical description of collision processes between neutral atoms and trapped ions. Such a theory is necessary to inform ongoing and near-future experiments, paving the way for ultracold hybrid atom-ion systems as avenues to study atom-ion chemistry, probes of many-body physics in atomic gases, or as platforms for other applications in quantum information science. This work will be carried out at primarily undergraduate institutions, introducing students of diverse backgrounds to methodologies in modern theoretical physics, and providing undergraduates with an opportunity to make meaningful contributions to modern scientific research.<br/><br/>In particular, the research team will investigate collisional resonances that arise as a consequence of the ion confinement, and use insights gained from the study of single ion systems to guide the treatment of systems with two or more ions.  The proposed collision theory constitutes a marriage of two powerful methodologies that have each played a pivotal role in scattering theory and few-body physics: multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT), and the adiabatic hyperspherical method. A successful integration of these methodologies could potentially be applied to other few-body systems well beyond the atom-ion problem. The goals of the project are to (1) refine a preliminary one-dimensional model based on single-channel atom-ion interactions with ionic confinement and extend it to three dimensions, computing observables such as elastic and inelastic collision rates and time delays. (2) Incorporate multichannel interactions that include the internal magnetic structure of the collision partners and investigate the consequences of ion trap micromotion. (3) Building on insights from preceding efforts, formulate a model for hybrid systems of atoms and multiple ions, with particular emphasis on understanding how a collision event couples to the entangled motional state of an ion crystal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The composition, growth mechanisms, and properties of atmospheric nanoclusters remain unknown and have previously not been directly studied given the analytical challenges. Professor Smith and his students will perform experiments by first generating low-volatility gas phase precursors and clusters up to 2.5 nm in diameter and then measuring the physical and chemical properties of these clusters as they grow to 10 nm in diameter. Their studies could result in the identification of the major species and processes that lead to nanoparticle growth of atmospheric aerosol and could lead to improved understanding of the role of new particle formation on clouds and climate. The project will also enhance educational and professional training of undergraduate and graduate students and provide opportunities for science communication to the general public.<br/><br/>The contribution of organics to nanoparticle growth rates will be studied for the following systems: (a) heterogeneous acid-base chemistry of semi-volatile organic acids with sulfuric acid, ammonia and amines; (b) particulate-phase accretion reaction chemistry; (c) direct partitioning of low-volatility gas-phase species. Experiments will be performed using a temperature-controlled flow tube and 560L chamber, and measurements will be made of the size-resolved composition and concentration of nanoclusters over the complete size range (1 ? 10 nm). Two modeling frameworks will be employed to determine the chemical mechanisms responsible for growth. The first is a growth law analysis method that can use measured size distributions to determine whether growth is diffusion-limited or can be attributed to surface- or volume-controlled processes that indicate reactive uptake. The second approach is a chemical closure method, where a model of condensation and reactive uptake will be used to connect measured gas-phase precursor concentrations to the measured composition of nanoclusters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This RAPID proposal aims to understand how environmental conditions and the species of diatom may impact these records. The investigators will use recently collected samples from the Southern Ocean to determine how different species react to varying amounts of nitrogen and silicon. These culture-derived data will then be used to ground-truth field-collected data. This is expected to improve our use of diatom fossil information to understand past ocean conditions.<br/><br/><br/>Diatom fossils provide information on past surface ocean nutrient conditions through the analysis of cell-bound nitrogen and silicon isotopic composition of frustules. Recent data suggested that simple fractionation models do not always explain spatial trends or seasonal variation.

The isolates were collected during the 2024-2025 spring diatom bloom in the Southern Ocean. In addition to accomplishing combined measurements of isotopic relationships and transcriptional response to nutrient conditions for understudied environmentally relevant diatom species, this work will aid in ground truthing in situ cruise data and improve reconstruction of past surface ocean conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Linearly approximating the governing complex physical laws is standard practice to lighten the computational burden, albeit with some inaccuracies. Traditionally, linearization design is agnostic of the end use. However, increased variations in operating conditions highlight the limitations of this one-size-fits-all approach. This NSF project aims to bridge the modeling and application gap by developing novel use-inspired approaches that yield linear models tailored for specific tasks and anticipated operating conditions. Reaching beyond power systems, the project will transform how scientists and engineers linearize complex physical laws to enable real-world applications. The intellectual merits of the project include the development of application-suited linearizations that enable robust decision-making and accurate simulation studies at scale. The broader impacts of the project include the development of tractable grid operation tools to increase the deployment of distributed energy resources. The fundamental aspects of this project will be used to increase the research participation of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Existing power-flow (PF) linearizations are typically developed and assessed based on their accuracy compared to the AC PF equations. However, when using PF linearizations for downstream applications, focusing on the application output accuracy is crucial.

The targeted canonical problems represent high-impact applications such as bulk system dispatch, distributed energy resource management, voltage control, uncertainty management, power system planning, and time-domain simulations. To tackle such diverse challenges, this project will source ideas from bilevel (stochastic) optimization, systems theory, sensitivity analysis, automatic differentiation, system identification, and neural networks. This project will develop comprehensive, rigorous, and tractable approaches allowing explicit inclusion of input data distributions and end-use application structure into the PF linearization process.

It is estimated that approximately 90% of cancer deaths occur due to cancers becoming resistant to current treatments. This project aims to significantly enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies by providing novel strategies to overcome this resistance. The commercial potential of this platform is substantial, driven by the urgent need for effective treatments targeting therapy-resistant cancers, such as lung, breast, and prostate cancer. Given the large patient populations affected by these cancers, the estimated annual revenue potential for a single therapy addressing just one of these cancer types in the United States exceeds $5 billion. Successful development of this project could facilitate the rapid creation and deployment of multiple new treatments, substantially improving patient outcomes and creating significant economic impact.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and validate a novel platform for targeted cancer therapies, which function similarly to guided missiles. In these targeted therapies, the payload is the core element responsible for destroying cancer cells upon delivery. The targeting component functions as a guidance system that directs the payload specifically to cancer cells by recognizing unique or abundant proteins on their surface. Traditional chemotherapy often fails because cancer cells evolve resistance mechanisms, rendering conventional treatments ineffective and often causing significant side effects. This project specifically targets an alternative cell-death pathway that cancer cells cannot easily evade. Research objectives include designing and synthesizing new payload candidates, testing their effectiveness and selectivity against therapy-resistant cancer cells, and verifying their performance in laboratory models. Anticipated results include identifying at least two promising payload candidates, demonstrating their selective anti-cancer properties, and establishing proof-of-concept for this innovative therapeutic approach, thus paving the way for broader applications in cancer treatment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because earthquake recurrence intervals may be hundreds to thousands of years for any given fault, the number of earthquakes directly observed on that fault in recorded history is typically one or two at most.  Paleoseismologists (geologists who study past earthquakes) can dig further back in time by looking at the geologic record of ancient earthquakes: evidence of past slip events that have disturbed rocks and sediment around the fault.  This is an expensive and time-consuming process that involves excavating parts of a fault, mapping out geologic structures, and determining the absolute dates of materials disturbed by past ruptures.  An alternative approach is to study indirect evidence of past earthquake ruptures preserved in the fractured and pulverized rocks surrounding faults in the so-called fault ?damage zone?. A fundamental question in this research project is whether fault damage zones contain information about the maximum earthquake size a fault can host (Mmax) in terms of type, style, extent, width and degree of damage. This project will develop criteria to distinguish damage related to earthquake rupture from damage accrued over the longer-term growth of the fault, and to use these criteria to test the hypothesis that the style and intensity of damage on faults that experience earthquake magnitudes greater than ~Mw6.6 to 6.8 can be clearly distinguished from that of faults experiencing smaller magnitude events.  This project will include a combination of field-based structural geology of crustal scale faults in southern California, cutting edge rock mechanics experiments, and theoretical rock and fracture mechanics to provide a roadmap for identifying uniquely seismic features preserved in damage zones, and to test the overarching hypothesis that the maximum earthquake size a fault can host can be estimated by examining the damage zone structure of active strike slip faults. <br/><br/>Mmax is a critical component of probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) as it limits the maximum size of earthquakes considered in a seismic hazard model. Slip rates of faults are the main drivers of hazard, but Mmax controls the upper end of moment release. If Mmax is large, then a significant proportion of the long-term seismic moment release is accommodated by rare large earthquakes.  In PSHA, this decreases hazard, compared with moderate earthquakes, which also generate strong shaking but have higher recurrence rates. Hence, quantitative information on Mmax is a significant aspect of quantifying hazard to critical facilities. Current approaches for determining Mmax can be strengthened by developing independent criteria that allow for Mmax determination without knowing the full paleoseismic history. This research will lead to the development of criteria to distinguish damage related to earthquake rupture from quasi-static damage accrued over the longer-term fault evolution, and to use these criteria to test the hypothesis that the style and intensity of damage on faults that experience earthquake magnitudes greater than ~Mw6.6 to 6.8 can be clearly distinguished from that on faults experiencing smaller magnitude events. This will be accomplished by carefully documenting the shallow expression of damage zone structure of crustal scale faults in Southern California and examining the unique characteristics of brittle damage that varies as a function of known historical and paleoseismic earthquake magnitudes. The difference in damage state is likely to be explained by increased energy dissipation by off fault deformation above a critical moment magnitude threshold, and understanding this relation yields the potential for estimating Mmax for active faults with incomplete historical and paleoseismological records. This collaborative study will use field-based structural geology, cutting edge rock mechanics experiments, and theoretical rock and fracture mechanics to provide a roadmap for identifying uniquely seismic features preserved in damage zones, and to test the overarching hypothesis that Mmax can be estimated by examining the damage zone structure of active strike slip faults. This project has the potential for developing an independent, deterministic criterion for Mmax on individual active faults by examining the damage zone structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The shifts in rainfall have previously been attributed to migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a band of clouds and rain around the equator that tracks the Sun north and south through the seasons. However, it is becoming clear that the observed rainfall patterns can not be fully explained by ITCZ migration. Drivers of the change in rainfall are key uncertainties in future climate projections in this region and, consequently, the projected impacts on human livelihood and safety. This project will use sediments collected from lakes in Guatemala and Venezuela to reconstruct rainfall through the last 10,000 years by measuring the hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf wax molecules, which originate from the surrounding vegetation and reflect the local rainfall. These data will be synthesized with other climate datasets, and the spatial pattern in rainfall and isotopes will be used along with climate models to investigate the contributions of a variety of atmospheric phenomena. The foundation of this research project is investigation of the rainfall patterns in Earth's climate zones. These foundations map to many of the Missouri grade 6-8 learning standards, for which science curriculum resources are scarce.

Beekeepers struggle to locate queen bees within their hives, a process that is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to colony health. The inability to efficiently locate and assess the condition of a queen bee contributes to hive losses, negatively impacting honey production and pollination-dependent agriculture. Given the essential role of honey bees in pollination, improving hive management has significant economic and ecological implications. By developing a novel bio-acoustic approach to attract queen bees to a predictable location within the hive, the technology will reduce labor costs, enhance hive monitoring, and increase productivity for commercial, sideline, and hobbyist beekeepers. The integration of advanced sensing and artificial intelligence into beekeeping practices will contribute to sustainable precision agriculture, with applications extending beyond honey bee management into broader agricultural and ecological monitoring systems.<br/><br/>This project introduces an innovative bio-acoustic luring system that leverages queen bee communication signals to enable rapid and accurate queen localization within managed hives. The technical innovation lies in the application of bio-acoustic principles to mimic naturally occurring queen bee piping sounds, which trigger predictable responses from the resident queen. This approach has not been previously commercialized and represents a novel method of influencing honey bee behavior for practical hive management applications. The research will focus on refining the acoustic signal parameters, optimizing speaker placement, and evaluating queen bee movement in response to controlled stimuli. A series of field experiments will be conducted in controlled and real-world hive environments to quantify the effectiveness of the bio-acoustic luring system in reducing queen search time and minimizing colony disturbance. The study will also assess the impact of various environmental factors on signal propagation and queen bee responsiveness. This research will establish a foundation for precision beekeeping tools that enhance hive management efficiency while maintaining honey bee health and productivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While some reaction pathways of RO2 are well understood, others?particularly isomerization and self- or cross-reactions?remain poorly characterized, despite their implications for secondary organic aerosol formation. Professor Barber and her students will use sophisticated, real time analytical techniques to examine how isomerizations and self- and cross- reactions of peroxy radicals work together to shape gas-phase product distributions and produce secondary organic aerosol. Their studies could result in improved understanding of the role of peroxy radical chemistry in determining atmospheric composition, tropospheric ozone production, and the formation of secondary organic aerosol, which would enable future improvements in 3D modeling of atmospheric composition and air quality. The proposed work will help cultivate the next generation of researchers in atmospheric chemistry at both the graduate and undergraduate level, and results from the work will be integrated into Professor Barber?s undergraduate environmental chemistry course.<br/><br/>Gas-phase non-methane organic compounds are present in air in small concentrations, but exert outsized influence on atmospheric composition via oxidation chemistry. RO2 are central intermediates in oxidation, with four major reaction pathways: reaction with NO, reaction with HO2, isomerization, and self- or cross-reactions. While the first two pathways are well-characterized, isomerizations and self- or cross-reactions remain poorly understood, despite their implications for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. This project will investigate the interactions between these pathways and their effects on product distributions and SOA formation using controlled environmental chamber experiments. Traditional oxidant-based chamber experiments struggle to isolate these pathways due to concurrent generation of NO and/or HO2. The proposed work circumvents this using alkyl iodide photolysis as a radical source, enabling precise control over RO2 concentrations and reactivity. Coupled to online chemical ionization mass spectrometry and scanning mobility particle sizing, this approach allows for systematic investigations of these reaction pathways, their interactions, and their role in aerosol formation. Specific project goals include examining how RO2 concentrations influence product distributions and SOA yields, assessing the impacts of low levels of NOx on oxidation outcomes, and systematically exploring the role of RO2 structure in modulating isomerization and self- or cross-reaction pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compounding the problem, ex situ vitrification equipment is inaccessible to most researchers due to high costs ranging from tens of thousands to millions of dollars.  The new sample vessel will be formed in a confined and ready-to-image geometry, avoiding air-water interface damage and eliminating the need for blotting, milling, and cutting.  Successful development will make ex situ vitrification obsolete for many applications, enabling a 100-fold reduction in costs and a 20-fold improvement in time-to-data.  Combined with APT, the new sample vessel will provide the first routine capability for imaging the structure and chemistry of biomolecules in 3D.  A breakthrough that can be used streamline computer-aided drug design (CADD) by providing data that can reduce pharmaceutical development costs by up to half, a savings of up to $1 billion per drug.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project resides in the innovative methods and transformative potential of proving a new microscope sample vessel technology that can physically and chemically suppress ice nucleation in order to provide routine in situ vitrification and imaging.

These chemical defenses, often unique to particular plants or groups of plants, are valuable resources for developing natural pesticides that may carry fewer risks for ecosystems and for consumers. This project focuses on a group of plants in the tomato family that produce a promising class of natural insecticides called acylsugars. These sticky sugars are produced by gland-tipped hairs and act as traps for insect predators, but they are non-toxic to humans and degrade quickly in the environment. While most acylsugar research has examined their importance in leaf defense, this research will explore their role in protecting the fruit and its enclosed seeds, studying the tomatillos and their wild relatives. Many of these species cover their fruit in a balloon-like sac that develops from the outer organ of the flower (the calyx), and they decorate this inflated calyx with dense sticky acylsugar-coated hairs. This research will investigate the relationship between the repeated evolutionary origins of the inflated calyx across tomatillos and the production of insecticidal acylsugars, providing the foundation for developing novel natural insecticides. This project is built upon a collaborative network of tomatillo researchers from the U.S. and abroad and will advance international collaborations. It will provide training opportunities for early career researchers including high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow.<br/><br/>In order to trace the coordinated evolution of inflated fruiting calyces and acylsugar defenses, the research will build the first comprehensive phylogenetic tree for all 310 species in the tomatillo clade. The phylogeny will be estimated using target sequence capture relying on existing collections of DNAs and herbarium specimens as well as new field collections. The researchers will use recently described Solanaceae fruit fossils, including two in the tomatillo clade, to calibrate the tree, and apply methods including state-dependent diversification to estimate transition rates to and away from the inflated calyx state. They will specifically test the hypothesis that gains of inflation are irreversible and that they proceed via an intermediate stage in which the calyx expands to cover the fruit but does not inflate. Finally, the project will explore the coupling of this physical defense (calyx elongation and inflation) with chemical defenses. In particular, the researchers posit that independent gains of inflated fruiting calyces are correlated with increased production of glandular trichomes and sticky, insecticidal acylsugars. Together, these three aims will allow the researchers to trace the assembly of a complex plant defense syndrome, which like many trait syndromes, combines convergently-evolved morphological and biochemical innovations as an adaptive response to a shared ecological driver.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Invasive species are introduced from outside their natural range that rapidly expand across areas where they were introduced. Invasive species negatively affect the economy and can change ecosystems in undesirable ways. Because of these negative effects, many restoration efforts involve removing invasive species. The project will test if ecosystems are resilient and can return to their original state after invasive species are removed. This project will also examine how long it takes for ecosystems to return to their original state once invasive species are removed. Both questions will be answered by experiments done in central Kenya, where an invasive ant has displaced native ants that defend Acacia trees against elephants and other browsing mammals. In invaded areas, browsing on trees is common, transforming savanna woodlands into open landscapes with few trees. Through targeted removal of the invasive ant, the project will discover whether invaded areas can be returned to their original state. Removal of invasive ants may restore the partnership between trees and native ants and reduce browsing by elephants. Across much of East Africa, Acacia trees are critical to the bioeconomy because they provide food for black rhinoceros, giraffe, and other animals. These trees are also used for fuel by humans. This project provides an opportunity to answer important questions about ecosystem resilience. Research in this system will address conservation issues that are relevant for land managers and restoration planning.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that a foundational ant-Acacia mutualism responsible for giving rise to near monocultures of the whistling-thorn tree is resilient following the removal of the invasive big-headed ant. Invasion fronts occur along a rainfall gradient, providing an opportunity to quantify whether and under what contexts the ant-acacia mutualism is resilient to removal of big-headed ants. Specifically, this project will answer two questions: (1) following big-headed at removal, how faithfully do stability-promoting feedbacks return to approximate those from uninvaded areas (i.e., is the foundational ant-acacia mutualism resilient)? (2) does resilience hinge on time since invasion, rainfall, or both? To answer these questions, the project will employ large-scale removal of big-headed ants, assays of photosynthesis, and demographic modeling to quantify the restoration of feedback loops involving symbiotic ant activity, elephant browsing, and whole tree photosynthesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the US, 3.4 million low-risk childbirths occur in hospitals each year representing the leading cause for admissions, in-hospital bed use, resulting in $50B direct costs. Despite optimal pharmacological administration, one in five (20%) experience significantly prolonged Stage I active labor durations due to ineffective uterine contractions. This results in increased maternal morbidity, health risks to the mother and infant, and is the leading cause of cesarean sections for low-risk delivery in the US. Rates of prolonged labor continue to increase with obesity, sedentary lifestyle and age of mother. This initiative aims to develop the first medical device therapy for use by Obstetricians to directly increase the labor forces while relieving uterine muscle demand during labor to make childbirth safer.  <br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a minimally invasive intrauterine labor augmentation system (ILAS) providing direct fluidic mechanical pressure modulation. The trans birth canal system utilizes contemporary Class II medical device catheter-balloon (sac) technology to contain saline which fluidically controls intrauterine pressure synchronized to every labor contraction.  In this SBIR Phase I project, the highest risk intrauterine assembly will be developed and mechanically validated through three primary objectives. First, the sac will be further developed for safe prolonged intrauterine use under simulated conditions by refining the biomaterial?s mechanical properties. This will ensure smooth deployment including low coefficient of friction, ease of insertion and withdraw from the uterus, with a suitable external diameter and mechanical handling characteristics. Second, the sac configuration and pleating pattern will be finalized for ensuring a low-profile insertion while maintaining durability and reliability. The system will then be validated through rigorous testing using a mock anatomical test system intrauterine cavity and infant. The results will verify the intrauterine catheter-sac?s ability to deploy properly under simulated use conditions, distribute fluidic pressure evenly to current clinical targets of 50-70mmHg, exhibit durability with a sufficient safety factor. The outcomes are a mechanically validated system using biomaterials suitable for preclinical translation during the next stage of development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most skincare and cleansing products contain more than 85% of water. Currently, products containing water typically are bulkier and heavier, requiring more storage space and cost to transport. These waterless products are lighter and require less storage space and fuel for transportation. The absence of water also removes the need for harmful preservatives, which may reduce product volume and increase the shelf life. The technology is based on ""self-activating"" chemistries that allow each tablet to transform into skincare products such as toner, serum, lotion, and soap by adding a teaspoon or less of water. These tablets are portable and easily used for travel. Each tablet is meant to be used just once, which may be more hygienic than conventional products packaged in bottles and jars. In addition to skincare, waterless products may be used in pharmaceutical and food industries. For example, tablets carrying highly concentrated active ingredients may help combat/prevent wound infections and offer rapid pain management for topical wounds.  Waterless technology may produce products that are easier to use and transport, while conserving water and providing better safety. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of waterless, tableted fprmulations for single use personal care products. Commercially available personal care products containing water are bulky and may lack hygiene, portability, and convenience. This technology has been developed for self-emulsifying or self-activating tablets that disintegrate and dissolve rapidly even when carrying water-insoluble ingredients such as oils. This ability is adapted from the pharmaceutical industry where each tablet quickly disintegrates in water and emulsifies to improve the aqueous solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs. Each skincare tablet is composed of ingredients in specific ranges that permit rapid disintegration followed by self-emulsification while withstanding mechanical stress during manufacturing and storage. Products are designed for single use and quickly transform into traditional soap, liquid and semi-solid personal care products without water or with only a few drops of water. In addition, the personal care products are light in weight, reduce 70% of the space, do not require harmful preservatives, and demonstrate improved shelf life. This technology may be used to improve skincare products such as toner, serum, lotion, cream, and soap as well as carry highly concentrated active ingredients (e.g., antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and pain relief agents) that may help combat wound infections and offer rapid pain management for topical wounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It aims to simultaneously freeze water and CO2 out of industrial exhaust streams with its unique swirling axisymmetric nozzles at locations such as power plants, manufacturing plants, and cement production. The CO2 captured using this technique can then be sold to a downstream customer looking to turn CO2 into a value-added product (e.g. CO2-to-fuel, CO2-to-building materials, etc.) and the captured water can be sold back to local municipal water systems to ease water stress in arid climates.

At its core, the technology involves pressurization of the flue gas exhausted from an industrial source and then accelerating it out at high supersonic speeds. During this flue gas expansion, static temperature and pressure of the exhaust stream are lowered so much that the H2O and CO2 freeze into solid particles. These solid particles are heavier than the surrounding gas and can be separated from the rest of the flow by adding a strong swirling component that migrates the solid particles to the outer regions of the flow. The H2O and CO2 are then removed, and the remaining core flow passes through a power recovery turbine to reduce operational costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) aims to develop new techniques based on topology and other disciplines in pure mathematics to understand complex data. Research questions are strongly motivated by applications from neuroscience, image recognition, biology, material science, geography, and beyond. The underlying idea is that topology helps recognize patterns within data and, therefore, turn data into compressed, useful knowledge. Besides advancing the progress of science by helping to prepare the next generation of applied topologists, this school is also designed to expand the reach of applied topology.<br/><br/>The topic of the school is the study of general techniques to achieve stability of invariants in TDA that can be applied to different objects, from persistence modules to Reeb graphs. In particular, the focus is on questions about the stability of various TDA tools: 1) Which metrics can be introduced to ensure the stability of traditional topological invariants? 2) Which invariants can be developed to ensure stability with respect to traditional metrics? Through questions like these, TDA enriches the traditional fields of algebraic topology and geometry while at the same time striving for theoretical guarantees for practitioners in data analysis. There will be three lecturers alternating in the mornings, an introductory poster section, problem sessions in the afternoons, and a few short research talks from the participants. Ultimately, the school?s goal is to encourage students to develop their own application-motivated results in TDA by considering well-established principled strategies.

By utilizing asset-backed digital tokens, particularly those backed by gold, this platform ensures that loans are collateralized and repaid based on the equivalent value of gold rather than fiat currency. This approach not only mitigates the risks of currency depreciation but also provides a more stable, transparent, and accessible credit alternative. The adoption of this technology has the potential to enhance financial access, promote economic stability, and provide a secure lending environment that benefits both borrowers and lenders.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a blockchain-powered lending infrastructure that enables the tokenization of real-world assets for collateralized loans. Unlike traditional lending systems, this platform leverages distributed ledger technology to ensure transaction transparency, enforceable smart contracts, and automated repayment mechanisms based on asset valuation. By using cryptographically secured digital representations of physical assets, lenders can provide credit with minimized counterparty risk, while borrowers can access capital without reliance on volatile fiat-based loan structures. This work contributes to advancements in decentralized finance and asset tokenization, offering a novel framework for secure, interest-free lending with applications in both consumer and institutional financial markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy storage devices are important for curbing catastrophic climate change. However, renewable electricity from wind and solar is intermittent, which means that this energy must be stored for use at night or when the wind is not blowing. The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to chemical fuels is a potential strategy for storing renewable electricity. Catalysts usually exhibit variations in performance when the structure of the material is changed. The proposed study will use experimental methods to understand how the structure of the material influences its performance as a catalyst.

Parasitism is one of these complex interactions that can impact multiple types of hosts from humans to plants. The process of parasite transmission is complex, and parasites employ various mechanisms to ultimately exploit the host resources. Some parasites even use other organisms, like insects, as vectors to infect their hosts which adds, yet another layer of complexity. Mathematical models have been essential to allow us to study vector-borne parasite transmission. Yet, these simplified relationships ultimately may result in an incomplete picture of the ecological process. Moreover, these simplifications may result in biased understanding of key population-level outcomes such as the proportion of individuals infected or how likely is a parasite to persist. For instance, models assume that every individual host has the same probability of getting infected. However, we know that this may not be always true. This project considers individual differences, host movement, and spatial variations to study their impact on  host infection and the transmission of disease in the system. This CAREER project integrates teaching and research to development a graduate course and will provide opportunities to graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in research.<br/><br/>This study evaluates how much model complexity is needed to effectively describe and forecast vector-borne disease dynamics. To answer this question this project follows an interdisciplinary approach that integrates hypotheses derived from theoretical mathematical models of increasing complexity with field transmission experiments in a natural lizard-malaria system in Puerto Rico. The investigators will build models that describe vector-borne parasite transmission under a variety of heterogeneous scenarios for the hosts including (1) individual differences, (2) movement, and (3) spatial heterogeneity. Then, the hypotheses will be tested in enclosure experiments in a natural lizard-malaria system. In these experiments, the conditions of the mathematical models on populations of infected and uninfected lizards and mosquito vectors will be recreated to quantify parasite prevalence and persistence under different heterogeneity scenarios. The quantitative interdisciplinary approach that is the cornerstone of this project is also regarded as a key gap in undergraduate and graduate training in ecology.

Precious metals-based fillers have dominated a wide swath of filler applications since the 1950s due to their favorable melting temperature range and low reactivity with other engineering materials. These applications include fuel system assembly for gas turbine engines in the power generation and aerospace industries, an early focal application in this project, where gas turbine OEMs and fuel-system subcontractors represent early prospective customers. This work targets precious metal consumption displacement by multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), which contain far more abundant component elements and can be tailored to meet the demands of specific applications. A successful commercialization effort will carry far-reaching impacts for America?s economic competitiveness and independence from foreign-sourced critical and noble metals in the brazing filler market (with a global market size of $5.5B in 2030) and beyond. The benefits of MPEAs can be exploited for structural applications with demanding operating conditions.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will realize these impacts by supporting in-operando component-level testing for use cases identified through close collaboration with industry for early adoption. A key outcome of Phase I was utilizing a high-throughput computational methodology to rapidly design tailored MPEA compositions, overcoming a decades-long lag in innovation in the braze filler material research space. Phase II aims to translate this innovation into a user-ready product by (1) finely tailoring final alloy compositions for customer-specified performance attributes, and (2) enabling the fabrication of alloys in powder format, which is suitable for drop-in replacement of current alternatives in most applications. The characteristically high flexibility in composition design for MPEAs, coupled with our established design platform, is anticipated to enable rapid identification of the optimized fine-tuned compositions. Once fully specified, these will be manufactured at the bench scale to support low-volume component-level testing with the earliest adopters in parallel with bringing our pilot-scale manufacturing capabilities online for progressively higher-volume tests. It is targeted to have the product be classified in a specification by a certifying agency and approved for at least one use case at one or more major OEMs by the conclusion of Phase II.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The solution addresses a pressing national need to improve community resilience and economic preparedness in the face of increasing weather-related threats. Currently available tools often offer limited precision, presenting data at broader geographic scales and failing to account for the seasonal variability of hazards. This limitation makes it difficult for decision-makers in real estate, infrastructure planning, and insurance to accurately assess risk and plan mitigation strategies. The technology enables users to input a specific location and receive detailed hazard indices that reflect current vulnerabilities and also change over time and across seasons. Outputs are presented through intuitive visualizations, such as maps and charts, to facilitate use by both experts and non-experts. By making environmental risk data more accessible and tailored to specific parcels of land, this project enables better decision-making, supports safer urban development, and reduces long-term costs. The technology advances scientific understanding, strengthens economic resilience, and helps communities prepare for and respond to weather-related disasters.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a geospatial modeling platform that applies advanced algorithms to assess compound and seasonal natural hazards at high spatial resolution. The platform processes a range of public environmental datasets to evaluate hazard exposure, vulnerability, and preparedness metrics, integrating them into a composite hazard index. Unlike traditional tools that use static or low-resolution data, this technology supports dynamic, time-sensitive risk assessments tailored to the location and season. The platform incorporates advanced statistical normalization techniques, machine learning-based pattern recognition, and customizable timeframes for historical analysis. Risk factors are quantified and converted into user-friendly outputs including heatmaps, graphs, and summary tables. Early-stage validation studies have shown that the system can accurately predict risk-related outcomes when compared against observed hazard data. These results are evaluated using statistical metrics such as percent bias and correlation coefficients to ensure scientific rigor. The technology holds promise for transforming how professionals in planning, engineering, and environmental management access and apply risk information to make timely, location-specific decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similar to the biological sensor system used for the sense of smell that can detect and distinguish individual odors amongst many others, this technology utilizes sensor to detect and analyze molecules in complex environments such as biological fluids or recycled water. The goal is to provide an alternative to instruments that require highly trained technicians and expensive infrastructure for operation. This approach has been used to determine the presence of a bacterial infection along with appropriate antibiotic therapy, impurities in treated water, and aerosolized chemicals. The technology may address unmet needs in medical diagnostics assessing the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics. The solution could rapidly determine appropriate antibiotic therapies for patients and monitor chemical byproducts in a manufacturing process and water treatment applications.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a molecular sensor system sensor using surface chemistry and artificial neural networks. The technology is based on a nanophotonic sensing platform that uses a combination of vibrational spectroscopy and machine learning analysis to analyze complex chemical mixtures. Molecular scale control of surface chemistry has led to reproducible sensor detection at single molecule detection limits allowing for quantification of analytes down to femtomolar concentrations using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). SERS spectral data is then analyzed with machine learning algorithms to ?fingerprint? complex spectral response. The sensitivity, coupled with the ability to rapidly gather large SERS datasets, provides a means to measure changes in multiple chemical signals rather than only detect a single analyte in typical sensor platforms. Chemical profiles of the metabolic response of bacterial cells exposed to antibiotics provide a fingerprint to discriminate between resistance and susceptibility of bacteria after exposure to antibiotics. Using this platform, metabolic responses to antibiotics in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two common pathogens associated with urinary tract infections, are observed below the conventional minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics in 5 minutes with 99.3% accuracy, discriminating between susceptible versus resistant bacteria. This platform may have potential for providing rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests that may mitigate the rise in antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria or inform the user of toxicants in the environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The demand for faster and more reliable wireless communication networks puts immense pressure on the available radio-frequency (RF) spectrum. Expanding into the FR3 band (7-24 GHz) alongside traditional sub-7 GHz frequencies is crucial to enable wider coverage, higher capacity, and faster data rates to support critical technologies and applications across various industries. However, as more devices and services rely on wireless communications, networks become increasingly crowded, leading to various types of radio interference among different systems. As spectrum environments become more dynamic and interference levels continue to rise, advanced interference-immune RF electronics hardware is needed. The techniques proposed in this project aim to address these challenges by introducing innovative microelectronic hardware solutions that can enhance the performance and resilience of future wireless systems in highly dynamic and congested spectrum environments. The new techniques can quickly adapt to interference, ensuring robust operation even under severe interference conditions of various forms.<br/><br/>This project seeks to investigate RF (including mm-wave frequency bands) silicon-integrated radio front-ends with high dynamic range for out-of-band (OOB), harmonic, and spatial interference, enabling interference detection, mitigation, and hardware adaptation for improved system operation in shared, congested, and contested spectrum bands. Different use cases, from low-power IoE devices to high-performance communication systems, are considered. Microelectronic circuits and systems will be developed to support sub-7 GHz bands and FR3 band (7-24 GHz). The research efforts are delineated into the following three thrusts: i) A low-power harmonic-resilient software-defined radio (SDR) prototype will be demonstrated, which is enabled by a fully passive harmonic-reject mixer topology that provides harmonic rejection at its input, output, and all internal nodes. Furthermore, a compact low-power clocking scheme will be incorporated in the design which will allow seamless operation of the SDR in the presence of harmonic interferers with sub-milliwatt static power consumption. ii) Highly selective harmonic-resilient front-ends with enhanced RF selectivity concurrently targeting OOB and 3rd- and 5th-order harmonic interferers. iii) A spatial blocker-tolerant digital multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver for operation within the 7-24 GHz frequency band with RF-domain spatial notch filtering using a widely tunable nonreciprocal phase shifter will be developed. An autonomous notch-steering control loop with a fast settling time is presented to be integrated for interference sensing and system adaptation.

Acid is widely used in metal refining processes from primary extraction to product finishing across metals including nickel, lithium, rare earths, and steel. However, current acid production and recycling methods are often associated with the generation of hazardous gases that must be managed. The transportation of acids and precursor chemicals adds further logistical complexity and costs to metals processing plants, especially where primary extraction occurs at remote mining sites. Spent acid is often wholly or partially neutralized on site to form salts of calcium, magnesium, sodium, or iron, which can pose environmental risks and space constraints to mine or refinery sites and surrounding ecosystems. Acid procurement and waste management can account for 30% to 80% of operating expenditures in metals leaching processes. This technology may offer a safer, cleaner, and more energy-efficient alternative for metal extraction with no direct emissions or hazardous byproducts. In addition, this technology may enable sustainable domestic supply chains for critical materials.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a bipolar membrane electrodialysis platform for acid and base production. The adoption of bipolar membrane electrodialysis in metallurgy has been limited due to the low concentrations of acid electrodialysis can produce with current technology. Metals leaching typically requires more concentrated acids and bases than in common applications of electrodialysis such as in the beverage or desalination industries. This technology allows for the doubling of acid concentrations versus traditional electrodialysis by optimizing membrane compositions, reactor component sizing, and operational parameters. Unlike conventional acid generation technologies, this approach avoids combustion, phase changes, or hazardous byproducts. The research builds on recent advances in membrane materials and stack design to improve efficiency and durability, allowing for high-throughput operation with minimal downtime. This technology may enable production of concentrated acid and thus, has important applications in metallurgy, where concentrated acids are widely used to extract metals from ores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polyextremotolerant fungi found in cold deserts, naturally produce melanin, incorporating it into their cell wall and releasing it under certain conditions. In nutrient-poor environments, where organic material is scarce, these fungi may form symbiotic partnerships with photosynthetic organisms like algae and cyanobacteria. Within these partnerships melanin may be exchanged for essential nutrients. Therefore, melanin could be available to help protect partners from UV radiation, cold temperatures, and water scarcity, enabling the survival of biological soil crusts. However, the genetic or metabolic triggers for melanin excretion are not well understood. This project investigates the symbiosis between a polyextremotolerant fungus and its photosynthetic partners, aiming to uncover the triggers regulating melanin production. It also develops predictive models of the metabolic interactions of the entire microbial community and validates these findings using genetic tools. Additionally, the fungus could serve as a valuable resource for large-scale melanin production, with applications in UV-protective products and advanced materials for the aerospace and other industries. Beyond scientific discovery, the project enhances the STEM workforce by implementing educational, outreach and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>This project aims to address two key deficiencies in understanding the role of a melanized fungus (Exophiala viscosa) in biological soil crusts: the mechanisms regulating melanin production and excretion, and the lack of experimental evidence for metabolite exchange between the melanized fungus and photosynthetic microbes. To tackle these knowledge deficiencies, the proposed research: 1) utilizes ?omics? data to discern the molecular mechanisms regulating melanin production in the fungus, when tri-cultured with an algae and a cyanobacterium; 2) develops and refines microbial community metabolic models to explore inter-species metabolic interactions and assess how carbon and nitrogen sources from the algae and cyanobacterium impact melanin production; and 3) employs genetic tools developed for the melanized fungus to investigate the interactions driving melanin secretion, applying targeted gene editing informed by the modeling framework. Aided by mathematical modeling and experimental validation, this directed experimental design investigates specific one-on-one interactions among ?keystone? microbial species to understand the community dynamics and foster symbioses critical for community survival. This approach promises a deeper understanding of microbial interactions, which differs from typical microbial ecology metagenomics-focused studies that do not provide detailed molecular insights into microbial interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These types of complex manifolds have a wide array of applications throughout physics and mathematics, and for this reason have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. This project will focus on constructions and classifications of such complex manifolds. The results will deepen our understanding of the geometry of complex manifolds as a whole and more broadly will further advance our knowledge through connections to other subjects ranging from algebraic geometry, topology, and analysis to physics. The project will also be used to help support researchers interested in contributing to these active and competitive fields. <br/><br/>More technically, the project aims to further our understanding of the singularity development both of the Khler-Ricci flow and of collapsing Calabi-Yau manifolds. Characterizing the development of singularities along the Khler-Ricci flow is one of the fundamental questions in geometric analysis and is expected to reveal deep ties between geometric analysis, algebraic geometry, and topology. On the other hand, the analogous collapsing Calabi-Yau picture has many applications, including to physics. These two programs fit into a common framework, each with a given singularity model (respectively Khler-Ricci solitons and complete non-compact Calabi-Yau metrics) and a corresponding type of degeneration (respectively the Khler-Ricci flow and families of collapsing Calabi-Yau manifolds). The project will (1) construct examples of non-compact singularity model geometries, (2) describe the moduli of these spaces and (3) analyze the corresponding degenerations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Industrial IoT networks have specific and unique operating requirements that make them highly prone to service disruption and security breaches. Moreover, these networks typically cover large geographical regions and operate in mission-critical industries such as healthcare and energy production. These challenges make software update processes highly challenging, and a top requirement by industrial IoT service providers. This solution also has the potential to decrease the threat of security breaches and attacks on mission-critical infrastructure in the energy, healthcare, and military sectors. As a result, this technology could reduce the economic costs incurred by service disruptions and any accompanying reputation loss, which can reach several millions of U.S. dollars per security incident.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of energy-efficient cryptographic techniques to ensure the incremental updating of sensor-nodes in large-scale, industrial, Internet of Things (IoT) architectures. The technology safeguards the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the software update components, and minimizes the service disruption time needed while loading, deploying, and processing the software updates. The main security engine leverages probabilistic data structures and incremental cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the energy consumption of the software update algorithms and to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the industrial IoT network during the update process. This secure software update solution could provide a safer operating environment for end users in applications relying on IoT architectures. Moreover, the energy-efficient and incremental cryptographic data structures employed in this solution increases the scalability of the overall IoT network and reduces service disruption times, lowering the overall operating costs of mission-critical industrial IoT deployments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Partial differential equations (PDE) are fundamentally important in mathematically oriented scientific fields such as physics and engineering. They are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. Similarly, harmonic analysis, historically developed from Fourier analysis, holds fundamental relevance in science, engineering, and the study of wave phenomena in general, beginning with the idea that a signal is composed of a sum of individual oscillatory components. Naturally, PDE and harmonic analysis go hand in hand, forming a powerful building block of modern mathematical analysis. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of tools and techniques at the confluence of harmonic analysis and PDE, providing solutions to longstanding open problems and permitting progress on multiple fronts. The invited speakers for this event are world-class experts who have been at the forefront of many recent breakthroughs and advances in these areas. Bringing them together offers a great opportunity to actively seek a timely cross-fertilization of ideas. For other conference participants, this provides a distinct chance to confer with and directly learn from experts across various fields. The interdisciplinary research fostered by this conference contributes to efforts to enlarge the nation's science personnel base and is expected to catalyze collaboration between mathematicians working at the confluence of harmonic analysis and PDE. Particular attention is directed to early-career researchers. In addition to providing them with a platform for learning from and interacting with leading experts in these fields, the conference will offer graduate students the opportunity to disseminate their research findings via poster presentations.<br/><br/>During the last decade we have witnessed an accelerated development of techniques rooted in harmonic analysis which have been motivated by problems arising in PDE. As a consequence, new research venues have been created and deep difficult questions come within reach of these methods. These make the conference a very timely event which has the potential to disseminate and advance the current knowledge in the area of mathematics at the interface between harmonic analysis and PDE. Ideas originating in geometric measure theory have proved crucial in obtaining sharp estimates and regularity results in partial differential equations, the Calderon-Zygmund theory of singular integral operators, complex analysis, and potential theory on Riemannian manifolds, among other fields. Harmonic analysis techniques have also proved to be powerful, resilient, adaptable, and impactful in nonlinear PDE and the spectral theory of linear operators. The list of speakers is comprised of individuals who have pushed the boundaries and established new paradigms in these fields, playing an influential role and having a lasting impact in the area.

Despite the critical role of ionic signaling in biological systems, our understanding of such phenomena remains limited. Ionic kinetics, crucial for cellular functions and signaling, are only understood qualitatively due to the lack of near-real-time monitoring technologies. Studying and manipulating these ionic signals not only helps in understanding how microorganisms communicate, evolve, and develop, but also enables the probing and controlling of cellular activities. This proposal aims to develop innovative soft ionic transistors to measure and analyze the ionic characteristics of biological cells and their environments. This project seeks to bridge the gap between rigid electronic devices and soft ionic biological systems by designing soft ionic transistors that use cellular ions to trigger their gating mechanism. This advancement would enable the study and could significantly enhance the understanding of cellular functions, stress responses, and the role of ions and ionic signals in biological systems, thereby providing deeper insights into biological mechanisms. The outcomes of this project are expected to have broad societal impacts, including significant effects on drug discovery and testing, personalized medicine, aging studies, and novel therapeutic strategies such as pain management and rehabilitation.<br/><br/>Ionic kinetics and the resultant intracellular-extracellular ion concentration gradients control cellular functions and intercellular signaling and communications. These ion concentration gradients indicate the health and functionality of cells and organs. Despite its critical role, the current understanding of cellular ionic kinetics remains largely qualitative, and the capacity to evaluate cellular functions based on their ionic activities is very limited. These limitations stem from the absence of technologies that can monitor ionic activities at the cellular level in near-real-time and continuously. This proposal aims to advance the understanding of cellular ionic kinetics by developing soft ionic transistors capable of continuously monitoring ionic activities at the cellular level. These transistors feature a novel gating mechanism triggered by ions secreted during cellular activities, allowing for near-real-time, quantitative evaluation of cellular ionic functions and addressing the current technological gap in monitoring ionic activities in biological systems. The central hypothesis of this research is that ion concentration gradients can polarize the ionic environment inside a transistor, forming electron-conductive ionic double layers at the bioenvironment-transistor interface. This hypothesis will be tested through in-vitro cell studies facilitated by soft ionic transistors. The project will involve designing, fabricating, and characterizing soft ionic transistors, followed by in-vitro cell studies to test the central hypothesis. Machine learning algorithms will be employed to develop a comprehensive model of the ionic attributes of biological systems, establishing relationships involving multiple interrelated physical, chemical, and biological variables. The anticipated outcome is a significant enhancement in the quantitative evaluation of cellular ionic activities and understanding of the correlations between ionic kinetics and cellular functions, thus bridging a critical gap in current knowledge of cellular ionics and their role in biological systems. The project outcomes are expected to have broad scientific and societal impacts. The ability to chronically study developing and growing biological systems will significantly impact various scientific fields, including drug discovery, aging research, personalized medicine, and novel therapeutic strategies such as pain management, all of which have broad societal impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nearly half the world?s population lives on the coast. Even more humans depend on coastal resources. These resources are threatened by sea-level rise, warming air and water temperatures, and changes in the frequency and strength of storms and rainfall. The best way to understand how and why coasts are changing in response to these threats is to use long-term ecological data. This project will use long-term experiments and models to predict how future environments will affect coasts and their resources. The research will be done at the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research (VCR LTER) site. The results will benefit society by improving coastal management that will protect shorelines, increase biodiversity, and produce seafood.<br/><br/>VCR LTER research builds on prior research and addresses three themes that test fundamental theories of ecosystem state change and spatial ecology: 1) mechanisms and consequences of state change within ecosystems; 2) connectivity and coupled dynamics between ecosystems; and 3) landscape-scale dynamics of ecosystem function, synchrony, and stability. VCR LTER research will identify biophysical feedbacks that either maintain or facilitate transitions in ecosystem states--including disturbance, recovery and restoration--and threshold responses to environmental drivers. The project will develop mechanistic models, calibrated and validated with short- and long-term data, and will use these to project state change. Additionally, the consequences of state change and cross-scale interactions for ecosystems attributes will be investigated, focusing on biodiversity, organic matter, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration. Collectively, this research increases the current and predictive understanding of how coastal ecosystems and their functions respond to environmental drivers. Cross-site and synthesis studies enhance the impact of the site-based research and contribute to broader knowledge on ecosystem transitions in response to long-term trends and variation in the environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The underlying rationale for this project, grounded in empirical research in ethnobotany and ecology, suggests the implementation of multiple dietary plant staples allows food producing societies to increase and stabilize food yields. Diverse food systems can thus constitute a strategic response to episodes of demographic growth. Archaeology can further substantiate these insights because it provides subsistence and population data on the centennial and millennial scales, highlighting successful strategies that have stood the test of time. At present, the link between subsistence diversity and socio-environmental sustainability increasingly draws interdisciplinary attention, largely due to the vulnerabilities of industrial farming. Contemporary farming is predicated on the continued success of high-yielding monocultures, but the biological simplification of food systems has increased dependency on human inputs and susceptibility to change. Understanding the long-term implications of species variability in farming systems is therefore of value in the United States today.<br/> <br/>The project addresses these issues by looking at two research questions in the context of an archaeological habitation site where both farming and plant foraging took place. The project first determines the extent of demographic change at the site throughout its occupation: this is accomplished through an analysis of wood charcoal remains that have already been excavated. Based on ethnographic observations of fuelwood collection, charcoal remains are expected to reflect population levels because small groups that do not experience resource stress tend to only select a handful of tree species from easy-to-access locations. The investigator therefore measures changes over time in the number of tree species used for fuel, as well as the accessibility of where the fuel was collected. The latter is assessed through oxygen stable isotope analysis, which represents a methodological innovation in archaeobotany. Data concerning the type of fuelwood that was selected over time serves as a proxy for population pressure. A second question focuses on whether the local food system became more diverse to cope with increased population pressure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These particles can act as the building blocks for cloud droplets and eventually precipitation.  Very large particles, known as giant sea salt aerosols (GSSA) have been historically difficult to observe because most instrumentation has been designed for smaller particles.  There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the production and vertical mixing of GSSA particles within the lowest part of the atmosphere above the ocean?s surface.  This study will make measurements of GSSA using a specialized instrument and combine that with numerical modeling to address questions about how these particles move through the atmosphere.  This research is societally important because it will help to guide numerical model development for better representation of clouds and precipitation.  This is a postdoctoral research fellowship award, so it also contributes to the development of the next generation of atmospheric scientists.<br/><br/>This award is for observational and modeling research that will address a critical gap in aerosol research relating to giant sea salt aerosol production and distribution.  The research plan consists of a three-pronged approach.  The researcher will use the mini-Giant Nuclei Impactor to make observations of GSSA during research cruises from Hawai?i.  These data will be analyzed to construct a distribution of GSSA from the turbulent wave layer through the mixed layer of the atmosphere.  In parallel, the PI, with help from a mentor, will use Large Eddy Simulation (LES) modeling to identify environmental variables, such as wind and humidity, that have the greatest influence on the vertical transport of GSSA.

Yet these resources vary widely ? languages like English use optional words like ?apparently? or ?maybe,? while other languages use complex combinations of obligatory affixes or other grammatical resources. These strategies are significant for communication ? for example, a language that forces a speaker to be explicit about his or her information sources might lead to very different outcomes than one that does not. Moreover, knowledge may be expressed differently when it comes from the speaker, who can be sure about what they are thinking versus another person, whose thoughts we cannot know in the same way ? and languages vary in their ?rules? for representing these differences. This project contributes to our understanding of the cross-linguistic possibilities in the expression of these domains, which in turn sheds light on the range of human perspectives on how knowledge is obtained and represented.<br/><br/>This project addresses these questions in a set of language varieties spoken in remote rural communities, where speakers? perspectives on knowledge and information source are likely to be maximally distinct from those represented in the urban and semi-urban contexts familiar to speakers of well-studied languages.

This project is enabled by a proprietary platform technology developed in Phase I of the project for mass production of a cell-based treatment with substantial improvements in molecular and functional fidelity. This novel platform offers a scalable, renewable approach for developing cost-effective therapies for a broad community of patients, and addresses major pain points in current adoptive immunotherapy development by eliminating time consuming and labor-intensive manufacturing processes and reducing expensive treatment cost. These advantages may enable the company to excel in the $3.3 billion immunotherapy market. Once developed, the novel cell-based off-the-shelf cell-based immunotherapies can provide significant healthcare, social, and economic impacts, and advance the health and welfare of the American public.  <br/><br/>The proposed project aims to develop and validate a novel platform technology for the scalable generation of high quality, robust tumor-targeted induced nai?ve T cells for off-the-shelf anticancer therapies. This platform employs a proprietary method to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived thymic epithelial cells as a critical element to enable induced nave T cell production. The scientific rationale derives from the natural biology of the Thymus, where the transition of immature T cells to nai?ve T cells requires interaction with thymic epithelial cells through a process called positive selection. This project focuses on demonstrating the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of these induced nave T cells. The selected cancer targets are CD19 for B cell malignancies and MAGE-A4 for solid tumors. Xenograft models with human cancer cell lines and immunodeficient mouse will be used in the assessment. Overall, this project aims to accomplish two objectives: 1) increase efficacy of iPSC-derived T cell therapy relative to current approaches; and 2) reduce the prohibitively high cost of current autologous T cell therapies, advancing health equity for cancer patients. The resulting product may enable a significant advance in the development of iPSC-based T cell immunotherapies with clinically relevant cell fidelity, reproducibility and scalability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polyextremotolerant fungi found in cold deserts, naturally produce melanin, incorporating it into their cell wall and releasing it under certain conditions. In nutrient-poor environments, where organic material is scarce, these fungi may form symbiotic partnerships with photosynthetic organisms like algae and cyanobacteria. Within these partnerships melanin may be exchanged for essential nutrients. Therefore, melanin could be available to help protect partners from UV radiation, cold temperatures, and water scarcity, enabling the survival of biological soil crusts. However, the genetic or metabolic triggers for melanin excretion are not well understood. This project investigates the symbiosis between a polyextremotolerant fungus and its photosynthetic partners, aiming to uncover the triggers regulating melanin production. It also develops predictive models of the metabolic interactions of the entire microbial community and validates these findings using genetic tools. Additionally, the fungus could serve as a valuable resource for large-scale melanin production, with applications in UV-protective products and advanced materials for the aerospace and other industries. Beyond scientific discovery, the project enhances the STEM workforce by implementing educational, outreach and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>This project aims to address two key deficiencies in understanding the role of a melanized fungus (Exophiala viscosa) in biological soil crusts: the mechanisms regulating melanin production and excretion, and the lack of experimental evidence for metabolite exchange between the melanized fungus and photosynthetic microbes. To tackle these knowledge deficiencies, the proposed research: 1) utilizes ?omics? data to discern the molecular mechanisms regulating melanin production in the fungus, when tri-cultured with an algae and a cyanobacterium; 2) develops and refines microbial community metabolic models to explore inter-species metabolic interactions and assess how carbon and nitrogen sources from the algae and cyanobacterium impact melanin production; and 3) employs genetic tools developed for the melanized fungus to investigate the interactions driving melanin secretion, applying targeted gene editing informed by the modeling framework. Aided by mathematical modeling and experimental validation, this directed experimental design investigates specific one-on-one interactions among ?keystone? microbial species to understand the community dynamics and foster symbioses critical for community survival. This approach promises a deeper understanding of microbial interactions, which differs from typical microbial ecology metagenomics-focused studies that do not provide detailed molecular insights into microbial interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These soft neural implants address the need for customizable and accessible technologies in neurological care. Conventional neural implants often suffer from high manufacturing costs, poor adaptability to individual brain anatomy, and limited compatibility with soft neural tissues, which can reduce treatment efficacy and increase the risk of complications. This project introduces an innovative solution that employs advanced design and fabrication techniques to produce implants precisely tailored to each patient?s brain structure. These implants can also enable communication between the brain and external devices, offering new approaches for treating individuals with severe motor impairments. By reducing production costs and enhancing fitness and performance, the approach has the potential to improve clinical outcomes while expanding access to cutting-edge neurological therapies. The technology supports healthcare delivery by making personalized neural treatments more affordable and scalable for all patients.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of personalized neural implants tailored to the unique anatomical structures of individual brains, offering a new approach in neural interface design. Traditional implants, typically fabricated using lithographic techniques optimized for mass production, are rigid and poorly suited to the brain?s complex anatomy, resulting in inadequate electrode-tissue contact, reduced signal fidelity, and increased foreign body responses. To address these challenges, this project introduces an integrated platform that combines magnetic resonance imaging-based anatomical mapping, simulation-driven optimization for pre-implantation safety and efficacy, and direct ink writing-based three-dimensional printing to create implants customized to individual brain structures. These neural implants are fabricated from soft, biocompatible and magnetic resonance imaging-compatible materials engineered to closely match the mechanical properties of neural tissue. The personalized designs further enhance tissue integration and long-term device performance while minimizing inflammatory responses. Additionally, the additive manufacturing approach enables rapid prototyping and scalable production, reducing fabrication time and allowing faster delivery of anatomically precise implants to patients. This level of anatomical specificity improves the targeting accuracy of brain regions, enhancing the performance of brain-computer interface applications and neuromodulation therapies. By eliminating the need for traditional photolithography, the platform has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs, shorten production timelines, and enable greater design flexibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to improve knowledge of tectonics by studying the deep structure beneath Africa, a continent that holds key clues about how the interior of the planet influences surface movements. Unusually hot mantle rocks are observed underneath Africa,  as well as the East African Rift System, the most prominent and active continental rift on the Earth. Taking advantage of these features, the project will  develop a detailed model of the deep structure beneath this continent. It will also  revise how its tectonic plates move, and explore interactions between the Earth?s outer shell with the deeper convecting mantle beneath Africa. The results of this research will help increase understanding of fundamental processes shaping our planet. For example, the findings may enhance earthquake hazard assessments, improve models of global plate motions, and provide relevant information to other aligned fields, such as geothermal exploration. This project uses advanced seismic and geodetic data to provide a more complete picture of Earth's dynamic interior.<br/><br/>This project will try to advance the understanding of plate tectonics by investigating how the African continent interacts with the underlying convecting mantle. Specifically, it will test a long-standing hypothesis that lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling modulates the influence of mantle convection on Africa?s surface motions, with broader implications for global tectonic processes. The research will integrate seismic and geodetic data from AfricaArray, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations, and other sources to develop open-access, high-resolution continental-scale models of the kinematics of Africa, crustal and lithospheric structure, upper mantle seismic properties?including azimuthal anisotropy?and key mantle discontinuities. To test this hypothesis, the project will enhance and leverage the capabilities of the open-source software ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Planetary Evolution, Convection, and Tectonics) to enable improved modeling of lithosphere-asthenosphere viscous coupling at a continental scale. A key objective is to determine whether lithospheric motion in Africa and its surroundings is only weakly coupled to the underlying convecting mantle due to an anomalously hot and low-viscosity upper asthenosphere. Beyond scientific contributions, the project has the following major broader impacts. It will support annual AfricaArray meetings in South Africa and enhance capacity-building efforts through workshops on data science, seismic and GNSS data processing, and access to streaming datasets. These workshops will follow well-established Carpentries lesson structures, with a focus on training new instructors.. An independent professional evaluation will make sure its impacts are maximized.

Because earthquake recurrence intervals may be hundreds to thousands of years for any given fault, the number of earthquakes directly observed on that fault in recorded history is typically one or two at most.  Paleoseismologists (geologists who study past earthquakes) can dig further back in time by looking at the geologic record of ancient earthquakes: evidence of past slip events that have disturbed rocks and sediment around the fault.  This is an expensive and time-consuming process that involves excavating parts of a fault, mapping out geologic structures, and determining the absolute dates of materials disturbed by past ruptures.  An alternative approach is to study indirect evidence of past earthquake ruptures preserved in the fractured and pulverized rocks surrounding faults in the so-called fault ?damage zone?. A fundamental question in this research project is whether fault damage zones contain information about the maximum earthquake size a fault can host (Mmax) in terms of type, style, extent, width and degree of damage. This project will develop criteria to distinguish damage related to earthquake rupture from damage accrued over the longer-term growth of the fault, and to use these criteria to test the hypothesis that the style and intensity of damage on faults that experience earthquake magnitudes greater than ~Mw6.6 to 6.8 can be clearly distinguished from that of faults experiencing smaller magnitude events.  This project will include a combination of field-based structural geology of crustal scale faults in southern California, cutting edge rock mechanics experiments, and theoretical rock and fracture mechanics to provide a roadmap for identifying uniquely seismic features preserved in damage zones, and to test the overarching hypothesis that the maximum earthquake size a fault can host can be estimated by examining the damage zone structure of active strike slip faults. <br/><br/>Mmax is a critical component of probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) as it limits the maximum size of earthquakes considered in a seismic hazard model. Slip rates of faults are the main drivers of hazard, but Mmax controls the upper end of moment release. If Mmax is large, then a significant proportion of the long-term seismic moment release is accommodated by rare large earthquakes.  In PSHA, this decreases hazard, compared with moderate earthquakes, which also generate strong shaking but have higher recurrence rates. Hence, quantitative information on Mmax is a significant aspect of quantifying hazard to critical facilities. Current approaches for determining Mmax can be strengthened by developing independent criteria that allow for Mmax determination without knowing the full paleoseismic history. This research will lead to the development of criteria to distinguish damage related to earthquake rupture from quasi-static damage accrued over the longer-term fault evolution, and to use these criteria to test the hypothesis that the style and intensity of damage on faults that experience earthquake magnitudes greater than ~Mw6.6 to 6.8 can be clearly distinguished from that on faults experiencing smaller magnitude events. This will be accomplished by carefully documenting the shallow expression of damage zone structure of crustal scale faults in Southern California and examining the unique characteristics of brittle damage that varies as a function of known historical and paleoseismic earthquake magnitudes. The difference in damage state is likely to be explained by increased energy dissipation by off fault deformation above a critical moment magnitude threshold, and understanding this relation yields the potential for estimating Mmax for active faults with incomplete historical and paleoseismological records. This collaborative study will use field-based structural geology, cutting edge rock mechanics experiments, and theoretical rock and fracture mechanics to provide a roadmap for identifying uniquely seismic features preserved in damage zones, and to test the overarching hypothesis that Mmax can be estimated by examining the damage zone structure of active strike slip faults. This project has the potential for developing an independent, deterministic criterion for Mmax on individual active faults by examining the damage zone structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional structural health monitoring methods, which typically require sensors to be directly placed on the targeted structure and rely on stationary camera setups. By utilizing drone technology paired with advanced computer vision and image processing techniques, this research intends to enable detailed and remote assessments of the dynamic response of large-scale structures. The resulting metrological framework intends to allow for precise quantification of displacement, deformation, and vibrations, enabling early identification of potential damage and extending the operational life of critical infrastructure. The grant also supports educational goals by offering hands-on training, mentorship, and workshops for undergraduate students and individuals seeking to transition into engineering-related careers. These initiatives are designed to create opportunities for all interested Americans by developing practical skills in advanced sensing technologies and structural health monitoring in support of workforce readiness and career advancement.<br/><br/>This research aims to advance and validate a framework for drone-based stereovision measurements in structural dynamics, addressing fundamental challenges in stereo camera calibration, feature extraction, and camera motion compensation. Key contributions include (1) developing a correlation function to track inherent structural features?such as bolts or rust?between the left and right views of the stereo cameras with sub-pixel accuracy; (2) reformulating calibration procedures to accommodate time-varying camera positions; and (3) expanding motion magnification techniques to capture subtle displacements in three dimensions. These innovations intend to enable precise structural health monitoring in real-world scenarios where both the structure and the stereo cameras are in motion, enhancing the ability to capture the three-dimensional dynamic behavior of large systems and leading to improvements in engineering practices for condition monitoring and maintenance. Beyond structural health monitoring, this research has potential applications in environmental sciences for tracking geological phenomena (e.g., volcanism, landslides, and glacier ablation) and in medical diagnostics (e.g., detecting subtle tremors in neurological conditions).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The effectiveness of current Ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing assays is limited by an inability to detect low-abundance RNA of pathogens amidst host background RNA. This project produces infection-specific reagent products that could enhance sensitivity and specificity in transcript detection. The novel capabilities of this approach will enable researchers and healthcare professionals to possibly gain insights into host-pathogen interactions, support applications in disease surveillance, diagnostics, immune profiling, personalized medicine, and/or enhanced public health responses. The commercial potential of this project is driven by a critical market need within infectious-disease research and clinical diagnostics by providing a new primitive for any multi-organismal sample. The technology?s scalable nature ensures broad applicability, including potential extensions into microbiome research and environmental monitoring.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide the means to overcome limitations within current transcriptomic assays in detecting low-abundance pathogen transcripts within complex host-pathogen samples. These problems will be addressed by the development of the Host-Pathogen Enrichment Platform (HostPathEP), which adaptively computes a synthetic multi-targeted priming reagent for each specific host-pathogen system. This reagent is developed to identify conserved motifs that differentiate target from off-target sequences within the combined genomic data of the host and pathogen and tailored to the context-specific research or diagnostic goal of the assay. The first objective is the development of the informatics infrastructure and graph representation learning algorithm behind HostPathEP. Next is the design and evaluation of custom reagents for multiple infection models and for bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and viral genome sequencing. Addressing a fundamental gap in pathogen transcript detection, this project will enable more effective transcriptomics applications for both research and clinical spheres. Anticipated technical results include improved transcriptomic profiling, facilitating new experimental capabilities and driving advancements in infectious disease research. Successful execution of this project will contribute to the broader adoption of targeted biomolecular assays in healthcare and research, ultimately advancing knowledge in disease pathogenesis and immune-response mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From a materials perspective, it is challenging to predict how a monomer structure will ultimately yield desirable material properties. On a biological side, it is possible to rewire the metabolism of cells to expand the repertoire of bio-based material building blocks. These new building blocks can unlock new materials that may be otherwise unfeasible. This proposal addresses the challenge of designing novel bio-based materials by enabling high-throughput characterization enhanced by Machine Learning (ML). Integrating ML and mechanistic model data is critical for establishing materials design criteria. Through a unique cycle, we can create, build, characterize, and understand the monomer-polymer function relationship for a specific class of microbial oil-derived polymers. Ultimately, this approach allows for the prediction of ideal starting molecules to produce desired materials properties. The proposed studies are significant since they address an unmet need in the field to develop a sustainable approach for materials production. Major outcomes of this work include: (1) high-throughput monomer production, (2) extensive materials preparation and characterization, and (3) data-driven models for predicting polymer properties. The outcomes of this work will have the broader impact of creating novel, sustainable processes for materials, as well as providing a deep understanding of materials design principles. Additionally, this collaborative research between Georgia Southern University and The University of Texas at Austin allows students to be exposed to a unique cross-over between genetic engineering, organic chemistry, and materials science not traditionally offered at the participating institutions.

We have selected microbial-produced triglycerides with varied fatty acid chains as ideal candidates to test this approach given the great chemical diversity possible within these molecules. Polyunsaturated triglycerides can undergo free radical co-polymerization to yield thermosets. Chemical diversity is obtained by producing modified cells and allowing for high-producing, parallel bioprocessing to obtain bio-based monomers. Upon polymerization and characterization, data-driven modeling is used to link monomer chemical composition to the materials? glass transition temperature, crosslink density, and storage modulus. This information is used to train an algorithm via ML. Combining material sciences, synthetic biology, and ML allows for a thorough investigation of combinatorial effects and holds potential for a paradigm shift in bio-based materials design. The proposed approach aims at achieving bio-based materials with crosslink densities higher than 77.7 x 10-4 mol/cm3, Tg higher than 85 ?C, and storage moduli in the rubbery plateau higher than 2.2 GPa, as this will allow for unprecedented material performance from triglyceride-based co-polymers.

Astronomical observations of our Galaxy and clusters of galaxies indicate ubiquitous cosmic magnetic fields at the micro-Gauss level, or about one-millionth of the Earth's magnetic field.  While weak, such magnetic fields appear to be pervasive and are dynamically important in the Universe even though astrophysical sources of magnetic field generation are often neither steady nor persistent.  This collaborative project will use theoretical and numerical modeling approaches to address how present-day galaxies and galaxy clusters not only came to host dynamically important magnetic fields, but also maintain those fields. Such study of the sustenance and longevity of magnetic fields in a turbulent plasma constitutes a key research frontier in plasma astrophysics and basic plasma science. The award will also support an ongoing program of biennial summer schools on plasma astrophysics and astrophysical fluid dynamics for undergraduate and early graduate students. These schools enhance the infrastructure for plasma science research and education in the US by attempting to remedy the relative lack of fluid and plasma physics education in US physics and astronomy curricula.<br/><br/>This project will use a combination of analytical theory and a suite of cutting-edge fluid-based and kinetic numerical simulation models to elucidate the decay and diffusion of dynamo-generated magnetic fields in a plasma.

The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to predict the decay laws and the final relaxed state of the magnetic field, including their dependence on the material properties of the plasma.  The project will also investigate how magnetic fields that are expelled from spatially localized astrophysical bodies into the intergalactic or intracluster medium subsequently disperse spatially and become volume-filling, and how the kinetic micro-physics of such weakly collisional plasmas helps or hinders this process.

How do different brain areas work together to represent the world that is perceived? How are communications among different areas -- which depend on stimuli in the environment and the state of the observer -- implemented by a circuit which is fixed? This project will integrate vast datasets into a set of models which will be probed to address mechanistic questions involving multi-area interactions such as these.<br/><br/>More specifically, a set of models which are similar in nature will be constructed. This set will start simple, but gradually simplifying assumptions about model parameters will be replaced by optimizations based on dynamical and functional data. The models will be used to test the hypotheses that: 1. The cell-type specific patterns of connectivity between areas are important in determining temporal responses to simple stimuli and observed frequency-specific inter-area interactions. 2. The functional specificity of inter-areal connections is important in determining the responses and inter-area communication in response to complex stimuli. 3. Variations in single-cell properties explain arousal-related changes in visual responses and oscillations. This project combines the unique experimental datasets and expertise of the Allen Institute with the Jlich expertise and resources for large-scale simulation, and the expertise of both partners in data-based neural network modeling. To facilitate further scientific inquiry, the project will construct a set of detailed system-wide models to study how properties of inter-area connectivity influence inter-area interactions, communication, and stimulus representations.

The first, quantum information theory, explores how quantum mechanics can enhance the storage, transmission, and processing of information, while the second, quantum many-body physics, investigates the collective behavior that can emerge in systems of many interacting quantum particles.  Important developments in both fields often involve a deepening understanding of quantum entanglement, a correlation between particles which classical physics is unable to describe.  <br/><br/>Recent breakthroughs in both disciplines?new techniques for protecting quantum information and fresh insights into how complex quantum systems evolve?present an opportunity for renewed interdisciplinary focus.  This project will aim to discover and characterize new phases of quantum matter that emerge from the synergy of these developments, and that may offer novel ways of storing and protecting information. Unlike traditional phases of matter, which are characterized by how particles are arranged or locally-correlated, these phases are defined by the way that their collective quantum entanglement is organized.  This research has the potential to both advance an understanding of fundamental phenomena and enable the development of future quantum technologies.<br/><br/>This research will be combined with the training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers in quantum science, an area of high national priority.

This initiative will provide students the necessary skills to begin academic research or to participate in industry efforts in quantum science.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This research project will use tools from the study of random quantum circuit evolution and from the theory of quantum codes, in order to (i) characterize novel zero-temperature phases of quantum matter which are intimately related to recently-discovered quantum low-depth parity-check codes, (ii) elucidate the universal entanglement properties of near-equilibrium, mixed-states of quantum many-body systems, and (iii) develop an understanding of regimes of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body evolution which naturally act as emergent quantum codes. This project will advance our understanding of universal phenomena in quantum matter and strategies for quantum error-correction by bridging developments in the theory of quantum codes and quantum many-body dynamics. Quantum error-correction as a dynamical process will be used as a new paradigm in order to understand the entanglement properties of near-equilibrium mixed-states of quantum matter, and to identify universal phenomena that demarcate phases of mixed many-body states. Studies of far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics will be used to identify error-correcting phases of matter in which open quantum dynamics acts as a robust, emergent quantum code even in the absence of feedback. Deep connections between random quantum dynamics and statistical mechanics will be used to uncover emergent quantum codes in quantum many-body evolution with measurements in higher spatial dimensions.<br/><br/>This research will be combined with the training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers in quantum science, an area of high national priority.

Reverse osmosis membrane technologies are widely used in industries such as food and beverage processing, wastewater reclamation, chemical processing, power plants, and resource recovery, but they suffer from severe challenges due to the accumulation of mineral scale and organic foulants. These issues lead to frequent cleaning cycles, high energy consumption, and premature membrane failure. The solution under investigation offers a novel approach to reducing these maintenance costs while improving overall performance and lifespan. By improving operational reliability and decreasing dependence on chemical cleaning agents, the technology supports sustainability, industrial efficiency, and public health through improved water treatment practices. Implementation of this technology could significantly lower the cost and chemical footprint of industrial water purification processes, contributing to economic prosperity and resource conservation.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of ultra-thin polyamide reverse osmosis membranes fabricated via a rinse-free, molecular layer-by-layer deposition process. Unlike conventional interfacial polymerization methods that produce rough, heterogeneous surfaces prone to fouling and scaling, this technique yields smooth membranes with tunable thickness and surface chemistry. By optimizing monomer concentration and eliminating intermediate rinsing steps, the fabrication process is significantly faster and more sustainable. The membranes can be functionalized with antifouling or scale-resistant coatings without compromising salt rejection or water permeability. Early tests indicate exceptional resistance to mineral scaling and organic fouling, potentially extending cleaning intervals by a factor of three or more. This innovation offers a scalable path toward next-generation membranes that address longstanding performance and cost barriers in industrial water purification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rapid, on-site testing using ELISA would be an attractive low-cost solution for PFAS screening to complement current slow and costly LC-MS (Liquid chromatography?mass spectrometry) method.   As a result of PFAS? pervasiveness, more than 95 percent of the U.S. population has PFAS in their bodies. These compounds have been associated with high cholesterol levels, thyroid disease, certain cancers, and pregnancy-related problems. Since the amount of testing for PFAS is expected to increase over time, there is a significant need for a cost effective, rapid method for detection of PFAS.  Today, an LC/MS sample test costs $250-$400 per sample and the throughput is low at 30 samples per day whereas an ELISA test could be about $40 per sample and can test about 120 samples per day.  Thus, an ELISA assay for PFAS detection would be a groundbreaking technology for the testing to identify PFAS hotspots, and assessment of remediation treatment efficacy for many PFAS projects and clean ups.  This project thus aligns with the goal of promoting well-being of U.S. population.<br/><br/><br/>Development of a PFAS ELISA requires the use of an antibody.  Currently no such antibodies are available commercially.  ELISAs are preferred due to their sensitivity and ability to tolerate pretreatments. The process of ELISA development includes development of critical components such as hapten development, immunogen preparation, antibody production, screening of antibodies for specificity to varying PFAS as well as sensitivity. The intellectual merit of this Phase II project lies in improving the PFAS detection sensitivity by 2-orders of magnitude compared to what was demonstrated in Phase I. While Phase I proved that PFAS can be detected using an ELISA assay with a hapten for immunogen preparation in a single animal species, Phase II will attempt to find antibodies produced by multiple animal species, specifically those that are not physically aggregated. The R&D focus initially will be on hapten and antibody- Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugate production. This will be followed by identification of the most sensitive pair and external validation of the test kits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The innovation, an engineered recycled steel fiber product, can replace conventional steel reinforcing bar (rebar) in certain applications, which will enhance understanding of how fiber characteristics impact key engineering properties. Recycled feedstock with inexpensive mechanical processing used to produce the fibers ensures a durable competitive advantage versus rebar, which is produced by costly melting and forming. In addition to lower upfront cost, the recycled steel fiber technology increases concrete toughness and will lower long-term maintenance costs. The business model for commercializing the recycled steel fiber technology involves bulk purchase of recycled feedstock, transport and mechanical processing, and then sale of the processed fibers to local concrete plants or contractors at a markup. Based on extensive customer discovery, the beachhead markets for the technology include concrete flooring and pavements. The technology will be a key factor enabling commercial success of the company, which was formed specifically in response to the technology.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on eliminating technical barriers inhibiting commercialization of engineered recycled steel fibers for concrete reinforcement. Concrete is traditionally reinforced with steel bars (rebar), which are labor-intensive, costly, and creates dangerous jobsite conditions. The proposed technology addresses each of these limitations, but technical concerns include whether the maximum achievable residual flexural strength of concrete reinforced with the fibers is sufficient for the target applications. Furthermore, the local nature of concrete production requires a robust design tool to determine proper required fiber dosage for a given application based on the concrete composition and properties. This project will elucidate the maximum achievable residual flexural strength and the role of fiber dispersion on limiting the strength and develop a machine-learning tool for determining design fiber dosage. Flexural testing will be performed on a wide range of concrete mixtures and fracture surfaces will be examined for fiber clumping. These test data will be combined with data mining of steel fiber reinforced concrete flexural strength results to train and test the machine-learning based design tool. The results of this project will include understanding of how concrete mixture design and fiber dispersion influences peak residual flexural strength.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, like all software, programs used in science may contain defects (""bugs"") --- errors in the code or mistaken assumptions ---that can render the output erroneous. Consequently, developers of scientific software expend significant effort debugging their code, reducing their productivity. Worse, some defects evade even the most extensive debugging efforts. This project is developing tools to help developers easily find subtle defects in their code and even verify (under reasonable assumptions) that the code is defect-free. The project's novelties are: a new modular approach to the specification of program components based on simple mathematical abstractions that are familiar to scientists; simple-to-use, automated methods to verify a program component adheres to its specification (or report a defect when it does not); and the application of these techniques to two state-of-the-art scientific software packages. The project's impacts are, first, the advancement of software verification technology generally, which can reduce development costs and increase software quality throughout industry, government laboratories, and academia. Second, improving public confidence in the soundness of conclusions based on scientific software. Third, the training of students and scientists in the use of advanced verification techniques, contributing to a cultural change in the way scientific software is constructed. <br/><br/>These advances are based on new symbolic execution techniques implemented in the CIVL model checker. Libraries are being developed to support abstract mathematical concepts such as ""vector"" and ""matrix"". Symbolic ""representation functions"" are used to tie these abstractions to the significantly more complex data structures in a scientific program. Such a function consumes a data structure (which may be distributed across multiple processes) in the program and returns the abstract construct represented by that structure. This allows the user to specify correctness properties on the abstract level while the model checker verifies that the program structures implement the abstract operations correctly. Model checking techniques are used to verify concurrent algorithms, such as those expressed using Message Passing Interface (MPI), OpenMP, or Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). These techniques are being applied to select components of PETSc, a widely used numerical linear algebra library and core component of numerous software projects, and to Flash-X, a state-of-the-art multiphysics simulation system used in astrophysics and other scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flexible biological macromolecules, such as disordered proteins and flexible RNAs, have recently been discovered to undergo spontaneous phase separation and form biomolecular condensates that play fundamental roles in a myriad of cellular functions from stress response to cellular signaling. Chen and his research group will develop a new intermediate resolution model for condensates of RNA (iConRNA) and collaborate with experimental labs to accurately calculate the phase diagram of RNAs and study how the interplay of various molecular forces control phase behaviors. These efforts will meet the urgent need for efficient computer models that can simulate the phase transitions of these dynamic molecules in studies of biomolecular condensates. Chen will integrate the latest advances in biomolecular condensates into courses at University of Massachusetts (UMass), train undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary research, and contribute to broadening participation in STEM education and research through the Eureka! program at UMass.<br/><br/>Jianhan Chen will develop a coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling framework for efficient simulation of the spontaneous phase transitions of flexible RNAs as well as heterotypic protein/RNA phase separation. The proposed iConRNA model will represent each nucleotide using 6 or 7 beads, and includes explicit base stacking, base pairing, Debye?Hckel electrostatics, and Lennard-Jones potentials. Parameterized using atomistic simulations and experimental data, iConRNA model will be designed to recapitulate transient local and long-range structure features of model RNAs, fold several small RNAs, and correctly capture the length and sequence dependence of the phase separation of various RNAs. Specific research objectives of this proposal will be to: 1) accurately model the temperature and magnesium ion-dependence of RNA structure and phase separation; 2) elucidate how the complex interplay of intrinsic structural propensities and intermolecular interactions govern the mechanism of RNA phase separation and condensate material properties; and 3) develop a self-consistent CG framework for modeling heterotypic protein/RNA phase separation. Integrated with experimental studies, these efforts will uncover crucial new molecular details and mechanisms underlying the complex magnesium and temperature dependence of RNA phase transitions. In parallel, Chen will distribute the CG models through the open-source OpenMM package to enable the community to study biomolecular condensates in biology and materials engineering.

The effect of complex organic mixtures on surface tension reduction of ambient aerosol during hygroscopic growth and eventual cloud droplet activation remains unknown because laboratory experiments have largely focused on simple mixtures, which do not mimic the chemical complexity of ambient aerosol. Professor Bain and her team will conduct detailed laboratory surface tension measurements of solutions and droplets containing complex mixtures of salts and organic species with a range of surface-active properties. Their studies could contribute to the fundamental understanding of the interactions between aerosol droplets and clouds by providing detailed information on how surfactants partition in complex mixtures. This could lead to improved predictions of the number of aerosol droplets that activate into cloud droplets, which greatly impacts cloud properties including reflectivity, lifetime, and precipitation. The research team will partner with Oregon State University?s Science & Math Investigative Learning Experiences (SMILE) program to develop a classroom activity introducing middle school students to atmospheric aerosol.<br/><br/>Due to the large surface-area-to-volume ratio of aerosol droplets, the partitioning of surfactants cannot be described by the surface tension of a macroscopic solution alone, and a partitioning model must be employed. Partitioning models have largely been tested for aerosol systems containing only one or two organic molecules, which do not begin to describe the chemical complexity of ambient aerosols. This project will investigate the surface tension of complex organic mixtures, including surfactant mixtures and their mixtures with salt, in macroscopic aqueous solutions and picolitre volume droplets. These results will be used to test the ability of partitioning models to describe the surface tension of droplets containing complex mixtures. The goals of this project are to determine how different ratios of strong, moderate, and weak surface-active molecules impact aerosol surface tension, how the surface tension of ambient aerosol changes as the total organic fraction decreases during hygroscopic growth, and to identify the chemical complexity required to accurately represent the surface tension of ambient aerosol with a partitioning model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will construct a table-top CV-entangled network utilizing two-mode squeezed states, generated through four-wave mixing in atomic rubidium-85 vapor, to measure distributed phase shifts with sensitivity surpassing classical limits. Deep learning, specifically Q-learning, which is a reinforcement learning technique, will be employed to suppress excess noise without requiring pilot tones or training sequences, by adapting similar noise mitigation strategies from CV quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). This approach leverages homodyne detection and real-time phase estimation to optimize local oscillators across the network, addressing noise introduced by beam splitters and environmental interactions.

The factors thought to influence this color variation are important natural biochemicals and provitamins that have antioxidant and other known health benefits. However, the specific molecular changes that underlie variation in pigmentation and ripe fruit color are rarely known, making it difficult to identify good targets for increasing the health benefits of this variation.  This research uses natural variation in fruit color across the plant group Solanum?that includes tomato, eggplant, and potato, and more than 1200 other wild species relatives?to identify the specific changes that underlie dozens of evolutionary origins of ripe fruit color variation. In addition to understanding different origins of the same fruit pigments and the environmental contexts that favor color variation, the research may speed the discovery of potential nature-based solutions for manipulating and enhancing the nutritional content of fruits in an important agricultural group. Products of the research will also be used to generate K-12 STEM outreach materials focused on natural color and vision, using fruit color and animal visual perception as an accessible educational vehicle. <br/><br/>The project integrates comparative genomic, transcriptomic, and macroecological data to examine molecular variation in two important plant pigment biosynthetic pathways (carotenoids and anthocyanins), and to associate this variation with independent fruit color transitions and the ecological context of global geographic fruit color variation.

Second, to examine whether fruit color convergence repeatedly draws upon the same or similar molecular mechanisms, it will investigate correlated and convergent evolution of fruit color transitions and pigment biosynthesis loci, using >80 independent fruit color transitions among 300+ Solanum species. Third, to identify the joint contribution of ecological and molecular processes to shaping fruit color variation across Solanum, it will identify macroecological features associated with the global distribution of fruit color variation in this group, and with variation in underlying molecular pigmentation mechanisms.

In this project, development of new photoresists will be carried out. These photoresists are light-sensitive materials used to form a patterned coating on a surface. To develop these photoresists, fundamental studies will be performed to learn what chemical reactions take place when these photoresists are exposed to light. By improving these materials, the project seeks to enhance the effectiveness of EUV photolithography, thereby supporting the growth of the semiconductor industry. This advancement is crucial, as it will enable the production of smaller, faster, and more efficient electronic devices, which are in high demand in today's technology-driven world. Additionally, the project includes educational initiatives to inspire and prepare students for careers in the semiconductor industry. These efforts align with the goals of the US CHIPS Act, which aims to strengthen the domestic semiconductor workforce.<br/><br/>During the two-year funding period, this proposed research will uncover the mechanisms behind the crosslinking and chemical etching of ultrathin photoresist films grown by molecular layer deposition (MLD), a vapor-phase method for depositing ultrathin organic-inorganic films with precise control over thickness and composition. Experimentally, the project will uncover process-structure-property relationships by varying the reactants used in the MLD process, leveraging a high-throughput MLD reactor to create a library of aluminum-based EUV photoresists with a variety of organic functional groups of varying photoreactivity and likelihood of forming crystalline structures. These films will be thoroughly characterized to determine the resulting films? chemical composition, thickness, and surface morphology before and after photopatterning with UV and e-beam sources. This effort will be paired with reactive molecular dynamics computational modeling to further understand film photoreactivity and organic reactant alignment during deposition. This combined experimental and computational approach aims to create a map of the structure of these photoresist films, which will be used to gain insights into the factors that influence strong EUV photoresist performance, supporting the broader adoption of EUV photolithography. This effort represents a significant technological advancement, as the limited existing work in the use of vapor-deposited EUV photoresists has largely focused on proof-of-concept patterning with new elements. Exploiting this library, we will perform convergence research, constructing an experimental model of these organic-inorganic films and comparing it to a computational model constructed through ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations.<br/><br/>This Future Manufacturing award is co-funded by the Divisions of Materials Research (DMR) and Chemistry (CHE) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), and the division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) in the Engineering Directorate (ENG).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to improve knowledge of tectonics by studying the deep structure beneath Africa, a continent that holds key clues about how the interior of the planet influences surface movements. Unusually hot mantle rocks are observed underneath Africa,  as well as the East African Rift System, the most prominent and active continental rift on the Earth. Taking advantage of these features, the project will  develop a detailed model of the deep structure beneath this continent. It will also  revise how its tectonic plates move, and explore interactions between the Earth's outer shell with the deeper convecting mantle beneath Africa. The results of this research will help increase understanding of fundamental processes shaping our planet. For example, the findings may enhance earthquake hazard assessments, improve models of global plate motions, and provide relevant information to other aligned fields, such as geothermal exploration. This project uses advanced seismic and geodetic data to provide a more complete picture of Earth's dynamic interior.<br/><br/>This project will try to advance the understanding of plate tectonics by investigating how the African continent interacts with the underlying convecting mantle. Specifically, it will test a long-standing hypothesis that lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling modulates the influence of mantle convection on Africa's surface motions, with broader implications for global tectonic processes. The research will integrate seismic and geodetic data from AfricaArray, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations, and other sources to develop open-access, high-resolution continental-scale models of the kinematics of Africa, crustal and lithospheric structure, upper mantle seismic properties?including azimuthal anisotropy?and key mantle discontinuities. To test this hypothesis, the project will enhance and leverage the capabilities of the open-source software ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Planetary Evolution, Convection, and Tectonics) to enable improved modeling of lithosphere-asthenosphere viscous coupling at a continental scale. A key objective is to determine whether lithospheric motion in Africa and its surroundings is only weakly coupled to the underlying convecting mantle due to an anomalously hot and low-viscosity upper asthenosphere. Beyond scientific contributions, the project has the following major broader impacts. It will support annual AfricaArray meetings in South Africa and enhance capacity-building efforts through workshops on data science, seismic and GNSS data processing, and access to streaming datasets. These workshops will follow well-established Carpentries lesson structures, with a focus on training new instructors.. An independent professional evaluation will make sure its impacts are maximized. Undergraduate researchers will contribute to the development of seismic tomography models  increasing their technical skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

IoT has become the new digital infrastructure by connecting everyone and everything together via billions of wireless devices. The majority of IoT devices are usually low cost, small size with limited computational capacity and energy resources, hence, cannot afford computational expensive cryptography. There is a trend to solicit non-cryptographic and lightweight solutions for IoT, as evidenced by MIT Technology Review in 2022 reporting the end of the password as the top 10 breakthrough technologies. Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) emerges as a non-cryptographic technique for secure device identification that exploits the unique and stable hardware impairments of radio devices as their identifiers. RFFI is promising for all wireless technologies, including WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular. While RFFI has attracted active research interests in the last decade, there are still critical research challenges remaining for a more robust and reliable RFFI system, which will be the focus of this project.<br/><br/>This project will bring together experts from Rice University and the University of Liverpool, UK.

While weak, such magnetic fields appear to be pervasive and are dynamically important in the Universe even though astrophysical sources of magnetic field generation are often neither steady nor persistent.  This collaborative project will use theoretical and numerical modeling approaches to address how present-day galaxies and galaxy clusters not only came to host dynamically important magnetic fields, but also maintain those fields.

Invasive species are introduced from outside their natural range that rapidly expand across areas where they were introduced. Invasive species negatively affect the economy and can change ecosystems in undesirable ways. Because of these negative effects, many restoration efforts involve removing invasive species. The project will test if ecosystems are resilient and can return to their original state after invasive species are removed. This project will also examine how long it takes for ecosystems to return to their original state once invasive species are removed. Both questions will be answered by experiments done in central Kenya, where an invasive ant has displaced native ants that defend Acacia trees against elephants and other browsing mammals. In invaded areas, browsing on trees is common, transforming savanna woodlands into open landscapes with few trees. Through targeted removal of the invasive ant, the project will discover whether invaded areas can be returned to their original state. Removal of invasive ants may restore the partnership between trees and native ants and reduce browsing by elephants. Across much of East Africa, Acacia trees are critical to the bioeconomy because they provide food for black rhinoceros, giraffe, and other animals. These trees are also used for fuel by humans. This project provides an opportunity to answer important questions about ecosystem resilience.

In contrast, Vibrio natriegens is naturally competent, meaning it will take in DNA without any chemical intervention.  Vibrio natriegens is the fastest growing organism on Earth and does not cause disease. This bacterial strain has been engineered to enhance scalability and ease of handling to allow for integration with fully automated systems. This scalability and each of handling may accelerate modification and testing and improve protein biomanufacturing as well as the ability to synthesize proteins of interest. These capabilities may shorten the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle and improve the speed and simplicity of workflows. With increased speed in these processes, the time and cost of pharmaceutical and vaccine development may be reduced, and new biological solutions to current problems may be developed more rapidly and easily.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an engineered strain of Vibrio natriegens as a chassis for scalable molecular biology and bioproduction. Vibrio natriegens expresses a high rate of natural competency, meaning it will organically take in DNA without chemical or other treatment. This is different from currently used E. coli strains that must be chemically treated every time DNA is introduced into the cell. Utilizing a genomic insertion of the TfoX master competency regulator gene combined with a specifically designed growth media, a strain of Vibrio natriegens was developed that can be transformed with DNA without the need for special equipment, which means transformation can be completed at room temperature with no heat shock, shaking, media transfers, or incubation. This technology may lower the cost of synthetic biology by several orders of magnitude and decrease the hands-on time to single minutes. In addition, due to Vibrio natriegens rapid growth rate, an experiment starting with DNA isolation to production of single colonies may be completed in a single day. Recombinant proteins can be rapidly tested and automated at large scales with ease. Further, cells have been shown to remain competent after transformation, allowing for repeated transformations of the same bacteria. This technology may enable more rapid genetic engineering and protein production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objectives of this research are to evaluate the economic efficiency of the U.S. coal supply chain over the last thirty years, accounting for complementarities and market power, and to understand how efficiencies might have been impacted by changes in supplier market structure (e.g. mergers between coal suppliers), changes in the competitiveness of coal (e.g. after the U.S. natural gas boom), and the deregulation of wholesale electricity markets. These are important questions to address for this major industry. In this research, methods are developed that also could be applied in other industries. The research effort includes training of Ph.D. students, coordination of activities across schools at a land grant public university, and the presentation of the results to a wide range of stakeholders.<br/><br/>The research involves three related projects that are made possible by combining confidential data on railroad shipments and power plant purchases of coal and transportation. Project 1 uses reduced-form econometric techniques to describe how shocks to electricity demand, shocks to electricity generating costs, and upstream shocks to the mining and railroad industries feed through into input prices and quantities. The results are interpreted through the lens of a theoretical models based on Cournot (1838) and Spulber (2017), which identify the possible effects of input complementarity with market power. Project 2 develops and estimates a static structural model of the supply chain and power plant output decisions. This model quantifies how supplier and downstream market power has varied over time and across space, and investigates the implications for counterfactuals (e.g., the introduction and elimination of subsidies for non-fossil fuel production or industry consolidation). Project 3 introduces dynamics into the model, testing whether prices are shaped partly by parties trying to anticipate and affect future changes in market structure (e.g., delay coal plant retirements) and, if so, estimating the effects on stylized counterfactuals, building on recent theoretical literature studying the effects of procurement on endogenous market structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Establishing and maintaining proper patterns of DNA methylation throughout the genome is a highly choreographed process involving not only the addition of methyl groups, but also their removal (termed DNA demethylation). This project will investigate how the enzyme thymine DNA glycosylase, a key player in the DNA demethylation pathway, is targeted to specific methyl groups throughout the genome. This is an important question because accurate removal of methyl groups from DNA is critical for normal cellular function, and dysregulation of this pathway can result in abnormal human development and disease, including cancer. Thus, the scientific outcomes will lead to an improved understanding of how DNA methylation landscapes are established and maintained under both physiological and pathological states and may provide impetus for future clinical applications. Additionally, this project will promote research training of graduate and undergraduate students and will provide research opportunities to K-12 students to encourage participation in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) plays important roles in maintaining appropriate genetic and epigenetic states, yet it remains unclear how this multifaceted enzyme is targeted and regulated at the genome level. While most studies aimed at answering this question have focused on protein interactions, emerging evidence now indicates a regulatory relationship between TDG and RNA. Indeed, TDG was recently shown to bind tightly to RNA. Moreover, RNA competes with DNA for binding to TDG and inhibits TDG-mediated excision, supporting a model wherein TDG-mediated processes, such as DNA demethylation, are regulated through the direct interactions of TDG with RNA. Yet, several critical questions remain: How does TDG bind to RNA? To what extent does TDG interact with RNA in cells and what is the functional relevance of those interactions? To answer these questions, this project will employ a series of biochemical, genetic, and genome-wide approaches to uncover the molecular basis of RNA recognition by TDG and to establish how these interactions contribute to TDG chromatin occupancy and function in vivo. The findings will have broad implications for all TDG-associated biological pathways and will provide new insights into the role of RNA in gene regulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This reduction in amplitude, known as attenuation or anelasticity, provides crucial insights into the properties of the materials they travel through. By analyzing mantle anelasticity, we can determine key characteristics of mantle materials, including their temperature, composition, and mechanical behavior. These properties are essential for understanding the formation, evolution, and dynamics of the planet. This project aims to improve our understanding of mantle anelasticity by analyzing the amplitudes of seismic waves from a wide range of seismic phases.  This research will establish an improved reference model for mantle anelasticity, which is important for understanding the material properties of the mantle and improving earthquake magnitude estimates.  In addition to advancing fundamental seismological research, this project will enhance geoscience education and outreach. The new dataset and corresponding Q model will be made publicly available, and the educational components will include undergraduate research opportunities, hands-on computer lab modules for geophysics students, as well as science communication through YouTube videos and exhibits at the Geosciences Museum. <br/><br/>In contrast to the well constrained 1-D seismic velocity structure, the 1-D attenuation structure of the mantle remains poorly understood.  In this proposed work, we will use S-wave amplitudes to determine the radial attenuation structure of the mantle.  The new amplitude dataset will include minor-arc S, SS, SSS, SSSS, ScS, Sdiff waves as well as major-arc SSS and SSSS waves and ScS multiples.   We will address major challenges in determining the radial structure of attenuation using body-wave amplitudes.  In particular, the research activities will explore measures that can be used to assess geographic sampling to determine global average Q values, which will allow us to determine the number of independent observables and analyze the depth resolution of the radial attenuation model. We will employ linear inversion and nonlinear forward modeling to obtain an optimal 1-D model using all available S wave measurements, including those affected by mantle triplications. We will investigate the frequency dependence of attenuation in the frequency range between 5 and 40 seconds.   The new global Q model will provide an important reference for calculations of synthetic seismograms and expected energy loss due to wave propagation. The improved model will enhance the resolution of the layered structure of mantle attenuation and help address key scientific questions related to asthenosphere thickness, transition zone rheology, and the thermal structure at the core-mantle boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, recent breakthroughs in quantum electrodynamics are opening a new era of possibilities for X-ray technology. This project aims to revolutionize X-ray science by developing new nanoscale photonics technologies. The Principal Investigator (PI)'s work holds the potential to bring about major leaps in the life sciences, energy sectors, and various other fields. These advancements could lead to new tools in quantum information science, ultrafast imaging, and spectroscopies that were once considered science fiction.<br/>This project is not only about advancing technological capabilities but also about promoting the overall progress of science in alignment with NSF?s mission. By integrating various fields such as quantum physics, laser technology, and accelerator science, the PI is setting the stage for novel applications that impact everything from medical imaging to quantum computing. Furthermore, their commitment to develop educational initiatives will foster a new pipeline of future scientists and engineers.<br/>In summary, this research endeavors to redefine how X-ray technology is utilized in various fields, while simultaneously addressing important educational and societal challenges. Nurturing talent from all segments of society and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration will ensure that the benefits of this research are widespread, enhancing national health, prosperity, and knowledge.<br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The PI will experimentally validate the production of X-rays via the quantum interference of electrons. This will be achieved by shaping electron wave packets from a true quantum electrodynamic (QED) perspective, enabling us to produce highly directional and monochromatic X-rays with energies reaching up to several tens of keV. The project aims to extend the PI's demonstration to generate attosecond-duration X-ray wave packets, thereby creating extremely bright X-ray pulses. This will be comparable in brightness to those of billion-dollar large-scale X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities but from much more compact radiation sources.<br/>The methods and approaches are centered around the fusion of QED, laser technology, and advanced accelerator physics techniques. By harnessing the capabilities of QED, the PI aims to provide an ultracompact X-ray source, that reduces both cost and size and features a scalable architecture suitable for integration and portability. This will offer the possibility of achieving on-chip X-ray frequency combs.<br/>The anticipated contributions of this project include not only the foundational demonstration of novel electron-photon quantum interference but also potential applications in quantum information science. Such applications span from quantum-level semiconductor lithography and ultrafast microscopy to compact XFEL devices and atom-by-atom matter assembly.<br/>Overall, the execution of this project is expected to significantly advance the field of X-ray science and facilitate a new class of radiation sources with broad applicability.

The project initially focuses on maize production. Farmers lose millions of dollars annually due to pest outbreaks and contaminants that go undetected until crops are severely affected. Existing detection tools are often too slow, too general, or unable to identify early-stage issues when the molecular markers indicating disease infestations are not abundant. This new technology aims to provide real-time, precise detection of changes in chemical signals in the field, allowing for earlier and more targeted detection of crops disease and intervention. For farmers operating under strict pesticide regulations, especially those in organic agriculture, this early detection capability is essential as they often rely on prevention rather than treatment to ensure crop health. By addressing a critical gap in early pest, contaminant, and disease detection, the technology holds promise for reducing economic losses and increasing the efficiency of crop management across the agricultural sector.<br/><br/>This I Corps project utilizes experiential learning, coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem, to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of engineered proteins that function as highly specific receptors for molecular markers associated with crop plagues and pollutants. Unlike conventional detection methods that lack specificity for organic crop applications, this approach employs machine learning algorithms to design nanoreceptors that distinguish between structurally similar compounds commonly found in organic farming environments. The nanoreceptors are integrated into an optical sensing system that operates through Frster Resonance Energy Transfer, using graphene oxide substrates to significantly enhance signal sensitivity. This enhancement enables the quantification of trace-level targets previously undetectable outside of laboratory conditions, offering actionable insights before visible symptoms on crops emerge. The platform supports real-time monitoring, delivering results within minutes and eliminating the delay associated with sample collection and lab-based analysis. The modular design of the sensing platform permits adaptation for different crops and target molecules by exchanging the machine learning algorithms, creating a flexible and scalable tool for precision agriculture beyond the initial application in maize.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These chemical defenses, often unique to particular plants or groups of plants, are valuable resources for developing natural pesticides that may carry fewer risks for ecosystems and for consumers. This project focuses on a group of plants in the tomato family that produce a promising class of natural insecticides called acylsugars. These sticky sugars are produced by gland-tipped hairs and act as traps for insect predators, but they are non-toxic to humans and degrade quickly in the environment. While most acylsugar research has examined their importance in leaf defense, this research will explore their role in protecting the fruit and its enclosed seeds, studying the tomatillos and their wild relatives. Many of these species cover their fruit in a balloon-like sac that develops from the outer organ of the flower (the calyx), and they decorate this inflated calyx with dense sticky acylsugar-coated hairs. This research will investigate the relationship between the repeated evolutionary origins of the inflated calyx across tomatillos and the production of insecticidal acylsugars, providing the foundation for developing novel natural insecticides. This project is built upon a collaborative network of tomatillo researchers from the U.S. and abroad and will advance international collaborations. It will provide training opportunities for early career researchers including high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow.<br/><br/>In order to trace the coordinated evolution of inflated fruiting calyces and acylsugar defenses, the research will build the first comprehensive phylogenetic tree for all 310 species in the tomatillo clade. The phylogeny will be estimated using target sequence capture relying on existing collections of DNAs and herbarium specimens as well as new field collections. The researchers will use recently described Solanaceae fruit fossils, including two in the tomatillo clade, to calibrate the tree, and apply methods including state-dependent diversification to estimate transition rates to and away from the inflated calyx state. They will specifically test the hypothesis that gains of inflation are irreversible and that they proceed via an intermediate stage in which the calyx expands to cover the fruit but does not inflate. Finally, the project will explore the coupling of this physical defense (calyx elongation and inflation) with chemical defenses. In particular, the researchers posit that independent gains of inflated fruiting calyces are correlated with increased production of glandular trichomes and sticky, insecticidal acylsugars. Together, these three aims will allow the researchers to trace the assembly of a complex plant defense syndrome, which like many trait syndromes, combines convergently-evolved morphological and biochemical innovations as an adaptive response to a shared ecological driver.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This computing framework employs advanced graph partitioning algorithms to model quantum circuits and identify optimal cutting points, taking into account practical hardware constraints to minimize cutting overhead and maximize algorithm fidelity. This framework also incorporates a weighted closest-first scheduler for distributing subcircuits efficiently across heterogeneous quantum and classical resources, enabling both sequential and parallel execution. Scientifically, this framework advances beyond existing tools by offering improved performance, enhanced resource utilization, and superior scalability for distributed quantum systems, while preserving the full computational power of the original circuit.

This research training will prepare the teachers to lead these experiments in their classrooms, where students will observe and study bacteria evolving in biofilms over a week using our innovative curriculum. Both research and teaching will be supported by mentors in our laboratory and in their classrooms. We will measure whether our program improves teacher confidence in using life science experiments in their classrooms, as well as student attitudes and self-efficacy towards science topics relevant to future careers in biotechnology. This program will empower greater understanding by teachers and students of how microbes evolve, a crucial topic today.<br/><br/>The dynamics of microbial biofilm adaptation, particularly its rapid pace and extent of diversification, present both a scientific puzzle and an educational opportunity. Through training the teachers, our program enables their students (age 12+) to observe evolutionary adaptation in just one week using a safe non-pathogenic Pseudomonas model. Through genome sequencing, we can identify mutations causing distinct colony morphologies. Student and teacher research revealed that biofilm adaptations protect against predation by Dictyostelium discoideum, uncovering an important but overlooked survival benefit. Building on 20 years of biofilm evolution research, our program creates a community where teachers are mentored by researchers with varied skills and by BIORETS alumni. Teachers integrate their research questions into an established curriculum that has engaged over 5,000 students across 19 states.

Freezing of gait is the most perplexing and disabling symptom of Parkinson's disease and often leads to falls. As the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson's disease affects nearly 1 million Americans and 10 million people worldwide. Eighty-five percent of patients suffer from freezing of gait, which increases fall risks and reduces the quality of life and the likelihood of independent living. Commanding insoles can be worn in various home settings to enable processing of large amounts of data in real time. The solution can be potentially expanded to include orthotics, diabetic pressure ulcer prevention, and sports performance monitoring.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on developing three innovative components: an insole hardware; an onboard, tiny, machine learning algorithm; and a mobile app. The tiny machine learning algorithm and app visualization techniques including, but not limited to, heat maps and bar plots, make more accurate and reliable decisions. Existing monitoring devices have restricted interconnectivity and comfort and cannot identify new or unseen gait freezing events in living conditions beyond their original training context. The training observations constantly gathered by the same patient in the place of inference keeps the classifier accurate, even with the limited size of the dataset. The automatic score scheme correlates highly ranked features with a personalized rehabilitation plan through toe/heel-tapping exercises to mitigate future freezing of gait or fall risks. The new understanding of multi-model sensing and tiny machine learning will advance home monitoring and healthcare. The mobile application manages real-time performance for end-users transparently and in a straightforward manner.

However, it has become more and more difficult to sustain this progress by further reducing the size of each transistor since the lateral dimension scaling is approaching its physical limits. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a set of enabling technologies for the vertical stacking of high-performance silicon devices in future integrated circuits. This three-dimensional (3D) stacking approach allows us to achieve higher device integration density without reducing the size of individual transistors and enables a higher communication bandwidth with lower energy consumption between circuit blocks for better performance. This project serves the U.S. national interest in helping US-based semiconductor companies to sustain their technology leadership in the worldwide competition through accelerated technology transfer. It also provides summer research internships for high-school students and develops research-based laboratory modules for the enrichment of undergraduate curriculum.<br/><br/>Monolithic 3D integrated circuits offer multiple advantages over conventional planar 2D architecture or 3D systems realized via wafer or chip stackings. However, their implementation and manufacturing face the fundamental challenge of forming high-performance n- and p-channel transistors on top tiers under the constraint of limited thermal budget to preserve the bottom-tier devices and interconnects from degradation. Low-temperature processed transistors built on laser-annealed poly-crystalline silicon, metal oxides, and low-dimensional nanomaterials have been explored as potential candidates, but their performance is far inferior to transistors built on single-crystalline silicon. The objective of this research is to fill this technology gap by developing a process to transfer-print ultrathin (<10 nm thick) single-crystalline silicon nanomembranes with uniform doping on wafer scale at low temperature (<200 oC) on top of a silicon-CMOS wafer with completed devices and interconnects. The transferred silicon nanomembrane is then utilized to build high-performance junctionless transistors without extra doping process to stay within a limited thermal budget <400 oC. They will connect with the bottom-tier transistors through ultra-dense interlayer vias to form functional logic and memory circuits with performance and chip-area footprint unattainable in 2D architectures. This project will enable a breakthrough in realizing high-performance 3D monolithic integration, overcoming thermal constraints associated with both the formation of high-mobility semiconductor layers and the fabrication of high-performance transistors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communities across the United States and around the world face an urgent need for tools to effectively manage water on the landscape. Recognized as the ""kidneys of the planet,"" wetlands capture and slow floodwaters, store surface water, and recharge groundwater ? all while filtering pollution, supporting biodiversity, storing carbon, and more. Yet over 50% of wetlands in the United States and worldwide have been lost, along with the knowledge of where wetlands were. TealWaters' groundbreaking platform builds on decades of advances across twelve scientific disciplines (e.g. remote sensing, geomorphology, hydrology, wetland ecology, AI/machine learning) to identify where wetlands are, the diverse benefits they provide, and where they have potential to be restored to regain those functions. TealWaters' interactive web-map platform, open source analytical tools, and custom products allow natural resource professionals, policymakers, scientists, and citizens to ask and answer questions and explore scenarios (e.g. which restoration opportunities would best mitigate flooding or enhance water quality) to make informed decisions. TealWaters' ultimate goal is to increase communities? resilience by providing urgently needed, accessible, scientifically advanced tools. <br/><br/>The foundation of the project's platform is the Wetland Intrinsic Potential (WIP) spatial data layer which gives the continuous probability of wetland extent across a landscape. WIP is based on a predictive model that combines physical, hydrologic, and ecological landscape information at multiple scales with on-the-ground knowledge and data. A major breakthrough is its ability to incorporate hidden geomorphic and hydrologic features, allowing users to ""see"" many smaller wetlands that are missed on other maps and identify the potential for wetland restoration based on where they might have existed in the past. On this foundation, TealWaters' software layers scientific workflows for mapping and modeling specific wetland functions and develops these workflows into products implemented in the cloud. Wetland features may be combined with other user-specified datasets to identify sites for wetlands protection, creation, and restoration based on user priorities. For wetland managers, planners, policymakers, and communities, TealWaters' platform radically expands the sophistication of, and access to, advanced tools for making decisions about how to manage water on the landscape. The products will also open new avenues of scientific idea generation, mechanistic prediction and hypothesis testing, integrative modeling, and vision-inspired new research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neurosurgical interventions to remove brain tumors or treat medically refractory epilepsy strive to not cause post-operative cognitive deficits in patients. However, a majority of neurosurgery patients self-report post-operative cognitive deficits affecting language, vision, hearing, touch or movement that lower quality of life and increase morbidity. By creating tools that improve outcomes, patients are able to return to their lives more completely after surgery, which has broad implications for not just their own quality of life, but that of their families, with direct consequences for the broader economy and society. This first-of-its-kind tool to support quantitative pre-operative surgical planning and evidence-based prediction of post-operative outcome will reduce uncertainty associated with neurosurgical interventions and relieve hospitals, healthcare payers, and patients of increased costs due to potential postoperative complications driven by neurocognitive deficits.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will complete a novel suite of products that integrate multiple sources of information to enable clinicians to more effectively plan neurosurgery in support of the best post-operative quality-of-life for their patients. There is currently no publicly or commercially available software platform that integrates the administration, recording, analysis and cross-registration of behavioral tests and functional and structural brain mapping protocols. Clinical teams therefore devote an enormous amount of time to translating siloed streams of information into evidence that is relevant for clinical decision making. This project will directly address these technological shortcomings by utilizing a combination of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and statistical models that integrate these clinical data and allow for predictive simulations of how a surgical plan will affect outcomes. Under the Phase II project, important user-interface and regulatory submission (510(k)) milestones will be completed, and the technical infrastructure for predicting patient outcomes will be validated using a closed historical dataset. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate prediction of post-operative quality of life and neurocognitive outcomes at levels that match or exceed reported precedents, and culminate in submission of a Class II De Novo device application to the FDA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project develops and tests an AI-driven foundation modeling framework of the atmosphere and ocean, which can be used for long-range weather forecasting, extreme weather event alerts, local-scale environmental intelligence, and others.  While AI methods have revolutionized weather forecasting, AI (Artificial Intelligence) foundation modeling has not yet been deployed for large-scale Earth system modeling beyond the atmosphere, which is necessary for environmental use cases beyond short-term weather.  As such, developing an AI-driven atmosphere-ocean foundation model is a high-risk, high-reward scientific innovation, and brings the power of AI to a broad range of environmental intelligence applications.  Success of this project would help fortify businesses, municipalities, and governments against environmental volatility, extreme weather, and uncertainty, ensuring continued economic vitality and resilience.  Businesses in many industries, including energy, agriculture, insurance, forestry, real estate, infrastructure, logistics, and finance, would benefit from deploying this technology.  <br/><br/><br/>The primary focus of this project is on the development of an advanced multimodal AI foundation model for environmental intelligence that actively learns the foundational knowledge of the Earth system components and their interactions.

The model will be pretrained on the petabytes of Earth system model output, combined with decades of observational data (e.g. satellite data) and reanalyses, synthesizing the corpus of current physical knowledge of the Earth system. This will require parallel input/output optimization, distributed computing, and careful data chunking to avoid loss of information and minimize error compounding.

Additive manufacturing offers substantial advantages over traditional manufacturing, such as reduced material waste, integrated part design, and the ability to fabricate complex geometries. However, existing challenges in the design and simulation processes, such as time-consuming manual methods and high costs, have hindered its widespread use. This project will develop a generative design tool that automates and optimizes additive manufacturing part designs, significantly reducing computational time and costs while improving part performance and sustainability. By streamlining the creation of editable, robust designs, the technology will reduce material usage, energy consumption, and environmental impact. This innovation is anticipated to drive adoption across industries, including aerospace, medical, and automotive, facilitating more efficient and sustainable manufacturing practices.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address the inefficiencies in additive manufacturing design through three key innovations: a method for generating topology-optimized editable parametric computer aided design models, machine learning-enhanced simulation for accelerated topology optimization, and the integrated optimization of build orientation and support structures. Current design software often generates large, complex files that are difficult to edit, resulting in a time-consuming additive manufacturing model design process. By enabling a dual-option framework, the proposed generative design tool will allow users to choose between maximized performance or a balanced approach that includes both performance and editability, providing insights into how different design priorities affect the final output. The high computational demands of existing topology optimization techniques have limited their use in designing end-use parts. Additionally, many current additive manufacturing processes require sacrificial support structures for parts with certain inclination angles, which increases material and energy usage, as well as manufacturing time and cost. This project reduces design time, making the process faster and more cost-effective without compromising the quality of the optimized design.

A generative model is an abstraction, and often a simplification, of a data generating mechanism using probabilistic tools, where specific features of interest regarding the generating mechanism are encapsulated into parameters of the generative model. Bayesian statistical inference is a popular statistical paradigm for combining such generative models for data with prior information about model parameters in a principled fashion to perform statistical inference on the unknown parameters. Some of the salient aspects behind the tremendous growth in popularity of Bayesian inference  include principled incorporation of domain information, an in-built penalty for model complexity allowing automatic model selection, and facilitating borrowing of information across different domains via hierarchical modeling. However, being inherently model-based, Bayesian statistics is intrinsically susceptible to departures from the postulated generative model.  Through this project, the investigators will explore and develop new statistical methodology for performing Bayesian inference allowing flexible departures from the generative model under consideration. A major focus will be the user-friendliness of the proposed approaches, circumventing the need for a user to explicitly build probabilistic models of increasing richness. The research will be disseminated through articles at prominent avenues and research presentations. Additionally, software packages for the methods developed will be made available publicly. The investigators are committed to enhancing the pedagogical component of the proposal through advising students and developing graduate and undergraduate topic courses.<br/><br/>Flexible nonparametric Bayesian methods have gained in popularity to address perceived issues of traditional Bayesian modeling regarding model-misspecification. The last thirty years have seen a proliferation of such methods, both in mainstream statistics as well as the machine learning community, as we continue to encounter increasing levels of complexities in modern datasets. However, nonparametric Bayesian methods can be challenging to implement as well as interpret. Furthermore, in many applications, the targets of interest are quite simple and it is essentially futile to model all aspects of the data. The fundamental aim of the proposed research is to develop a flexible Bayesian non-parametric approach that retains the generative modeling aspect of traditional parametric Bayesian modeling while avoiding a complete probabilistic specification of the data generating mechanism as typically performed in nonparametric Bayesian modeling. This will be performed by defining a modified likelihood function, leveraging ideas from the empirical likelihood literature as well as optimal transport theory, that centers around a user-specified parametric family of densities. An automated calibration procedure will be developed to control the extent of centering around the parametric model. The investigators will offer a firm theoretical underpinning of the proposed procedure and develop computationally efficient algorithms to carry out inferential tasks. The developed methods will be applied to scientific learning problems in neuroscience and nuclear physics to allow departures from existing scientific models in situations where their operating characteristics are less understood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this, a system was developed for modeling the interaction of the user and device, where individual surface geometry and functional abilities are incorporated into analyses that enable individualized optimization of device configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that these optimizations result in varied device configurations across individuals, and that for patient populations there is a positive correlation between the results of symmetry-based neuromuscular goals and thermodynamics-based metabolic goals. The aim is to provide physically minimal interventions that can affect meaningful biomechanical changes in people with a broad range of locomotor deficits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dispersive/wave equations model wave propagation phenomena which are ubiquitous in nature. They also describe the basic laws of quantum physics, which is one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century. This project studies fundamental questions about dispersive and wave equations by introducing ideas from probability theory. The results of the project will advance the mathematical theory of wave turbulence, which has important applications to plasma physics, nonlinear optics, and oceanography, and the analysis of Gibbs measures for Hamiltonian systems, which plays a key role in quantum field theory and statistical physics. Due to its scope and connections to physics and science, the project will also promote interdisciplinary interactions. As part of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) is training junior researchers and contributes to maintaining the diversity in STEM disciplines at University of Southern California.<br/><br/>This award supports work on five research projects (A-E). The first three projects are concerned with the mathematical theory of wave turbulence. In Project A, the PI extends the short kinetic time derivation of wave kinetic equation to longer kinetic times. This is a major step in the development of the theory, as it goes beyond the perturbative regime and will also shed light on the longstanding open problem of the long-time derivation of the Boltzmann equation. In Project B, the PI plans to generalize this derivation to cover the full range of conjectured scaling laws, which is physically well motivated and also leads to new mathematically interesting structures. New significant combinatorial structures and cancellations which are not present in the physics literature are expected to be discovered. Project C considers the wave turbulence problem for water waves, which has been studied since the 1960s by physicists. Mathematically, it is a quasilinear equation and substantial new ideas are required to obtain results similar to the ones available in the semilinear case. The last two projects concern Gibbs and other invariant measures in statistical physics and quantum field theory. Project D concerns the Gibbs measure for the 2D hyperbolic sine-Gordon equation, which is an important model that contains near-critical scenarios. Here, the goal is to further develop the random tensor theory introduced by the PI in earlier work. Project E investigates, through a combination of techniques from probability theory and integrable systems, the invariance of the white noise measure for the one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrdinger equation, which is critical but also completely integrable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the fault near Mandalay slipped by about 15 feet (5 m), the southern end moved only a few feet. Thus, it remains unclear whether the southern segment is now locked or if it continues to slip slowly, raising concerns about future earthquakes near Yangon, a megacity of over 8 million residents.   Using highly sensitive instruments called creepmeters, the team will monitor surface fault movement with 1/10,000 inch (2.5 ?m) precision, recording the information every minute. These measurements will help determine whether the fault is still moving silently (afterslip), which can precede future ruptures. A similar reduction in slip was seen during the 1906 San Andreas Fault earthquake, though such detailed monitoring was not possible then. Project data will help assess ongoing seismic hazard in one of Southeast Asia's most densely populated regions as well as to test instrumentation that may be used when similar type earthquakes occur in the U.S..<br/><br/>Following the Mw 7.7 Mandalay earthquake, segments of the Sagaing Fault are expected to be slipping slowly through the process of afterslip. This silent fault motion typically occurs near and beyond rupture terminations and may persist for over a year before decaying to negligible rates. Measuring the evolution of this slip will allow the team to assess how frictional properties of the fault were altered by the mainshock. An increase in slip rate may signal elevated seismic hazard, including the possibility of future triggered earthquakes.   The team will deploy highly sensitive creepmeters capable of resolving 2.5 ?m to record fault motion continuously once-per-minute. These instruments can detect both dextral (horizontal) slip and fault dilation. Singapore-based collaborators, already active in Myanmar, will host and operate the devices as part of a new, instrument-based afterslip study.  This project focuses on the southern segment of the rupture, where slip during the earthquake was significantly less than further north. Southward propagation of afterslip into this area poses a direct threat to Yangon, a city of over 8 million. Unlike satellite-based geodetic methods, which offer only weekly resolution and far lower sensitivity, the ground-based data will provide high-resolution insight into near-field fault deformation.  This study will fill a critical observational gap in understanding the evolution of afterslip and its role in post-seismic hazard. It also provides a rare opportunity to study fault mechanics in near-real time, in a region of high vulnerability and limited prior instrumentation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ever since the commercialization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based solution processing of carbon fiber production in 1960s, there have been no changes to address the use of hazardous solvents and high process cost. This project will replace the current solvent spinning process-based polymer precursor fiber production with melt-spinning and eliminate the use of harmful solvents in spinning process and thereby reduce the production costs, investment costs, and health hazards. The new technology will produce high strength carbon fiber at a reduced cost by 30-40% compared to the current technology. The lower cost of carbon fiber will open up the long-sought application by automotive, offshore wind energy and other industries where carbon fiber composites are used.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a novel manufacturing process to extrude our patented polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based quad polymer into precursor fibers, which are carbonized to produce carbon fibers. High strength carbon fibers have been produced from the PAN based precursor fibers by solvent spinning process since it was developed in 1958. The precursors are still produced by solution spinning of the polyacrylonitrile-based polymers in toxic organic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide. These toxic solvents have to be contained, collected, and recycled which adds to high manufacturing costs of carbon fibers. Additional drawbacks in the solvent process include fibers with porosity that prevent the final carbon fiber to reach high strength and slow drawing speed. This results in low manufacturing productivity. The STTR project innovates with a new melt-extrudable polyacrylonitrile-based quad polymer and a melt-spinning process for making precursor fibers. Currently, there is no commercial manufacturing of precursor fibers produced using dry melt-extrusion process to produce the precursor fibers for carbon fiber production.

To reduce the high mortality rates that are common among such patients, real-time decision-making tools are needed urgently. The solution helps to understand and predict the air flow variations in the respiratory systems of individual patients (e.g., during mechanical ventilation) and diagnosing the level of lung damage (e.g., ascertaining the level of disease progression). The computer model of the lung can be customized for personalized therapy of individual patients. Such assisted therapies include optimization of the mechanical ventilator settings, while simultaneously avoiding unnecessary stress and strain on lung tissue, thus avoiding or minimizing damage to the lungs of these patients.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques were explored for efficient model order reduction. By leveraging AI, equivalent network representations of lungs can be developed which consists of non-linear flow impedances. The flow regimes range from turbulent flows (in the trachea, which is several centimeters diameter) to laminar flows (in smaller bronchi/ bronchioles and alveoli, which are millimeters to microns in diameter).

It proposes that the Earth?s outermost layer, the crust, is composed of multiple rigid plates that move across Earth?s surface. Plate movement is largely driven by subduction, which is the tectonic process by which oceanic crust is pulled into the Earth?s interior. While decades of research have helped understand how subduction drives plate motion, induces volcanism, and is related to hazardous earthquakes, the processes through which subduction starts remain largely unknown. Without this knowledge, the theory of plate tectonics remains incomplete. This grant is focused on understanding the process of subduction initiation by studying an ancient subduction zone that is exposed in southern Alaska along the Shelikof Strait. This area preserves sedimentary and volcanic rocks that were deposited prior to, during, and after subduction started. The formation of this new subduction zone in the Late Triassic led to the development of the Talkeetna  volcanic arc. The preservation of such a complete record of subduction initiation is rare and will allow the team to better understand the processes that caused oceanic crust to begin to sink into the Earth?s mantle. The characterization of these rocks will be the focus of an ambitious PhD student?s research under the direction of the two PIs at Purdue University. The grant will also include the production of Earth science classroom materials and the production of popular science education videos that will be posted on YouTube.<br/><br/>To accomplish the proposed research goals, the PIs will conduct a multidisciplinary study of Late Triassic sedimentary and volcanic strata that are exposed along the Shelikof Strait. These rocks are the oldest known portion of the well-studied Talkeetna arc and record the events preceding, during, and immediately following subduction initiation in this area. The exceptional preservation of these strata will allow the team to test two end-member hypotheses that have emerged as possible subduction initiation mechanisms: forced and spontaneous. Forced initiation occurs when compression leads to crustal shortening and the development of structures along which negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere can sink into the mantle. Spontaneous initiation occurs when density unstable oceanic lithosphere begins to sink into the mantle along a pre-existing lithospheric weakness. Both end-member processes make specific predictions for the nature of pre-, syn-, and post-subduction initiation sedimentary and volcanic strata. Forced initiation should lead to uplift and unconformity development prior to initiation. Spontaneous initiation will lead to sudden extension coeval with initiation. Typically, the record of these processes is obscured by subsequent deformation and magmatism in modern and ancient arcs. However, the Late Triassic strata along the Shelikof Strait remain relatively undeformed and are suitable for testing these models. To fully understand this record, the PIs will make new geologic maps of the area, produce new geochemical measurements and radiometric age determinations, and measure stratigraphic sections of sedimentary and volcanic strata. Once integrated, these data will provide a remarkably continuous record of subduction initiation processes over geologic time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inefficient temperature management leads to substantial energy waste and increased operational costs. The need for better temperature control affects a broad range of industries, including residential, commercial, industrial, transportation, and supply chain logistics sectors. Energy use for heating and cooling accounts for a significant portion of total energy consumption globally. Existing phase change material solutions often suffer from poor thermal properties, limited operation, and lack of adaptability to specific applications. This technology addresses these shortcomings by enabling more precise and efficient temperature stabilization through the efficient storage and release of energy. The materials are designed to effectively absorb excess heat when temperatures rise and release stored heat when temperatures fall, significantly reducing the energy burden on heating, cooling, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. By improving how thermal energy is managed, this technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption and enhance comfort, safety, and resilience.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of nano-engineered phase change materials with enhanced thermal conductivity, heat storage capacity, and structural stability. Functionalized carbon nanostructures were synthesized and incorporated into selected base phase change materials to function as thermally conductive and chemically interactive scaffolds, yielding composite systems with enhanced latent heat storage, accelerated thermal response, and improved structural integrity. Conventional phase change materials are often constrained by low intrinsic thermal conductivity, limited enthalpy of transition, and mechanical degradation under cyclic thermal loading. In contrast, these phase change material composites demonstrate enhanced phonon transport pathways, enhanced heat storage capacity, and morphological stability during repetitive phase transitions. The core innovation lies in the tailored interfacial interactions between the carbon-based nanomaterials and the phase change  molecules, which facilitate efficient thermal energy transfer, activate additional heat storage modes in the composite matrix, and mitigate material fatigue over extended operational lifespans. This approach also allows the optimization of the thermal properties of the composites by tuning different chemical interactions. Broad deployment of these advanced composites offers substantial reductions in energy consumption, extended device lifetimes, and increased system-level thermal efficiency, with measurable economic benefits across sectors demanding high-performance thermal regulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has shaped land use and fisheries regulations, as well as contributed to species declines and the endangered status of many large mammal populations. While it is recognized that predation by large mammalian carnivores dictates the structure and stability of ecosystems both on land and in the seas, knowledge about the biological traits that determine the energetic demands of these keystone predators is limited. Researchers on this project address this gap by synthesizing 40 years of energetic, behavioral and movement data for 23 species of large keystone carnivores to conduct one on the most comprehensive analyses of mammalian field energetics to date. Broad dissemination of the results to scientific, wildlife management and public communities will foster integrative plans to support activities of both humans and keystone species living on the landscape.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will create a library of 14 bioenergetic metrics and algorithms representing major indicators of ecological resource demands, and thus common keystone attributes of carnivorous mammals. Assessing bioenergetic demands across time and space will enable seasonal and spatial planning for different carnivore lineages comprising the felids, canids, ursids, mustelids, pinnipeds and cetaceans. By creating energetic cost algorithms for swimmers and runners, the scientific community will be able to translate locomotor movements of free-ranging mammalian carnivores into energetic costs for terrestrial or marine living. Harmonizing these data with existing animal tracking-trait databases will ensure global application and accessibility. Successful completion of this project will result in a unique library of allometric equations for comparative bioenergetic modeling across species and temporal and spatial scales that are critical for predicting sustainable resource use. These will be published in scientific journals and two technical books on carnivore energetics and scaling. Publicly accessible online and printed information about living in close proximity of large carnivores are also planned.

Wastewater infrastructure on islands face additional challenges, as they are subject to saltwater intrusion, shallow groundwater, poor soils, high material, labor, and energy costs, and proximity to sensitive ecosystems like coral reefs.

Around 4.6 billion tons of cement is produced annually to meet growing urbanization, industrialization, and infrastructure demands. However, conventional Portland cement manufacturing is among the most energy intensive industries, primarily due to its high-temperature production process. This Future Manufacturing Seed Grant (FMSG) research project explores a novel, lower-energy approach to cement manufacturing by combining biological and chemical processes that will leverage waterways? massive capacity to hold onto the key components used in cement production. Photosynthetic microbes called cyanobacteria look to be harnessed to produce solid calcium carbonate, a key component of cement, using sunlight and minerals in water. This microbially produced calcium carbonate plans to then be combined with sand and other materials for a promising alternative route to cement manufacturing. The success of the project will help enhance the competitiveness of US manufacturing and increase the availability of critically needed building materials, ultimately lowering the costs for production of new buildings for homeowners and businesses.<br/><br/>The biomineralization of calcium carbonate from water sources using cyanobacteria is currently challenging for manufacturing applications. In this research project, the natural microbial carbonate mineralization process looks to be applied and improved through modification of the producer organisms and by controlling external environments to generate key components for biocement. Calcium carbonate production using microbes requires high carbonate concentrations in concert with elevated calcium levels and availability of chemical conditions that facilitate solid precipitation. Synechococcus elongatus cyanobacteria and other strains important to calcium carbonate formation look to be modified to enhance precipitation of calcium carbonate in the environment. Delivery of calcium carbonate seeks to be improved by increasing nucleation processes that facilitate carbonate precipitation to overcome barriers to solids formation. In concert, manipulation of extracellular conditions through electrochemical adjustment of environmental pH intends to ensure maximum conversion of reactants to calcium carbonate precipitate. Next, an integrated and scalable biocement manufacturing process that combines cyanobacterial growth and precipitation steps plans to be designed and implemented. A final goal will be to include biocement in infrastructure materials and test that these materials are mechanically stable and possess sufficient stiffness and strength. The project will include experts in microbial biomanufacturing, electrochemical engineering, and mechanical testing. Further, this project looks to train future engineers from high school to graduate levels in key concepts including microbial fermentation, electrochemistry, and mechanical testing of materials, and demonstrate how these skills will be applied to design, develop, and implement the next wave of innovative, low-cost manufacturing processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sending sensitive data to web-service providers is a serious privacy risk: the provider could lose the user's data in a data breach, decide to sell it later on, or be forced to disclose it to a foreign government. At the same time, web services are indispensable. Thus, computer users currently have no choice but to hand over their sensitive data to web-service providers and to suffer the accompanying privacy risks. This project will develop a new suite of privacy-protecting web services that never see or process any unencrypted user data. This project's goal is to make it possible for everyday Internet users to enjoy the tremendous benefits of today's web while shielding them from the accompanying privacy risks. In addition, the educational aspects of the project will focus on the development of undergraduate content and an openly available textbook to teach security and systems in tandem. <br/><br/>This project consists of three parts, each dedicated to the development of a different private web service. The first part focuses on private machine-learning inference: allowing a client to evaluate a large server-side machine-learning model on its private data (e.g., the client's photos) while revealing no information about the client's private input data to the machine-learning service. The second part focuses on private search: allowing a client to search over a server-side corpus of billions of documents (e.g., web pages) while revealing no information about its search query to the search engine's servers. The third part focuses on private web browsing: allowing a client to browse a web of hundreds of millions of text-based pages while revealing no information about which pages it is reading. Building each of these three private web services will require new technical tools. In particular, this project will develop a suite of new low-level cryptographic primitives, including new high-speed protocols for private matrix multiplication, new protocols for private nearest-neighbor search in high-dimensional vector spaces, and a new cryptographic primitive, distributional private information retrieval, which allows a client to privately fetch data from a remote database server at relatively low cost.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therapies based on T cells (CAR T-cell therapy) are proving to be effective for certain cancers. T cells are isolated from a patient?s blood and modified to express a binding protein (CAR) that allows the T-cell to more effectively attach to tumor cells. Once modified, the CAR T-cells are grown to create millions of them, and then introduced into the patient, where they bind to cancer cells and kill them. The weak link in this process is the growth step. As the cells grow in number, they create inexact copies of the original cell, so ultimately there is a broad distribution of effectiveness in the resulting CAR T-cells. This reduces the effectiveness of the treatment. This project will attempt to track the development of these growing populations and determine what causes this variability. In parallel, the PI will be developing hands-on lessons and computational tutorials on light microscopy for high school and college-level communities. This should enhance STEM education and broaden the understanding of single-cell biological engineering.<br/><br/>This project aims to decode how single-cell phenotypic heterogeneity arises and can be precisely controlled by linking dynamic cellular behaviors to deep molecular phenotyping. Currently, a major limitation is the inability to observe how a cell?s molecular phenotype relates to the multimodal signals and dynamic paths it takes through time and space. To address this challenge, the research leverages three cutting-edge technologies: (1) spatial proteomic multiplexed imaging; (2) in vitro cell tracking; and (3) engineered biomaterial artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) that deliver controlled stimulatory signals to T cells. The scope of the project is centered on three main objectives. First, it will image and computationally extract dynamic cell interactions to link these events directly to downstream T cell phenotypes. Second, it will establish a barcoded, dynamic, multi-input T cell stimulation platform and decode the complete stimulation histories of individual cells as they acquire their final phenotypes. Third, it will use these integrated datasets?encompassing dynamic behavior, molecular signatures, and multiplexed stimulation conditions?to learn and predict how T cell phenotypes emerge from complex, time-varying inputs. To accomplish these goals, the project employs existing and newly developed computational workflows, including segmentation, unsupervised clustering, machine learning, and data-driven multiscale modeling. By constructing a powerful, decodable perturbation screening platform, the research will uncover how distinct combinations and sequences of stimulation events shape T cell fate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach has a number of well-recognized challenges, including achieving desired levels of security. The Named-data Networking (NDN) architecture is ""data-centric"" and defines a network service that delivers data objects requested by a name rather than an address.  The NDN protocol emphasizes security (especially integrity and authenticity) and location-independence of delivered data. Unlike the legacy web, which authenticates the server where the data resides, the NDN protocol cryptographically binds the data and name, thus making security independent of which server the data is retrieved from. NDN has been shown to be useful within individual networks, but scaling it to a global service has been an ongoing challenge, both because the set of data names is unbounded and because those names are not tied to specific locations. SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation on Next-generation networks), is an inter-domain routing (IDR) architecture designed to carry packets between network domains while overcoming certain shortcomings of the current Internet's IDR system, which is based on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  BGP was designed and deployed before cryptographic security mechanisms came into widespread use. SCION, on the other hand, was designed from the ground up to be secure, and fully independent of the BGP-based IDR system. It also provides increased control over the paths packets follow between domains, including concurrent use of multiple paths between source and destination, to increase transmission capacity and resilience.<br/><br/>Motivated by the synergy between these two next-generation protocols, this project aims to design, develop and prototype NDN+SCION: a secure, scalable, global name-based network service based on the existing NDN and SCION protocols. This project aims to address two main research questions: (i) where and how to implement the interface between NDN within a network domain and SCION across domain boundaries; and (ii) where and how application trust, which determines what data is considered authentic, interacts with network trust, which determines how requests for named data are routed.  The prototype service will be deployed and tested on the FABRIC testbed.

These equations govern everything from fluid flow in pipelines and aerodynamics in high-speed transportation to plasma control in nuclear fusion and material behavior in advanced manufacturing. However, processes described by nonlinear PDEs are notoriously difficult to analyze and control using existing methods, requiring deep mathematical expertise and significant computational resources. This CMMI-UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) project combines the efforts and expertise of UK and US collaborating investigators to attempt to overcome these challenges by developing new computational methods and algorithms that enable the solution, analysis and control of nonlinear PDEs. The key focus of this collaborative project is ensuring that developed tools are accessible to researchers and engineers without requiring extensive mathematical expertise. By making these techniques more practical and widely available, this project looks to enhance the ability of data-based models to drive improvements in reliability, efficiency, and safety across sectors including energy, industry, and defense.<br/><br/>The sum-of-squares polynomial optimization framework allows one to computationally verify stability properties of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by searching for positive polynomial Lyapunov functions. This research project aims to develop an equivalent of the sum-of-squares framework for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The first step seeks to construct a suitable parameterization of polynomials on the spatially distributed Hilbert space of Lebesgue-integrable functions. The next steps seeks to reformulate the nonlinear PDE using this distributed polynomial parameterization. This step is anticipated to involve applying a state transformation and the partial integral equation (PIE) framework to eliminate partial derivatives and boundary conditions, ensuring a well-posed representation of the system. Once reformulated, the next step seeks to parameterize positive polynomial Lyapunov functions in a distributed space using positive partial integral operators, enforcing a sum-of-squares-type condition. It is expected that the Lyapunov stability conditions will be expressed as a convex optimization problem, allowing for an efficient computational solution. To support broad applicability, specialized software intends to be be developed to automate each step of this process, enabling analysis across broad classes of nonlinear PDEs. This software looks to feature user-friendly interfaces to facilitate adoption by non-specialists for rapid prototyping of complex data-based models. Finally, resulting algorithms will be applied to problems of fluid flow with transition to turbulence, as well as to data-based models of magnetohydrodynamic plasma in Tokamak nuclear fusion reactors.<br/><br/>This research is a collaborative effort under the NSF Directorate for Engineering - UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Lead Agency Opportunity (ENG-EPSRC), NSF 20-510.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In industrial applications, the droplets often contain particles, which can modify the fluid properties and lead to peculiar behavior upon impact. The dynamics of droplet impact have been studied extensively for simple liquid drops, but it has not been studied as extensively for droplets composed of complicated fluids such as a suspension of particles.  Droplet impact for these systems is difficult to predict because it depends on the interplay of multiple effects such as surface tension, viscosity, and inertia. As a result, the flow fields in these systems can be complex, and particles inside the drop may not be evenly distributed throughout the drop.  If the concentration of particles in the drop is high, the drop is opaque, which makes it difficult to visualize internal flows.  This project will establish a framework that combines several state-of-the-art diagnostic methods to probe the impact dynamics of drops composed of complicated fluids.  Data will provide critical insight into the impact dynamics of complex fluid droplets on surfaces. The project will support an educational plan for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students to help build the STEM workforce pipeline and engage public interest in multiphase flow research through the art of science competitions.<br/><br/>The goal of this award is to develop an experimental platform by synergistically combining various advanced diagnostic techniques to probe the detailed dynamics as complex fluids droplets impact on surfaces, and to generate systematic understanding of the coupling between the complex fluid properties and flow behavior.

However, little is known about this link due to the complexity of the interaction. Current imaging techniques cannot capture this complexity at the resolution of a cell within the brain. This CAREER project aims to develop an innovative microscopy system capable of simultaneously imaging many aspects of the brain to better understand the link between neurons and blood vessels. The outcome of this project will pave the way to better understand conditions like Alzheimer?s disease and stroke. This project will also benefit society through STEM education activities aimed at strengthening the biophotonics workforce. These activities includes igniting high school students' interest in STEM, providing hands-on courses for undergraduate and graduate students, and engaging the public to raise awareness about biophotonics and STEM.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term goal is to create a transformative field in fluorescence-phase multimodal imaging for simultaneous imaging of fluorescence-labeled and label-free cellular structures and functional activities in vivo. To realize this goal, the CAREER project will develop correlative, simultaneous microscopy of optical signatures (COSMOS) capable of noninvasively and concurrently recording fluorescence, second harmonic generation (SHG), and quantitative phase signals from a single dataset. Unlike current dual-contrast systems, COSMOS integrates fluorescence/SHG and phase imaging into a fully merged system. It collects two-photon excited diffracted fluorescence/SHG as multiplexed measurements, followed by computational decomposition. The reconstructed phase provides quantitative biophysical properties of neurovascular units, while the intensity of diffracted fluorescence indicates neural activity and blood dynamics, and the intensity of diffracted SHG reveals the spatial distribution of collagen in the extracellular matrix. COSMOS reconstructs multiple distinct optical signatures from the same dataset, enabling high-speed, high-throughput imaging of dynamic interactions in neurovascular units. Beyond neuroscience, COSMOS potentially has broad applications, such as studying cancer cell metastasis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One such technology involves storing hydrogen in ice-like structures called gas hydrates. However, the amount of gas that can be stored in these hydrates is too low to meet the economic goal, which is to store an amount of hydrogen that is at least 5.5% of the hydrate?s weight. This project will explore how to store more hydrogen by trapping the hydrogen gas as tiny bubbles inside the hydrates. The project will run computer simulations of hydrogen and water molecules to understand how the tiny bubbles are trapped. Experiments will be conducted to validate simulation results. The new approach proposed for increasing hydrogen storage could also be used to increase the storage, transportation, and capture of CO2 to help reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. This research will benefit the broader society by making it possible to store and use hydrogen in many applications, including transportation. Transitioning from traditional fuels to hydrogen will help reduce environmental pollution and global climate change. Middle and high school students will also see and interact with these ice-like structures using virtual reality (VR) headsets.  <br/><br/>This CAREER project seeks to significantly enhance hydrate-based hydrogen storage (HBHS) by trapping hydrogen gas nanobubbles within solid hydrate structures. Unlike HBHS approaches that use promoters, the proposed approach can significantly enhance hydrogen storage capacity and formation rate. Large-scale atomistic MD studies will examine how hydrogen nanobubbles become trapped within the growing solid hydrate. The results will be visualized using a Virtual Reality (VR) workflow that allows researchers to probe and visualize the internal structure of these hydrates with VR headsets and controllers. Experimental studies will also be conducted to confirm the game-changing potential of this approach. Hydrogen hydrates will be formed under conditions that favor nanobubble trapping, and analyses such as volumetric measurements, microscopy, and NMR imaging will be performed on hydrate samples. These tests will confirm the trapping of hydrogen gas nanobubbles in hydrates and quantify the potential to exceed the DOE hydrogen storage target. By combining advanced visualization of large-scale MD simulation results with experimental validation, this project aims to redefine the capabilities of HBHS, providing a clean energy storage method that could have broad applications in the fields of hydrogen storage, carbon sequestration, CO2 capture and transportation, and methane production, storage, and transportation.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering and Molecular Thermodynamics (PRM) program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finally, it will provide opportunities for discussion forums, workshops, and dissemination of computational tools to the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>This project will develop new experimental techniques and mathematical models to generate a fundamental understanding of microswimmer transport and collective behavior in porous media. The work will focus on bacteria, an archetype of microswimmers that can move through fluid by flagellar propulsion. Two fundamental questions will be addressed. First, how is single-cell motility altered by pore-scale confinement - specifically, how does motility depend on the properties of the cells and of the porous medium? Second, how do cell-cell interactions guide collective behavior in porous media?  By connecting cellular properties, porous medium properties, and motility/collective behavior, this work will generate knowledge to enable prediction and control over bacterial transport and organization.  Results from this project will help practitioners control bacterial behavior in applications such as treating infections, microbial drug delivery, using soil bacteria for agriculture, and bioremediation.

This project focuses on electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR), a process that uses electricity to turn CO2 from industrial emissions from the air into valuable products. However, the buildup of salts inside the device used for CO2RR is a significant challenge. These salts clog the device's channels and prevent CO2 from reaching the reaction sites, which can cause the device to fail over time. To address this issue, the project team will study how salts form, move, and accumulate in CO2RR devices under different conditions. Using advanced equipment, investigators will track salt formation and movement in real time by measuring ions and observing the reactions. This will provide a better understanding of the process and help develop strategies to inhibit salt buildup, such as applying specialized coatings to improve the device's long-term performance. Improving CO2RR technology is important for several reasons: it helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthens economic competitiveness, and creates jobs. Additionally, the research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in electrochemical systems, which could benefit other related technologies. The project will also provide valuable hands-on learning experiences for students, fostering critical thinking and innovation as they prepare to become the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The practical deployment and long-term stability of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrolyzers are hindered by salt precipitation within the cathode chamber, which obstructs CO2 diffusion channels, leading to performance degradation and eventual failure. The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing salt migration and formation in CO2RR electrolyzers, and to use this knowledge to devise effective strategies for salt removal, thereby enhancing long-term stability. This will be accomplished by integrating novel CO2RR reactor designs with in-operando spectroscopic techniques and cation mass balance analysis, conducted under various reaction conditions and interfacial microenvironments. The first step will involve establishing a comprehensive cation crossover monitoring platform, enabling detailed tracking of salt migration, crossover, and formation processes. This platform will also identify key factors influencing salt formation rates. Next, the project will investigate the primary driving forces behind salt migration from the catalyst-electrolyte interface toward the gas flow channels. Based on these findings, surface coating strategies will be developed for the cathode gas flow channels to enhance salt removal and improve the overall stability of the electrolyzer. Ultimately, this research will provide critical insights into mitigating stability issues in CO2RR systems and offer solutions that can be applied to other electrochemical processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The behaviors of materials under dynamic loads that are applied within a fraction of a second remain poorly understood due to the complex, nonlinear interplay between material microstructure, geometry, and applied load. The complexity increases manifold for architected materials, in which topological considerations are paramount to achieve specific responses or functions. Consequently, methodical design of architected materials with optimal dynamic fingerprints is a challenge that has not been adequately addressed. By seamlessly integrating advances in graph network theory, machine learning, numerical simulations, and high-speed additive manufacturing approaches, this Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) award will accelerate the understanding, inverse design, and fabrication of architected materials with tailorable dynamic fingerprints. The outcome will be materials with inversely designed three-dimensional micro-architectures fabricated via desktop additive manufacturing with prescribed behaviors, such as impact shielding and wave transmission. Applications include energy and shock absorption, acoustic wave filtering, stretchable electronics, and other multifunctional material systems. The project will also train graduate and undergraduate students in the new paradigm of autonomous inverse design and additive manufacturing based on desired behaviors. Moreover, demonstration modules, design games, and additive printing activities will be used for outreach to K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project will extend graph-based generative machine learning modeling techniques to identify the underlying motifs within architected materials to understand their dynamic behaviors as well as provide an inverse design framework for optimized functional responses. The first step is to develop a graph space model to represent an arbitrary architected material composed of an arbitrarily complex 3D micro-architecture, by size, scale, hierarchy, lattice topology, and material attributes. The next step involves obtaining high-fidelity experimental data and higher-order simulation data with large amounts of lower-order experimental data to accelerate the training and discovery process. A forward graph-based machine learning model will be trained on the combined data for functional response prediction. Lastly, the graph neural network with reinforcement learning will be used to generate graphs with the desired properties based on the forward predictive model. This extensive and experimentally validated framework will be used to discover fundamental knowledge pertaining to structural and dynamic characteristics, which will then be leveraged to inversely design materials with prescribed dynamic fingerprint.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These braces can help some people, but many brace users still have difficulty walking. One reason braces may not provide benefit is that the ankle is complex, but most braces act like a simple spring. Another reason is that current methods for brace customization are based on trial and error as there is not a good model for how to change the brace?s properties to best meet each person?s needs.  Ankle braces with tailored properties that better mimic normal ankle function may make it easier to walk for people with ankle injuries.

Industrial grade additive manufacturing machines used in the aerospace and defense industries produce high performance structural metal parts. However, high costs and relatively low production speeds have greatly limited industrial use of these technologies beyond a few aerospace applications. This Future Manufacturing grant seeks to expand industrial adoption of metal additive manufacturing using an efficient molten metal droplet jetting process that is akin to high-speed inkjet printing using molten metal as the ""ink"". Process knowledge generated via this research helps make domestic manufacturing of metal components competitive with overseas competition in terms of both cost and speed. Three hallmarks of the process are that it intended to process both new and recycled metal as the feedstock material, there is very little scrap produced, and labor costs are minimal. This improves the business case for reshoring domestic manufacturing by lowering the costs per part. The ability to convert scrap metal such as machining chips into new parts is particularly important for commercial and military supply chain scenarios where resources are scarce. The project looks to advance education and workforce development through summer camps and certificate courses in additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>The ambitious goal for this Future Manufacturing research is to enable additive manufacturing of metal components that are competitive with traditional casting and machining processes on the bases of cost, speed, and quality. The technology used is a novel multi-nozzle molten metal jetting process. Unlike most metal additive processes, this process melts metal prior to deposition rather than during deposition. This allows any form of metal feedstock material to be used, including ingot, rod, wire, and recycled material. Several scientific contributions are needed to realize the ambitious goals of the project. High material deposition rates are needed for this process to be competitive with traditional processes. Multi-physics modeling are used to determine the conditions under which progressively higher frequency jetting of molten metal droplets is possible. Throughput is also increased using multi-nozzle arrays. Computationally efficient thermal modeling techniques are employed to better understand the relationship between multi-nozzle jetting strategies and part quality as determined by evaluation of microstructure and porosity.  Lastly, the quality of material produced from recycled metal feedstock is compared with that of virgin material, and lifecycle analysis tools are used to quantify the relative impacts associated with different recycled material usage scenarios.<br/><br/>This Future Manufacturing award is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Divisions of CMMI, CBET and ECCS in the ENG Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These braces can help some people, but many brace users still have difficulty walking. One reason braces may not provide benefit is that the ankle is complex, but most braces act like a simple spring. Another reason is that current methods for brace customization are based on trial and error as there is not a good model for how to change the brace?s properties to best meet each person?s needs.  Ankle braces with tailored properties that better mimic normal ankle function may make it easier to walk for people with ankle injuries.

Effective infrastructure provides a strong foundation for socioeconomic vitality and broad quality of life improvement. Strong, reliable, and effective infrastructure spurs private-sector innovation, grows the economy, creates jobs, makes public-sector service provision more efficient, strengthens communities, promotes equal opportunity, protects the natural environment, enhances national security, and fuels American leadership. To achieve these goals requires expertise from across the science and engineering disciplines. SAI focuses on how knowledge of human reasoning and decision making, governance, and social and cultural processes enables the building and maintenance of effective infrastructure that improves lives and society and builds on advances in technology and engineering.<br/><br/>This project examines the management and restoration of watersheds in remote, mountainous regions. Management efforts can reduce the risk of severe wildfires in these regions. Among local residents and stakeholders, however, there may be misunderstandings about the ecological processes that lead management efforts to reduce the risks of fires. As seen more generally in studies of risk perception, the resulting uncertainties can result in indecision and inaction. In this study, the researchers examine how uncertainties in evaluating risks lead people to prioritize different management opportunities. Using experimental methods, the study presents participants with varying degrees of uncertainty about anticipated outcomes of restoration efforts to determine how this variation affects decisions to allocate resources toward management. The project contributes to goals of forest management by identifying the information that stakeholders need to make decisions about restoration efforts. The project also provides training opportunities for a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar.<br/><br/>This study addresses the effects of uncertain outcomes on the perceived benefits of restoration efforts in remote, mountainous watersheds. Drawing on methods and theory from cognitive psychology, the researchers experimentally pose scenarios to participants to determine how varying uncertainty leads individuals to evaluate the benefits of different management options. This work focuses on three distinct types of uncertainty, namely direct, indirect, and perceived uncertainty. Direct uncertainty assumes that the probabilities of events are known completely whereas indirect uncertainty arises when the respective probabilities are known only incompletely. Perceived uncertainty refers to subjective feelings of uncertainty, which are commonly influential in decision-making.

Improving these systems is important for making energy storage safer, longer-lasting, and more effective. At the core of these systems are electrolytes, special materials that allow ions to move and enable energy storage and transfer. By designing better electrolytes, it is possible to create improved batteries and energy systems that support sustainable energy solutions. This project focuses on understanding how electrolytes function at the molecular level. Using advanced tools like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and experimental techniques, the research aims to uncover new insights into how ions interact and move within these materials. These discoveries will help in designing better electrolytes, leading to more efficient and reliable energy storage technologies. Beyond advancing science, this project will benefit society by providing open-access tools and knowledge to researchers and educators. It will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in research, and contribute to the development of technologies that support cleaner energy. These efforts align with national priorities to drive innovation, foster sustainability, and expand the science and engineering workforce to meet future challenges in energy and materials science.<br/><br/>The proposed research investigates the solvation structure of liquid organic electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as a model system. The study aims to identify and understand multiple stable ionic species within multicomponent electrolyte solutions and their impact on transport properties. Using a combination of experimental spectroscopy, computational simulations, and machine learning (ML), the project will achieve the following goals:  First, it will develop a large-scale database of experimental NMR spectra, capturing solvation environments in LIB electrolytes. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and vision-language models (VLM), data from the scientific literature will be extracted to create a high-fidelity resource for training ML models. Where gaps in the literature exist, new NMR data will be generated through collaborations with experimental researchers. Second, the project will elucidate solvation structures and their dynamics by combining molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. This approach will overcome traditional limitations by automating predictions of NMR chemical shifts, enabling the identification of multiple stable species in complex solutions. The proposed work will result in the first systematic open-source augmented NMR spectroscopic database for both traditional and non-traditional nuclei, corresponding liquid composition and metadata, and detailed solvation structure obtained using simulations. Finally, the research will develop an ML-based framework to predict NMR chemical shifts for new electrolyte systems, bridging computational and experimental data. The framework will provide rapid and accurate mappings of solvation structures to observed NMR spectra, facilitating electrolyte design for various applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

OUD includes physical dependency and neural adaptations in brain circuits of reward and motivation, self-regulation, and stress reactivity that can persist years after drug discontinuation. Substance craving is one of the primary causes of OUD patient's relapse. Studies have shown psychological cues such as stress, anxiety, and arousal can precipitate the cultivation of drug craving. Research has found that mindfulness-based strategies reduce cravings, psychological cues and prevent relapse. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) bring about clinically relevant changes to physiological arousal, stress, and addictive behavior through cognitive behavioral skill development. This project focuses on developing and testing innovative technologies to aid sustainable recovery of OUD with wearable and in-home physiological monitoring and generation of adaptive, personalized, and just-in-time MBIs. While the research is focused on OUD, the principle and the outcomes can be expanded to include other substance use disorders. The project includes several education and outreach activities such as machine learning course for medical professionals and annual workshops for middle school girls.<br/><br/>This study focuses on opioid use disorder (OUD), related cognition, and behaviors associated with a) reward, b) self-regulation, c) stress reactivity, d) opioid craving, e) physical opioid withdrawal symptoms and MBIs known to be impacted by OUD and post-acute withdrawal from opioids. In particular, the research tasks focus on there areas. First, effective physiological feature identification and extraction to detect craving that is generalizable across large OUD populations and consider the external factors such as age, gender, drug use habits, etc. Second, development of an effective multi-modal sensing integration approach to capture psychological craving cues (e.g., stress, arousal) from a combination of acoustic and physiological sensing. This will include novel multiple instance (MIL) multitask learning based classification techniques that are scalable with near real-time performance. The study will address the fundamental gaps of indoor craving-relevant sensing where only a small fraction of a long signal may convey information relevant to the targeted emotional state/class. The last task will include development of a craving context-aware MBI recommender system that models the dynamic nature of OUD subjects craving-interventions and feedbacks. The system will be formally validated to ensure safety against adverse outcomes. Successful execution of the research will begin to test the effectiveness of integrating passive sensing, adaptive artificial intelligence (AI), and mindfulness interventions on regulating drug craving.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These processes encompass the transport of food particles along the intestinal tract, their mixing with digestive enzymes, and the movement of nutrients to the surface of the intestinal wall. These processes are facilitated by the rhythmic movements of the intestinal wall and microstructures on its inner surface. This suggests that the human body may regulate digestion and absorption in the small intestine by controlling these movements. This project will uncover the mechanisms by which the small intestine mixes and transports food particles, enzymes, and nutrients across different scales, ultimately regulating digestion and absorption. The study will employ advanced numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and data analysis techniques to explore the intricate processes involved. <br/><br/>This project comprises high-fidelity numerical simulations of multiscale mechanisms, advanced theoretical analysis grounded in physics, and data analysis techniques leveraging machine learning. The primary objective is to establish a mechanistic framework for understanding how human physiological systems manage digestion and absorption by regulating these mixing and transport processes in the small intestine. This will be achieved through two specific goals; 1) Uncover the mechanisms of mixing, transport, and breakdown of chyme particles, along with dissolved enzymes and nutrients in intestinal fluids and 2) Identify the impact of mixing and transport processes in the small intestine under various conditions on food digestion, nutrient absorption, and energy consumption.

Accurate predictions of how quickly it will rise is challenging because it depends on many different processes and how these processes interact with and feedback on each other.  One process that may play a surprisingly large role is the effect of small swirls and eddies (only a few feet across) of warm water that control the rate of ice melt at the near-vertical cliff faces of the world?s marine-terminating (tidewater) glaciers.  At these glaciers, ice flows directly into the ocean and melts underwater or calves icebergs. Melting of the ice produces freshwater that flows out near the ocean surface and drives a return flow that draws in deep warmer ocean water toward the glacier. According to current theory, increasing the rate of ice melt increases the strength at which warmer ocean water is pulled in towards the ice face, which further enhances the melting.  The details of this process - particularly the small-scale dynamics near the ice face - have never been measured because the calving ice cliffs are too dangerous to make measurements.  Here we propose to use a highly specialized underwater robot (a remotely operated vehicle, or ?ROV?) with state-of-the-art optical and acoustic instruments to observe the melt rate and the processes that control it.  One of the novel aspects is the use of ?melt stakes? - 6 ft long rods that will be driven into the glacier face by the ROV and monitored continuously to determine the melt processes. These stakes then provide a frame of reference for our ROV to make a suite of detailed measurements of the shape of the glacier face, the dynamics of the currents adjacent to it, and how the ice-water interface evolves.  At the same time, we will observe the local ocean environment in the fjord - the currents, salinity and temperature - which are the main ingredients we need to predict ice melt in larger-scale and climate models.   Our analyses will combine field data with a high-resolution fluid-flow model that recreates the conditions along the ice with realistic water properties.  The combination of model and data will be used to refine our melt predictions and verify these directly using our observed measurements.  At the end of the project, we will be able to extend our results to estimate how much melt is occurring for tidewater glaciers around the globe, and how this may change in time.  Beyond this importance to society and the scientific community, this grant provides broader impacts across several levels: (1) mentorship and support for two early career women (2) support for three graduate students in interdisciplinary ice-ocean studies, (3) experiential opportunities, funding, and mentorship for 45 senior-year undergraduate students, whose capstone projects will directly contribute to this project while being supervised by our gender and culturally diverse team of engineers and technical staff, (4) classroom experiments showing buoyancy and convection to engage K-12 students and the general public, and (5) two teams of high-school women will additionally be involved and make observations through Girls in Icy Fjords expeditions.<br/><br/>Melting at the ice-ocean interface of marine-terminating glaciers influences the rate of mass loss from the world's ice sheets. In addition to contributing to sea-level rise, details of the melt process dictate the depth at which fresh meltwater enters the ocean (which in turn affects ocean circulation on a variety of scales) and alters calving rates. Existing theory suggests that the rate of submarine melting along these ice faces is set by the strength of subglacial discharge. However, recent observations find unexpectedly high melt rates over broad sections of glacier termini, even outside discharge plume areas.  The observed order of magnitude discrepancies between observed and predicted melt rates suggests the presence of energetic dynamics elsewhere along the ice face that drive near-ice turbulent flows.  We hypothesize that this discrepancy arises from differences in the rate-controlling physics within the boundary layers.  Current turbulent transfer coefficients were derived from stable boundary layers.  Yet on vertical glacier ice faces, boundary layers have strong buoyant forcing and marginal stability that likely produce dynamics not captured by laboratory or idealized models.  Because buoyant meltwater fluxes provide kinetic energy for near-boundary outer flows -- and because enhancement of those flows leads to enhanced melting -- there is potential for strong positive feedbacks in the dynamics.  As a result, small errors in the melt parameters or the parameterization functional form can have significant consequences to the total melt calculation. No studies have yet to make observations immediately next to near-vertical ice faces, or measure melt dynamics with the resolution necessary to investigate these dynamical feedbacks. This grant supports the development of a first-of-its-kind network of coordinated underwater acoustic, optical and in-situ unmanned sensors to be deployed at LeConte Glacier, Alaska. Using methods that meld glaciology, oceanography, and robotics, these systems will collect the first geophysical observations of the turbulent boundary layer at a near-vertical glacier face.  Specifically, we will directly measure velocity, salinity and temperature through a buoyancy-forced near-vertical boundary layer and relate these to observations of the subsurface ice morphology (e.g., slope, roughness) across several spatial scales.  By combining these data with high-resolution realistic simulations, we will characterize the dominant contributions to boundary layer turbulence and explicitly relate these to local melt rates. Our ultimate goal is to determine what parameters need to be measured (e.g., fjord u,T,S) over what time and space scales, as well as what assumptions can be made in order to connect dynamics from the small-scale ice interface to the large-scale ocean and glacier forcing.  This grant builds an observational capacity that does not exist at present.  Measurements will span a sufficient range of the parameter space (in ocean temperature, velocity variance and ice morphology) for us and others to test existing and advance new melt models that underlie many ice-ocean community models.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences Program and the Physical Oceanography Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They can be found in non-stick cookware, water-resistant clothes, stain-resistant carpets, firefighting foam, and even some food packaging. These chemicals don?t break down easily in the environment or inside our bodies, so they are called ?forever chemicals.? Over time, they can build up in drinking water and organs like the liver and kidneys, which has raised concerns about possible health risks. This project focuses on finding a way to remove PFOA from water using a safe and low-energy method. It combines the natural ability of enzymes, which help break down substances, with special membranes that can separate PFOA and its breakdown products, all while keeping clean water flowing easily. The project will train students and teachers at graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 levels. They?ll learn about creating materials for membranes, enzyme reactions, and using advanced techniques to study these processes. The goal is to help the public understand important environmental issues and expand the science and engineering workforce through educational programs in schools and outreach activities.<br/><br/>The proposed work describes the formation and testing of an environmentally benign hybrid membrane platform which facilitates the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), in addition to the removal of its degradation by-products and residual PFOA to thus produce clean drinking water. The approach is based on immobilizing a natural biocatalyst, Laccase, onto a polyelectrolyte membrane developed in lab settings using various surface-anchoring techniques. Pore size, porosity and other morphological properties of the underlying membrane will be tailored to serve the dual purpose of both providing a sustainable platform for enzyme immobilization and resulting degradation abilities, as well as to reject the by-products of such PFOA degradation. Toxicity analysis of the degradation by-products via a metabolism assay technique will be implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach to be used for eliminating potential deleterious health effects. To advance understanding and thus ensure project transferability and sustainability in real settings and for other fluorochemicals, the synergistic kinetics of the membrane separation and the specificity, efficiency and operational stability of the enzymatic breakdown processes will also be evaluated. The research component of this work will be complemented by educational, mentoring and outreach activities to contribute to the development of the next generation workforce capable to understand both the implications of water contamination processes, how they can result in environmental and human health effects, as well as capable to develop and implement next generation technologies for low energy, benign decontamination.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering and Molecular Thermodynamics (PRM) program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, this project will: (a) develop novel techniques for learning robust-by-construction perception policies; (b) construct safety monitors for perception policies to ensure their safe operation during runtime; and (c) develop a principled approach to mine closed-loop perception failures at scale and use them to improve robot safety over time. These results will be grounded through a thorough evaluation on a heterogeneous physical robotic testbed, as well as photorealistic simulators, with a focus on autonomous inspection and autonomous aircraft landing tasks. The ability to develop safe perception-driven systems will have a direct, positive impact on a broad range of robotics applications where safety and reliability are of high importance, such as surveillance of critical infrastructure, service or delivery robots, and autonomous cars.

Climate change is affecting this synchrony and this mismatch will have cascading effects on our ecosystems. This project will examine the connection between migratory timing and resource availability in a songbird. Resources on the breeding grounds (e.g., insects important for raising young) are peaking earlier each year. Songbirds may not be able to respond to these changes, modifying the timing of their migration to arrive on the breeding grounds earlier. This mismatch is not only of concern to researchers; federal and state wildlife agencies are also trying to prepare for the downstream consequences of this phenomenon. Accordingly, this project was designed in collaboration with wildlife agencies. Results will help policy makers assess existing protection policies and test new management plans for migratory songbirds. Local outreach along the migratory flyway is also planned (e.g., educational programming on migration that will connect children across North and South America). Underrepresented groups in STEM will also be recruited in this project and included in both the research and outreach plans.<br/><br/>Plasticity and adaptation could allow migrants to advance their migratory timing, but direct estimates of these mechanisms and their molecular basis are rare and restricted to a small number of proximate populations. This project will begin filling this knowledge gap, using state-of-the-art tools from several disciplines (e.g., animal movement ecology, genomics and computer modeling) and data from a broad geographic scale. Specifically, (1) plasticity and (2) adaptation for migratory timing will be estimated and (3) the molecular basis of this trait will be examined. Estimates of plasticity and adaptation will then be (4) integrated into models predicting how populations will respond to climate change and specific conservation strategies being proposed for this group. The species chosen for this work already shows advances in their migratory timing, but these advances are weaker in populations that breed further north. This trend could relate to the fact that environmental conditions on the breeding grounds are less predictable for northern breeders and is a question this project will address. Results from this project will be relevant to many fields (e.g., genetics, behavior and evolution) and the predictive framework can be used for other systems, traits and environmental variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past results have emphasized the need for addressing multimodal integration in a domain-specific manner. For instance, cardiac rehabilitation is a diverse range of practices for restoring individual's functioning. Unfortunately, only 30% - 40% of patients report regular exercise at six months after discharge and 39%-45% of these patients suffer from at least one readmission within one year. These poor outcomes motivate the need for  using technology for remote monitoring in this multi-modal system.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how multiple cardiac experts view multimodal data, decide on the progress, and the variations/biases among the experts' views and decisions. This understanding would help us design and build a multimodal visualization and progress-tracking system that can provide meaningful information to stakeholders. Though the proposed algorithms for multimodal data analysis are tightly tied to the biomedical domain, the derived knowledge and understanding would be useful to other domains using multimodal sensing. Results, metrics, and algorithms from this research will be published widely in high-quality academic journals and conference proceedings.<br/><br/>Integrating, visualizing and tracking progress using multimodal data is highly domain dependent. In this project, cardiac tele-rehabilitation deployed in-home is the target domain, generating multimodal data, with their diverse data characteristics and varied timeframes. Research challenges in domain-specific multimodal integration typically include the characteristics of the multimodal data as well as the domain-specific needs. For multimodal integration for cardiac rehabilitation, the challenges include: (i) Integrating the multimodal data with diverse types of data with varying temporal characteristics to find relationships among potential adverse events; and, (ii) Possibilities for using mobile and wearable sensors to provide opportunities for personalization both in the rehabilitation and in the multimodal data integration.

The testing bottleneck in the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a resurgence of interest in group testing, where several people's biological samples are mixed together and examined in a single test. When the rate of infection in the population is low, this method can significantly reduce the total number of tests per subject and increase the throughput of the existing testing infrastructure. However, traditional group testing has the following limitations: First, efficient group testing based methods for the estimation of prevalence have been largely overlooked in the literature. Second, traditional group testing usually assumes that the testing results are qualitative (positive versus negative), not quantitative (providing viral load information). Third, the theoretical study of group testing rarely takes practical constraints, such as the sensitivity of the pooled tests and the dilution effect, into consideration, which hinders the applicability of the testing schemes in practice. The goal of this project is to overcome these limitations of traditional group testing and design advanced pooled testing strategies for efficient prevalence tracking and accurate infection diagnosis. It will develop optimized pooled testing strategies with strong theoretical performance guarantees yet feasible and cost-effective in practice.<br/><br/>The proposed research is organized in three research thrusts as follows. Thrust 1 aims to design effective sampling and testing algorithms to estimate the prevalence in communities and track its evolution, under scarce testing resource constraints. Thrust 2 focuses on the design of optimized pooling and decoding algorithms for compressed sensing based (COVID-19) virus diagnostic testing. Thrust 3 validates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed pooled testing through experiments on anonymized COVID-19 samples. This project bridges group testing and online learning, the two largely disconnected areas, with the objective to effectively allocate limited testing resources for efficient prevalence tracking. Such integration leads to novel sampling strategies, broadens the paradigm of group testing, and advances the state of the art of online learning. Moreover, the proposed compressed sensing based diagnostic testing leverages quantitative measurements provided by advanced testing technologies, which can significantly increase test throughput, reduce the number of needed tests, decrease the consumption of scarce reagents, and provide results robust against observation noises and outliers. The rich compressed sensing theory provides possible approaches to the rigorous mathematical certification of the correctness of the decoded results. Besides, the clinical constraints on pooled testing also lead to novel problem formulation and theoretical characterization, enriching the study of compressed sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The engineering of gut-associated microbial consortia can hold the key to the development of these new technologies. While microbiome science is often discussed in the context of human health, the impact of microorganisms on animals is much more pronounced, especially in the context of high-intensity farming such as aquaculture ? one of the main sources of high-quality protein and fat for humans. Given the enormous relevance of aquaculture in the economy and nutrition of many nations, it is imperative to develop strategies to control microbiome composition and function, in order to maintain and increase productivity in a sustainable manner. In this project, synthetic microbiomes will be constructed to increase feed efficiency in the brine shrimp, Artemia salina, and prevent infection by a bacterial pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which is responsible for great losses from disease in aquaculture worldwide. Furthermore, a two-pronged bridge program partnering Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of Central Florida with Ecuador?s National Center for Aquaculture and Marine Research (CENAIM) will be created. The bridge program will directly further the development of sustainable aquaculture methods while protecting marine biodiversity and ecosystems and will provide a critical translational avenue to test the results of this work in large-scale, real-world settings. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the research. <br/><br/>Microbiome engineering is an emerging field and the ability to design and construct multispecies systems from isolates is currently limited. This project leverages research on marine bacterial communities and environmental pathogens to design synthetic microbial consortia that maximize feed efficiency and prevent pathogen colonization in aquaculture ? a major source of edible protein for humans. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop standardized animal microbiomes that could be used to increase animal production and well-being by synergistically controlling the interaction between feed efficiency and pathogen colonization. Underlying this project, a novel framework, based on ?ecological modules? of organisms that could be mix-and-matched to obtain a desired functionality, will be used to design synthetic consortia. The investigators have already established two key ecological modules that are ubiquitous in communities that degrade complex organic matter in the ocean and have amassed a large strain collection with a wide range of metabolic capabilities. Synthetic consortia will be built from this collection by combining different primary degraders and secondary consumers to modulate host diet and deter pathogen colonization using a model system consisting of the brine shrimp, Artemia salina, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a bacterial pathogen of enormous impact in aquaculture worldwide. Overall, this research will generate an experimental platform to design synthetic communities using modules assembled from natural isolates for desired functionalities and may provide insight into microbiome assembly and formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This enables low-power and ADC-free architectures, supporting scaling to large MIMO arrays. The code-domain radar signals will be processed at Gigahertz rates in the analog domain using cross-correlators that operate using a margin-propagation paradigm, resulting in lower power and compute latency. A compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture reduces the data transfer between the high-speed memory and the correlator sub-systems. The proposed approach is expected to achieve a 10-100x reduction in power consumption, and 5x lower compute-time per frame compared to conventional radar systems.

Robots that can collaborate have shown great potential in many applications from search and rescue missions to precision agriculture. Due to limited sensing, communication, and processing capabilities, autonomous robots in a collaborating group often need to make collective decisions through communications in proximity. For example, exchanging sensing data or control commands with neighboring robots through range-constrained wireless communications. The integral role of wireless communications requires robots to coordinate and react to the changing environment for reliable information sharing in addition to their original tasks. However, existing research paradigm often assumes that the communication environment is well modeled and can be pre-programmed into robotic systems for effective coordination without disruptions. This significantly limits the capabilities of robot teams and makes them vulnerable in real-world environments that can often be unpredictable. To address the challenges, this project seeks to create a set of methods and tools that may augment many multi-robot coordination tasks, by enabling robots to learn the environment on the fly, adapt their motion to environmental changes, and maintain communications when unexpected robot failures happen. The project will also support education and outreach activities such as curriculum development, broadening participation of students from underrepresented groups, and local community engagement in the Charlotte metropolitan area.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to create novel methods and algorithms that enable the co-design of learning, communication, and motion control for mobile robot teams.

Notable challenges include processing emotional speech and speech in noisy environments and generating speech that represents the characteristics and expressiveness of specific speakers such as personality traits, mood, prosody, and emotional state. These challenges are exacerbated by a limited availability of data. Improving such capabilities will have a wide range of social impacts ranging from giving natural voice to patients who have lost it to rendering comprehensible and speaker faithful renderings of old poor quality recordings that have become hard to understand to generating seamless speech translations in real time communications while staying faithful to the voice characteristics of the speaker. To address these challenges, the project proposes to explore and expand theories about speaker identity, emotion, and expressiveness in challenging conditions. Practically, this means studying how factors like background noise, emotions such as stress, cultural differences or other idiosyncratic ways of speaking affect a system?s ability to recognize and render faithfully the speech of a specific individual. This work will enable a second aim of this project which is to create voice technology that can be used for safeguarding ethical and responsible use of voice generation. Sophisticated voice conversion techniques can be used to detect and prevent spoofing and other fraudulent activities and make it challenging for unauthorized users to mimic or imitate target speakers. Besides security and defense other areas that will benefit from this project include security and defense, accessibility and healthcare assistive technologies, medical voice preservation, speech therapy and rehabilitations as well as entertainment and gaming.<br/><br/><br/>This award aims to develop novel algorithms utilizing deep learning techniques to advance voice conversion models with the ability to represent faithfully the characteristics and emotional states of individual speech. The project includes the following key areas of research. The first research target is to explore learning speaker identity and emotion representations for robust voice conversion with self-supervision. By investigating joint representations, this project seeks to develop a deeper understanding of how speaker characteristics and emotions can be effectively transformed. The second research target is to investigate voice conversion solutions for challenging conditions such as noisy environment, emotional speakers, and limited training to enhance the expressiveness and naturalness of the converted speech. The third research target is to investigate novel deep learning techniques for the detection of synthetic voices and joint training strategies to further improve voice conversion performance and evaluation. By exploring the synergies between transformation and detection of synthetic voices, this project has the potential to significantly impact society with a) accurate and expressive voice-based applications and b) applying the same techniques to detect when speech is naturally occurring or synthetic for the prevention of spoofing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technique also provides the research community with new 3D imaging capabilities to probe the structure and function of deep tissues noninvasively and holistically in vivo, facilitating new discoveries and development of new therapies. The approach equips 2D ultrasound imaging systems with the ability to perform 3D imaging, results in lower costs and increased accessibility, making broad and direct impact on patient care globally. In addition, the technology will provide a viable 3D imaging solution for the ultraportable, pocket ultrasound devices that are becoming increasingly popular. Since many of these devices are not used by trained sonographers, 3D imaging is particularly useful for mitigating operator dependence. As such, the technology becomes essential because it will conveniently enable 3D imaging for the ultraportable at-home ultrasound market. <br/><br/>The proposed project presents a highly practical and cost-effective solution to democratize ultrafast 3D ultrasound imaging because it instantly converts existing 2D ultrafast ultrasound imaging systems into 3D-capable devices. The technology addresses the market needs of 3D imaging by working with existing ultrasound systems and probes, lowering financial barriers for new users, breaking existing technical barriers of 3D ultrasound imaging, and enabling advanced imaging modalities that are not possible with conventional techniques. The research objective of this PFI-RP project is to conduct use-inspired research to overcome the knowledge gaps and technical challenges of the 3D imaging technique, making this technology ready to be transferred to the commercial ultrasound market. The proposed project will improve various components of devices to improve imaging quality. The proposal will also develop automated calibration and synchronization methods to facilitate streamlined user experience. Designated control hardware and software interface will be developed for integration with commercial ultrasound systems. Finally, in vivo animal imaging studies will be conducted to evaluate the imaging performance of the new 3D imaging device. Successful completion of this project will culminate in a commercially viable 3D imaging technology that is poised for immediate commercialization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project studies and develops discrete structures arising from the interplay between combinatorics and algebraic geometry. Additionally, the interdisciplinary potential of combinatorics is utilized in two ways. First, to study the complexity of a model from machine learning using a recent geometric rephrasing. Second, to develop an algorithm used to help identify novel complex genetic structures driving health and longevity outcomes in humans.

Such well-designed knowledge assessments, vetted by rigorous design and psychometric processes, are still relatively uncommon in the computer science education community. Moreover, students learn computing concepts in a variety of increasingly different educational contexts: at home, on the job, in a course offered online, or in a traditional classroom. Thus, there is a pressing need for an empirically validated assessment of computing knowledge that works in a variety of educational contexts and with different programming languages. The goal of this project is to design and pilot such a multi-contextual and multi-language assessment by enhancing the existing Second Computer Science 1 (SCS1) course assessment. <br/><br/>The new assessment, referred to as SCS1++, will be designed by addressing known issues with the existing SCS1 assessment while also increasing the number of questions on the assessment. Specifically, the project will (1) construct a coherent argument for validity claims of SCS1++ as a whole; and (2) create subscales aligned with the concepts on the assessment to improve the assessment?s formative values. The project will directly inform the research on equitable CS assessment by updating the current SCS1 with improved questions and rigorous validation using advanced psychometric tools. A design-based research approach will be used, based on theory, and the system will be evaluated in real educational settings.

While techniques do exist to ensure such isolation, they typically increase the engineering burden on programmers or trade off performance for security, limiting their effectiveness and reach. Today, programmers are deploying code on shared computing infrastructure in increasingly fine-grained units (e.g., serverless computing), making this trade off more severe over time. The off-the-shelf technologies, such as containers that isolation frameworks are often built on, were not designed for this fine-grained use case. This project thus aims to ensure both performance and security for code running on cloud infrastructure by designing new isolation mechanisms from the ground up using novel operating system, compiler, programming language, and virtualization technologies. The project will help produce more robust cloud computing infrastructure that is less susceptible to attack, less likely to leak sensitive user data, and more productive for programmers. If successful, potential impacts include reduced economic losses from compromised infrastructure, strengthened national security, and increased privacy for the broader public using cloud services. The project will also make contributions in education and broadening participation in the computing profession by enhancing educational content, injecting industry-relevant and applied content into the curriculum, increasing the representation of people from diverse backgrounds in computer systems research, revitalizing the computer systems curriculum at the PI?s institution, and fostering undergraduate research engagement. <br/><br/>This project proposes Colony, a new software framework for lightweight, bespoke, virtualized execution contexts. Colony leverages novel execution abstractions customized for individual applications and designed for both performance and isolation. Colony contexts are synthesized using compiler analyses, and are exposed through a rich set of programming abstractions and programming language extensions. Colony builds on a new abstraction for isolated function execution, the virtualized subroutine, or virtine, along with an embeddable hypervisor. The goal of the Colony project is to achieve both high performance and strong isolation for individually isolated function contexts in a variety of applications. The project will explore various mechanisms to enable bespoke contexts, including virtualization mechanisms enhanced for optimized start-up performance, and programming models with novel language/compiler support. These bespoke contexts can be used for lighter-weight isolation than managed languages, giving them broad applicability to areas such as OS kernel drivers, third-party libraries, and database user-defined functions, as well as the more nascent serverless computing paradigm. The proposed work has potential to open up new lines of research in operating systems, virtualization, compilers, and system security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, in scientific and industrial applications ? from polymer recycling to 3D printing ? measuring a material?s response to repeated pushing and pulling is a good way to predict its performance. Despite the usefulness of these tests, however, there is no universal way of to interpret their results. This project will show that systematically tweaking the deformation cycle and analyzing the resulting changes can lead to new insights into a material?s behavior in a broad range of processes. The scientific tools developed for this project will have implications in other engineering disciplines where analogous ?push-and-pull? tests are applied, including signal processing, process controls, and electrical circuits. Finally, this award will support outreach efforts in STEM education for high school students. In partnership with programs at UCLA, a high school students from the Los Angeles and Inglewood Unified School districts will receive training in computer literacy and scientific computing, including applications related to the project's research. <br/><br/>Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) flows are widely used by industry for material characterization of complex fluids, from commodity polyolefins to next-generation 3D printing gels. In principle, LAOS data contains valuable information about the structure and composition of a fluid, but the quantitative interpretation of experimental LAOS measurements is still an active area of research. This project will generalize the concept of parallel superposition rheology to LAOS flows, allowing a complete characterization of the material?s linear response function for perturbations about a base LAOS deformation cycle. This linear response function can be formulated as a harmonic transfer matrix (HTM), and preliminary data suggests that the HTM can be useful for both fundamental material characterization and prediction of shear banding flow instabilities. Overall, our proposed research will deploy a combination of theoretical, computational, and experimental tools to formalize and validate this new approach to LAOS banding stability analysis, develop interpretive frameworks for quantitative material characterization, and explain distinctions in the underlying bifurcation structure of steady and oscillatory shear banding flow instabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Evidence suggests that the newer wave of automation in manufacturing is not so much to replace workers but rather to complement human work to increase precision, safety, and product quality. Yet, U.S. manufacturers are not adequately addressing the changing nature of skill requirements which is anticipated to leave 2.4 million manufacturing jobs unfilled by 2030. This project will address the urgent need for breakthrough technologies that enable workplace-based learning and rapid upskilling of the manufacturing workforce on complex, cognitively demanding, and hard-to-automate tasks. The project will focus on precision machining and inspection in the aviation industry as the specific work context for building and validating the IXR technologies, which is also expected to inform the technology development in other industries such as medical, automotive, semiconductor, and defense. The convergent research team will create new technological pathways to enable intelligent worker-XR teaming and advance the fundamental understanding of its impacts on labor economy and worker learning and innovation. This project aims to create new perspectives, methods, and discoveries to unleash the full potential of America?s manufacturing workforce,  and as such, strengthen national prosperity and economic competitiveness in precision manufacturing.<br/><br/>This project brings together several disciplines, including engineering, learning sciences, social sciences, economics, computer sciences, psychology, and workforce development. The investigator team is structured to achieve multiple convergent goals across the three dimensions of the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier: (1) The Future Work dimension will investigate the changes in employer skill requirements for precision manufacturing including education, years of experience, and actual skills, using a proprietary database of 160 million online job vacancies. Expert interviews, firm-level surveys, and in-depth case studies will investigate training and upskilling practices for incumbent and entry-level workers, explore accessibility of the IXR approach for certain groups of workers and firms, and identify economic barriers and opportunities for adopting the IXR technology. (2) The Future Technology dimension will advance the fundamental understanding of how new sources of multimodal data captured by XR devices, digital thread, IoT, and cloud-based analytics can be harnessed to interpret, predict, and guide the behavior of precision manufacturing workers. A novel IXR technology will be built and validated that adapts the scientific methods of computer vision, natural language understanding, and inference engines to provide intuitive and personalized assistance to workers performing complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks. (3) The Future Worker dimension will generate new knowledge about the affordances of worker-XR teaming to support the development of workers? adaptive expertise for increasingly complex manufacturing tasks, building on research from the learning sciences that examines cognitive processes associated with complex reasoning and problem solving. It is expected that the knowledge generated in this project will elicit new pathways for the design of future collaborative human-technology systems for training adult workers beyond XR.

RDCs operate through the injection of an air-fuel mixture which is detonated through a reactive shock wave rotating at supersonic speeds and fed through the mixer to cool and slow the flow before it reaches a turbine which ultimately harnesses the energy.  RDC-mixers hold great promise to revolutionize power and propulsion systems, but they are difficult to model/optimize due to unsteady mixing, extreme temperatures, and high-speed diffusion.  This collaborative project aims to develop models and methodologies that enable optimization of the RDC-mixer for maximal fuel efficiency.  The investigators will leverage a three-pronged meta-modeling framework featuring an innovative digital twin, a novel statistical surrogate model, and a physical experiment involving a high speed wind tunnel in which the mixer will be assessed through high-frequency optical and probe-based measurement techniques.  RDC-mixer-turbine systems are directly impactful to clean energy and heat production, but their potential impact is even broader. Diffusing elements and mixers are used in a variety of applications, ranging from aviation, aerospace, agriculture, refrigeration cycles and heat exchangers. The mathematical modeling foundations developed in this project will be widely applicable to computer simulation experiments and digital twins. <br/><br/>This project is organized into three aims. First, motivated by the complexities of the digital twin, a gradient-enhanced Bayesian deep Gaussian process surrogate will be developed to provide non-stationary flexibility, uncertainty quantification, gradient-enhancement for improved accuracy, and gradient predictions to facilitate Bayesian optimization.  Second, the digital twin of the RDC-mixer will be developed at reduced computational costs as existing simulations of RDC-mixers require weeks of compute time.  Tailored unsteady boundary conditions are proposed to separate the computational fluid dynamic simulations for the combustor and mixer, which will enable faster computation.  The digital twin will incorporate steady and unsteady flows, meshing, and adjoint solvers to provide gradient information at minimal cost.  Third, a novel calibrated Bayesian optimization framework will be developed to first optimize calibration parameters of the digital twin, then use these with a bias-correction model to sequentially optimize the physical experiment. The physical model will be used in the calibration feedback loop to train the bias-correction model and to test and validate the best designs.  Collectively, the surrogate model, digital twin, and physical experiment will enable effective optimization of the RDC-mixer design for optimal fuel efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The colloidal particles are often suspended in flow through a porous medium in these applications.  These flows also produce variations in the concentration of a solute such as a salinity gradient in coastal zones or a contaminant gradient in soil near a discharge.  This project will use a combination of experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling to determine the effects of chemical gradients on the motion of colloids in porous media. The project will integrate research with education and outreach activities, involving high-school and undergraduate students in museum demonstrations of experimental modules related to microplastic spreading in soil, synthetic trees, and extraction of energy from salinity gradients. <br/><br/>Predicting and controlling the transport of colloids in porous media is essential in a broad range of problems from filtration and wastewater treatment to contaminant spreading and remediation in subsurface flows. Colloids in these environments are often exposed to chemical gradients, which can lead to their diffusiophoretic migration. This project will use experiments, simulations, and modeling to systematically probe the role of flow velocity disorder, solute gradients, and the 2D/3D nature of the problem on the dispersion and transport of colloids through porous media. This is a multiscale problem, from the nanometric Debye layer next to solid surfaces, where surface charge and zeta potential impacts the diffusioosmotic flows, to the macroscopic dispersion of colloids over the scale of the porous medium. The combination of experiments and simulations probe a wide range of length and timescales, isolating and highlighting the role of key physicochemical ingredients such as surface properties at the nanoscale on the dispersion of colloids at macroscopic scales. Results will advance our fundamental understanding of colloid transport in porous media and lead to predictive models that describe, control, and guide colloids in the presence of flow and solute gradients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite more than 5,000 authors publishing refactoring papers in the last two decades, refactoring researchers, students, and new community members lack publicly available refactoring benchmarks, tools, and datasets. They must frequently replicate existing refactoring research from scratch ? this wastes time, effort, and introduces threats to validity. The project's novelties are to create and disseminate a repository of software refactoring-related artifacts and online tools, to enable refactoring as a service, sufficient to support rigorous empirical studies and experiments with the detection, prioritization, repair, testing, and documentation of software quality issues across a broad community of researchers, educators, software engineers, and STEM researchers. The project's impacts relate to issues of great economic impact: large software companies spend millions of dollars yearly to reduce the technical debt through refactoring. The publicly-released infrastructure will support the transition of refactoring research into practice and will enable STEM researchers to better maintain their software prototypes as these inevitably decay. The proposed infrastructure REFCRI will be a catalyst for revamping software engineering courses at many universities to emphasize real-world examples of refactoring and will offer tremendous education resources for practitioners. The investigators will organize workshops on the platform to foster a thriving community.<br/><br/>The investigators will curate a repository of refactoring data sets via data pre-processing techniques to (i) clean the data, and (ii) check its coverage and diversity. The team of this project will release an API to allow the refactoring community to easily upload datasets, refactoring teaching examples/tutorials, tools, and publications. The data sets will serve as benchmarks that enable researchers to validate new tools and will enable new empirical studies in the field of software engineering. The data sets will provide realistic training examples and tools to enhance the integration of refactoring into software engineering curricula and will serve as a tremendous educational resource for practitioners. The investigators will integrate and orchestrate (based on Kubernetes) multiple tools covering the whole lifecycle of refactoring by automatically transforming the inputs/outputs of existing tools into generic data processing formats and packaging tools as Docker images. They will make existing refactoring tools easy to configure, execute, and integrate. REFCRI will re-implement several refactoring tools, from papers and repositories, as services in the cloud. The investigators will first automatically mine millions of examples of refactorings that open-source developers applied manually and then they will use them to recommend and synthesize new refactorings-by-example to support Python and other data science languages widely used by the STEM community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simultaneously, prospective homebuyers are faced with rising costs and fierce competition for housing ? with aging adults, veterans, minorities, and low-income families hit hardest by rising home prices. This project seeks to understand how people assign value in these types of transactions (wages, homebuying), focusing on how individuals respond to competition and market changes. The project team is partnering with financial education programs on money management and first-time homebuyers to understand how differences between people ? such as their tolerance for risks or willingness to delay purchases until a future date ? predict their success on job and housing markets. The findings will allow us to better understand the psychology of value, create educational resources to help people adopt better strategies for finding jobs or housing, and identify public policy interventions that can alleviate housing and labor shortages.<br/><br/>Across a series of experiments, this project tests computational models of pricing in multi-alternative, multi-attribute settings. These experiments manipulate simulated market competitiveness, delays, risks, and attributes of the choice alternatives in order to examine the dynamics of price-setting among individuals and test the cognitive mechanisms of pricing models. To improve the accessibility and efficiency of pricing model fitting and comparison, the project embeds them in neural networks trained to map observed pricing data onto generative model parameters. These will be added to online tools, teaching materials, and workshops to make them widely available. The pricing models will be used to estimate risk and delay aversion, bias, and pricing dynamics in multi-alternative choice experiments.

Measurements of ocean properties under ice shelves are needed to improve global predictions of sea level rise and to anticipate its societal consequences. Such measurements, however, are challenging to obtain. In this  Ideas Lab: Engineering Technologies to Advance Underwater Sciences (ETAUS) project, a proof-of-concept mothership-and-passenger system will be developed to permit the future deployment of a highly capable, autonomous underwater vehicle (the mothership), programmed to travel as far as safely possible under ice shelves to release a swarm of novel, low-cost passenger robots that will coordinate to explore further into the ice cavity. The hardware prototypes, networked communication systems and protocols, and coordination algorithms developed as part of this project?s mothership-and-passenger system will help advance the field of underwater exploration in confined and hard-to-reach environments. The project will also foster the training of future scientists and engineers by engaging youths from small fishing communities in Oregon through presentations at Oregon?s MATE ROV Regional Competition, by employing high-school interns through the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering (ASE) Summer Academy Program, and by training multiple undergraduate and graduate students at participating institutions.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a mothership-and-passenger sampling system to reach difficult-to-access glacier grounding zones via the open ocean to measure the extent of ice cavities and surrounding water properties. The project will innovate along three main areas of inquiry: 1) passenger robot design, 2) acoustic communication protocols and hardware, and 3) mothership-and-passenger coordination algorithms. Novel, low-cost passenger robots will be conceived that can switch through different operation modes to optimize maneuverability, power consumption, or a combination of both, as needed for various tasks throughout a deployment. Acoustic communication protocols and hardware will be developed to prioritize robust communication between passenger robots over throughput and permit swarm self-localization by utilizing time-of-flight and angle-of-arrival between passengers to estimate relative positions. Swarm coordination algorithms will be designed to estimate flow direction and strength from the passenger robots? relative positions to optimize navigation and power consumption. The performance of the network will be tested in increasingly challenging environments, i.e., tests will be conducted in a pool, an unfrozen lake, and finally in a frozen lake, while network capabilities with a larger swarm will be modeled to ensure the scalability of the system to ocean deployments. Finally, the software developed for the mothership-and-passenger communication and self-localization protocols will be generalizable and made available open-source to allow other research teams to adapt the system to their own needs. The mothership-and-passenger sampling system will not only advance under-ice-observation capabilities but also have wider oceanographic applications such as detection and monitoring of underwater harmful algal blooms or anoxic events threatening fisheries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be achieved by creating a unified framework that blends fast transients with slow dynamics and selecting dynamics through transformation, simplification, and numerical methods. The intellectual merits of the project include establishing a unified symbolic framework for device- and system-level modeling, developing advanced analytical methods for stability analysis, and creating efficient simulation algorithms, all aimed at improving grid simulations under complex, multi-timescale dynamics. The broader impacts of the project include enhancing open-source infrastructures for power engineering research and education, cultivating public interest and knowledge of renewable energy through innovative outreach programs, and engaging underrepresented students with hands-on experiences in renewable energy technologies.<br/><br/>The large-scale integration of converters and IBRs has significantly impacted power system dynamics.

This project aims to understand how network transients, switched converters, and electromechanical dynamics can be uniformly modeled, rigorously analyzed, and efficiently simulated. Specifically, the project will 1) establish a symbolic framework for formulating component dynamics by switched differential algebraic equations (DAE), which will enable the transformation and simplification of models in a principled manner; 2) establish analytical methods to characterize the oscillatory properties of small-signal models, including assessing the impact of uncertainty on eigenvalues and timescale separation; and 3) develop efficient simulation methods for switched DAE problems in both the time domain and dynamic phasor domain, creating algorithms that leverage the properties of the mathematical models to speed up computations while maintaining accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the advancement of process sensing, the Internet of Things, data analytics and cloud computing, more manufacturing plants are favoring predictive maintenance over traditional preventive maintenance. Predictive maintenance involves monitoring and predicting machine tool condition and performance. It avoids unnecessary maintenance and prevents catastrophic failure of machine tools, thereby saving operational costs and improving production reliability. However, there are barriers to fully implement predictive maintenance such as insufficient accuracy and reliability of machine tool anomaly or fault detection by existing techniques. This award supports fundamental research on designing a next-generation process sensing-machine learning architecture for capturing manufacturing process dynamics that reveals the underlying dependency of product quality on process settings and machine conditions. This research engages industry in assessing the performance and scalability of this novel machine tool health-monitoring technique at actual manufacturing plants, with the outcomes offering a competitive edge to the U.S. manufacturing sector in the global market. The research involves disciplines such as advanced manufacturing, sensor networks, machine learning, and computing. Knowledge gained is applied to developing manufacturing curricula to equip the next generation of engineers with new skills in manufacturing and data sciences.<br/><br/>This project advances the fundamental understanding of complex manufacturing process dynamics for root cause analysis of process sensing variation and detection of machine anomaly occurrences, through discovering the process-observation causal relationships by an innovative machine learning technique. To improve the trustworthiness and computational efficiency of data-driven analysis and decision making in actual manufacturing plants, a next-generation process sensing-machine learning architecture is designed with capabilities in: 1) high-accuracy modeling and high-efficiency computation upon an optimal architecture without extensive manual tuning; 2) physically interpretable discovery of system input-output causal relationships and process dynamics through the integration of model training with manufacturing domain knowledge; 3) allowing for modeling from unbalanced data and incremental learning from evolving machine conditions without repeated model training for robust and scalable anomaly detection. A physically interpretable convolutional neural network with automated architecture search is developed to correlate process parameters, multivariate sensing data (e.g., force, vibration, power), and part quality specifications (e.g., strength, surface quality) that are acquired from turning and milling processes. The discovered relationships are then diagnosed by an incremental sparse classifier for machine fault detection and classification. The outcomes from this project establish a scientific foundation for the systemic realization of machine tool anomaly detection and predictive maintenance that is not achievable with existing techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This risk assessment score is then used by juvenile justice practitioners to inform how to intervene with a youth to prevent reoffending (e.g., referring youth to a community-based program vs. placing a youth in a juvenile correctional center). Unfortunately, most risk assessment systems lack transparency and often the reasons why a youth received a particular score are unclear. Moreover, how these scores are used in the decision-making process is sometimes not well understood by families and youth affected by such decisions. This possibility is problematic because it can hinder individuals' buy-in to the intervention recommended by the risk assessment as well as mask potential error in those scores (e.g., if youth have risk scores driven by a particular item on the assessment). To address this issue, project researchers will develop automated, computer-generated explanations for these risk scores aimed at explaining how these scores were produced. Investigators will then test whether these better-explained risk scores help youth and juvenile justice decision makers understand the risk score a youth is given. In addition, the team of researchers will investigate whether these risk scores are working equally well for different groups of youth (for example, equally well for boys and for girls) and identify any potential errors in how they are being used in an effort to understand how equitable the decision making process is for the range of youth involved in juvenile justice. The project is embedded within the juvenile justice system and aims to evaluate how real stakeholders understand how the risk scores are generated and used within that system based on actual juvenile justice system data.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project aims to understand how risk assessment scores are currently being used in the juvenile justice system and how interpretable machine learning methods can be used to make black-box risk assessment algorithms more transparent (without reverse engineering them given that most assessments are proprietary). The team of researchers endeavor to understand the way that juvenile justice risk scores are being used through the analysis of quantitative data from the juvenile justice system (which details the risk scores and justice system decisions) and through qualitative data collected via key informant interviews. In the second phase of the work, the team of researchers will train various interpretable machine learning algorithms to predict youth's risk scores (which are currently generated by a proprietary, black-box algorithm). The team will also predict the sentencing dispositions for youth based on these risk scores and other pertinent data collected by the juvenile justice system. The project team will then test and measure how understandable a series of the automated explanations derived from these machine learning methods are to youth, families, judges and probation officers. The goal of this step will be to identify algorithms that are highly predictive of the risk score and dispositions, respectively and then to identify methods that provide clear, human-interpretable explanations of the risk and dispositions to key stakeholders throughout the process. This step will also allow researchers to optimize methods for explaining outcomes by possibly identifying one method that is more understandable for explaining risk scores to youth compared to another method that is more understandable for their families or probation officers, for example. Finally, the project team will also explore the potential for error throughout the process (from risk scoring to the use of the scores) and ways in which these interpretable algorithms can be used to help identify, quantify and mitigate challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems are increasingly crucial as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques become pervasive across various fields, including climate modeling, drug discovery, and physics simulations, significantly expanding the need for computational power and data management. However, the existing HPC infrastructures face challenges with extended job wait times and suboptimal resource use, primarily due to the escalating complexity of computations and the burgeoning demands for resources. Unlike traditional HPC tasks, AI algorithms and models exhibit distinct resource requirements, often resulting in either excess or insufficient resource allocation for AI tasks. This project aims to bridge the gap between HPC resource provisioning and AI application demands through an in-depth analysis of resource allocation and utilization within HPC environments running AI workloads. The goal is to identify strategies for minimizing resource waste and reducing the length of job queues by efficiently reallocating idle resources to accommodate large-scale AI tasks. By creating and disseminating datasets, models, algorithms, and system source code, this initiative will contribute valuable tools and insights to the research community. The findings will be broadly shared through research papers, technical reports, book chapters, course materials, and tutorials, enhancing the knowledge base in both HPC and AI fields and supporting the broader objectives of promoting scientific progress, improving national health, prosperity, and welfare, and contributing to national defense. <br/><br/>This project centers on advancing the efficiency and productivity of HPC systems by innovatively leveraging idle resources to expedite AI job processing and diminish waiting periods. The research is structured around three interconnected themes, each addressing critical aspects of resource utilization and AI performance enhancement within HPC environments. The initial theme undertakes a comprehensive analysis of idle resources in HPC systems, aiming to identify patterns and opportunities for resource optimization. Building on the insights gained, the second theme explores methodologies for the safe and timely harvesting of idle resources across various categories, ensuring that these resources can be reallocated without compromising system stability or performance. The third theme is dedicated to developing strategies that utilize these harvested resources to boost AI application outcomes significantly and, by extension, enhance the overall productivity of HPC operations. The project will implement a tangible HPC testbed equipped with real-world benchmarks and workloads alongside these thematic investigations. This testbed will serve as a platform for empirically validating developed algorithms and systems, facilitating a rigorous assessment of their effectiveness in improving HPC resource allocation and utilization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rare are those species that tolerate environments that fluctuate rapidly and severely. Little is known about what drives the physiological flexibility needed for species to survive and thrive in highly variable environments. This research will use genetic and physiological tools and approaches developed for North American killifish to gain an integrative understanding of how extreme physiological flexibility is assembled and how it works. Within the Fundulus genus, some species of fish are highly flexible and can adjust to huge extremes in environmental salinity, but others are much less flexible. High-flexibility species are compared to closely-related low-flexibility species, for multiple pairs of species. This comparative approach is powerful for distinguishing what makes high-flexibility species unique. Results should provide new insights into how features of the genome (variation in gene sequences, variation in genetic control elements, variation in gene content) may enable or disable physiological adjustments to extreme environmental change. One hallmark of global climate change is an increase in the frequency and severity of environmental variability, and this variability is posing yet another threat to the global biodiversity crisis. This research should provide insights into what makes some species more or less likely to do well in the face of environmental variability. This project is jointly funded by Integrative Ecological Physiology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The genomic infrastructure that supports physiological flexibility, an important form of phenotypic plasticity, is likely complex and multigenic but is poorly understood. Most aquatic species live in osmotically stable fresh or salty (marine) waters which vary little in salinity, where residents exhibit narrow limits for accommodating salinity changes and are considered ?stenohaline?. In contrast, euryhaline species can adjust their physiology to accommodate large changes in salinity; they survive and thrive in osmotically dynamic environments such as estuaries. Euryhalinity is an extraordinary and important form of phenotypic plasticity. Comparative experiments that integrate physiological, transcriptomic, and structural genomic information, will be used to reveal the mechanistic infrastructure that supports euryhalinity. The Fundulus genus of killifish includes many species of euryhaline estuarine specialists. Multiple independent radiations into fresh water have also resulted in repeated losses of euryhalinity. Physiological challenge experiments will be used, within a phylogenetic-comparative framework where independently evolved losses of plasticity in three clades provide replicated opportunities to infer the mechanisms that support plasticity that is ancestrally retained. Experiments will test the hypothesis that euryhalinity is underpinned by gene regulatory flexibility maintained and constrained by natural selection. This work will illuminate the mechanistic basis of a trait that is both physiologically important, and important in the history of vertebrate diversification. Since euryhalinity is also a compelling example of phenotypic plasticity, findings will contribute to the elaboration of a growing general theory of the mechanistic and molecular-genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Integrative Ecological Physiology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its complex folding patterns create more space for neural connections and subdivide the brain?s circuitry. Yet little is known about how these folds are created or how they shape brain function. This project examines growth rates, tensile forces, and material properties of the developing brain tissue that interact to induce and shape the patterns of brain folding. The folded mouse cerebellum will be used as the experimental system for studying these mechanical aspects of brain folding. Mouse strains with different patterns of cerebellar folding will be compared to determine how the tissue mechanics of folding are regulated differently during development. Comparison with rat cerebellar folding will additionally reveal how the mechanics are adjusted to regulate folding pattern changes between species. The project will advance the developmental and regulatory understanding of brain folding, and make fundamental contributions toward understanding neural development, improving tissue engineering, and elucidating the mechanisms underlying evolutionary brain changes. This project includes a research-based course for undergraduate students who will directly participate in the acquisition and analysis of the proposed experiments and develop their public-facing communication skills. Through a partnership with the local school district, this project will also support junior high science educators and their students by refreshing teacher science experience through hands-on participation, and the collaborative development of supplemental curricula for junior high science classes.<br/> <br/>Research into the morphogenesis of the brain has been limited due to an almost exclusive focus on the cerebral cortex, as well as the difficulty of acquiring developmental data. This proposal will meet these challenges by developing the murine cerebellum as a tractable model of brain folding. Previously, the cerebellum has been shown to undergo differential expansion at the time of folding initiation. Additionally, the cerebellum is under tension and has an outer fluid-like layer. These tissue properties are predicted to regulate folding as well as the partitioning of functional brain circuitry. Differential expansion, the predicted tunable driver of folding amount, will be analyzed in two- and three-dimensions in both wild-type and mutant strains of mice, as well as in rats. Cerebellar tension (predicted to decrease during folding progression)  will be investigated with mechanical assays that examine folding amount as well as the fibrous axonal and dendritic components potentially mediating tension. The fluidity of cerebellar tissue will be analyzed using live ex vivo imaging and pharmacological perturbations. These experiments will demonstrate how tissue-specific forces are created and regulated during development to shape the folding brain and produce the variation seen within species, and how tissue mechanics are evolutionarily modulated to set up the folding variation seen between species. More broadly, the results of this proposal will provide insight into how emergent mechanisms arise during development to impact neural tissue form and function.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Organization Program in the Neural Systems Cluster, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Erasure coding (EC) is a generalization of replication known to be more storage efficient for the same fault tolerance in theory. However, reaping the benefits of EC for geo-distributed data stores in practice poses several new scientific challenges. The overarching goal of this project is to address these challenges by developing a comprehensive understanding of the response time vs. cost trade-off for EC-based consistent geo-distributed stores. The research will be conducted in the following four thrusts: (i) development of EC techniques and distributed algorithms to satisfy consistency criteria known as eventual and causal consistency, (ii) development of efficient, EC-compatible reconfiguration algorithms that provably maintain consistency despite changes in object configurations, (ii) development of analytical models of performance and cost, and associated optimization frameworks, and (iv) integration of developed techniques into Apache Cassandra. The proposed research will be conducted in the context of the public cloud, where inter-DC latencies and pricing information are readily available allowing competing schemes to be compared in a fair manner.<br/><br/>The proposed research could lead to cost reductions for geo-distributed data stores hosted on public clouds, which are fundamental building blocks for several applications including collaborative editing, social media, financial transactions, reservation systems, and multi-player gaming. The validation plan involves experiments performed using an Apache Cassandra-based prototype that will be made open source. The prototype will serve as a testbed for other researchers and engineers to plug in their own algorithms and compare findings. The proposed research has a cross-disciplinary nature and will be supplemented with an education plan that involves development of survey articles and curricular integration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Problem settings in vaccine design, disaster response, and smuggling prevention, among others, involve decision-makers observing a system evolving over time who periodically decide whether to commit non-renewable resources, or defer their use, to optimize the system's overall performance. The evolution of the system is subject to randomness and its performance may depend on other decision makers, about whom there may be incomplete information, who seek to optimize their own performance. The research supported by this award seeks to determine what rules should guide commit or defer decisions in these settings, how and to what extent the decision-maker should use the information feedback observed, and how to computationally find the commit or defer decisions in specific problem settings. The educational activities include the creation of an online game to teach fundamentals of multistage decision-making to K-12 students.  <br/><br/>Standard commit or defer problems (CDPs) assume a single decision-maker and cannot model problems that involve multiple decision-makers, e.g., a Leader and a Follower, who interact in a hierarchical manner. This project will establish a mathematical and algorithmic framework to solve hierarchical CDPs. The framework will improve our understanding of real-life CDPs and their practical requirements. The project will simultaneously address a number of technical challenges. First, the Leader may face global resource constraints, such that the resources spent in one period, cannot be replenished in future periods; second, the Leader's performance depends on the optimal actions of the Follower; and third, the Leader learns about the uncertain parameters of the Follower's problem by observing their reaction to the Leader's actions. By using approaches at the interface of hierarchical and online optimization, the project will rigorously establish the manner by which commit or defer decisions should be made in hierarchical settings under uncertainty. Furthermore, the project will use tools from mathematical programming and probability to uncover how and to what extent the decision-maker should use the information that is learned, and then formulate and solve for optimal or near optimal policies in large instances of relevant applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerical analysts develop algorithms for simulating these systems by solving PDEs on a computer; these simulations enable engineers and scientists to develop prototypes and to interpret data from sensors. For example, the NSF-funded Nobel-winning detection of gravitational waves would not have been possible without advances in numerical analysis. In recent decades, numerical analysts discovered that ideas from differential geometry, an area of pure mathematics, can be used to develop good algorithms for solving PDEs. In fact, these ideas help not only for geometric problems in fields of study like computer vision and general relativity, but also for fields like electromagnetism that have little to do with geometry. Although applying differential geometry to numerical analysis has been very successful, thus far this link has been explored only for a small number of differential geometry ideas. In this project, the investigators will continue exploring this link, taking more ideas from differential geometry and applying them to develop new numerical algorithms. These algorithms could then be used both in applied areas, by solving PDEs in science and engineering, and in pure areas, by solving PDEs in differential geometry itself. The project will also support the training of graduate student researchers.<br/><br/>This project focuses on problems at the cusp of numerical analysis and differential geometry.  It deals specifically with the design of finite element methods for PDEs that involve vector fields and tensor fields on Riemannian manifolds.  In the long term, these efforts have the potential to lead to robust numerical methods for solving geometric PDEs like the Einstein field equations, which are useful for studying gravitational wave signals, as well as PDEs like the elasticity equations, which model how objects deform under stress. This project has three main goals. The first is to develop a new family of finite elements for discretizing algebraic curvature tensors and other bi-forms---tensor products of differential forms---on simplicial triangulations. The second goal is to develop an intrinsic finite element discretization of the Bochner Laplacian, which is a basic differential operator in Riemannian geometry that differs from the familiar Hodge Laplacian from finite element exterior calculus. The third goal is to leverage what we learn to design numerical methods for a wide range of geometric problems, such as computing spectra of elliptic operators on manifolds, simulating intrinsic geometric flows, and solving prescribed curvature problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, the network data delivery path to the compute nodes remained unchanged. As such, the current datacenter network suffers from the overhead of the multi-layered software stack, complex network protocol processing, frequent data movement, and network device management. The project novelty is to leverage hardware specialization and near-data processing to re-architect a datacenter?s network. The project's educational plans include organizing yearly outreach workshops to educate K-12 teachers on computing fundamentals, involving underrepresented, undergraduate, and low-income students in research, and integrating research into the higher-education curriculum. Such activities boost student enrollment in higher-educational institutions, train diverse students who deeply understand computer architecture and systems fundamentals, and can innovate across architecture, networking, and operating systems fields. The project?s impacts are to shape the future of datacenter networking and educate a high-quality workforce to supply the needs of the US IT industry and academia.<br/><br/>The project aims to design, implement, and evaluate a network data plane that delivers data directly from top-of-rack switch ports to the server?s Central Processing Unit (CPU) caches and memory modules, leveraging an optical interconnection network. The investigator extends the CPU Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with several network access instructions that enable a process to access the network with minimal software activity. The memory access instructions offload the notification between the CPU and the network interfaces to the hardware. The investigator develops libraries and transport protocols that utilize the proposed network data and control plane to provide robust connectivity between processes running on different servers. Lastly, the project explores the design space of domain-specific near-memory accelerators for network protocol acceleration.

The goal of this project is to advance QIS education by using virtual reality (VR) and machine learning to adaptively address misconceptions about the field. The project will directly impact the education of approximately 120 undergraduate students learning QIS and has the potential to help transform how to motivate and prepare students for future quantum workforce positions.<br/><br/>This project will leverage QubitVR, a VR application previously developed for learning foundational QIS concepts like superposition, measurement, and entanglement. As a first aim, the project will identify and predict QIS misconceptions by collecting data from a controlled, general-population study of QubitVR. This aim will include the development and validation of a new QIS Concept Introductory Test (QISCIT) for assessing learning outcomes. It will also involve labeling misconceptions in the collected data and the development and systematic evaluation of machine learning models based on VR tracking and input data for predicting when QubitVR learners are likely to have a misconception. As a second aim, the project will adaptively tutor QIS misconceptions by developing two intelligent tutoring versions of QubitVR: one that employs proactive conceptual scaffolds based on the machine learning models and one that employs reactive scaffolds based on conventional action-condition rules-based reasoning. This aim will involve one of few studies to directly compare machine learning-based and rules-based approaches to intelligent tutoring by comparing the two versions in a between-subject, general-population study. As a third aim, the project will ecologically validate the efficacy of QubitVR by collecting control, baseline, and adaptive tutoring data from undergraduate QIS courses in a longitudinal study.

Despite the great success of machine learning techniques, massive amounts of data are collected and used to train the machine learning models. The privacy of sensitive data has become a big concern. Existing efforts are still preliminary, and enormous challenges remain to be resolved. Crucially, stronger privacy protection guarantees often sacrifice important properties of machine learning models, such as predictive utility and fairness, which can be undesirable or completely unacceptable. This project develops a consolidated privacy protection framework for machine learning systems that comprehensively considers the optimal trade-offs between computational privacy and several critical properties of machine learning, including utility, fairness, and distributed learning. The project will provide a comprehensive set of tools to protect data privacy for real-world machine learning applications under different circumstances. The privacy-preserving techniques will have a transformative impact on machine learning systems used by various sectors, allowing companies and hospitals to enjoy the advantages of machine learning techniques on big data while protecting data privacy under corresponding regulations.<br/><br/>The research project thoroughly examines and discusses the real-world complicacy or restrictions when applying differential privacy, from privacy-utility trade-off, privacy-fairness relation, privacy in distributed learning, to post-learning privacy protection. The framework developed by the project takes deep root in rigorous optimization frameworks, often accompanied by theoretical guarantees and aided by cutting-edge algorithmic tools such as meta-learning, adversarial learning, and federated learning. Besides, the framework carries the following methodological innovations: differential privacy tailored to learning problems; customized privacy addressing heterogeneity in collaborative learning; privacy-protection of learned models through unlearning; consolidated privacy and fairness in learning. Those efforts will significantly augment the practicality and scalability of differential privacy. The project will be systematically evaluated on various real-world medical applications, and the tools will be readily used to tackle critical challenges in medical research.

When the organism of interest is involved in a host-pathogen interaction, ?the environment? becomes complex, including includes not only external forces, but also the conditions imposed by the interacting partner. There are also two genomes at play, each of which affects the behavior of both organisms. In addition, external environmental forces impose additional pressures, and each genome can affect how both partners respond. This project examines the role the host genome plays in altering behavior of both host and pathogen under environmental stress. It leverages an agriculturally relevant system, nematode infection of tomato. Parasitic nematodes are responsible for around $125 billion in annual crop loss worldwide with yield loss upwards of 80% for tomato. Limited control options are available, and the situation is exacerbated by an emerging concern in agriculture: the effect of warming nighttime temperatures (WNT). This unprecedented trend is causing critical challenges to crops. Broader, future impacts of this work include the development of novel approaches to examine host-pathogen interactions and how they are affected by external conditions. This then will lead to the identification of plant lines that are more resilient to both abiotic and biotic stresses. Importantly, by elucidating the molecular biology behind the parasite response to those plants under WNT, this study will go beyond merely identifying relevant host genes to contribute new insight into the mechanisms by which those genes alter the nematode biology. Understanding the nematode in addition to the plant paves the way towards targeting the parasite directly for crop improvement.<br/><br/>The goals of this project align with an overarching concern in genetics: to identify DNA variants that influence how individuals respond to their environment. Here, the concept of ?individuals? and ?environment? are complex. DNA variants in one species will be identified that, in tandem with external environmental conditions, affect how another, interacting species responds. The environmental context considered is warming nighttime temperatures (WNT), a critical, highly relevant, and current environmental concern. Genetically variable tomato plants derived from a cross between a cultivated line and a wild line will be infected with a genetically homogeneous strain of parasitic nematodes. A control experiment will also be performed with uninfected plants. These early, late, and control experiments will be carried out under two temperature regimes: normal nighttime temperatures and WNT. For each treatment combination, phenotypes related to infection and plant health will be collected, along with gene expression data for both plant and nematode. With this design, connections between DNA variants in the tomato genome and molecular responses of the nematode as well as the plant will be made, and the effect of WNT on these connections will be uncovered through via a series of genetic mapping experiments. Leveraging the connections identified in this way, more complex genotype-expression-phenotype pathways can subsequently be inferred, providing a detailed view of the molecular biology of the plant-parasite interaction response to WNT. It will also pinpoint promising candidate genes, which will be functionally validated. All project outcomes will be made publicly accessible through publications and deposition of data and resources in long-term repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consider, for example, the part of the US legal system that is devoted to handling lawsuits and resolving conflicts. The structure of the legal system includes the law itself, the attorneys, judges, and all the other people involved in bringing a lawsuit forward and ensuring that it is resolved. As a result, US companies spend a lot of funds on litigation alone.  In US colleges, administrative spending is comparable with instructional spending and has been cited as a key factor in the increasing tuition of US universities.  The continuing growth of these kinds of costs is a major challenge, but they aren't understood very well.  When these costs are studied, they are often viewed as hidden or unintended expenses that are unique to the systems in which they are found. The research supported by this grant develops a unified theoretical framework for studying regulatory mechanisms across different kinds of systems, from single cells to entire societies. The research improves society by suggesting ways to make the organization of institutions, such as companies, universities and governments, more efficient.<br/><br/>Regulatory functions and mechanisms are a necessary, essential, and ubiquitous feature across all biological, social, and mechanical systems. Bacteria have regulatory genes, companies have managers, and car engines have engine control units. Indeed, the challenge for all complex adaptive systems that aim to survive in multi-faceted and competitive environments is to optimally manage internal functions and interactions.  The presence of regulatory mechanisms in complex systems is therefore a universal rule of life, and network structures emerge under the rule of life. This grant develops a unified science of regulatory functions and their associated emergent structures to answer questions such as: What causes an increase in regulatory costs? Can we predict the amount of regulatory costs an organism or organization needs, based on its size, function, and complexity? Is it necessary to grow the administrative or regulatory functions of a system to ensure the continued functioning of the system, or is it an unnecessary burden? This research develops scientific measurements to determine the appropriate or optimal size and network structure of bureaucracy for a system to perform its tasks. The research takes place in two steps: 1) gathering and organizing datasets that span biological and social systems; and 2) using these datasets to develop a theory for regulatory structures across a wide range of systems. The theory will start from a mathematical framework that describes cost as a function of the size and complexity of a system and integrate this theory with new results and models of the functional diversity of organizations and their structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among all foods, fruits and vegetables are the ones with the highest categories of losses, with up to 50-60% of spoiled produce discarded in landfills. The proposed innovation will provide a desirable and healthy protein-fortified coating for food preservation. Moreover, the coating is washable, edible, and glossy providing an all-encompassing yet desirable food preservation solution that benefits consumers, sellers, and farmers. The proposed coating technology will enhance the window for the markets of edible coatings that focuses on the growing health- and sustainability-focused retail stores and health-conscious consumers. Other than reducing food waste and economic losses, the anticipated technology could have significant environmental impacts. For example, reducing food waste can save 25% of the freshwater supply, 3.9 billion tons of fertilizer, 300 million barrels of oil, and 135 million tons of greenhouse gases every year in the USA alone. This project will also benefit the education and training of students related to research translation.<br/><br/>The proposed project is based on the development of an eco-friendly and biodegradable protein-based nanocomposite coating that can be applied to the surface of perishable fruits and vegetables of any shape. On the lab scale, egg and soy-protein composite coatings have significantly extended the shelf life and cosmetic appearance of various fruits. However, testing on a pilot scale will provide a detailed understanding of performance and cost matrices. To fully understand the technological viability of commercializing the proposed coating, the optimum combinations of various proteins with cellulose nanomaterials, chemical modifications of proteins via selected plasticizers and crosslinkers, and easily scalable mechanisms for controlled coating methods will be explored. The coating will extend the shelf life by reducing maturation, senescence, dehydration, and microbial growth rate. The deliverables of this project will be a minimum viable product via pilot-scale studies. Overall, with an end goal of improving the environmental performance and sustainability of the food industry, the outcomes of the research will lead to the development of a protein-based inexpensive, and green coating that will enhance the shelf-life of fruits with the added benefits of biodegradability, washability, edibility, and cosmetic appearance and provide a business feasibility analysis for the potential commercialization of the product.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, the substrate an organism interacts with can pose various challenges during locomotor movements that can impact performance. Adaptations in movement require a dynamic interplay between an organisms? nervous system, anatomy, and muscle physiology, which together drive whole-body movements. However, the physiological strategies that one animal uses may not be ideally suited for a different habitat or substrate type. This research aims to understand how specialized ways of movement, more specifically, how hopping and jumping may constrain how an organism responds to instantaneous changes in the environment. Frogs and toads provide a unique model to understand variation in movement strategies. This project will investigate whole-body movement and nervous system control of muscle recruitment in response to changes in substrate stiffness. In addition, the project will investigate the mechanics and organization of tendon tissue to better understand the role of tendon stiffness in specialized forms of movement. Such unique adaptations in muscle and tendon physiology can inform the impacts of changing environments across habitats on locomotion, as well as design parameters in engineered systems dealing with environmental disturbance. The broader impacts of this research will increase research opportunities and mentorship of undergraduate students historically underrepresented in STEM, as well as enable the development of educational workshop-based trainings and resources to increase access to STEM research opportunities across the home institution. <br/><br/>Throughout history the emergence of new modes of locomotion has played a crucial role in an animal?s ability to navigate new habitats. For example, behavioral transitions between microhabitats may result in more subtle shifts in an animal?s locomotor strategy. In some cases, the locomotor system may be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the physical properties of the environment. The proposed work aims to understand how specialized ways of movement have uniquely constrained motor control strategies and muscle-tendon properties. To address this, the first aim will quantify and compare interspecific kinematic variation between the long distance, endurance hopping of Cane toads, and the fast, powerful jumps of Cuban tree frogs, in response to environmental perturbations in substrate stiffness. The second aim measures in vivo hindlimb muscle length and motor patterns in response to substrate stiffness to characterize the motor control mechanisms used by long distance endurance hoppers. The third aim seeks to characterize tendon ultrastructure by quantifying collagen fibril organization using techniques in transmission electron microscopy and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. Lastly, tendon material properties will be quantified using in vitro tendon tissue stress and strain tests to determine the role of tissue stiffness across species specialized for differing modes of locomotion and power output. The proposed research will advance understanding of how specialization in different locomotor modes can provide robust benefits or limitations at various levels of physiological organization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its appearance diverts the jet stream flow (altering nearby weather) and can contribute to extreme events like heat waves and droughts. Predicting blocking events is difficult. Our understanding of blocking events is poor, and complete theory for blocking still does not exist. The outcome of this project will advance our knowledge of blocking, which will enhance our capabilities to better forecast midlatitude weather extremes and project the response of blocking to climate change. In addition to training doctoral students, the project will develop (1) a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program with workshops focused on developing innovative teaching materials on climate science, and (2) a course to educate college students from non-geoscience quantitative majors about climate science.<br/><br/>Specifically, this proposal seeks to understand blocking dynamics and their spatiotemporal variability as well as their response to climate change. The research objectives are to: (1) assess the role of positive eddy-blocking feedback mechanism in blocking persistence, (2) evaluate the impact of large-scale circulation on blocking characteristics, (3) examine the impact of climate change to blocking, and (4) investigate the roles of latent heating in the previous objectives. The research approach includes an innovative use of the linear response function theory, Buckingham-pi scale analysis, and wavelet analysis in a hierarchy of models, from dry/moist two-layer quasi-geostrophic to dry/moist idealized general circulation models (GCMs) to large-ensemble simulations from fully coupled GCMs. The RET program will provide 7 research positions for high-school science teachers, who will develop introductory lessons on climate change. These lessons will be shared with 100s of science teachers through workshops and other venues and will be taught to 10000s of Houston public school students, many from the underrepresented groups. The developed class will result in novel materials for introducing climate science/research to a broad group of STEM students, strengthening efforts aimed at training a skilled future workforce in climate science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
