The investigator will study a knot?s properties defined by its quantum invariants, constructed by summing over weighted ?states? of the knot. The project aims to recover certain quantum invariants of a knot by assigning classical objects to each weight and state. This will, in a way, make precise the idea of quantum mechanical theories and classical theories predicting the same physical phenomena at large scale. In the long-term, the investigator will apply the results toward the goal of developing new theories governing the behavior of knots. For the broader impacts of the project, the investigator will recruit talented undergraduate students at Texas State University to work on summer research that directly contributes to the research program and train them to disseminate their work to the local community. The summer program will culminate in an annual quantum topology conference at Texas State University to support network development for early career mathematicians, that broadly includes graduate students and postdocs working in quantum topology in the United States.<br/><br/>The project will proceed along three main lines of inquiry, where the first component investigates the simplification of a presentation of the Khovanov homology of torus links with the aim of giving a general decomposition of the colored Jones polynomial, the decategorification of colored Khovanov homology. With her collaborators the investigator will apply the formula for the decomposition to study the volume conjecture of a subfamily of highly-twisted alternating links. The second component will generalize Garoufalidis? Jones slope conjecture to include surfaces in 4-dimensions and study the number-theoretical implications via Zeilberger?s machinery. The third direction of inquiry plans to recover and potentially construct new link and 3-manifold invariants from results of the first and second line of inquiries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hosts thus experience strong selection to avoid contracting an infection. This research will advance our understanding of the evolution of host strategies to avoid contact with parasites. Researchers for this project propose that hosts avoid their parasites through dispersal, the permanent movement between sites. This idea is important because it asserts that dispersal, a widespread behavior, drives rates of contact with parasites and evolves as part of hosts? defense against infection. The proposed work will use experiments and field surveys to test parasites as drivers of dispersal evolution. The project will also create educational programs that engage community college transfer students in scientific research. <br/><br/>The main idea of this work is that dispersal strategies evolve to be sensitive to infection risk. The researchers predict that hosts evolve to disperse early in an epidemic, when infection risk is low. The work will conduct experiments with a free-living nematode and its natural parasites. The researchers will track the evolution of dispersal strategies under parasite selection and identify the genetics and mechanisms of adaptation. They will also test if dispersal limits selection for other defenses. Finally, they will assess whether dispersal reduces infection risk in the wild, by observing the natural distribution of parasites. Community college students will contribute to this work through a research course at the local community college and a summer research experience for incoming transfer students. A bridge course will connect transfer students with research and provide academic support. Community college transfer students are more likely to identify as low-income and first-generation, and this work will promote their success in STEM while advancing fundamental knowledge of parasites as selective agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will address three fundamental questions aimed at advancing understanding of extreme precipitation: 1) how does the precipitation distribution depend on spatial and temporal scales? 2) what are the comparative roles of aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing in determining the precipitation distribution? and 3) how do stratospheric aerosol injections impact extreme precipitation changes? These questions are specifically motivated by the need to better understand the value of high-resolution modeling for understanding precipitation extremes, to understand if aerosol forcing can explain the discrepancy between observed and modeled changes to extreme precipitation events over the past few decades, and to understand why extreme precipitation decreases despite holding temperatures fixed in model projections of stratospheric aerosol injection. The scientific goals of this project are in line with the principal investigator?s goal to build a career around understanding precipitation extremes as they unfold over the next decades. An educational component is also integrated into this project providing research experiences for undergraduates related to the science objectives; training students on the use of data for real world problems co-identified in workshops with highway engineers; and integrating the science results into graduate and undergraduate level courses. <br/><br/>The principal investigator has previously developed a novel approach to the analysis of the precipitation distribution by defining shift and intensity modes of the distribution. The shift mode is defined as a uniform shift in the amount distribution to higher or lower intensity by a set amount, while the intensity mode is defined as an increase in the amount distribution by the same factor across intensity bins. In the context of these two modes of the precipitation distribution, this project will test the hypotheses that 1) increasing the resolution of the precipitation dataset shifts the precipitation distribution to higher intensities without changing its shape; 2) aerosol forcing over the past several decades has had a larger impact on the intensity mode of the precipitation distribution relative to the shift mode, and that this impact differs from that of greenhouse gases; and 3) stratospheric aerosol injection masks the temperature effects on the precipitation distribution, leaving only the direct response to determine the distribution change, which differs from that of the temperature response in terms of its impact on the shift and increase modes. Results of this work will be used to produce information co-designed during workshops with Northeast US highway engineers, with an integrated educational component to allow students to gain experience in addressing stakeholder needs related to precipitation extremes. In addition to supporting the principal investigator, the project requests funds for a postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, and one undergraduate student researcher each summer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the research team will create a climatology of QLCS events over the past 10+ years, including advanced weather radar information about drop sizes and shapes, that will be used alongside idealized numerical modeling to answer questions about the structure and impacts of QLCSs.

The research team will create a new database of QLCS events covering the period after the dual-polarization upgrade of the US national weather radar network.  Using a combination of Machine Learning techniques and existing software, QLCS events will be classified, their environments will be described, and polarimetric variables will be determined.  The database will be analyzed and then combined with idealized numerical simulations from Cloud Model 1 to address the hypotheses that mesovortices will be more numerous and longer-lived in high-shear environmental clusters, and that QLCS updrafts will be deeper and more intense when the QLCS environment promotes more intense cold pools via greater evaporative cooling of precipitation.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Atmosphere Cluster in the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures, however, leads these alloys to develop a serious problem known as sensitization that can eventually result in catastrophic failures. This project investigates the fundamental mechanisms controlling the sensitization process in Al-Mg, which are governed by complex atomic interactions with defects in the material?s internal structure created during manufacturing. These findings will ultimately guide the development of new material processing strategies that mitigate the sensitization process and extend the lifetime of these materials by several times their current limit. As Al-Mg alloys are already used extensively in critical transportation and energy infrastructure, this research presents immediate potential for large economic and sustainability improvements. The education and outreach efforts included in this project introduce materials science education in venues and contexts classically associated with the humanities. In an ongoing collaboration with the Cincinnati Art Museum, educational Science of Art programming is being introduced via QR-code links located alongside select objects within the museum, and a new interdisciplinary undergraduate course is being offered that uses the unique and publicly intriguing lens of sword-making to introduce fundamental concepts in physical metallurgy and materials science to undergraduates outside science and engineering majors.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project tests three major hypotheses regarding the fundamental mechanisms by which microstructural features control the nucleation and growth of grain boundary precipitates in 5xxx series Al-Mg alloys, a defect-controlled precipitation process governed by complex diffusion pathways. Precipitation of the anodic Mg-rich beta-phase along grain boundaries in these super-saturated Al-Mg alloys leads to increased susceptibility to intergranular corrosion in a process known as sensitization, which can compound over time at environmental temperatures and result in catastrophic failures. Carefully designed experiments are employed that take advantage of novel characterization techniques to make statistically relevant direct observations of the nanoscale precipitates along the grain boundaries, addressing uncertainties regarding the underlying mechanisms and diffusion modes dictating the nucleation and growth, along with the precipitate distribution?s consequent impact on the sensitization response. Establishing the contributions that specific microstructural features play in the progression of this type of precipitation, notably as a function of temperature and configuration, enables the development of new processing strategies that lower long-term sensitization response in these alloys and increase service life. This research answers pertinent questions inherent to many systems possessing detrimental nanoscale precipitates that nucleate preferentially upon defect structures, and provides critical new experimental studies exploring the interplay between microstructural elements and multi-stage diffusion pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project additionally provides opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research, and supports creation of materials for an advanced undergraduate-level modern numerical linear algebra course to be used at Harvey Mudd College (HMC) and beyond.  This course will feature significant curricular research projects which align with the technical directions identified in this project; descriptions of potential course project topics will be released with the public course materials.  The project will additionally provide vertically-integrated mentorship opportunities for visiting graduate students, HMC undergraduates, and high school students through HMC?s federally funded Upward Bound (UB) program.  Finally, the project will support an annual professional development workshop for early career participants interested in research mentorship at primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this CAREER project is the development and analysis of a suite of randomized iterative methods for problems with devastating adversarial corruption, problem constraints, and extremely large data dimension.  The project will focus specifically on three main research thrusts: (1) Developing and analyzing corruption-robust variants of randomized iterative methods in numerical linear algebra for least-squares regression, and generalizing these analyses to first-order methods in numerical optimization for a more general class of convex optimization problems. (2) Analyzing the iterative behavior of common combinatorial and numerical iterative methods for randomly sketched and subsampled regression problems with nonnegative and related constraints, and using these analyses to develop efficient randomized iterative methods for such problems.  (3) Extending the application of randomized iterative methods to problems in which both the number and size of data may be massive by developing provably effective randomly compressed and sparsified iterative updates. Open-source software implementations of the developed and analyzed methods will accompany the work completed under each of the above thrusts.

However, measuring relevant traits for many different plants using traditional methods is slow and expensive. This research will develop new methods to measure plant traits on museum specimens using leaf spectra, which characterize the way different colors of light reflect off leaves. These methods will significantly speed up trait measurements at a global scale and revolutionize our ability to understand how traits and their combinations enable plants to live in different environments. The project will train the next generation of researchers in the cutting-edge and rapidly growing area of spectroscopy. Graduate and undergraduate students will gain research experience, new course materials will be developed, and workshops on spectral biology and herbaria will provide training to scientists. A partnership with the Master of Fine Arts program at the University of Maine will result in a public exhibit.  The methods and software developed will build capacity for study of natural history collections.<br/><br/>This research will explicitly assess the evolution of function associated with independent biome shifts in two widely distributed tropical plant lineages, the Brongniartieae (Fabaceae) and Bombacoideae (Malvaceae). The project will use multivariate phylogenetic comparative method approaches to test 1) if plants in different biomes occupy different functional hypervolumes, 2) if biome shifts lead to differences in evolutionary trait dynamics, such as shifts in rates of evolution, and 3) whether plant traits and combinations of traits evolve convergently in different biomes or if certain traits enable biome shifting in the first place. New, highly sampled time-calibrated phylogenies will be generated using phylogenomic data and Bayesian analyses. Functional data will be assessed from herbarium specimens using novel machine learning models for reliably phenotyping material using spectroscopy developed in this research.

They play a major role in decomposing up to 60% of plant litter and fallen wood in these areas. During this process, termites rely on a partnership with microorganisms in their guts to help break down organic matter. In the process, some termites can also produce substantial amounts of methane that can be released into the atmosphere. There is still much uncertainty about how much methane termites release worldwide due to a lack of understanding of the processes that determine termite methane production and emission. The goals of this project are to understand the differences in methane production rate across termite species and how that relates to the microorganisms in their guts, and to estimate total methane emissions from termites across large areas using field measurements and remote sensing data. The fieldwork focuses on termites in the tropical savannas and forests of Odzala-Kokoua National Park, home to an exceptionally wide variety of termite species. The results from this project could greatly improve understanding of how much methane termites produce and how it happens, from individual species to whole colonies and larger areas, helping to fill important gaps in knowledge of termites' role in contributing to atmospheric methane. The project will train early-career scientists and engage K-12 students and the public through field, education, and museum programs in the United States and beyond, enhancing public understanding of insect ecology and their impact on the environment.<br/><br/>Researchers will conduct field surveys to assess termite populations across tropical savannas and forests in Odzala-Kokoua National Park. An incubation method will measure methane production rates across termite species, considering variations in castes, nesting behaviors, and feeding groups, followed by DNA isolation and sequencing to characterize the methanogen community in termite symbiotic systems. A mass balance approach will determine the oxidation rates of termite-produced methane across different colonies, while laboratory incubations and metagenomic analyses will assess methanotrophic activities and communities within the colonies. Field measurements of colony-level methane emissions will be integrated with high-resolution, drone-based, LiDAR remote sensing to develop algorithms for upscaling termite methane emissions to landscape scales. The data collected will be used to address: 1) How do methane production rates vary across termite species, and what are the underlying mechanisms for these variations? 2) What are the oxidation rates of termite-produced methane within colonies and surrounding soils, and what are the mechanisms driving these processes? 3) How much methane is emitted by termites across tropical savanna and forest landscapes? This project has the potential to transform knowledge of the rates and underlying processes of termite methane production and emissions, from individual species to colonies to landscapes, filling crucial knowledge gaps and advancing understanding of this overlooked yet important contribution of termites to global atmospheric methane cycling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mathematical terms, a ?group? is a collection of elements combined with an operation that links any two elements to form a third, adhering to closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility principles. A ?group action? involves applying elements of a group to another set?s elements, transforming them in structured ways, such as through rotations or reflections. These transformations are crucial in many data processing applications, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), image registration, and multi-reference alignment. Each observation in these problems involves a common, unknown signal and an unknown group element, with the primary goal being to infer both the signal and the group elements accurately. This project aims to significantly advance statistical understanding and develop effective methodologies for handling data influenced by group actions. The wide existence of such data ensures that the progress we make towards our objectives will have a great impact not only on the statistics and machine learning community but also on a much broader scientific community, including fields such as structural biology, computer vision, and signal processing. This project will have educational outcomes that result in curriculum development, teaching, and outreach activities, including activities to K-12 students through the University of Pennsylvania Data Science Academy. The project will advance applications in image recognition and time series alignment, which have broad application in areas like medical imaging.<br/><br/>This project is structured around three main aims, each designed to tackle distinct aspects of group actions. First, the PI will improve the accuracy of orbit recovery in scenarios where the prior distributions of group elements are non-uniform, developing computationally efficient procedures that are effective under realistic conditions. Second, the PI will develop theories and methods for group synchronization problems, particularly under high noise levels and in situations with incomplete data, aiming to reduce the error of group recovery and provide entrywise inference. Third, the PI will address theoretical and computational challenges in the multi-reference alignment problem, developing procedures specifically designed for the cyclic structural nature of data, thereby enabling more precise uncertainty quantification. Together, these aims will not only enhance the theoretical understanding of and the ability to analyze group actions but also lead to the development of accurate and computationally efficient algorithms designed to tackle real-world challenges in data analysis where group actions are integral.  This research project will have impacts more broadly, in that it will result in software development and in the education of technical experts. These experts will use this software to advance applications in image recognition and time series alignment, which have broad application in areas like medical imaging.  These activities will then advance applications in image recognition and time series alignment, which have broad application in areas like medical imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Market failures prevent resources, such as labor and capital, from being used in the places where they are most valuable. While it is known that market failures are a feature of all economies and contribute to income differences across countries, the question of which types of households are affected most by these market failures is much less researched. This project makes progress on this gap by developing tools to connect and analyze multiple datasets that provide an extensive set of links in the economy between households and firms, between both households and firms and the government, and between the firms themselves. Understanding which groups benefit and which groups lose out from policies that address such market failures is vital to the design of approaches that maximize the welfare of any nation. The research outcomes could be essential for researchers and decisionmakers in shaping optimal U.S. policies and potentially enhancing the wellbeing of households and businesses.  <br/><br/>This award funds a research project that develops tools to estimate distortions?markups, markdowns, and taxes that prevents resources being allocated to their best uses?at a highly disaggregated level and trace them to individuals through arbitrary trade, employment, and financial networks. This methodology is applied to administrative data, where the research team can map out the flow of goods and money for the entire economy by linking firm-to-firm networks with firm-to-consumer, firm-to-lender, and firm-to-employee networks alongside ownership registries. These methods reveal how the burden of distortions is shared among households belonging to different regions, demographic groups, skill groups, and income levels. In addition, they enable answers to various questions, such as which distortions do the most to compress and expand the distribution of living standards; what trade-offs are observed in approaches designed to improve the impacts of distortions; and to what degree overlapping distortions necessitate our wide-ranging analysis as opposed to focusing on one specific distortion or sector at a time. The theory and methods are developed in a way that they can be applied to any country with similar data. This project advances knowledge in several ways. First, it operationalizes recent theoretical work on general equilibrium models of heterogeneous agents in distorted economic environments. Second, by assembling a complete empirical mapping of economic relationships between agents in an economy, it measures the distributional impact of the main distortions that are present in an economy (those on labor, capital, output, and intermediate inputs) throughout all sectors. This is relevant because studying the impact of reducing distortions in one specific market is influenced by distortions in other markets. Thus, to fully assess the trade-offs of reducing distortions, one needs to go beyond specific distortions and specific sectors. The results have the potential to significantly reshape how economists perceive the implications of market distortions and the policies responding to them. By addressing who bears the costs and who benefits from market distortions, a key theme for decisionmakers, the findings of this research could lead to optimal policies related to market failures and enhance the welfare of the U.S. population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on topological phases of matter, a novel class of materials that conduct electricity along their edges in a way that remains unaffected by defects or noise. This makes them ideal to improve quantum computations - which are notoriously sensitive to noise. This project aims to stimulate innovations in quantum technology by unlocking a deeper understanding of how electrons behave in these materials. The project investigates how stable currents emerge between topologically distinct phases; compute their profile and their speed; and derive effective equations for their propagation. The educational component of this project seeks to inspire students by emphasizing the vital role of mathematical skills in today's professional landscape. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to organize a monthly talk series, ""Y Math?"", which features industry leaders showcasing how mathematics drives innovation across diverse fields. <br/><br/>The first research track of this project focuses on topological insulators, materials whose Hamiltonians have a spectral gap and a topologically non-trivial Fermi projector. For straight interfaces, the bulk-edge correspondence predicts that the conductance along an interface between insulating phases of matter is equal to the Hall conductance jump across the interface. The PI seeks to extend this principle to curved interfaces by extracting from the edge conductance an intersection number that accounts for the non-trivial geometry. The physical interpretation is that each connected component of the interface supports a number of edge modes equal to the Hall conductance difference. The PI also intends to compute high-frequency corrections to the bulk-edge correspondence in the continuum - where this principle is sometimes violated. The second research track of the project focuses on Weyl semimetals, three-dimensional crystals with conical intersections in their band structure. Despite an extensive physics literature, there is no known example of Schrdinger operator with Weyl points. The PI plans to show that Weyl points nonetheless appear generically in the band spectrum of Schrdinger operators in three dimensions and produce explicit examples as parity-breaking perturbations of face-centered and body-centered cubic crystals. By studying resolvent expansions for adiabatic modulations of these crystals, the PI plans to show that interfaces support topologically protected surface states: three-dimensional analogues of the robust edge states emerging between two-dimensional topological phases. These projects require tools from spectral theory, multiscale analysis and topology that will serve the mathematical community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the last few hundred years many flows emitted from either the summit or rift zones have reached the ocean. If that were to occur today, lava would cut the main highway around the island and cross the densely inhabited coastal strip. Lava flows erupted from the SW rift zone in the last 200 years reached the coast in as little as 3 hours. Future eruptions could potentially travel even faster. Lava flow hazard assessment requires accurate data on the viscosity of lava, which controls how fast it flows. These data must include the temperature range, crystallinity, and bubble content during eruptions. The UTSA HAMsTER lab recently developed a technique to measure the viscosity of erupting lava, including bubbles and crystals. However, the range of bubble and crystal contents that can be measured with this technique needs to be investigated. Lava will be collected from 4 different eruptions of Mauna Loa, and then used as starting materials for the experiments. The data will lead to better modeling of volcanic processes and lava flow hazards. These improvements will also apply to other volcanoes in the US and elsewhere. The project will support an Air Force veteran for the first two years of his PhD. Lab members will explain and demonstrate volcanoes to K-12 schools in San Antonio.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to explore the capabilities of a new technique for measuring the rheology of three-phase basaltic lava (liquid + crystals + bubbles). This technique uses a high-temperature rotational concentric cylinder rheometer, with short heating and measurement times that enable retention of original crystal textures including olivine phenocrysts, and pyroxene and plagioclase microlites. The mineralogy and CSD's of previous rheology techniques applied to basaltic lava have never adequately reproduced those found in field samples. Preliminary experiments using the new technique on lava from K?lauea have crystal size and shape distributions that are indistinguishable from samples collected in the field. These samples had much lower viscosities (by up to an order of magnitude!) than would be predicted using current rheology models that are used in lava flow modeling. Starting materials for new experiments will be lavas from Mauna Loa, including very high high crystal and bubble contents. This project will specifically (i) test what bubble contents can be retained during measurement and (ii) test current models for the rheology of three-phase suspensions. The expected contributions are (i) experimental measurements of direct relevance to future eruption hazard modeling at Mauna Loa and similar volcanoes, (ii) a unique rheological dataset for testing suspension rheology models, and (iii) validation of the range of conditions accessible to the new experimental method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The potential for snowmelt is dependent on the availability of snow and the occurrence of specific weather patterns that trigger melting. By assessing the weather patterns suitable for snowmelt, further insights can be gained into how and why rapid snowmelt occurs and what impacts can follow. Particularly in the eastern and central United States, the snowpack typically completely melts and re-accumulates multiple times per season, where the variable release of water from the snowpack can pose challenges to predicting and preparing for large and rapid events. Using historical archives of snow and meteorological data, this research aims to evaluate the physical characteristics of weather patterns that result in rapid snowmelt and assess how variations in weather conditions have contributed to variability in snowmelt in the recent past. The investigator will then assess future projections of snowmelt conditions and associated weather patterns using a suite of numerical models under multiple future scenarios. Through this project?s research and educational objectives, over 20 students per year will be actively involved in research efforts.<br/><br/>An improved understanding of the processes leading to snowmelt, the role of atmospheric circulation on regional energy balances, and the projected variability of future snowmelt conditions will better inform water resource and risk managers of potential outcomes. Such information allows for appropriate infrastructure and hazard mitigation plans to be determined for impactful snowmelt events. Synergies between research and educational objectives will further allow for the creation and dissemination of a variety of Open Educational Resources for university students that will advance STEM education beyond the investigator?s institution and facilitate the testing of additional underexplored hypotheses by students.

They play a major role in decomposing up to 60% of plant litter and fallen wood in these areas. During this process, termites rely on a partnership with microorganisms in their guts to help break down organic matter. In the process, some termites can also produce substantial amounts of methane that can be released into the atmosphere. There is still much uncertainty about how much methane termites release worldwide due to a lack of understanding of the processes that determine termite methane production and emission. The goals of this project are to understand the differences in methane production rate across termite species and how that relates to the microorganisms in their guts, and to estimate total methane emissions from termites across large areas using field measurements and remote sensing data. The fieldwork focuses on termites in the tropical savannas and forests of Odzala-Kokoua National Park, home to an exceptionally wide variety of termite species. The results from this project could greatly improve understanding of how much methane termites produce and how it happens, from individual species to whole colonies and larger areas, helping to fill important gaps in knowledge of termites' role in contributing to atmospheric methane. The project will train early-career scientists and engage K-12 students and the public through field, education, and museum programs in the United States and beyond, enhancing public understanding of insect ecology and their impact on the environment.<br/><br/>Researchers will conduct field surveys to assess termite populations across tropical savannas and forests in Odzala-Kokoua National Park. An incubation method will measure methane production rates across termite species, considering variations in castes, nesting behaviors, and feeding groups, followed by DNA isolation and sequencing to characterize the methanogen community in termite symbiotic systems. A mass balance approach will determine the oxidation rates of termite-produced methane across different colonies, while laboratory incubations and metagenomic analyses will assess methanotrophic activities and communities within the colonies. Field measurements of colony-level methane emissions will be integrated with high-resolution, drone-based, LiDAR remote sensing to develop algorithms for upscaling termite methane emissions to landscape scales. The data collected will be used to address: 1) How do methane production rates vary across termite species, and what are the underlying mechanisms for these variations? 2) What are the oxidation rates of termite-produced methane within colonies and surrounding soils, and what are the mechanisms driving these processes? 3) How much methane is emitted by termites across tropical savanna and forest landscapes? This project has the potential to transform knowledge of the rates and underlying processes of termite methane production and emissions, from individual species to colonies to landscapes, filling crucial knowledge gaps and advancing understanding of this overlooked yet important contribution of termites to global atmospheric methane cycling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This difficulty may come from not having enough detailed information about daily relationship experiences. With modern technology, like smartphones, people now track many parts of their daily lives, such as diet, exercise, and mood. This project uses similar technology to better understand romantic relationships by observing how they change day by day. It applies techniques like those used to forecast the weather or stock market trends to identify relationship patterns. These patterns help scientists learn about the different ways that relationships ebb and flow in daily life and predict which relationships are likely to last and which may not. <br/><br/>This project seeks to transform the basic scientific understanding of romantic relationship quality. It uses innovative intensive longitudinal methods with large, heterogeneous samples of individuals and couples in romantic relationship to (1) examine dynamic patterns of change in relationship quality over time and (2) identify whether some relationship patterns are more adaptive than others. For instance, patterns involving quick recovery from negative experiences might be more adaptive than those involving slow recovery. Tracking day-to-day relationship changes over long periods allows for discovery of common patterns that emerge before a relationship ends, improving predictions of relationship outcomes. In addition, examining how partners change with, view, and affect each other adds an important dyadic component to prediction models, filling a key gap in our scientific knowledge. The development and sharing of innovative statistical methods for analyzing dynamic social processes provides valuable resources for the scientific community. Broad dissemination of study findings, including through an interactive website, ensures that the findings are shared broadly. Ultimately, this project expands our knowledge of relationship science by encouraging us to view relationships in a novel way - as potentially meaningful dynamic patterns of change which informs future research and interventions aimed at promoting healthy, lasting relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Optimization algorithms empower most of the data science and machine learning technologies currently used for decision-making in several sectors, such as healthcare, energy, transportation, manufacturing, and finance. Despite its widespread adoption, there are still significant gaps between theory and practice in optimization. In some sectors, simple heuristics, e.g., stochastic gradient descent, yield incredibly effective results while lacking basic theoretical guarantees. Meanwhile, other sectors rely on traditional algorithms, e.g., interior point methods, that have strong guarantees but struggle to scale to contemporary problem sizes. The goal of this project is to advance the state of the art of optimization theory and algorithms to tackle the unique challenges posed by modern data science problems. This award integrates research efforts with activities that broaden STEM participation and expand educational opportunities; these include mentoring high school students through the Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Outreach, advising diverse group of graduate students, developing novel courses on the practice and theory of data science, and disseminating methods via open-source software to encourage broad adoption.<br/><br/>To achieve its research goal, this CAREER award will develop novel tools to analyze the computational and statistical complexity of off-the-shelf heuristics that perform well even in nonconvex, nonsmooth settings. Capitalizing on these insights, the project will design new algorithmic solutions that circumvent the computational pitfalls of traditional methods. The guiding principle to tackle these challenges will be structure. On the one hand, although nonconvex, nonsmooth problems appearing in applications are known to be NP-hard, this notion only captures worst-case complexity. In practice, many problems enjoy additional benign geometric structure, enabling simple heuristics to succeed. On the other hand, this project will leverage the inherent structure of problems to design faster, parallelizable algorithms that can fully utilize modern machine learning infrastructure. These algorithms will be evaluated on optimization formulations from various applications spanning X-ray crystallography, phase space tomography, and recommendation systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the Southwestern U.S., for example, weedy grasses can fill gaps between native cacti, significantly increasing fire fuel availability, leading to bigger fires. To reduce impacts of this weed-fire connection scientists have traditionally focused on the planting of native plant species. Focusing on plants alone, however, might be misplaced. Important processes that affect fire behavior might occur below ground, in the soil, and may play a crucial role in post-fire habitat recovery. This project will study the bacteria and viruses (microbes) and the different types of organic matter in soil to better understand the relationship between weedy plants and wildfire. Once the researchers understand these soil processes, they will design inocula that contain soil and plant seeds that promote recovery in damaged areas. Combining the right belowground (soil) and aboveground (seeds) ingredients, the researchers hope to create an environment where soil microoganisms promote growth of native plants, which in turn provide nutrients back to the soil that promote growth of beneficial microbes. The project will publicize its results to land managers via workshops, extension publications, and the EcoRestore digital portal. In addition, high school students participating in a free outdoor science program will collect data, identify plants and maintain experimental plots.<br/><br/>With increasing temperature, drought severity and fire frequency, western US forests have the potential to transform from net sinks to net sources of CO2. In addition, invasive grasses can create sustained, novel, grass-fire cycles. To understand the effects of grass-fire cycles belowground, the researchers will investigate: (1) the interactive effects of fire and plant invasion on the microbiome and biogeochemistry of the soil; and (2) changes in soil viruses and their role on necromass entombment and carbon sequestration. Finally, to test effective and economically viable approaches to assist post-fire recovery, the project will design and deploy inocula to disturbed areas based on different formulations of plant seeds and soils with the ultimate goal of priming the ecosystem towards soil carbon sequestration. In addition to the outreach activities described above, the project will include training opportunities for a Ph.D. student and several undergraduates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The challenge lies in effectively combining these different data types to build statistical pipelines that outperform those developed using any one data type. Traditional statistical approaches struggle with this challenge. This project will establish a new statistical paradigm to address the complexities of such heterogeneous data while accounting for datasets with billions of variables. The project outcomes will facilitate principled prediction and inference in applications ranging from single-cell biology to precision health and neuroimaging.

These bounds are crucial, for example, in reinforcement learning, which underpins the success of systems like AlphaGo. Additionally, they play a key role in uncertainty quantification and the theoretical analysis of black-box machine learning algorithms. However, classical finite sample bounds have a significant limitation: they are often overly conservative. This conservatism leads to underperforming algorithms and unnecessarily loose guarantees. This project is built around a novel yet straightforward idea: finite-sample bounds can be derived from infinite-sample results. By leveraging recent breakthroughs in optimal transport and probability theory, the project aims to develop a new method for deriving such inequalities. These methods will be applied to problems such as online data-driven decision-making, early stopping rules, and machine learning for multiscale physical models. The PI will interweave their research and teaching throughout the research period and beyond. In particular, the PI will provide research training opportunities to graduate students and develop undergraduate and graduate courses, with course materials made publicly available and with joint participation from industry.<br/><br/>Classical concentration inequalities, such as the ones derived by Hoeffding or Bernstein, are over-conservative, are regularly inadequate for heavy-tail distributions, and often rely on the assumption of independence. In this project, the PI tackles those limitations from a new angle, starting with an infinite-sample result for a given problem, such as a central limit theorem, and translating it into a finite-sample result for the same problem by using the concept of distributional approximations. The advantage of this novel proof method is threefold: Firstly, the derived bounds improve as the sample size grows. This leads to inequalities that are considerably tighter than the classical ones. Secondly, limit theorems often hold for many forms of dependent data. This opens a more promising path to derive finite sample probability bounds than conventional Chernoff-based techniques. Lastly, by extending this approach to non-Gaussian limits, the PI develops finite sample concentration inequalities for heavy-tailed statistics. This project will (1) develop a completely novel method for obtaining concentration inequalities, as well as new results for transport distances and optimal transport, (2) provide machine learning theorists with a new set of powerful probability tools for obtaining high-probability guarantees for high-dimensional estimators and dependent and structured data, and (3) provide tighter tail bounds which will lead to algorithmic improvements and improved uncertainty quantification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Market failures prevent resources, such as labor and capital, from being used in the places where they are most valuable. While it is known that market failures are a feature of all economies and contribute to income differences across countries, the question of which types of households are affected most by these market failures is much less researched. This project makes progress on this gap by developing tools to connect and analyze multiple datasets that provide an extensive set of links in the economy between households and firms, between both households and firms and the government, and between the firms themselves. Understanding which groups benefit and which groups lose out from policies that address such market failures is vital to the design of approaches that maximize the welfare of any nation. The research outcomes could be essential for researchers and decisionmakers in shaping optimal U.S. policies and potentially enhancing the wellbeing of households and businesses.  <br/><br/>This award funds a research project that develops tools to estimate distortions?markups, markdowns, and taxes that prevents resources being allocated to their best uses?at a highly disaggregated level and trace them to individuals through arbitrary trade, employment, and financial networks. This methodology is applied to administrative data, where the research team can map out the flow of goods and money for the entire economy by linking firm-to-firm networks with firm-to-consumer, firm-to-lender, and firm-to-employee networks alongside ownership registries. These methods reveal how the burden of distortions is shared among households belonging to different regions, demographic groups, skill groups, and income levels. In addition, they enable answers to various questions, such as which distortions do the most to compress and expand the distribution of living standards; what trade-offs are observed in approaches designed to improve the impacts of distortions; and to what degree overlapping distortions necessitate our wide-ranging analysis as opposed to focusing on one specific distortion or sector at a time. The theory and methods are developed in a way that they can be applied to any country with similar data. This project advances knowledge in several ways. First, it operationalizes recent theoretical work on general equilibrium models of heterogeneous agents in distorted economic environments. Second, by assembling a complete empirical mapping of economic relationships between agents in an economy, it measures the distributional impact of the main distortions that are present in an economy (those on labor, capital, output, and intermediate inputs) throughout all sectors. This is relevant because studying the impact of reducing distortions in one specific market is influenced by distortions in other markets. Thus, to fully assess the trade-offs of reducing distortions, one needs to go beyond specific distortions and specific sectors. The results have the potential to significantly reshape how economists perceive the implications of market distortions and the policies responding to them. By addressing who bears the costs and who benefits from market distortions, a key theme for decisionmakers, the findings of this research could lead to optimal policies related to market failures and enhance the welfare of the U.S. population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials are distinguished in having properties that remain unchanged when the material is reshaped or disturbed. Topological materials have robust, i.e. impervious to material imperfections or shape, metallic conduction on their surfaces and interfaces that hold promise for device applications. Recent theoretical work has revealed that topological materials are ubiquitous in nature. However, the analytic tools for efficiently identifying and classifying topological materials are applicable to only about half of the crystal arrangements of constituent atoms that occur in nature, and only in materials where electrons do not interact strongly. A unifying framework for understanding how these analytical tools relate to measurable properties of materials is also lacking.<br/><br/>This project will focus on addressing this issue by exploiting mathematical connections between topology and symmetry as they apply in materials.

The discovery of topological materials has revolutionized condensed matter physics, and has promised transformative breakthroughs due to their robust transport properties, edge states, and exotic quasiparticle excitations. Developments over the past several years have shown that topological materials are ubiquitous in nature. The theory of topological quantum chemistry and symmetry-based indicators has given researchers new tools to quickly screen for nontrivial topology in weakly-correlated materials, based on the symmetry properties of electronic wavefunctions in momentum space. In spite of this tremendous progress, there are two major outstanding hurdles before the promise of harnessing topological effects can be realized: Symmetry indicators are not applicable to approximately half of the known crystal symmetry types, and a unifying framework connecting symmetry indicator invariants to experimental observables is not known. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI will address these issues by: 1) Studying the hydrodynamics of topological crystalline insulators and their response to defects to identify observable consequences of nontrivial topology beyond the bulk boundary correspondence. Both hydrodynamic response and the response of the bulk and boundary to defects will be investigated; 2) Developing group-theoretic techniques to define extended symmetry indicators for topological insulators and superconductors applicable to chiral materials. Attention will be paid to incorporating internal symmetries such as sublattice and particle hole symmetries with spatial symmetries in a consistent framework. Additionally, the action of spatial symmetries on electron spin will be explored as an indicator of topology.<br/><br/>In addition to the research, this project supports the training and mentorship of graduate students and their preparation to join the nation's quantum workforce, as well as improved access to physics education and research.

It will investigate how microscale particle interactions, elasticity, and pore network connectivity influence macro-scale transport by integrating microscopic measurements and bulk permeability analysis. Two fundamental questions will be addressed: (1) How does the network of pores in a medium determine the formation of particle clusters within individual pores and enhance the long-range spatial order within clusters? (2) What is the microscopic origin of the increased apparent viscosity of a suspension of particles flowing through a porous medium at small shear stress? By connecting particle elasticity, cluster formation, and porous medium properties, this study will identify the regimes in which either single-particle properties or collective transport dominate, leading to new insights into clogging and material transport in biological and industrial applications. Results from this project will advance the physics of phase transition in a porous structure by quantifying the spatial correlation of particles within the medium.

However, these microbes do not provide a free lunch: the host pays for microbial nutrients by providing resources like sugar back to the microbes. This project will test whether this cost also affects the host?s ability to defend itself. The researchers will address this question in legume plants. Legumes rely on a beneficial microbe for an essential nutrient (nitrogen), which they pay for with sugar. The researchers will test how this beneficial microbe affects the evolution of leaf defensive hairs, an important plant defense. These hairs prevent insects from eating the plant. If beneficial microbes affect leaf defensive hairs, then it means that they can influence whether their host will be able to evolve resistance to natural enemies like insects.

A key problem in this area is understanding how environmental change affects the way that species obtain food. Rising ocean temperatures may increase the food requirements of predatory animals which can cause prey populations to decline. Alternatively, warming can cause multiple predators to compete and interfere with each other, reducing effects on prey. This CAREER project addresses this problem by focusing on abundant native and invasive predatory crabs and their consumption of prey blue mussels in the Gulf of Maine, which is among the fastest warming habitats on the planet. This project measures how temperature affects the physiology of the focal species and how they interact with each other using a series of laboratory experiments, then uses mathematical models to calculate the impacts of temperature on the relative abundance of predators and prey. The educational components of this project include the formation of two working groups that pair early career scientists (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) with middle and late career mentors to train on team-based approaches to science. The investigator is developing data science workshops and laboratory modules to enhance undergraduate education. Results of this research inform the management of marine resources such as shellfish and broadly contribute to our understanding of how marine life will respond to changing ocean conditions. <br/><br/>Predicting the ecological consequences of changing environmental conditions will require an understanding of how temperature affects species interactions such as predation and competition. Further complicating this endeavor is the fact that communities in nature are often composed of multiple interacting predators that can produce non-linear and complex effects on prey species and overall community composition. This project 1) uses an integrated approach, combining single species physiological assays to compare the relative thermal performance of multiple predatory marine invertebrates (native and invasive) and prey blue mussels from the Gulf of Maine; 2) measures species interactions within the community using mesocosm experiments, quantifying temperature dependent predation, intraguild predation, and competition; and then 3) uses this information to construct numerical models to predict the effects of temperature on the biomass dynamics of both predators and prey.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Magnetospheres are dynamic, interconnected systems composed of complex and varied populations of particles and waves.  At Earth, electromagnetic waves are a primary mechanism through which energy is transferred across particle populations, connecting distant regions in space and time.  These waves can accelerate electrons to high energies, generating the Van Allen radiation belts, which pose a hazard to spacecraft and humans in space.  Waves can also drive particle precipitation into the atmosphere, modifying ozone and atmospheric chemistry and generating dazzling auroral displays.    Additionally, the team will train future satellite engineers and scientists through involvement in CubeSat development.  The project aims to expand the space hardware workforce and broaden participation in one of the essential directions of this field.<br/><br/>Magnetospheres are dynamic, interconnected systems composed of complex and varied populations of particles and waves.  At Earth, plasma waves are a primary mechanism through which energy is transferred across particle populations, connecting regions such as the distant magnetotail with the inner magnetosphere and even down to the ionosphere and atmosphere.  These waves can act as particle heating and energization drivers, generating the radiation belts.  Plasma waves can also drive particle precipitation into the atmosphere, modifying ionospheric conductance and atmospheric chemistry.  With the growth of the Heliophysics System Observatory and multi-spacecraft missions, we can now piece together a more complete picture of the three-dimensional dynamics of the complex magnetospheric system.  The proposal will utilize multipoint measurements to study the drivers, structure, and effects of waves in Earth's magnetosphere.  The team will analyze multi-mission wave data from the Heliophysics System Observatory to characterize the fine and larger scale properties of various wave modes, looking at overall spatial extents and spatial scales of modulation and wave property evolution.  As evidenced by upcoming Heliophysics missions and mission concepts, constellation missions have become the future of magnetospheric science, and with the continuing development of small spacecraft and CubeSats, these multipoint measurements are now more easily obtainable.  Therefore, as part of this effort, the team will address workforce development, specifically by training future satellite engineers and scientists through involvement in CubeSats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With growing international competition and a diminishing share of federal funding for research and development (R&D) compared to other sources, there is a need to better understand the effectiveness of government R&D funding programs. The Small Business Administration?s (SBA) Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs (hereafter, SBIR/STTR), which provide non-dilutive funding to small U.S. businesses, are the most well-known of such programs. A long literature evaluates their effectiveness, and the U.S. Congress requires periodic review for reauthorization, yet critical elements of program design have been left out of quantitative evaluations and recipients acknowledge several potential design flaws. One overlooked element is the role of timing between SBIR/STTR grant rounds and specifically the impact of long waits between SBIR/STTR funding tranches. Advancing understanding around the role of timing could significantly improve program success and technology outcomes, furthering national technology and SBA priorities.<br/><br/>This research evaluates the impact of accelerated government R&D funding for small technology business. The research uses data on federal R&D funding awards, data on commercialization, finance, and procurement outcomes, empirical modeling, and interviews. The project identifies policy levers for enhancing public programs that finance innovation, and explores the comparative advantage of such programs for some scientists and firms versus others, with particular attention to those innovators who have been overlooked and under-funded. The researchers examine 1) impacts of gaps in waiting time between government R&D funding tranches 2) the impacts on key firms that have been identified as priorities for support. The project has the potential to improve technology development and the ability of new, small technology firms to survive. It will provide actionable, evidence-based policy recommendations and have direct implications for federal programs, related state programs, and nonprofits that support firms in applying for SBIR/STTR awards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, there are an estimated 60 million horses under human management globally, and in the United States, the horse industry provides jobs for more than 4 million people. Each year, an estimated 27 million Americans ride horses, and 2 million own horses. Although primarily valued for transportation, leisure, and sport today, the earliest domesticated horses played a critical role in the prehistoric development and spread of pastoralism. Horses increased food availability both by enabling the management of larger livestock herds and by directly contributing to human nutrition through milk production. The origins of horse milking are poorly understood, but horse dairy products like koumiss have been a core food tradition in grasslands for thousands of years. The goal of this collaborative and multidisciplinary project is to answer fundamental questions about the origins of horse husbandry and the early economic role of horse dairying in ancient pastoralist societies. Archaeological investigations of early horse management and milking clarify the development of Bronze and Iron Age horse husbandry, which laid the foundation for the rise of historic horse-focused empires and the growth of today?s global livestock economies. By bringing together an international team of archaeologists, chemists, cultural heritage managers, and commercial dairy producers, this project creates new collaborations and business opportunities between academic institutions and the food industry, builds stronger training networks for graduate students in food science and analytical chemistry, and contributes to greater public understanding of the history and science of dairying through cultural events, STEM-based outreach programs, and a museum exhibition.<br/><br/>The investigators apply cutting-edge analysis of proteins in ancient human dental calculus (tooth tartar) using mass spectrometry to understand the emergence of horse milk consumption and its rise as a vibrant food tradition. This project tests and refines hypotheses regarding the origins and spread of horse dairying connected to horse domestication and early riding, clarifies the role that social and ecological factors played in the success of horse dairying in grassland environments, and examines the relationship between horse dairying and the dairying of other livestock species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, continental interiors contain many dormant fault zones that represent locations where crustal blocks came together. These ancient fault zones are sites of weakness that can become reactivated to generate mountain ranges in the middle of the continents if the tectonic plate motions are appropriate and the ancient fault is sufficiently weak. However, it remains unclear which plate tectonic scenarios favor fault reactivation, leading to the unsatisfying observation that some ancient fault systems get reactivated by later tectonic events and others do not. This project will study uplift of the Black Hills, South Dakota, because it is an isolated mountain range near the middle of the North American continent that is focused on an ancient fault zone related to growth of the North American continent. To develop an understanding of ancient fault reactivation, this project will study the ancient faults exposed in the Black Hills to determine how those faults formed and evolved throughout the tectonic evolution of North America. The project will target specific sites in the Black Hills and use the chemistry of the rocks to determine their ages. This history of fault motion and rock ages from the Black Hills will be used together to determine: 1) when uplift of the Black Hills began and what tectonics processes were responsible; and 2) whether the faults that uplifted the Black Hills formed at the time of uplift, are older faults inherited from assembly of the North American continent, or both. The project will involve a high school from the Rapid City, SD region, and undergraduate and graduate students from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, who will receive training on how to perform geologic field work and help collect the data related to the project goals. The project PI will also generate and contribute field trip curriculum to high schools in the Black Hills region. Collectively, the project will contribute a better understanding of how plate tectonics works within continents, which will provide an explanation of why some continents have isolated mountain ranges hundreds of kilometers from the coastlines where active plate boundaries typically reside.<br/><br/>The general view of ?strong? cratons characterized by stable Precambrian basement is challenged by observations of Precambrian basement exhumed in the cores of geologically recent orogenic belts. Rather, intracontinental deformation that exposes Precambrian rocks provides a record of the evolving strength of continental interiors relative to the forces acting on continental margins and allows for an evaluation of how inherited deformation features in the Precambrian basement may influence, or not, the rejuvenated orogen. The Laramide orogeny of western North America is an example of a geologically recent orogenic belt that exhumed Precambrian basement but has an unclear relationship to the Precambrian structures that it spatially overlaps. This project will use the Black Hills of western South Dakota to test the hypothesis that the geologic evolution of inherited structures within a Precambrian suture zone facilitated strain partitioning of pure shear and simple shear components of Laramide deformation. Determining the relationship between Precambrian and Laramide structures in the Black Hills will require modern structural analysis of both Laramide and Precambrian structures, and low-temperature thermochronometry and U-Pb geochronology on exhumed Precambrian metamorphic rocks to place better time brackets on deformation phases. Outcomes from this research will reveal the prominent sites and style of structural reactivation in the Black Hills, leading to a mechanistic understanding of intracontinental deformation as recorded by the Black Hills. Outcomes of the project will contribute to modern research objectives of the Tectonics community, including constraining the factors that influence the mechanical behavior of the lithosphere, understanding the evolution of lithospheric scale fault systems, and developing a skilled geoscience workforce. The education plan associated with the research project will involve high school and university students in field work/education and develop field trip curriculum and training for dissemination to high school faculty. These activities will strengthen the relationship between local high schools and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (the host university), leading to increased student interest (and expectantly enrollment) in geoscience at the university level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as a stigmatized, resource-lacking population, IRRIs are at risk of experiencing unique and highly challenging stressors in their job search and employment, as well as to respond to the resulting strain in maladaptive ways (e.g., substance use), thus potentially increasing the odds of recidivism. To address these risks and enhance the odds of reentry success, there is a need to better understand the challenges experienced by IRRIs as they seek gainful employment. Accordingly, the project team is conducting interviews with IRRIs at various stages of their reentry, as well as with those working with them (e.g., halfway house directors and counselors), to explore the unique aspects of IRRI job search and employment. Informed by these interviews, the project team also aims to test how a combination of different job search tactics, individual background factors, and situational factors may combine to explain job search and employment outcomes. The findings will be used to inform efforts aimed at helping IRRIs successfully transition to employment (e.g., guiding the more effective investment of reentry resources), as well as to facilitate the development of more efficacious interventions that mitigate risky behaviors and reduce recidivism.<br/><br/>This project aims to shed light on the adaptive and maladaptive coping tactics adopted by IRRIs in response to the stressors and strain they experience in their job search, how such factors impact their job search success, and how individual and organizational search-related resources and demands can impact employment outcomes. The project involves two studies. Building on conventional models of job search and the literature on community reentry, Study 1 is an exploratory, qualitative study in which we will interview up to 30 IRRIs (at various reentry stages) and 10 reentry professionals with the aim of developing a model of job search predictive of IRRI job search and employment outcomes. Study 2 aims to quantitatively test the hypothesized relationships embedded in the model emerging from Study 1 by collecting longitudinal field survey data from 200 IRRIs in three evenly spaced waves over their first four months of post-incarceration reentry. Results from the research will contribute to the understanding of experiences and challenges of IRRIs as they search for employment as part of their community reentry, as well as to the development of more efficacious policies and interventions to mitigate risky behaviors among such individuals and reduce their odds of recidivism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particles repel or attract one another, and importantly, this repulsion or attraction may become increasingly strong as particles become increasingly close together. In principle, the equations of physics, such as Newton?s laws of motion, allow to completely determine the behavior of each particle in the system for arbitrary periods of time. However, in practice, the large number of particles, and therefore the complexity of the system, far exceeds even the best computing resources. To answer questions of interest, one needs a simpler effective description that is a good approximation. Following the prescriptions of statistical mechanics, much effort over the years has been devoted to achieving a reduction in complexity through a point of view focused on the probability of finding at a given time a particle in the system at a certain position in space and moving with a certain velocity. A first approximation, known as the mean-field limit, effectively captures the ?typical behavior? of a particle in the system through a solution of a single equation, which is much simpler than the equations governing the exact motion of all the individual particles. However, our understanding of the mean-field limit over the timescales relevant for the system?s relaxation to equilibrium is quite poor. Additionally, the mean-field description ignores correlations between particles, created by their interactions and the thermal effects of the particles? environment, which capture the disorder of the system. Little is known about this disorder, which is encoded in the probability of deviations from the mean-field limit. The distribution of these deviations is the next-order approximation beyond the mean-field. The project will advance our understanding of how the system disorder grows with the number of particles and changes over time. The results are of direct application for the modeling of states of matter, such as plasmas, as well as problems with particle-like behavior, such as vortices in fluids or superconductors and the training of neural networks. The methods developed to tackle these problems, based on measuring how the energy or entropy of a system varies in space and time, will establish new connections between different areas of mathematics of independent interest. A key feature of the project is the integration of research and educational activities, promoting the goals of the Federal 5-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan. Through summer courses for advanced high-school students, new undergraduate curricula focused on mathematical communication, working groups, and supervising undergraduate and graduate student projects, the research program will provide opportunities for the mentorship and training of a new generation of researchers in the U.S. at this intersection of mathematics, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>Building on the investigator?s extensive work, the project addresses fundamental, open questions for the large time, beyond leading order description of Coulomb/Riesz gases. The two main lines of investigation are (1) central limit theorems for fluctuations around the mean-field limit and cumulant expansions that capture the system disorder and corrections to the mean-field limit; (2) the interplay between generation of chaos in these systems (the phenomenon of the particles becoming independent and identically distributed in the joint large time and system size limit), log Sobolev inequalities (LSIs), and relaxation estimates for gradient flows. The project develops both the physical and mathematical understanding of Coulomb/Riesz gases. (1) advances several new conjectures for the scaling of fluctuations and cumulants, their limiting dynamics, and the optimal rate of convergence to Gaussianity, quantifying the disorder as a function of the system size, length scale of observation, temperature, and singularity of interaction. These questions are all open except in limited cases, and the project stands to shape the future direction of the field. (2) develops the new connection between generation of chaos and LSIs for Gibbs measures, which has wide application beyond Coulomb/Riesz gases, with emphasis on LSIs for nonconvex energies, which is a major challenge in the field. The project develops new mathematical tools, such as commutator and gradient flow relaxation estimates, which have potential applications across analysis/PDE and probability. Lastly, Coulomb/Riesz gases are an important testing ground for the longer-term goal of answering fundamental questions of statistical mechanics for more general systems arising in machine learning, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because both beneficial and harmful bacteria use microcompartments, understanding their assembly and mechanisms of action could allow us to engineer bacterial strains to combat chemical pollution and carbon dioxide surpluses, or conversely to design antibiotics less likely to promote widespread resistance.  The project combines cryo-electron tomography, mathematical modeling and simulation, and biochemical assays to develop a model of how these large protein assemblies are built, mature, and function. This research is part of an increasing trend toward interdisciplinary science, yet many students struggle to cross traditional scientific divisions. Therefore, the project also includes an education plan focused on developing the necessary skills to analyze and interpret the various types of research data in the molecular life sciences. Group-based projects with raw data will be developed for a large enrollment Bioanalytical Chemistry class. ?Best practices? methods will be published for use by other educators.<br/><br/>The best-studied and simplest microcompartment known is the alpha-carboxysome, which allows ocean bacteria to utilize CO2 to build sugars for metabolism. The carboxysome has a protein shell and contains just two enzymes: carbonic anhydrase that converts ocean bicarbonate to CO2, and Rubisco that removes the carbon from CO2 for downstream metabolism. Carboxysomes are so stable that they are passed from cell to cell, living far longer than the cell that originally made them. In addition, they are so efficient that cells without them die even if they still have the enzymes in the cytoplasm. How the microcompartment is assembled and the enzyme components organize to become a stable, efficient carbon-fixing machine will be studied.  The lessons learned from this detailed study will then be applied to the characterization of a more complex system, the propanediol-utilization compartment that allows Salmonella to thrive in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Taken together, these studies of beneficial and pathogenic microcompartments will both provide new insights into prokaryotic metabolism and create blueprints of powerful machines whose redesign could lead to new technologies or whose disruption could treat mammalian illness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theme of FACM 2025 is ""New trends in data- and physics-based modeling and simulation of fluids"". Since its inception in 2004, the FACM conference has established itself internationally as a leading forum for the dissemination of recent results and new ideas in applied and computational mathematics and applied statistics. It attracts a distinguished international audience and provides an important forum to showcase US mathematical talent, and opportunities, especially junior participants, for networking with researchers in academia and industry. This year's conference will explore the advances that have been made in recent years by applying new computational tools and techniques (including machine learning and artificial intelligence, among others) to challenging problems that arise in fluid dynamics. A particular focus will be on application areas, which range from industrial challenges to biomedical applications to large-scale ocean flows.<br/><br/>This year's FACM conference theme will address the many exciting emerging new trends in data- and physics-based modeling and simulation of fluids. New research will be presented and discussed in a variety of forums. There will be four plenary presentations of an expository nature, given by recognized US-based leaders in their fields, each of which will set the scene for a focused minisymposium session. The four minisymposium sessions will focus on: fluid-structure interaction, particularly in the realm of biological flows; complex fluid flows arising in applied physics and industrial applications; new trends in the modeling and simulation of wave propagation; and computer-assisted proof in fluid dynamics (particularly for partial differential equations arising in wave-propagation). A highlight of the conference will be the poster session, anticipated to be extensive, dynamic and stimulating.

This material is the interstellar medium (ISM), the stuff out of which new stars are born. The ISM is a wonderful physics laboratory. It is sculpted by a rich array of physical processes, and so observations of the ISM can be used to decipher the poorly understood physics that governs the formation of stars and the evolution of gas in galaxies. Astronomers observe the ISM in many wavelengths of light. This proposal will develop novel tools to unlock the physical information encoded in those observations. This work will generate a new understanding of the gas, dust, and magnetic fields in our Milky Way galaxy. Because the ISM obscures our view of light from the very early universe, this work will also help clear the way for cosmological discovery. This proposal will also build tight links between cutting-edge research and education, impacting students from high school through graduate school. This project will 1) develop a suite of pedagogical Jupyter notebooks to enable active learning in graduate ISM education, 2) host a workshop on integrating computational tools into the classroom, and 3) develop a new dual-enrollment astrophysics course focused on modern approaches to data-driven inference, serving low-income high school students.<br/><br/>This proposal will develop cutting-edge methodologies for physical inference with complex data. The researchers will pursue a new approach to determining the phase structure of interstellar gas, and therefore to understanding the evolution of gas in galaxies. This work will open new avenues of inquiry by building computational tools to compare data and numerical simulations in high-dimensional spaces, and will reveal new insights into the magnetic structure of the ISM. This work will also build a new approach to modeling the structure of polarized dust emission from our Galaxy.

Self-experimentation has been gaining traction due to the $54 billion health tracking industry. However, there is a mismatch between what technology currently provides (for example, step counts and sleep scores) and what people expect from it, which is personalized health insights and recommendations. This project seeks to understand and enhance the agency of individuals to make decisions about their health and wellbeing by supporting explorations such as, ?Is coffee or milk the trigger for my irritable bowel syndrome symptoms? Does taking aspirin affect my menstrual flow? Will exercising in the evening improve my sleep quality??  This project?s designs will lead to more personalized feedback for health concerns such as physical activity, diet, and sleep. The research will thus support current efforts to manage chronic diseases in the United States, for example, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. In addition to engaging with different types of communities, this project will advance education by improving how students are taught to use the scientific approach to answer questions about their own health through self-experimentation. <br/><br/>This project will transform how we approach technology to support personal health management. It will expand our understanding of self-experimentation and significantly impact technology design to support and empower individuals in managing their health and wellbeing. Specifically, the research will contribute a new theory in the form of the life-cycle model of self-experimentation, its stages along with their associated properties and barriers. The project will also provide empirical evidence of design patterns addressing known challenges, such as improving experiment selection through novel interface design patterns to support goal elicitation and personalized data representations. Other known challenges include improving robustness of experimentation data through tailored experiment designs and learning-based experimentation support, and personalizing communication of findings through tailored visualizations and post-experiment paths of action. By systematically understanding and addressing the barriers and needs for effective self-experimentation this research will reshape self-experimentation from a challenging and unreliable tool available only to people with advanced knowledge and significant resources to a well-understood practice accessible to individuals throughout their health tracking journey.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, there are an estimated 60 million horses under human management globally, and in the United States, the horse industry provides jobs for more than 4 million people. Each year, an estimated 27 million Americans ride horses, and 2 million own horses. Although primarily valued for transportation, leisure, and sport today, the earliest domesticated horses played a critical role in the prehistoric development and spread of pastoralism. Horses increased food availability both by enabling the management of larger livestock herds and by directly contributing to human nutrition through milk production. The origins of horse milking are poorly understood, but horse dairy products like koumiss have been a core food tradition in grasslands for thousands of years. The goal of this collaborative and multidisciplinary project is to answer fundamental questions about the origins of horse husbandry and the early economic role of horse dairying in ancient pastoralist societies. Archaeological investigations of early horse management and milking clarify the development of Bronze and Iron Age horse husbandry, which laid the foundation for the rise of historic horse-focused empires and the growth of today?s global livestock economies. By bringing together an international team of archaeologists, chemists, cultural heritage managers, and commercial dairy producers, this project creates new collaborations and business opportunities between academic institutions and the food industry, builds stronger training networks for graduate students in food science and analytical chemistry, and  contributes to greater public understanding of the history and science of dairying through cultural events, STEM-based outreach programs, and a museum exhibition. <br/><br/>The investigators apply cutting-edge analysis of proteins in ancient human dental calculus (tooth tartar) using mass spectrometry to understand the emergence of horse milk consumption and its rise as a vibrant food tradition. This project tests and refines hypotheses regarding the origins and spread of horse dairying connected to horse domestication and early riding, clarifies the role that social and ecological factors played in the success of horse dairying in grassland environments, and examines the relationship between horse dairying and the dairying of other livestock species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In collaboration with local communities. researchers study a diverse range of dietary remains preserved at archaeological sites to provide a holistic perspective on human diets and document food practices at the individual level. The resulting data have value to communities working to mitigate the impact of environmental changes on culturally important traditional foods. The community-based outcomes of this project provide opportunities for enhancing tribal engagement and scientific collaboration. This investigation develops new methods for identifying food practices in the past and contributes to the education and training of students in these methods as well as in community engagement.<br/><br/>This study produces a fine-grained record of hunter-gatherer dietary practices through analysis of plant and animal food remains in human feces preserved at archaeological sites.

This interaction is essential for pollination and food production. Surprisingly, recent studies show that plants can ""listen"" to the sound of pollinators, such as the buzzing of bees, and respond by producing sweeter nectar. How plants achieve this remains a mystery. This award aims to uncover the physical and molecular mechanisms that allow plants to detect and respond to sound. The principal investigator (PI) proposes that the plant cell wall acts like a filter, vibrating at specific frequencies, while structures called Hechtian strands help transmit these vibrations to the cell's interior. This process could trigger changes inside the cell, leading to the production of sugars and other responses critical for pollination. By studying these processes in detail using cutting-edge tools and techniques, this award will provide new insights into how plants interact with their environment.<br/><br/>Beyond advancing scientific knowledge, this project has practical applications in agriculture. Understanding how sound influences nectar production could lead to innovative methods for boosting crop yields and supporting pollinator populations.

Unfortunately, new seedlings are not replacing the trees that have died. These seedlings may need beneficial soil microbes, which have also declined under drought. This project tests this idea by adding beneficial microbes to pion seedlings planted into areas of experimental severe drought and nearby areas with normal conditions. DNA sequencing will identify the important microbes. Greenhouse experiments will expand this across the range of pion pine by comparing seedling growth in soils from sites with different severities of drought. This project will develop new methods to restore pion trees in areas devastated by drought. The seedlings of most tree species rely on beneficial microbes to survive and grow. Thus, results will also inform management of other forests across the US. This project trains graduate, undergraduate, high school students, and local school teachers to allow the research to reach additional participants.<br/> <br/> <br/>Drought is common in the western US and other parts of the world and can lead to tipping points at which ecosystems lose resilience ? the capacity to withstand disruption without a change in function. This research investigates plant-soil feedback as a general mechanism to promote the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems to drought. Experiments leverage a large-scale, historical forest drought experiment to evaluate the hypothesis that positive species-specific plant-soil feedbacks between trees (pion pine) and specialist soil microbes (ectomycorrhizal fungi) increase resilience by benefiting seedling recruitment. Field inoculations and laboratory assays will determine the degree to which recovery hinges on keystone fungi and their functional traits. This project achieves generalization across the geographic range of pion pine with a greenhouse experiment to detect the threshold level of drought that degrades the resilience conferred by plant-soil feedback. This research integrates theory and experiments to promote synthesis across spatial scales that advances understanding of how environmental change disrupts biological interactions and how these interactions influence resilience to environmental change. This project has high potential to broaden understanding of how soil microbes sustain terrestrial ecosystem resilience and to advance use-inspired research through the discovery of practical solutions (soil inoculants) to maximize the resilience of woodlands to drought.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some savannas, including Brazil?s cerrado, fire is necessary, helping to maintain open tree canopies and allowing a continuous and highly diverse grass layer to thrive. Exactly how fire should be managed to conserve cerrado biological and functional biodiversity remains unclear, however. This work focuses at the interface of stewardship and research to evaluate how fire is being managed in protected areas in Brazil?s cerrado, whether fire policies are effective for conserving vulnerable fire-dependent cerrado plants, and how fire may be used as a tool to increase cerrado resilience. This work will advance scientific understanding of fire and the maintenance of ecosystem function and biodiversity in savannas, as well as ensuring that Brazil?s national fire policies promote biodiversity and ecosystem function across all of Brazil?s ecoregions. The project will elegantly integrate societal benefits (determination of how well management practices and policies are working) and a variety of training and outreach with cutting-edge research.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the research interrogates a) how a new legal framework in Brazil (Law 12651) allowing for the development of integrated fire management policies in protected areas and on private lands has changed fire regimes in flammable savanna ecosystems, b) whether the policies developed under this framework are appropriate to conserving fire-dependent biodiversity in Brazil?s cerrado, and c) the extent to which cerrado ecosystems and biodiversity are vulnerable in a conservation context and whether fire management can be used as a tool to increase cerrado resilience. To do this, methods will involve combining detailed remote sensing mapping of fire history across cerrado protected areas, intensive site-based work in six protected areas, and mapping of cerrado vulnerability. The six field sites encompass four national parks and two ecological field stations. The work will reach a broad set of participants, including both researchers at Yale and Unicamp and managers at the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservao e Biodiversidade, via a series of participatory management workshops aimed at synthesizing existing fire policy and disseminating information to participants. The managers will gain experience in field work and receive guidance on the importance of fire for biodiversity conservation.

This research project seeks to understand how cells interpret information related to stress.  Understanding these processes is of significant importance to the scientific community by expanding our understanding of biology and testing this knowledge by building computational models of these processes.  The approaches used to understand these mechanisms also have broader impacts beyond academic research alone.  This includes providing training opportunities both for graduate and undergraduate students interested in careers in STEM fields, cross-disciplinary activities exposing high school students to the integration of data science and biology, and early elementary outreach to demonstrate how microscopy can be used to gain insight into cellular processes and foster interest in STEM.  It is anticipated that the research will impact 100s of students over the duration of the project.  <br/><br/>Within this project, the investigators will examine the mechanisms that cells use to relay information through the stress kinase JNK and transcription factor c-Jun.  Previous studies have shown that JNK activity is highly dynamic but it is unclear how this contributes to gene expression patterns.  The investigators previously determined that different JNK dynamics can give rise to distinct gene expression patterns but it is unclear how these patterns are regulated.  This project will focus on two mechanisms: 1) post-transcriptional regulation of genes through mRNA stability and 2) combinatorial regulation of genes by multiple transcription factors.  The investigators will experimentally measure mRNA decay rates using metabolic labeling.  Live-cell imaging of fluorescent reporters and mutation of 3? UTR sequences will be used to determine how 3? UTR sequences contribute to both mRNA stability and observed gene expression dynamics.  For the second mechanism, the investigators will test how different promoter sequences and transcription factor binding sites contribute to dynamic gene expression over time to explore combinatorial gene regulation.  Systematic deletions of cis-regulatory elements in fluorescent reporters will be used to assess impacts on gene expression dynamics over time.  The collected data from objectives 1 and 2 will be used to refine a computational model of JNK signaling which will be used to facilitate future research into the function of JNK in cells.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

YouTube videos of the field and laboratory research will be developed as part of outreach to the broader public on diversity of Asgard archaea. <br/><br/>This project will collect hot spring sediment samples from the western U.S. to recover and identify novel Asgard archaeal lineages. A combination of amplicon, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic sequencing will be performed from DNA and RNA extracted from these samples. Amplicon sequencing will be done using archaeal primers that capture most of Asgard archaeal diversity. Near full-length sequencing of amplicons will result in phylogenetically useful information enabling assessment of diversity and abundance in the hot springs. Metagenomic sequencing using both short and long reads of the most abundant archaeal samples will enable reconstruction of near-complete genomes. Metatranscriptomic sequencing will reveal novel lineages that may have been missed due to PCR bias. Phylogenomic and ancestral state reconstructions with the improved representation of lineages from hot spring habitats will shed light on the origins of Asgard archaea in terrestrial or marine geothermal features. Phylogenetic analysis of the eukaryotic signature proteins found in these archaea will also reveal where the genes encoding these proteins first appeared during geologic time. This research will advance our knowledge of diversity and deep evolutionary relationships of Asgard archaea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This event is the ninth in a series of conferences, held every eight years since 1961 at the University of Georgia, and will focus on recent developments in geometric topology. Topological spaces are everywhere in mathematics and in fact everywhere in real life. From ordinary 3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time of relativity to spaces of configurations of complex organic molecules and sets of solutions to systems of many equations, the basic problems of topology are ubiquitous.  Geometric topology, in particular, focuses on problems in which a strong visual component of reasoning and problem solving comes into play and is generally the most accessible part of topology for a broad audience.  At the same time it is the realm of topology in which some of the hardest outstanding problems remain unsolved. Recent developments to be highlighted at this conference include, for example, the remarkable results of Watanabe, which show that the set of all symmetries of the simplest 4-dimensional object, the 4-dimensional ball, is drastically more complicated than had been suspected eight years ago.<br/><br/>This conference focuses on the most significant advancements in geometric topology and related geometry since the last Georgia International Topology Conference in 2017.  The topics will highlight exciting new developments including advances in knot theory, four-manifolds, topology of diffeomorphism and embedding spaces, homotopy theory, contact and symplectic topology and geometry, equivariant Floer homology, Floer homotopy theory, geometric group theory, hyperbolic manifolds and dynamical systems. The conference has historically generated tremendous interest among graduate students and recent PhD?s. The speakers at various career stages and the range of topics to be presented will offer students and new PhD?s a valuable taste of what the mathematical research community has to offer. The results of the conference will also be made available to a wider audience through a conference proceedings.

Hybrid seed is a result of cross-pollinating two plant varieties of the same species that differ in their genetic makeup and phenotype traits. These hybrids are selected for genetic configurations that provide favorable phenotype traits or characteristics like higher grain yield, disease tolerance, etc. However, the large-scale conventional production of hybrid seeds by crossing inbred parent lines/varieties is resource- and labor-intensive, making them expensive and placing limitations on their availability and benefits to farmers. This hurdle could be overcome if hybrid crops can be made to reproduce asexually as clones, which will maintain the favorable set of genes and combinations that result in high yields, for example. Recently the technology was developed to produce hybrid rice using the asexual method but it has not yet been successfully adapted to maize, a major crop plant in the U.S.A. In this project, new methods will be developed for maize to maintain the hybrid state of the parent chromosomes in the progeny of hybrid plants. The success of these methods will make possible the inexpensive production of high-yielding hybrid seeds from maize. With the importance of hybrids for maize cultivation, the project is expected to have a large impact on U.S. agriculture.   <br/><br/><br/>Asexual reproduction occurs naturally in many flowering plants by a two-step process called diplosporous apomixis: first, the elimination of genetic segregation during meiosis to make clonal gametes, i.e. egg cells and sperm cells containing unreduced and unrecombined parental genomes, and second, the development of the unfertilized egg cells into embryos to produce clonal plants.   Previously, synthetic apomixis has been successfully achieved in rice, through genetic manipulations that combined the substitution of mitosis for meiosis in gamete cells together with the induction of parthenogenesis, where a plant produces fruits and seeds from unfertilized eggs. In maize, efficient parthenogenesis has recently been demonstrated using the method developed for rice. However, the substitution of mitosis for meiosis has not been successful in maize, due to differences between the function of rice and maize genes involved in the meiosis. This project will develop a novel strategy to generate diploid gametes in maize, based on a hypothesis of conservation of cis-regulatory elements of cell division genes in meiosis and mitosis. The strategy involves editing multiple genes required for cell division and meiosis, as well as the utilization of selected cell division genes from rice.   The methods developed in this project, if successful, could be extended to other major crop plants, and potentially adapted to study other cellular processes in plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, new seedlings are not replacing the trees that have died. These seedlings may need beneficial soil microbes, which have also declined under drought. This project tests this by adding beneficial microbes to pion seedlings planted into areas of experimental severe drought and nearby areas with normal conditions. DNA sequencing will identify the important microbes. Greenhouse experiments will expand this idea across the range of pion pine by comparing seedling growth in soils from sites with different severities of drought. This project will develop new methods to restore pion trees in areas devastated by drought. The seedlings of most tree species rely on beneficial microbes to survive and grow. Thus, results will also inform management of other forests across the US. This project trains graduate, undergraduate, high school students, and local school teachers to allow the research to reach additional participants.<br/> <br/> <br/>Drought is common in the western US and other parts of the world and can lead to tipping points at which ecosystems lose resilience ? the capacity to withstand disruption without a change in function. This research investigates plant-soil feedback as a general mechanism to promote the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems to drought. Experiments leverage a large-scale, historical forest drought experiment to evaluate the hypothesis that positive species-specific plant-soil feedbacks between trees (pion pine) and specialist soil microbes (ectomycorrhizal fungi) increase resilience by benefiting seedling recruitment. Field inoculations and laboratory assays will determine the degree to which recovery hinges on keystone fungi and their functional traits. This project achieves generalization across the geographic range of pion pine with a greenhouse experiment to detect the threshold level of drought that degrades the resilience conferred by plant-soil feedback. This research integrates theory and experiments to promote synthesis across spatial scales that advances understanding of how environmental change disrupts biological interactions and how these interactions influence resilience to environmental change. This project has high potential to broaden understanding of how soil microbes sustain terrestrial ecosystem resilience and to advance use-inspired research through the discovery of practical solutions (soil inoculants) to maximize the resilience of woodlands to drought.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key barrier to many applications, however, is the availability of high-performance photovoltaic cells tailored to these wavelengths of light. Current technologies exhibit insufficient performance and high cost due to material and fabrication limitations. One possible way to address these challenges is to use nanoscale quantum structures in the photovoltaic cell, in a way similar to some commercial photodetectors. This could allow the use of more common materials and reduce some of the losses that limit performance. However, these quantum structures have not been studied in detail for power generation, and a number of open questions exist about how they function and perform. This project will study the fundamental operation of quantum-structured photovoltaic cells, fabricate these types of devices, and measure their performance. This research could have direct impacts in several energy applications, which could help the U.S. reduce reliance on foreign energy sources and improve infrared technologies for a variety of power, communications, and defense applications. This project also seeks to advance the U.S.?s expertise in semiconductor technologies by inspiring students to join the semiconductor workforce and creating new initiatives for graduate and undergraduate students to explore these career options.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: (1) determine the influences of bias and illumination on band structure and carrier transport, and identify design strategies to achieve high carrier collection under forward bias; (2) identify nanophotonic structures to couple IR radiation into the active region of these devices while minimizing parasitic absorption; and (3) fabricate cells with narrow intersubband gaps and demonstrate high energy conversion efficiencies while improving modelling and understanding of transport. The research will utilize a combination of quantum optoelectronic simulations to investigate the band structure and electronic transport under illumination and bias, finite element electromagnetic simulations to design photonic structures for coupling light into the ISPV cell, custom models to predict device performance, epitaxial growth of novel types of conduction band engineered active regions and test samples via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, microfabrication of samples and devices, and detailed material and device characterization using standard and custom spectroscopy, microscopy, and testing equipment. This work will develop a detailed understanding of the relationships between materials, structure, transport, and device performance for an intersubband quantum cascade structure under illumination and in use for electricity generation. Preliminary results indicate that the structure of an intersubband photovoltaic cell is likely to be quite different from a traditional quantum cascade detector, and this research will reveal why these types of structures are different and how an active region should be designed for effective power generation. The combination of experimental and simulation activities and parallel investigation of semiconductor structure and photonic structure will lead to strong platform for future design of scalable and efficient IR energy conversion devices in a variety of applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The specific aims of this project are to determine the impact of membrane phosphoinositide content on condensate formation, size, composition, and function; determine how the recruitment of specific adaptor proteins impacts local phosphoinositide lipid composition within condensates; and determine how specific protein enzymes control local phosphoinsitide lipid composition within condensates. This research will reveal fundamental mechanisms by which proteins and lipids may coordinate the formation and function of membrane-associated condensates throughout the cell.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising paradigm is to utilize the fact that electrons on the surface of a material often have behavior unachievable in the interior.  The desired surface electronic behavior can be controlled by the types of atoms that are on the surface, and this surface composition can be inhomogeneous or variable.  The project employs simultaneous measurements of surface atomic composition and surface electron motion to understand how to control desired surface electronic behavior via chemical composition.  Broader impacts are achieved through outreach to the public about novel materials via social media and public lectures.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in materials physics and communication thereof via in-person and online tutorials and technical writing pedagogy.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This work assesses how characteristic surface states manifest amidst dynamic chemistry, electronic correlations, and real-space mesoscale phase separation. Bulk-boundary correspondence is a fundamental principle in topological materials including Weyl semimetals that establishes a connection between the bulk and surface electronic structure.  The composition and morphology of the surface can markedly affect the surface electronic structure, and needs to be measured independently.  In this project, the researchers are incorporating photoemissions measurements of local chemistry, periodic structure, and electronic structure into developing enhanced understanding and control of surface electronic states.  This project uses bulk chemical substitution to push the Curie temperature to zero in magnetic Weyl semimetals.  At these critical compositions, local chemical variation at the surface has an outsized role in driving topologically distinct surface electronic structures which can be tuned dynamically with ion migration.  Multiple photoemission microscopies are coupled with automation, visualization, and correlation tools to connect surface chemistry, structure, and electronic structure in a closed loop.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research aims to develop innovative quantum devices that take advantage of nonequilibrium behavior using graphene Josephson junctions. Traditionally, Josephson junctions consist of two superconductors separated by a non-superconducting region, enabling them to conduct electricity without resistance or energy loss. This project explores a new type of Josephson junctions by leveraging the extraordinary properties of graphene?a single layer of carbon atoms?as the non-superconducting region. By integrating multiple superconducting terminals, these devices are predicted to display remarkable electrical properties under nonequilibrium conditions. This project enriches our understanding of these emergent properties and has the potential to pave the way for developing devices that are highly efficient and resilient to noise?addressing a key challenge in quantum technology. Beyond technical innovations, this project also contributes to workforce development by training students at all levels. Additionally, it features a strong focus on education and outreach, including course development and engaging the local STEM community through summer camps.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>This research builds upon recent advances in graphene Josephson junctions to explore the nonequilibrium properties of emergent Andreev bound states in these systems. The project aims to develop ballistic, dual-gated Josephson junctions on graphene heterostructures to minimize disorder and enable independent control over carrier density and contact transparency. A central focus is on manipulating and probing the energy-phase relationship of Andreev modes under nonequilibrium conditions, achieved by applying microwave radiation and/or voltage bias. The project also aims to identify topological properties of these nonequilibrium states by directly examining the Andreev band structure using tunneling spectroscopy. This research intends to deepen our understanding of Andreev modes, topological phases, and superconductivity, paving the way for their use in superconducting spintronics and quantum information processing. Finally, the project aims to train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers by equipping them with expertise in nanolithography and low-temperature measurement techniques?key skills for the future quantum workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, understanding how fish respond to changing environmental conditions is essential to mitigating future human impacts on marine ecosystems. This research effort explores fish evolution and ecology by leveraging microfossil fish teeth and shark scales (together called ?ichthyoliths?) found in deep-sea sediments to evaluate the ecological and evolutionary responses of fish to major transitions in Earth?s history. Ichthyoliths are the most numerically abundant marine vertebrate fossils, as each fish can produce dozens to hundreds of teeth, and a shark may produce tens to hundreds of thousands of scales in its lifetime, presenting the potential for high-fidelity studies of paired biological-environmental records to explore the impact that changing environmental conditions have on fish populations and biodiversity. However, ichthyoliths are extremely small ? most are less than the width of a human hair ? and are typically found separately from the animals that produced them, making these valuable fossils a challenge to work with. This research project will be the first to develop a robust, open-source, and freely available toolkit for ichthyolith studies, combining modern fish biology, machine learning, and high-resolution digital imaging, and then to use this toolkit to explore how fish and sharks responded to several major environmental perturbation events in Earth?s history. This framework will be a transformative tool, allowing for a wide range of research into fish and shark evolutionary and ecological dynamics far beyond the case studies of this research. Finally, this award supports a unique summer research program for undergraduate students to develop skills as researchers and science communicators, providing professional development and unique fully accessible research experiences, while also developing accessible education and outreach materials that will make these small, near-invisible microfossils accessible to a wide audience of K-12 students and the wider public. <br/><br/>The highly robust ichthyolith microfossil record has the potential to unlock fish and shark evolutionary and ecological dynamics going back millions of years on an unprecedented scale. However, these microfossils are typically found in isolation from the animals that made them, making precise taxonomic identification a challenge. Further, their small size and large morphological diversity have been barriers to developing a robust morphological or taxonomic framework for the group, limiting their utility for evolutionary and paleoecological studies. This research will develop a robust taxonomic, ecological, and morphological framework for ichthyolith classification, by leveraging a machine-learning ensemble model-based approach to classify ichthyoliths using a repeatable morphological framework. This framework will be grounded in the modern with a catalog of extant fish species, allowing for taxonomic and ecological identification of different fossil tooth morphologies. Finally, the researchers will use this analytical toolkit to test hypotheses about fish abundance, biodiversity, paleoecology, and evolutionary trajectories across major climate events in Earth?s history including the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period, the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary, and the Early Eocene. The framework and toolkits developed through this work will be shared as an open-source, image and morphological database, R package, and online platform to support national and international collaboration on ichthyolith work, providing a common language, analytical toolkit, and structure to support widespread, diverse ichthyolith-based research going forward, unlocking the potential of ichthyoliths to better understand ? and protect ? the fish in our oceans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop aims to create a dynamic platform where both established and emerging researchers, specializing in infinite-type surfaces and related fields, can come together. This event's goal is twofold: first, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of recent breakthroughs in the field, and second, to explore various avenues for future research and encourage future collaboration. Furthermore, enabling US-based scientists to attend this international meeting has two additional benefits: (1) Allowing for future long term collaborations with researchers outside of the US, and (2) Providing a means to disseminate research and results to the global mathematical community. <br/><br/>Infinite-type surfaces serve as a common thread connecting various areas of mathematics. An infinite-type surface is a two dimensional manifold with ""infinitely much topology,'' e.g. the sphere with a Cantor set of points removed or a surface of infinite genus. They appear in the study of polygonal billiards, topological dynamics, as generic leaves of foliations on compact spaces, in the study of Thompson groups, or in 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. More recently, there has been a significant surge in the study of mapping class groups associated with infinite-type surfaces, also known as big mapping class groups. These are topological groups exhibiting rich phenomenology. As automorphism groups of countable structures, often endowed with well-defined large-scale geometry, they also inhabit the intersection of geometric group theory, model theory, and descriptive set theory. While infinite-type surfaces possess this interdisciplinary nature, historically, only two workshops (in 2013 and 2019) have brought together experts from diverse fields sharing this common theme. Thus, the primary scientific objective of this workshop is to convene a diverse group of mathematicians to facilitate cross-pollination among the different areas converging on infinite-type surfaces.

How do those movers? social statuses and identities shape adaptation and integration experiences after post-disaster population movement? In what ways do movers create meaning in new places of residence, and under what conditions do they remain settled or return to the disaster-stricken place? Answers to these questions are important because they can reveal what elements of a destination place are conducive to long-term settlement, and the conditions under which movers can successfully rebuild their lives after a disaster uproots them. The Principal Investigator (PI) will answer these questions by interviewing post-disaster movers about their experiences recovering and rebuilding their lives after moving to a new place. The PI will locate and interview study participants who were surveyed and interviewed in 2020 after their post-disaster movements, to understand what opportunities and challenges they have encountered in their new communities since these interviews took place. This study advances knowledge and scholarship by using novel longitudinal data to examine how movers rebuild their lives after disaster-induced population movement, focusing on the role of destination places in shaping long-term settlement decisions. Aligned with NSF?s mission, this project addresses the intersection of population movement, disaster response, and social integration to promote societal welfare and scientific progress. Additionally, it promises to benefit society by informing more effective incorporation strategies and support services for movers in disaster-prone areas.<br/><br/>The project focuses on movers after hurricanes compromised their homes in 2017 and beyond. The study explores how demographic characteristics influence movement in order to better understand the relationship between place- and home-making processes and societal incorporation. By re-interviewing a sample of 54 movers, including a sub-sample of return movers, this project will be the first to longitudinally examine post-disaster population movement, capturing not just multi-level factors influencing incorporation and settlement, but return movement and resettlement and factors that shape re-adaptation.

As a result, the ocean iron cycle is closely tied to the ocean carbon cycle. Progress in understanding the ocean iron cycle has been slower than for some other elements because it is present at very low concentrations and care must be taken to avoid contaminating samples. The international GEOTRACES program has, over the last twenty years, greatly accelerated progress in marine iron geochemistry. Capabilities have also been developed for measuring the stable isotopic composition of iron in seawater. In this project, a team of researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Hawaii will measure iron isotopes in samples from three GEOTRACES expeditions in the Pacific Ocean. This will produce an unprecedented data set for iron isotopes. Combining these data with ocean biogeochemical modeling, the team will address important questions about the sources of iron to the ocean and about biological cycling of iron. The project will support several early-career scientists, including postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students at each institution. Project data will be made publicly available through the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office and in GEOTRACES data products.<br/><br/>Iron plays an essential role in driving oceanic biogeochemical cycles and is thought to limit phytoplankton growth over large regions of the surface oceans, particularly the Southern Ocean, where primary productivity mediates deep ocean-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange, and the eastern Equatorial Pacific, where iron feeds a highly productive ecosystem. Deep iron sources are key to the marine iron cycle, especially in the deep Pacific Ocean where hydrothermal venting from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has been suggested to supply dissolved iron to the Southern Ocean via upwelling. However, key questions remain about sources, longevity/speciation, and transport of this dissolved iron. Samples have been collected during two GEOTRACES zonal sections, from South America to Australia along 10S (GP21 in 2021) and Ecuador to Papua New Guinea along the Equator (GP11 in 2023). Samples are also available from one GEOTRACES-compliant cruise (GPc03) in the western subtropical Pacific. Using a combination of state-of-the-art iron isotope measurements and biogeochemical modelling, the team will address the following questions: 1) Using iron isotopes as a tracer, what is the relative supply of dust, sediment, and hydrothermal-derived iron to different regions of the shallow ultra-oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre and Equatorial upwelling zone, and how does iron supply vary in space and time? 2) How do microorganisms fractionate iron isotopes as they take up iron? How does the extent of this fractionation relate to the (temporally and spatially variable) nutrient limitation regimes and the degree of upper ocean iron recycling in the Equatorial-South Pacific? 3) What is the flux, isotope signature, and location of dissolved iron supplied to Pacific Deep Waters (PDW) by hydrothermal venting along the EPR and the Tonga/Kermadec arc? What are the stabilization mechanisms, isotopic changes, and longevity of this dissolved iron with transport? How do dissolved iron and iron isotopes evolve in PDW as it travels southward along the coast of South America and into the Southern Ocean? The results are expected to transform understanding of this essential micronutrient.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has recently been shown that the rare 17O isotope provides additional information, but unfortunately, it is very difficult to measure with sufficient precision. A revolutionary laser spectroscopy system was developed for measuring 17O in the last several years. It is easy to use, costs less than traditional mass spectrometers and is more rapid than traditional mass spectrometry. It is truly a ?game changer? for isotope analyses. There are several limitations to this new method however. It is proposed here to develop a method where the traditional N2 carrier gas is substituted with N2O. This allows the sample to be frozen out of a vacuum line at liquid nitrogen temperatures, and therefore easily transferred in a vacuum line. If the system works as expected, sample size will be reduced by an order of magnitude, analytical precision should double and analysis time will be reduced. University of New Mexico personnel will work with the laser manufacturer, Aerodyne Research Inc. in an academic-industry collaboration to perfect the N2O system. The new instrument will be an integral part of the research of three Ph.D. students and serve as instrumentation for several undergraduate senior-honor?s theses. It is expected that this relatively simple instrument will become the standard method for analyzing triple oxygen isotope ratios.<br/> <br/>Laser-based spectroscopy (TILDAS) is a straightforward, rapid and accurate method for determining triple oxygen isotope ratios (d18O, D?17O) of CO2 gas. Sample preparation and laser analysis are straightforward, however, the system requires a precisely diluted sample of ~450 ppm CO2 in an optically transparent carrier gas (N2 or CO2-free air) which involves a sophisticated interface. Gas mixing takes close to 30 minutes, and aliquots of the sample gas are pumped away after each measurement, limiting ultimate precision. Here it is proposed to substitute a liquid nitrogen condensable gas (N2O) in place of N2. Being able to freeze out the sample will lead to 1) rapid mixing times, doubling the throughput rate, 2) smaller sample requirements to as low as 14 micrograms calcite equivalent and 3) increased precision due to repeatable analysis of the same sample gas. It will significantly expand the reach of triple isotopes. Initial test results are very promising (d18O 0.03?; d17O 0.05 ?, D?17O 60 per meg, 1s), but further improvements require additional modifications to the TILDAS system. The inlet system will be redesigned and collaborations with Aerodyne Research Inc. will improve the analysis software and interface to develop an automated N2O based system that can be used for triple isotope analysis of CO2 gas, carbonates, water, soil water, leaves, blood, etc. This will be the primary research effort of a Ph.D. student working closely with the principle investigator. Results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and work with the laser manufacturer will result in the system available to new users. Initial applications (3 Ph.D. students and one undergraduate student) will be for 1) soil water and associated carbonates, 2) lake carbonates for paleoclimate, 3) body water (measured as blood) of desert dwellers, 4) evaporation studies of equisetum, and 5) degassing kinetics of modern travertines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, the ocean iron cycle is closely tied to the ocean carbon cycle. Progress in understanding the ocean iron cycle has been slower than for some other elements because it is present at very low concentrations and care must be taken to avoid contaminating samples. The international GEOTRACES program has, over the last twenty years, greatly accelerated progress in marine iron geochemistry. Capabilities have also been developed for measuring the stable isotopic composition of iron in seawater. In this project, a team of researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Hawaii will measure iron isotopes in samples from three GEOTRACES expeditions in the Pacific Ocean. This will produce an unprecedented data set for iron isotopes. Combining these data with ocean biogeochemical modeling, the team will address important questions about the sources of iron to the ocean and about biological cycling of iron. The project will support several early-career scientists, including postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students at each institution. Project data will be made publicly available through the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office and in GEOTRACES data products.<br/><br/>Iron plays an essential role in driving oceanic biogeochemical cycles and is thought to limit phytoplankton growth over large regions of the surface oceans, particularly the Southern Ocean, where primary productivity mediates deep ocean-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange, and the eastern Equatorial Pacific, where iron feeds a highly productive ecosystem. Deep iron sources are key to the marine iron cycle, especially in the deep Pacific Ocean where hydrothermal venting from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has been suggested to supply dissolved iron to the Southern Ocean via upwelling. However, key questions remain about sources, longevity/speciation, and transport of this dissolved iron. Samples have been collected during two GEOTRACES zonal sections, from South America to Australia along 10S (GP21 in 2021) and Ecuador to Papua New Guinea along the Equator (GP11 in 2023). Samples are also available from one GEOTRACES-compliant cruise (GPc03) in the western subtropical Pacific. Using a combination of state-of-the-art iron isotope measurements and biogeochemical modelling, the team will address the following questions: 1) Using iron isotopes as a tracer, what is the relative supply of dust, sediment, and hydrothermal-derived iron to different regions of the shallow ultra-oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre and Equatorial upwelling zone, and how does iron supply vary in space and time? 2) How do microorganisms fractionate iron isotopes as they take up iron? How does the extent of this fractionation relate to the (temporally and spatially variable) nutrient limitation regimes and the degree of upper ocean iron recycling in the Equatorial-South Pacific? 3) What is the flux, isotope signature, and location of dissolved iron supplied to Pacific Deep Waters (PDW) by hydrothermal venting along the EPR and the Tonga/Kermadec arc? What are the stabilization mechanisms, isotopic changes, and longevity of this dissolved iron with transport? How do dissolved iron and iron isotopes evolve in PDW as it travels southward along the coast of South America and into the Southern Ocean? The results are expected to transform understanding of this essential micronutrient.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study investigates how rising ocean temperatures affect blue mussels, which are vital to marine ecosystems and global aquaculture. Blue mussels are being collected around Hokkaido, Japan, where ocean warming is occurring at a high level and varies around the island. This, combined with differences in temperature tolerance between the two blue mussel species in Hokkaido, is being used to determine how ocean temperatures are influencing community composition. By combining genetic tools, temperature data, and reproductive studies, this project explores how climate change is affecting mussels and what that could mean for ocean ecosystems. Undergraduate student training is a key aspect of the project, which will provide international fieldwork experience and on-campus research assistantships. Research activities are being incorporated into course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), and datasets serve as case studies in upper-level undergraduate biology courses.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to explore the effects of rising sea surface temperatures (SST) on the distribution, reproductive dynamics, and hybridization of the Mytilus edulis species complex in Hokkaido, Japan, where unprecedented decadal SST increases have been observed. Focusing on M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis, it aims to (1) re-examine species distributions after 17 years, (2) evaluate changes in reproductive stages, and (3) investigate genetic structures of hybrid populations. The project integrates traditional genotyping with double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) to assess shifts in population structure. SST trends are being analyzed using long-term remote sensing data, while histological techniques will measure reproductive responses. This research leverages Hokkaido's hybrid zones as natural experiments to understand differential species responses to climate warming, providing insights into the mechanisms driving biogeographic shifts, reproductive adaptations, and genetic variability in hybrid systems.

Research objectives are, firstly, characterize set of 5 applicators over a range of physical electrode configurations, gas types, flow rates and pressure, and electrical pulse parameters, to determine optimum conditions for producing desired radicals and active species, whilst avoiding undesirable plasma breakdown regimes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and spectrometry will be used to measure gas breakdown effectiveness, with photoresist removal by oxygen used to determine surface reaction rates. Secondly, data gathered from an existing nanosecond high voltage pulsed generator will define Phase 2 generator specifications.

They allow detailed investigations of phenomena at time and<br/>length scales difficult to observe directly.  In particular for complex systems such as the human brain, they have become<br/>indispensable for testing hypotheses and making predictions for experiments.  Cognitive phenomena such as learning and memory evolve<br/>on timescales from minutes to years, while the underlying processes on the level of individual nerve cells involve milliseconds timing.<br/>Bridging these timescales in computer simulations requires significant computational resources.  This project develops a new hardware system<br/>specifically designed to meet the increasing computational demands arising for increasingly sophisticated multi-scale brain models.  This<br/>new tool will both support fundamental neuroscience research and accelerate the translation of insights into biological computation<br/>into novel computing devices for commercially relevant applications. While the project focuses on computational neuroscience models, the<br/>implementation challenges and proposed solutions are applicable to the simulation of a broad class of dynamical systems such as power grids,<br/>financial markets, and epidemics.  Finally, this project will support the continuous development of open-source workflows for the design of<br/>asynchronous digital hardware.<br/><br/>Despite tremendous progress in recent decades, the biophysical mechanisms and computational principles underlying memory and learning<br/>in the brain remain poorly understood.  Due to the complexity of biological systems and the difficulty in reproducibility (in the<br/>engineering sense) of results, researchers rely on computational models to test hypotheses and to make experimental predictions.<br/>Modern models of neuronal computation and learning are formulated in continuous-time with continuous interactions, i.e., as systems of<br/>ordinary differential equations.  Yet, these are a poor fit for existing accelerators which are optimized for either continuous time<br/>with discrete (spiking) interactions or discrete time with continuous interactions.  A significant implementation challenge on the path to a<br/>scalable accelerator lies in efficient parallelization of the spatially discrete, non-locally and non-uniformly coupled systems of<br/>equations, in particular due to the communication requirements arising from continuous interactions in continuous time. To overcome these<br/>challenges, we propose a convergent simulator architecture that can accelerate continuous-time models of learning using neuromorphic<br/>hardware principles.  On the algorithmic end, we exploit the insight that continuously interacting systems do not necessarily require dense<br/>communication, i.e., that communication in implementations of these dynamics can be both sparse and adaptive to computational demand.  The<br/>resulting algorithms are ideally suited for implementation in asynchronous digital hardware with fine-grained parallelism and share<br/>similarities with existing neuromorphic computing approaches.  To validate our approach and ensure its usefulness to the scientific<br/>community, we create both an FPGA implementation and silicon prototype for a recently proposed cortical learning model and develop novel<br/>model variants for processing and learning across long time scales.<br/><br/>This collaborative U.S.-Swiss project is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and SNSF funds the partners in Switzerland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates how family experiences relate to children?s thinking about fairness and their aspirations for future work and family life. The broader impacts of this project include research training in developmental science and behavioral methods for graduate and undergraduate students in STEM, and broad dissemination of the research findings to the public.<br/><br/>There has been limited research into how children?s experiences with their immediate home environments ? namely their family?s division of labor ? impact their cognitive development. This project takes a socio-cognitive developmental approach by focusing on a relatively underexplored contributor to young children?s cognition: the experience of within family division of labor. In a series of studies, the project investigates (1) how family division of labor is associated with children?s own future expectations for both career and family life, (2) how naturally occurring distinct family structures (e.g., two-parent versus single-parent households) may influence young children?s understanding of how family labor can be divided, and (3) whether alternative examples can influence children?s beliefs about their future family lives and career aspirations. The project uses behavioral and observational data from parents and children, including experimental and survey approaches, to test possible causes of children?s career and family life aspirations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Isotope observations from national atmospheric monitoring sites will be combined with the next generation of atmospheric chemistry models, that include the ability to simulate isotope compositions, to fill critical knowledge gaps regarding nitrogen oxide sources and chemistry. This information will enable the development of more effective regulatory strategies for improving air quality.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are to quantify nitrate formation pathways and characterize the variability of nitrate precursor emissions across the US. The primary loss pathway of nitrogen oxide (NOx) is through its oxidation to atmospheric nitrate, mainly in the form of nitric acid (HNO3) and particulate nitrate (pNO3), with organic nitrates (RONO2) also contributing significantly to some regions. Atmospheric chemistry and transport models are often unable to accurately replicate observed concentrations of HNO3 and pNO3, including their magnitude, seasonality, and urban-rural gradients, posing significant challenges for predicting air quality responses under policy change. Stable isotope analyses of nitrogen and oxygen will be used to quantify precursor emissions and oxidation chemistry across the contiguous US. By integrating these novel isotopic measurements with 3-D chemistry transport modeling, this project will provide insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of precursor emissions and chemical formation pathways contributing to nitrate across diverse regions in the US, enhancing model predictions of nitrate.<br/><br/>An environmental chemistry summer camp, the first of its kind in South Carolina, will be developed leveraging the existence of an established summer camp entitled the Carolina Master Scholars Adventure Series (CMSAS), designed to attract academically talented middle and high school students.

Over the past 30 years, scientists have discovered renewable nanomaterials?tiny particles made from common, renewable resources like wood and crops. These materials combine the benefits of advanced technology with sustainability and safety, offering potential solutions to global challenges. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), which are tiny, rod-shaped particles, are an example of renewable nanomaterials. CNCs can naturally form strong, color-producing structures, which have potential uses in products like coatings, textiles, and electronic devices. However, the exact factors that control how CNCs assemble and create colors are not yet well understood. This research focuses on studying how different surfaces and drying conditions affect the assembly of CNCs. By uncovering these details, this project seeks to create sustainable colors and materials, leading to innovations like smart windows, anti-corrosion coatings, and even semiconductors. This project also includes a significant educational component that focuses on engaging college students, middle-school teachers and the public in science, technology and sustainability. This project specifically fosters interdisciplinary educational opportunities, involving hands-on learning, research experience, peer-teaching and mentoring, and partnerships between academia, local schools and communities. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER program is to develop a scientific foundation and an interdisciplinary, inclusive education platform to harness the self-assembly of renewable nanoparticles on solid surfaces for the controlled design of advanced sustainable materials and bio-inspired colors. Of particular interest are cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), plant-based nanoparticles that spontaneously self-assemble in aqueous suspensions to form chiral nematic structures at critical concentrations. These helicoidal structures achieve an arrested state which may be characterized as strong, color-generating nanostructures as a result of drying the colloidal state into a coating or a film (a process referred to as EISA or evaporation-induced self-assembly). The substrates onto which the dispersions dry are hypothesized to critically influence the self-assembly of CNCs, which in turn controls the generated visible colors. This program, therefore, aims to (1) elucidate the role of mounting substrate effects on the assembly and anchoring of these CNCs and (2) investigate the influence of drying dynamics on EISA, known to primarily govern color generation. A series of mounting substrates of varying surface properties and topography is used to investigate the deposition of CNC mono- and multilayers and assess the influence of substrate properties and external drying conditions on the drying dynamics of CNC cholesteric structures and the formation of colors. The outcomes of aims (1) and (2) are to be integrated into a novel interdisciplinary, multi-generational educational platform that will train the next generations of leaders in bio-inspired and sustainable colors for materials design and innovation. This platform will also aim to (3) develop a globally competitive STEM workforce to increase the engagement of younger generations from all backgrounds and the broader public in science, technology and sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Living organisms employ ions to transmit sensory signals, store information in memory, and convert chemical energy into work. These functionalities often involve ions in confined aqueous environments. In biological systems, ion transport occurs through channels, proteins, and membranes, where the confined geometries enable enhanced responsiveness to stimuli. Within cellular environments, these stimuli are self-generated by changes in local ionic and molecular compositions. <br/><br/>The team hypothesizes that the response of ions to external stimuli in artificial channels and synthetic confined morphologies can be used to emulate neuronal functions, such as information signaling and processing. To explore this, they aim to investigate the mechanisms by which information and energy are transferred via ionic structural changes and motion in confined environments. Ionic motion in solutions is typically driven externally by electric fields (electro-osmosis) or ionic concentration gradients (ionic diffusion-osmosis) and is strongly influenced by geometry and surface properties. Surface-induced electro-osmosis and ionic diffusion-osmosis occur when electric fields or gradients are self-generated due to non-uniform surface properties. These properties include spatially varying chemical activity, ion fluxes, and structural asymmetries, such as irregular charge distributions or asymmetric geometries. <br/><br/>The supported research will focus on developing theoretical, numerical, and computational approaches to design and analyze both externally driven and surface-induced ionic flows in confined systems, with an emphasis on understanding the roles of surface and geometric effects.  The goal will be to uncover the mechanisms underlying ionic signaling to enable the design of ionic systems capable of storing and transferring information, mimicking brain-like functionalities. This research has the potential to lay the foundation for the development of ionic machines?soft, adaptive materials that encode and process information using ionic currents. Additionally, the team is committed to educating students and postdocs in this emerging interdisciplinary field, which has immense technological relevance and promises to drive innovations in futuristic applications.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports research aimed at improving our understanding of ion transport in spatially-confined, electrically-charged environments. The team will attempt to design biomimetic materials that perform information and energy transference in nanochannels using ions as charge carriers. They will develop molecular simulations and continuum theory to determine the relationship between memory effects and ionic microstructures in the transport of ions. They will employ classification schemes to assess the system's ionic clustering conditions, topology, and time evolution required to produce non-linear and time-dependent ionic conductivities. These features are essential to create memory effects. The team will also explore the mechanisms to modify ionic conductivity in nanochannels by considering polarizable surfaces of various geometries and the impact of direct and time-dependent biasing electric fields. There are currently no efficient computational methods to address surface polarization effects on strong confinement by topologies other than flat. To develop ionic signals' information transference and processing paradigms, the team will develop computational methods to investigate ionic currents at pore boundaries and non-symmetric structures. They will also develop analytical models and numerical methods to analyze the combined effect of ionic fluxes with charge patterns in surface-induced electro-osmosis and ionic diffusion-osmosis.  The supported research will answer fundamental questions about information transference, signaling, and key biophysical processes. It will provide a physical understanding of molecular interactions in nano- and micro-sized confinement of charge-containing systems. In doing so, it will aid the design of new materials for various applications, including water desalination, ion separation, and blue energy harvesting. <br/><br/>This award will impact diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, and materials science, by employing the results of the supported research to interpret experimental measurements and design new functionalities. The results of all studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and the ream will develop open-source computational codes to assist researchers working on related theoretical and computational problems.

For many applications, their electrical conductivity must be increased by adding positive (p-type) or negative (n-type) charges. This process is known as molecular doping. While there are many p-type organic semiconductors, n-type organic semiconductors are far rarer. Moreover, they are less stable in ambient conditions, and it can be difficult to control their electrical conductivity. Advancing the field of organic electronics will require development of new electronic materials and processes for n-type doping. The goal of this project is to enhance the efficiency of n-type doping using a catalyst, a compound that enhances the speed of a chemical reaction. The investigator will combine synthetic strategies for new organic semiconductors with selection of n-type dopant-catalyst pairs to optimize the doping process. This research will result in a new class of n-type organic semiconductors with high-performance and enhanced stability. This research will also promote understanding on how the new n-type materials affect device performance. The PI?s educational goal is to foster a positive perception of organic electronic materials and devices. This will be accomplished through outreach to middle and high school students, coupling course instruction to undergraduate and graduate research projects, and providing internship opportunities at a start-up company to foster entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/><br/>The doping of inorganic materials has been instrumental in the progress of the semiconductor industry and advances in numerous fields including medical diagnostics, environmental science, and homeland security. For organic semiconductors, several strategies have yielded doped ?-electron solids with greatly enhanced optical and electronic properties as well as novel materials, physical phenomena, and device concepts. However, these advances were largely enabled by p-doped (hole transporting) materials, while useful n-doped (electron-transporting) materials have been limited in chemical accessibility, doping efficiency, and environmental stability. This limits their use in devices where both p-type and n-type semiconductors are required. Recently, the PI and coworkers discovered that metal nanoparticles (e.g., Au) can catalytically assist/accelerate the doping of representative organic semiconductors by molecular dopants. This research project will: 1) Elucidate the mechanism of the catalytic n-doping process and expand the scope to other type of catalysts. 2) Explore other dopants and semiconductors, implementing to date unexplored structural design and synthetic strategies. 3) Characterize catalyzed vs uncatalyzed doped film properties in terms of composition, electronic structure, morphology, microstructure, and opto-electronic response. Thus, this study plans to bring n-doped organics to unprecedented levels in terms of molecular/macromolecular materials designs, their accessibility in scale, and their useful opto-electronic properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some humans, however, can digest milk throughout their life because they carry genes that code for lactase persistence (LP). These genes emerged independently, and were selected for, in several populations where milk was a central food staple. This study examines the genetic, microbiome, and cultural factors that allow adult milk digestion among groups of peoples that are milk-dependent but lack LP genes. Additionally, the study examines whether genes that impact lactose tolerance co-evolved with those that permit the metabolization of high levels of milk-derived sugars. The study provides training opportunities in field, genetic, and computational methods and is relevant to human evolutionary history and public health. <br/><br/>This study collects novel genetic, microbiome, and phenotypic data to expand current knowledge on genetic and cultural adaptations to milk consumption. Cutting-edge functional genomics approaches enable the identification of novel enhancer regions near the lactase gene and near genes involved with sugar metabolism. Genetic data integration allows for the identification of novel genetic variants influencing lactase persistence. Lactose tolerance tests are applied in tandem with a genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify novel genetic loci linked to milk-induced blood sugar level increases. Gut microbiome sequencing enables the identification of bacteria that aid in digesting lactose and quantifies the extent to which milk preparation practices shape the composition of the gut microbiome. The study creates a large genomic and phenotypic database that informs the understanding of recent human evolutionary history and gene-culture co-evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

De minimis imports refer to the import of goods with a value below a certain limit, considered too small to be subject to taxes or customs duties. In the U.S., the 1930 Tariff Act arranges de minimis trade limits and allows people to import up to $800 worth of goods per day without duties or customs burden. De minimis imports in the U.S. form an increasingly important channel through which consumers and small businesses source their spending. The share of de minimis imports in total consumer imports and total e-commerce sales has grown continuously. This research builds and extends an economic framework that uses new data sources, including international shipments into the U.S. handled by three shipping carriers, to answer various research questions, such as How does the existence of de minimis policies affect firms and consumers? Which consumers are the largest beneficiaries of direct imports, and of de minimis imports? What are the implications of changing the de minimis rule and how would these effects vary across consumer types, and what is an optimal de minimis threshold? The research findings have the potential to inspire new trade policy designs, enhance the welfare of U.S. consumers and businesses, and help maintain the U.S.'s position as a global leader in international trade. <br/><br/>This award funds a research project to develop a quantitative trade framework where consumers have heterogeneous preferences across commodities of different value, and where firms are heterogeneous with respect to productivity and quality. Firms optimize over prices while considering incentives to avoid paying taxes. A range of firms who would have otherwise priced above the tax notch lower prices, implying a source of terms of trade gains for the country imposing de minimis. The empirical analysis identifies the relevant elasticity parameters of the model by leveraging the observed bunching in the distribution of shipment values at the tax notch created by de minimis policies, drawing parallels to methods used in public economics to analyze labor supply elasticities. The combination of the model and estimated parameters is used to determine the aggregate, distributional consequences, and efficiency of de minimis policies, and to gauge the welfare effects of direct low-value shipments more broadly. Additionally, by extending their framework, the researchers answer important research questions concerning the global impacts of de minimis rules and their impacts on firms. This research could enable researchers and decisionmakers to better evaluate the value of de minimis trade, the impact of trade policies on these imports, and their effects on participant welfare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The processes that generate unique concentrations of  species remain poorly understood. Madagascar exemplifies biodiversity hotspots: it is home to an extraordinary number of species restricted to small, localized areas on this Indian Ocean island. This project will test three possible explanations of how these biodiversity hotspots formed in members of the tree genus Diospyros (the source of valuable ebony wood) by examining their evolutionary relationships and calculating how sensitive a species is to environmental conditions. A better understanding of these processes will help explain why some parts of the world have exceptionally high levels of biological diversity, why so many species only occur in very limited areas, and how we can better conserve them. This project will also provide educational and training opportunities to graduate students and high school students, giving them foundational tools to contribute to the scientific workforce and develop into future leaders in STEM fields. <br/> <br/>This research will leverage existing DNA bank material and conduct targeted field sampling to generate a robust, time-calibrated phylogeny of Diospyros (Ebenaceae) from Madagascar and surrounding regions using the Angiosperm 353 target enrichment probe set. The resulting phylogeny will be used to: 1) determine the biogeographic origins of Malagasy Diospyros, 2) produce a unifying taxonomic framework for all Malagasy Diospyros species along with practical, interactive digital identification tools, and 3) conduct the very first head-to-head comparison of three competing hypotheses of island biodiversity and microendemism on Madagascar. Specifically, researchers will assess support for these hypotheses by: 1) quantifying species niche breadth using novel phylogenetically-informed species distribution models, 2) conducting phylo-spatial tests of endemism and phylogenetic turnover, and 3) examining patterns of niche conservatism and shifts in the rate of diversification through time.

Nematocytes, the stinging cells found only in cnidarians (corals, jellyfish, and their relatives), are an important model for understanding the origin of novelty. Nematocytes derive their sting from their ability to eject a tiny, venom-laden harpoon from a pressurized compartment inside a cell. The compartment, and the harpoon it contains, are constructed of an unusual protein called minicollagen, which is also found only in cnidarians. Recent advances in genome sequencing have greatly improved our ability to detect novel protein-coding sequences from DNA; still, there remains a critical gap in our understanding of how novel proteins (like minicollagen) give rise to novel traits (like the nematocyte). To address this gap, the proposed work is characterizing the protein-protein interactions necessary for the development of the stinging apparatus in diverse types of nematocytes. Additionally, to understand how novel protein-coding sequences acquire adaptive functions, this work is investigating the processes that direct proteins to their proper locations inside the cell. Ultimately, these investigations will enable the development of designer cells with traits that have never come together naturally. The educational goal of this research is to better prepare undergraduate students to pursue careers in integrative research through development of a research-based lab course in evolutionary cell biology. This research is also increasing public science literacy by providing new and innovative learning resources to STEM educators and museum visitors.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this work is to develop a framework for predicting the emergence of novel traits from novel protein-coding genes by investigating the processes that drove the emergence of the nematocyte. To achieve this goal, the proposed work is using mass spectroscopy and proteomic analysis to characterize how unique nematocyte types emerge from taxon-specific interactions among novel proteins (Aim 1). Additionally, using genome engineering to alter protein localization, the proposed work is reconstructing the order of events that permitted the fixation of the nematocyte-specific protein minicollagen in the stem cnidarian genome (Aim 2). Collectively, this work is revealing how functional interactions among novel proteins drive the emergence of novel traits. This work will advance our ability to predict the fate of novel proteins and contribute significantly to explaining cases of novelty that arise de novo from new genes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates one such form of variation: differences in how many copies an individual has of certain genes. The genes encoding ribosomal RNAs are present in hundreds of copies per genome, and two humans may have differences of hundreds of copies between them. Variation in these genes has recently been linked to cancer, aging, and cell function. This project will explore the minimal copy number requirements of these genes for development to healthy adulthood and advance our understanding of the interaction between copy number differences and health-relevant characteristics. Ultimate outcomes of this work may add new nuance to our understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype. The project will create new opportunities for undergraduate student training in genetics and molecular biology at SUNY Brockport. Research goals will also be incorporated into an undergraduate research course format to broaden accessibility of original research experiences for students. <br/><br/>The phenotypic consequences of genetic interaction with ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) copy number will be assessed using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, an animal that exhibits substantial variation in rDNA copy number between wild isolates. The lower bounds of copy number sufficiency for development and fertility will be explored through CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic engineering of the rDNA copy locus, and the impact of this variation on tumor formation and lifespan will be characterized. This project will furthermore explore rDNA copy number variation in the context of dysregulated cell function, using conditions of altered ribosome regulation or compromised small RNA gene regulation. A discovery-based undergraduate research course will provide students with training in single guide RNA cloning and application of a CRISPR-activation approach to overexpress target genes in rDNA copy number variant backgrounds. Students will train in hypothesis-based investigation, molecular techniques, and organismal phenotyping to assess the consequences of rDNA copy number variation in altered cellular environments.

Tracing fossil remains over time helps us understand evolutionary processes, extinction events, and shifts in geographic patterns of organisms, especially in response to environmental changes such as warming events, ice ages, and shifts between wet and arid climates.  Linking past shifts with alterations in the types, abundances and distributions of species can provide clues of the potential impacts of future changes. The majority of fossil discoveries are of plants and animals, which represent a small slice of life forms on Earth. The vast majority of species and genetic diversity are found in microscopic forms, including organisms called protists. Despite the importance of these tiny organisms, their use in understanding the impacts of environmental change is severely limited because very few fossil records exist. Over the past three decades, the PI has uncovered numerous fossil deposits rich in these microscopic organisms that span millions of years of geologic time, and significant periods of environmental change. The objective of this work is to synthesize the extensive body of information on past microscopic life, with the goals of improving the ability of scientists to model future impacts of environmental changes on Earth?s ecosystems, and to better understand evolutionary patterns of these microbes.  A broader impact of this work will include securing and archiving the extensive fossil collection, and associated data, in an established museum to benefit future exploration of these important organisms.<br/><br/>Being an OPUS award, this project is synthesis driven, using an extensive fossil database of freshwater microfossil species established using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses of hundreds of rock samples from numerous North American sites.  Samples and specimens were derived from rocks taken from deep drilled cores, numerous outcrops, and subsamples of rock matrices from plant and animal macrofossils archived at multiple museums. The sites span 82 million years of geologic history dating from the Cretaceous.  Documentation of new species, morphological traits, and estimates of environmental conditions will be determined for each protist group represented in the fossil collection.  Next, a comparative synthesis of the diversity, distribution, ecology and morphological form across all groups will be made.  The synthesis will also evaluate the potential of each protist group to migrate under different climate scenarios, their use as bioindicators, the extent of evolutionary change, and provide estimates of minimum age constraints for use in molecular phylogenetic studies. All field and laboratory results will be digitized and organized into catalogs by group and site, and made available to the scientific community.

The project will focus on re-engineering the mitochondrial localization signals of five DNA glycosylases that specifically excise oxidized DNA damage, namely OGG1, NTHL1, NEIL1, NEIL2, and NEIL3 to improve their targeting to mitochondria while preserving their nuclear localization. A novel computational framework will be used to optimize mitochondrial targeting signals through sequence modifications that enhance mitochondrial import efficiency. The re-engineered glycosylases will be validated experimentally for localization and their enzymatic activity assessed through biochemical assays. The functional impact of enhanced mitochondrial localization will be evaluated by examining oxidative damage repair capacity, mtDNA stability, and mitochondrial function.

In recent years, however, we have come to understand that the dynamics of a protein are essential to its function.  More tools are needed to examine protein dynamics. In this research, the investigator will seek to apply a method of time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy developed in his lab to diverse biological molecules of eminent interest in medicine, in collaboration with three renowned scientific laboratories, thus broadening the utility of this important tool for studying protein dynamics.  The method involves rapidly mixing two components of a reaction, allowing the reaction to proceed for a controlled length of time, then rapidly freezing the sample for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Time-resolved cryo-EM will show the progression of a biochemical reaction as a sequence of intermediate states, like successive frames of a movie. The application of this method in the life sciences will greatly expand our understanding of molecular interactions in the cell in healthy persons, as well as their disruption in disease. This research is truly interdisciplinary as it is at the intersection of biology, biomedical engineering, nanofabrication, microfluidics and high-performance computing.  As such it will inform molecular medicine and inspire projects for graduate students in the labs of the collaborators and nation-wide as it opens avenues of research and training in health science research never explored before.<br/><br/>Using newly designed PDMS-based microfluidic chips, the PI's team will apply the time-resolved cryo-EM sample preparation method, which his lab has developed and demonstrated with the ribosome, to a diverse range of other molecules: (1) RNA polymerase, a large molecule that copies the genetic information from DNA to make mRNA; (2) GLP1R, a G-protein coupled receptor found on beta cells of the pancreas and neurons of the brain; and (3) multi-drug efflux transporter AcrB, to be isolated and inserted into proteoliposomes.  Although the structures of these molecules are known, their mode of action involving domain motions in the time range of 10 to 1000 milliseconds cannot be explored with normal methods of structure research.  Time-resolved cryo-EM can fill this knowledge gap. Samples will be supplied by three collaborating labs, and feasibility of determining intermediate states in the functional cycle will be explored. The experience gained will guide the decisions of the PI?s team on necessary design modifications, desired ranges of control parameters, and the addition of other features required to make the device generally applicable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neodymium is essential to permanent magnets which are key to a wide range of modern technologies including wind turbines, electric vehicles, cell phones, and defense applications such as fighter jets, submarines and drones making a domestic supply critical. Our alternative to the current technology is protected by a combination of patent applications and trade secrets, both competitive advantages which are expected to expand via this project. A toll manufacturing business model is intended to help deploy the technology while insulating the startup company from commodity price fluctuations. The proposed technology is presently the sole market offering for the startup and thus this project is essential to the success of the company. The company intends to target domestic supply chain applications for initial market entry bolstering domestic manufacturing and improving national security.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to disrupt the current (>90% market share) oxyfluoride molten salt electrolysis for reduction of neodymium metal. The current oxyfluoride process is a semi-batch process that relies on consumption of a graphite anode which produces carbon dioxide and perfluorocarbons pollutants. The direct generation of perfluorocarbons, which are strictly regulated by the US EPA, makes domestic deployment of the oxyfluoride process challenging and costly. A novel alternative molten salt electrolysis process has been developed that is more electrically efficient than oxyfluoride. However, the process was originally developed for intermediate temperature, solid neodymium reduction. To achieve cost-competitiveness, this project aims to advance the novel process to run stably for extended durations at higher temperatures where liquid neodymium can be produced continuously, achieving cost-advantaged neodymium reduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stiff arteries affect up to 20 million people over the age of 60. The solution is a medical device that is implanted through minimally invasive procedures, serving the patients who are not responsive to medication. The treatment population can benefit from a higher quality of life and a lower risk of complications including stroke, heart failure, heart attack, kidney failure, and vision loss. In addition to increased patient health, this solution can result in a reduction of expensive surgeries associated with cardiovascular diseases and strokes. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This technology is based on the development of a physical approach to reduce systolic blood pressure. Within a pulse of blood from the heart, energy is usually distributed through the arteries due to their compliance. However, as people age, the arteries stiffen, leading to reduced buffering of this pulse wave and ultimately to isolated systolic hypertension. This disease is difficult to adapt to, since it stems from a physical change in the molecules that make up the walls of the blood vessels. The solution restores the native compliance of the blood vessels using an implantable device, which then brings the patient's blood pressure back to a healthy state. This solution differs from current treatments by directly treating stiff arteries, which are one of the most critical risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The LA metropolitan area sits above a deep sedimentary basin that significantly affects the level of ground shaking from local and regional earthquakes. The basin has a complex tectonic history of extension and compression and is also crosscut by numerous faults. This has resulted in a complicated subsurface structure that leads to significant variation in site amplification of seismic waves across the basin, as evidenced by the recorded ground shaking following the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake. In the summer of 2022, a temporary 300-node geophone array was deployed across the entire LA basin, providing a seismic data set with uniform and dense coverage for the first time. In this project, the researchers will analyze these data and combine them with other available seismic and gravity observations in the region to construct a detailed 3D basin model. The model will help explain the level of amplification in different areas of the basin as well as its lateral variations The resulting model may be used to model ground motion for realistic earthquake scenarios, which is vital for evaluating infrastructure preparedness.  In addition, this project will explore the connection between the resulting seismic velocity model with mapped geological features, and the tectonic evolution of the LA Basin. Through the research, the project will support graduate and postdoctoral education, and the scientific findings will contribute to seismic hazard assessment efforts in southern California.<br/><br/>The density of the 300 sensor LA nodal array deployed in 2022 will enable the use of novel passive seismic imaging methods. By extracting Rayleigh and Love surface waves from multi-component ambient noise correlations, it will be possible to measure their velocity dispersion and Rayleigh wave ellipticity in the region. Techniques based on particle motion and apparent slowness will be developed to isolate different modes of surface waves. Both isotropic as well as radially and azimuthally anisotropic basin structures will be investigated using surface wave measurements. By using receiver function and autocorrelation methods, in addition to surface wave properties, it will be possible to determine crustal discontinuities, including major intra-basin sedimentary interfaces, the bottom of the basin, and the shape of the Moho beneath it. The use of gravity data will guide the identification of converted and reflected phases and determine the tectonic extension that the basin has experienced, enabling evaluation of the extent of thermal subsidence that has occurred within it. The dataset that will be analyzed is unique in an academic setting for its density, regularity, and completeness of coverage, allowing for the exploration of new methodologies. These include mapping shallow seismicity to identify possible unknown faults, using reflected surface waves to map the properties of faults within the basin as well as discover new ones, and determining aspects of the stress field through anisotropy. The 3D basin model constructed in this project is expected to be more accurate than the current community velocity models (CVMs), enabling more reliable ground motion predictions for various earthquake rupture scenarios. The new model will be validated through simulations of recent earthquakes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Non-Technical Summary  <br/><br/>Many technologically relevant fields require increasingly complex materials that pose severe challenges in their preparation and development.  The limitations of current synthetic approaches thus represent a major bottleneck to the extensive tuning of physical properties and for the realization of potential commercial applications.  This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF's Division of Materials Research, addresses the challenges inherent to the preparation of crystalline semiconductors for facilitating the efficient capture of sunlight for the reduction of carbon dioxide.  Results from this work leading to the synthesis of new semiconductors, and, for example, the efficient production of chemical fuels from them, are important to our nation's progress toward clean and renewable energy production.  The discovery of compounds occurring at the limits of synthesizability is aimed at understanding the impacts of new structural features on their properties and stability during the capture and conversion of solar energy, and thus pushing the frontiers of structure-property relationships.  More broadly, the advancement of synthetic approaches to prepare complex semiconductors helps to accelerate their technological development for many related applications in the electronics industry.  The professional training of undergraduate and graduate students is provided within these research activities, such as advanced characterization techniques at national laboratories, with a focus on the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups.  Educational efforts include the development of an undergraduate laboratory module as well as a professional training workshop at North Carolina State University in advanced materials characterization.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2. Technical Summary<br/><br/>Advancing capabilities to attain crystalline solids with technologically useful properties can be bolstered by the development of synthetic approaches to target new compositions and structures that are thermodynamically unstable, or metastable.  The discovery of the underlying factors leading to their kinetic stabilization, including for those compounds not yet predicted computationally, represents a central objective of the research project. Research plans for this project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF's Division of Materials Research, specifically focus on the investigation of metastable, Cu(I)-containing semiconductors that have promising applications as p-type semiconductors for the absorption of solar energy and the catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide at their surfaces. Synthetic aspects are aimed at advancing the accessible range of crystalline structures and optimal photoelectrochemical properties through the unlocking of relatively low temperature pathways using flux-mediated reaction conditions.  Structural characterization by X-ray and neutron scattering is used to help answer key questions regarding the mechanistic synthetic transformations and the resulting kinetic stability.  Fundamental insights into the optimal tuning of their crystalline structures and chemical compositions to achieve the efficient reduction of carbon dioxide under sunlight are probed in depth by photoelectrochemical property measurements.  The key relationships to their thermodynamic instability and electronic structures are also established with synergistic computational efforts using density functional theory.  Educational initiatives include professional training for students involved on this project, a new undergraduate laboratory module in solid-state chemistry, and an annual workshop in materials characterization using Rietveld methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Living creatures use Earth?s predictable, 24-hr light:dark cycle to organize and optimize biological processes. While this has been beneficial for millions of years, the modern use of artificial light at night, which includes environmental light pollution and night shiftwork, hijacks light-sensing mechanisms and disrupts biological processes. Recently, light has been found to affect one of the most shared and essential biological processes ? breathing. This project will advance the understanding of how light affects fundamental biology by defining the neurobiological pathways used by light to affect breathing. Integrated into the research program, this project emphasizes the education and training of undergraduate students in creative problem-solving skills. These skills are expected to foster the next generation of STEM innovators to promote scientific discovery in an ever-changing world.<br/><br/>Defining the neurobiological circuits that mediate light?s effects on breathing can better equip society to predict and respond to the physiological effects of light pollution. The goal of this project is to identify the retinal and brain pathways used by light to modulate breathing and blood gas homeostasis. This project uses whole-body plethysmography and a combination of chemogenic and viral approaches in transgenic mice to: 1) Determine the neuronal populations by which intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) modulate breathing rate and minute ventilation, and 2) Determine the extent to which ipRGC projections to the hypothalamic biological clock organize the respiratory chemoreflex to the light:dark cycle. This contribution is significant because it critically expands the current understanding of breathing behavior to include light as a fundamentally important, ubiquitous, and previously undocumented modulator of breathing. Overall, this project is expected to positively impact several research fields, including basic and clinical respiratory physiology, circadian biology, neuroscience, and ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This meeting will be the third event in a sequence of annual JAF DEDS conferences moving between Auburn, UAB, FIU, FSU. The sizable growth of applied mathematicians specializing in partial differential equations and applied dynamical systems in the states of Alabama and Florida has led to new level of research activity in mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, medical imaging, mathematical physics, applied harmonic analysis and spectral theory. This regional conference series connects newly formed and existing research groups and provides opportunity for dissemination of recent results, especially to early career researchers without federal funding, facilitating interaction between an increasing number of regional graduate students and the internationally recognized experts in the field. The Third JAF DEDS Conference will be preceded by a graduate students day on May 20th, 2025, featuring two mini-courses by guest presenters and a professional development panel. Priority for financial support will be given to those with no other sources of support and special attention will be given to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career researchers. <br/> <br/>The tools and techniques from dynamical systems have been used to establish existence and investigate stability of special solutions (pulses, traveling waves, steady states, and fronts) for large variety of differential equations. These solution are often used to model complex physical phenomena across a range of applications, including evolution of surface water waves, coherent structures in optics, combustion phenomena, and plasma dynamics. Motivated by the recent progress, the scientific program of the conference will be centered around a variety of equations from the mathematical physics modeling optical systems, fluid motion and waves in novel materials. These systems are described by equations of Klein-Gordon or Nonlinear Schrodinger type and are either Hamiltonian or dissipative in nature. Understanding them will improve our theoretical knowledge and provide new insights into practical aspects of nonlinear optics, electronic transport in irregular media, new materials, and fluid dynamics.

One pathway toward increasing the performance of solar cells is to increase the portion of sunlight that can be used to generate electricity. Much of the sun?s light is wasted because it consists of low-energy photons which are not absorbed by the semiconductors used to make solar cells. Low energy photons can be made usable by transforming them into higher energy photons through a process called upconversion. For example, two low-energy infrared photons can be converted into a higher-energy visible photon. This project will use a combination of organic molecules known to enable the upconversion process and metal halide perovskites, which are currently being investigated for use in solar cells. The perovskite will be used to absorb the low energy light and excite the organic molecules. Upon successful upconversion, higher energy light can then be absorbed for use in a solar cell. A combination of optical techniques and microscopy will lead to a detailed understanding of the underlying processes. Beyond the scientific impact of this project, a goal is to guide students to further pursue a scientific career and inspire their independent research, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving capabilities by strong mentorship in undergraduate research and education. This activity aims to inspire a new generation of scientists. To close the growing rift between scientists and the non-scientific community, a strong foundation linking the PI?s institution with the local community will be built by outreach lectures and science communication (?Kitchen Chemistry? or ?Kitchen Spectroscopy?) via local TV and social media outlets.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Efficient interconversion of solar energy to chemical or electrical energy is the key to meeting the future energy demands of our society. Improved photon utilization through an upconversion process involving triplet generation at the perovskite/organic semiconductor interface is a very promising approach to increase the photoexcited state lifetime and therefore, overall device efficiencies. The principal investigator will explore perovskite-sensitized solid-state upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation to unravel the role of microscale and nanoscale molecular arrangement in OSCs. A combination of optical spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy will be employed to elucidate the local optoelectronic properties originating from specific molecular arrangements of polyacenes on perovskite substrates. Control over orbital coupling by molecular placement will allow the involved steps to be systematically evaluated. The main goal is to understand why commonly utilized annihilators which exhibit high efficiencies in solution (e.g., diphenylanthracene) do not yield transferable results in the solid state, and how aggregation effects can be harnessed or avoided to improve solid-state upconversion yields. To achieve this goal, new perovskite/triplet acceptor pairs will be developed to investigate why promising solution-based triplet annihilators perform poorly in the solid state. The effect of local intermolecular interactions on the upconversion process will be studied on the microscale and the nanoscale using optical scanning probe microscopy and time-resolved optical spectroscopy. The combination of characterization methods spanning from the ensemble to the atomic scale will reveal the local structure-property relationships governing the bulk optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskite/OSC-based TTA upconversion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today's information technologies utilize the electron charge as the primary carrier of information. However, the electron also carries a tiny angular momentum called spin that enables spintronics, which is the spin-based counterpart of familiar electronics. Two key phenomena in contemporary spintronics research are the spin-transfer torque, where flowing electrons interact with local magnetization in a material, and spin pumping, where a varying local magnetization generates a spin current. Spin-transfer torque underlies a host of novel technologies, such as magnetic random access memories that are already commercially available, and neuromorphic circuits for hardware-based artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>Even though spintronic phenomena are fundamentally quantum in nature, the standard microscopic understanding of both spin torque and spin pumping is essentially a quantum-classical hybrid: Flowing electrons are treated quantum-mechanically while localized spins are treated as classical objects. This heretofore necessary simplification results in a number of unsolved puzzles when one tries to explain certain spintronic experiments. These puzzles can be traced to quantum effects where quantum entanglement stands out. Entanglement is one of the most remarkable features of the quantum world whereby in a system of just two entangled quantum particles (e.g., two electron spins) what happens to one of them instantaneously determines what happens to the other one, even if they are arbitrarily far away from each other. The overarching goal of this project is to open new avenues for spintronics by bringing entanglement effects into the realm of spin-torque and spin-pumping phenomena. In turn, and in addition to resolving existing puzzles, this will make it possible to design novel protocols for probing quantum magnetic materials via the extensive toolbox of experimental techniques developed for spintronics over the past three decades.<br/><br/>In addition to the development of theoretical methods and open-source software for modeling spin transport in quantum materials, the project will also include advanced training for graduate students, preparing them for a productive participation in the nation's quantum workforce. The project will also provide opportunities for high-school students from Delaware and neighboring states to work on magnetism research projects and prepare them for competitions in math, science, and technology.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The dynamics of localized spins within magnets in contemporary spintronics, driven out of equilibrium by injecting current or by applying external fields, relies on the celebrated Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation that considers their local magnetization as a classical vector. The applicability of the LLG equation demands that the underlying quantum state of localized spins must remain unentangled. However, several experiments in spintronics involving particular antiferromagnetic layers cannot be explained by LLG dynamics. This suggests the presence of mixed entangled quantum states of many spins within nonequilibrium antiferromagnets, despite their interaction with the inevitable dissipative environment.<br/><br/>The project will develop theories to explain experimental puzzles in antiferromagnetic spintronics, as well as in current-driven atomic and molecular spins on surfaces as a smaller version of quantum spin systems that can serve as testbed for new method development. These predictions can then be exploited to design experiments where spin torque and spin pumping are used to probe exotic magnetic quantum matter. Such matter notably includes quantum spin liquids, characterized by long-range entanglement and fractionalized excitations, whose confirmation and control is highly sought as a resource for topological quantum computing. The theory developed in this project will also guide experiments toward direct quantification of entanglement of antiferromagnets or quantum spin liquids, but via table-top experiments suitable for two-dimensional and/or nonequilibrium materials where neutron scattering becomes inapplicable. These activities will require construction of new theoretical methods to study the fundamental problem of quantum transport of spin and charge in strongly interacting boundary-driven systems that are coupled to different baths at their edges.<br/><br/>In addition to the development of theoretical methods and open-source software for modeling spin transport in quantum materials, the project will also include advanced training for graduate students, preparing them for a productive participation in the nation's quantum workforce. The project will also provide opportunities for high-school students from Delaware and neighboring states to work on magnetism research projects and prepare them for competitions in math, science, and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are the most numerous life-forms on the planet. In general, bacteriophages consist of a genome made either of DNA or RNA that is packaged into a protective protein shell called a capsid. While much is known about bacteriophages with DNA genomes, far less is understood about those with RNA genomes. This project will investigate how these RNA genomes are packaged into their protein capsids. In particular, the project will describe the shapes into which the RNA genomes are folded, and how these shapes are recognized by the proteins and selected for packaging. By identifying these structures, the project will inform the design of synthetic capsids capable of packaging synthetic RNA molecules for use in RNA-based technologies. Furthermore, these RNA structures will facilitate the discovery of new RNA viruses by learning how to recognize viral RNA in the sequence libraries obtained directly from the environment. These discoveries will advance the understanding of RNA bacteriophage diversity and enable the production of novel nanoscale materials derived from their coat proteins. Throughout, the project will train graduate and undergraduate students in challenging fields of physical chemistry, biochemistry, and computational biology.<br/><br/>Bacteriophage MS2 is the canonical model system for studying viral RNA packaging, yet the mechanisms by which MS2 coat proteins selectively package their RNA genomes while excluding abundant cellular RNA remain unclear. While RNA of a model phage MS2 is believed to contain structural signals that are recognized by its coat proteins during packaging, the precise nature of these signals and their role in selective packaging is not fully understood. This project will use quantitative packaging experiments inside the cells to identify key RNA structures involved in selectivity. Plasmid-encoded RNA molecules with defined structures will compete with the cellular transcriptome for packaging by MS2 coat proteins. Single-particle imaging and high-throughput sequencing will quantify the packaged RNA composition, providing a direct measure of selectivity. These measurements will be used to critically evaluate current hypotheses of selective packaging and identify the key RNA structures involved. The project will then use these structures to screen metagenomic datasets for previously undescribed RNA bacteriophage genomes. Once discovered, the coat proteins from newly identified bacteriophages will be expressed in cells to produce protein capsids. In addition to verifying the discovered bacteriophages, these capsids will provide the research community with new protein nanoparticles for applications in biotechnology and nanoscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These machines can improve how individuals and small companies make products by increasing the speed and precision of making products while reducing the costs and labor compared to typical ways of manufacturing. The current ability of digital fabrication to support many kinds of manufacturing is limited by how existing equipment performs when run in an automated mode. Designers and manufacturers rely on techniques for making products that are specific to domains and materials.  Their techniques often require combining automatic and manual operations. However, current digital fabrication technologies enforce the same ways of operating regardless of domain or material.  The machine control methods limit operators to setting machine instructions in advance and responding to machine errors. These methods prevent operators from applying their domain knowledge or manual skills in the fabrication process and keep them from using digital fabrication with their existing way of making things. This project aims to enable experts to use digital fabrication technologies in powerful domain-specific workflows. The project will investigate new machine control methods and software design techniques that blend precise automated ways of making products with an expert controlling the machine by hand. This research will create new business opportunities by allowing domain experts to adapt digital manufacturing processes to the making of their products. This project will also help users tailor digital fabrication machines to their specific needs, which will lead to new products and materials, as well as new types of digital fabrication.<br/><br/>This project will establish domain-specific computer-numerical control (CNC) toolpath abstractions, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software interfaces, CNC machine architecture, and collaborative engineering methodologies for building cross-domain digital fabrication technologies for professional practice. Prior research has examined novice-oriented digital fabrication technologies focusing on high-level design specification and entirely automated fabrication practices or separate efforts in interactive digital fabrication interaction. To date, research in digital fabrication lacks a systematic investigation of the relationship between CNC machine mechanisms, control architecture, CAM toolpath design, and operation paradigms that blend automated and manual control. The investigators will conduct a comparative analysis of the practices of contemporary product designers and manufacturers who produce either manually or digitally fabricated products in low volume. The investigators will use insights on the barriers that practitioners from different domains face in the manufacturing workflow to inform the development of CNC control methods that enable creators to safely and efficiently reconfigure CNC machines to build new products. The investigators will pair the development of new CNC engineering techniques with the investigation of CAM design technologies that allow practitioners to precisely control machine behavior, coordinate machining operations with manual intervention, and understand and predict the fabrication workflow. The investigators will integrate their research with an education agenda that spans higher education and secondary public school education aimed at engaging students in computer science and entrepreneurial learning through applying digital fabrication to produce functional products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to vast design freedom, the rapid laser melting during additive manufacturing can produce highly refined structures at the nanoscale in metals for achieving high strength. However, high-strength nanostructured metals often suffer from limited ductility, which is an ability to be stretched without breaking. This strength-ductility tradeoff has been a long-standing challenge in materials science and the quest for materials that can simultaneously enhance strength and ductility has been a long-sought-after goal. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of materials that contain high concentrations of five or more different elements in near equal atomic proportions, in contrast to traditional alloys that are primarily based on one major element with some minor alloying elements added. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental investigations into additive manufacturing of HEAs towards strength-ductility synergy beyond current benchmarks. This project is helping to understand the microstructural origin and deformation mechanism that govern the mechanical properties of 3D-printed HEAs by integrating microstructural characterization, mechanical testing, and computational modeling. The knowledge being established in this project will guide the development of strong yet tough metal alloys for various applications such as advanced energy systems, transportation, and defense. This CAREER award also includes a significant educational component that engages students in research across high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. Through broadening participation of underrepresented groups, this project is diversifying the next generation of researchers and STEM leaders in materials science and advanced manufacturing. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>3D-printed metal alloys usually involve highly localized melting processes, strong temperature gradients, and fast cooling rates. These extreme printing conditions result in far-from-equilibrium states that enable microstructural refinement to the nanoscale for achieving high strength. However, high-strength nanostructured metal alloys often suffer from limited ductility, known as the strength-ductility tradeoff. Through harnessing the extreme printing conditions of laser additive manufacturing and favorable compositional effect of HEAs, a unique type of hierarchical microstructure in the form of dual-phase nanolamellae embedded in microscale eutectic colonies is achieved in 3D-printed eutectic HEAs. This process gives rise to an exceptional combination of strength and ductility. This CAREER award is investigating the fundamental processing-structure-property relationship in these strong yet ductile nanolamellar EHEAs produced by additive manufacturing. The scientific objectives in this study are to: 1) Understand how laser printing protocols affect the solidification microstructure and mechanical properties of 3D-printed eutectic HEAs. Process-sensitive thermal modeling will be developed to unveil the physical link between the complex printing parameters and the solidification microstructure and resulting mechanical properties. 2) Unravel the deformation mechanism and micromechanical response of 3D-printed eutectic HEAs by in situ neutron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. 3) Elucidate the phase transformation pathways in 3D-printed eutectic HEAs upon post-printing heat treatment. A fundamental investigation of the phase transformation pathways and kinetics during annealing of the far-from-equilibrium 3D-printed HEAs are being performed to expand the palette for materials design. The mechanistic insights and design motifs being provided by this CAREER project have broad implications for the development of hierarchical, multi-phase, nanostructured alloys with excellent mechanical properties. This award also encompasses an educational and outreach plan to advance research training and education of next-generation students and underrepresented groups. New outreach initiatives such as 3D printing workshops and a summer-enrichment program will be developed to inspire women and underrepresented minorities and increase the diversity of our future workforce in materials science and advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These innovations demand more than correct operation; autonomous machines, particularly those powered by deep neural networks (DNNs) in autonomous vehicles, must meet strict timing requirements that necessitate rigorous real-time safety certifications. Such certifications rely on advanced analytical methods combining worst-case execution time analysis with schedulability analysis to ensure operational safety and reliability. However, significant challenges persist in integrating worst-case execution time and schedulability analysis, especially in evaluating the timing accuracy of systems that use computing accelerators for autonomous driving. The project?s novelties are its development of an integrated architecture that leverages hardware-software co-design to address these complex issues, with the aim of significantly enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems and other autonomous machines. The project's broader significance and importance lie in its commitment to integrating this research into educational and outreach activities to encourage diversity in STEM fields and broaden participation in computing and engineering. <br/><br/>To achieve these research goals, the project is organized around three core objectives: (1) developing an accelerator-enhanced SoC that enables real-time scheduling decisions directly at the hardware level, supporting efficient task management by the runtime scheduler; (2) designing an accelerator-aware real-time scheduling framework that accurately characterizes and assesses the complex execution behaviors and timing requirements of DNN tasks within the operating system layer; and (3) implementing an outlier management strategy to derive reliable worst-case execution time values for DNN tasks on accelerators at the application layer. Together, these objectives advance system software to reliably manage DNN-intensive applications on customized heterogeneous SoCs and establish precise, temporally accurate resource allocation schemes.

Understanding these structures, especially in long questions such as ?What does her mother think she is reading?? requires children to grasp intricate relationships between words and hold information in memory while comprehending longer sentences. Remarkably, by age four, children achieve this feat despite two major challenges: (1) cognitive limitations, such as reduced memory capacity compared to adults, and (2) variations in language input, as children are exposed to widely different linguistic environments but still succeed in learning these complex relationships. This research investigates theories of language learning and examines whether they can account for children?s ability to overcome these challenges. The findings provide valuable insights into the processes of language acquisition and child development, as well as practical strategies to support children?s learning.<br/><br/>The project employs computational cognitive modeling to implement a learning theory of wh-dependency acquisition. This approach concretely specifies how the learner processes wh-dependencies in child-directed speech and how the learner outputs behavior that demonstrates adult-like wh-dependency knowledge. To implement the two sources of limitations outlined above, this research tests the performance of the learning model under child-like memory limitations and examines how the model behaves with input across different environmental settings. To ensure the learning theories reflect real-world scenarios, the research also expands a database of child-directed speech to better capture the input children encounter. By precisely implementing learning theories and aligning them with limitations children face, this project aspires to uncover foundational principles of language learning and further our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that support this remarkable ability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How brains handle these categorization decisions flexibly and adaptively remains elusive. This project investigates the role of brain waves in the prefrontal cortex in categorization task. The project studies brain activity in humans and animals while performing a decision-making task to leverage a computational model to better understand the brain mechanisms involved. This project has potential to open a new window into understanding of decision making and will set the stage for future investigations into disorders, such as Parkinson?s disease and schizophrenia, in which both brain waves and cognitive function are impaired.<br/><br/>This project tests the novel hypothesis that beta oscillations at different frequencies could act as separate channels to selectively transmit decision information downstream, akin to frequency-division multiplexing. Specifically, beta frequency shifts in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex appear to synchronize different neuronal ensembles that represent specific decision outcomes.

Depending on the context, the same feature could place an object or event in different categories. For example, categorizing animals as ?big? vs. ?small? varies when a house cat is considered ?big? when compared to an ant and an elephant is considered ?small? compared to whale.  How brains handle these categorization decisions flexibly and adaptively remains elusive. This project investigates the role of brain waves in the prefrontal cortex in categorization task. The project studies brain activity in humans and animals while performing a decision-making task to leverage a computational model to better understand the brain mechanisms involved. This project has potential to open a new window into understanding of decision making and will set the stage for future investigations into disorders, such as Parkinson?s disease and schizophrenia, in which both brain waves and cognitive function are impaired.<br/><br/>This project tests the novel hypothesis that beta oscillations at different frequencies could act as separate channels to selectively transmit decision information downstream, akin to frequency-division multiplexing.

This project develops new tools to help security professionals allocate resources more effectively, minimizing vulnerabilities at soft targets such as schools, public venues, and places of worship. By combining insights from human-subject experiments and surveys with advanced mathematical modeling, this research provides practical strategies for making better defensive decisions. Unlike traditional, theoretical approaches, which assume adversaries act purely rationally, this project incorporates data from human decision-making experiments and surveys to create more realistic and actionable models. The outcomes of this research extend beyond improving security as they also offer valuable insights into adversarial behavior that can inform fields like marketing and risk management. Additionally, the project supports education by involving students in cutting-edge research and developing tools that make complex mathematical models accessible to non-experts. By advancing our understanding of decision-making and optimizing resource allocation, this project promotes national safety and prosperity.<br/><br/>This project develops a novel framework for studying adversarial decision-making by combining game-theoretic modeling with data from human-subject experiments and surveys. The primary objective is to model an attacker?s best response function based on actual decisions made in attacker-defender scenarios, rather than assuming purely rational and theoretical strategies. The research investigates key variables?reward, cost, and probability of success?and their influence on adversarial behavior. Using this data, the project derives closed-form Nash equilibria to optimize defensive resource allocation strategies across multi-layered security systems. The study incorporates mixed-effects regression and numerical optimization techniques to analyze decision-making processes and solve for equilibrium strategies. Additionally, by utilizing the research methodology of designing and conducting behavioral experiments that simulate attacker-defender games, collecting empirical data, and using advanced game-theoretic modeling, the project validates and refines prescriptive solutions displayed in Graphical User Interface toolkits for stakeholders. The results contribute to actionable resource allocation strategies while offering a scalable framework for analyzing adversarial behavior in diverse applications, including security and risk management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These particles (also called ?particulate organic matter? or POM) carry carbon into the deep ocean where it is stored for hundreds of years. The storage of carbon in the deep ocean contributes to the drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as loss of nutrients from the surface ocean. Understanding the mechanisms and processes that govern the fluxes of POM is thus directly relevant to the global carbon cycle, marine ecology, and fisheries. This project uses new tools to measure the isotopes of three different elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen). The approach shows promise for addressing a long-standing question: to what extent do bacteria replace the organic matter from algae (the original source of the POM) as particles sink. Results from this study will be important for predicting the amount and dietary quality of POM in a rapidly changing ocean. The project will support Ph.D. students at both Caltech and University of Miami and educational activities for K-12 and college students. <br/><br/>The project takes advantage of a recent analytical development, the measurement of hydrogen isotopes in amino acids as a new tracer. Preliminary measurements suggest that there is a large (up to 20%) shift in the hydrogen isotope ratio of amino acids within POM over the upper 300 m of the ocean, consistent with the depth at which POM degradation is most intense. The investigators hypothesize that the shift in hydrogen isotopes reflects the replacement of phytoplankton biomass with bacterial biomass. The project will test this hypothesis through 1) the analysis of archived POM samples from four different localities in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, 2) measurements of diverse phytoplankton grown in culture, and 3) degradation experiments in which algal biomass is fed to bacteria and zooplankton. In addition to cutting-edge hydrogen isotope measurements, the investigators will employ a suite of additional measurements to characterize the microbial communities and POM being studied. Collectively, this work aims to develop hydrogen isotopes in amino acids as a novel proxy for the turnover of organic matter within marine particles, which could be applied to studies of marine POM throughout the world?s oceans. The project will also develop outreach activities to introduce K-12 and collegiate students to marine science. These will be implemented through the GO-Outdoors program in Pasadena, the Exploring Marine Science Day in Miami, and undergraduate student cruises in Miami.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, radiocarbon, which decays over thousands of years, can be used to determine that ocean currents travel from the surface to the deep sea in about 300 to 1000 years, depending on where you are.  Radiocarbon decay is too slow for this technique to be used in the upper ocean.  Beryllium-7 is another radioactive element generated in the atmosphere.  Beryllium-7 decays in months so it is well suited to the faster circulation of the upper ocean.  Unfortunately, beryllium-7 is very rare, so measurements are expensive.  In this project an affordable and efficient system will be designed and built to sample beryllium-7 in seawater.  The system will be tested near Florida and then used near Bermuda to estimate how quickly the upper ocean circulates.  The circulation timescales will be used with oxygen measurements to estimate the rate of biological activity in this part of the Atlantic Ocean.<br/><br/>The project will develop an in situ pumping system to more easily collect beryllium-7 from seawater.  The prototype will be tested on a brief cruise near Florida and then deployed as part of Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) cruises over four seasons and two years.  To estimate lateral trends in preformed oxygen and in beryllium-7, additional sampling near the BATS site is planned on all cruises.  The beryllium-7 data collected at BATS will be applied in an established vertical mixing model to estimate vertical diffusivities (Kz) and Oxygen Utilization Rates (OURs) over a full seasonal cycle.  The lateral beryllium-7 and oxygen trends measured will be used to calculate the impacts of horizontal transport on the vertical model.  The Kz and OUR estimates will be compared with those determined at BATS in 2007/8 using the older, large volume sampling technique for beryllium-7.  The sampling system has promising applications to other trace elements and isotopes and will provide for more widespread applications of beryllium-7.

The Q-ICPMS makes it possible to measure most of the elements in the periodic table with great sensitivity (below parts per trillion detection limits) in minutes. The LAM is a front-end sampler that allows measurement of solid materials in spots as small as 5 microns. Twenty-one separate research groups have developed new applications with the proposed instrumentation, including projects that bear on volcanic hazards, geohealth, and critical minerals. This project also provides support for geochemically-focused research projects by summer interns at LDEO, and provides training opportunities for students in state-of-the-art, hands-on chemical analysis.<br/> <br/>Purchase of a new excimer laser and Q-ICPMS will leverage two other high resolution ICPMS instruments in the designated lab (a 2009 Nu AttoM and a 2012 Thermo Neptune-Plus), enabling applications that range from multi-trace element to high precision isotope ratio measurements in microns-spot measurements. The primary research to utilize the LAM-Q-ICPMS system is focused on measuring chemical zonation in volcanic crystals for developing diffusion timescales of magma in motion beneath active volcanoes, and on measuring boron isotopes in serpentinites to trace the deep earth water cycle at subduction zones. Others in the user group propose provenance studies that focus on paleoclimate or human artifacts; in situ trace element analyses of melt inclusions, tephra and crystals for volcanic-magmatic-ore deposit research; corals and foraminifera for paleo-climate reconstructions; geohealth applications in the study of trace metals in rice, hair, soil and paint; and environmental engineering applications in carbon sequestration and processing of ores. In addition to LDEO and the AMNH, the new instrumentation will support research at other institutions in the New York City area, including several CUNY campuses and Stockton University. The facility will also provide training opportunities for up to 20 graduate students given existing projects.

The ubiquity of this concept is central to its connection with dynamics, the study of systems that evolve in time and space. These processes can be either deterministic, as in the movement of planets, or stochastic, as in the throwing of dice. The main purpose of this proposal is to study the interplay between dynamics and groups (group actions and dynamics) using the methods of logic, with a particular emphasis on the tools of descriptive set theory. Descriptive set theory precisely studies how complicated it is to define certain subsets, equivalences, and related objects. In particular, it can show whether certain simple classifications of objects exist or are impossible.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will focus on understanding the complexity of random walks and their Poisson Boundaries, the possible symmetries and joinings of dynamical systems, and the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Poisson Boundaries capture the notion of asymptotic indistinguishability for random walks. They also classify the space of an important set of functions on groups (the bounded harmonic functions). When the boundary is trivial, this implies that in the long term all random walks look similar. One goal of this project is to make progress in understanding when this triviality occurs. Joinings represent a broad notion of symmetry, more general than morphisms or factor maps, that topological dynamical systems can have. Understanding the joinings of a topological dynamical system to itself provides a rich perspective on the various symmetries that the system can possess. Borel equivalence relations are a formal way to precisely describe whether classification problems are easy or difficult. This project aims to further impact their study, as well as to initiate the exploration of linear algebraic analogues of Borel equivalence relations.

Biofilms are groups of bacteria that stick together via secreted polymers and can be found on many surfaces?from rocks in streams to medical devices. While sometimes beneficial, biofilms often cause problems in industrial and medical settings because they are hard to remove and resist antibiotics. Understanding how bacteria interact with biofilms and switch between swimming/non-swimming states is crucial for controlling harmful biofilms. However, studying these interactions has been challenging due to the lack of tools that can observe both types of bacteria simultaneously. This project aims to develop HoloCon, a new imaging tool that combines three-dimensional holographic imaging and fluorescent microscopy, allowing scientists to see both free-swimming bacteria and biofilms in three dimensions and observe their interactions in real time at the single-cell level. HoloCon will visualize and quantify both bacterial populations in one setup, explaining how resident biofilms repel free-swimming cells attempting to colonize and invade them?a common scenario in natural environments like the ocean. HoloCon will be widely useful to researchers observing cell dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and to others imaging cell or particle trajectories in complex three-dimensional environments such as tissues. The Broader Impacts of the project include its intrinsic merit as the project could impact the work of microbiologists, cell biologists, and developmental biologists. Research tasks will be integrated with educational missions to train future scientists and engineers and inspire public interest through classes, research, and outreach activities in high schools.<br/><br/>The major goal of the proposal includes both the development of a new tool for cell biology studies and the scientific discoveries enabled by the new tool. Specifically, in Aim 1, an innovative imaging tool named HoloCon will be developed, which represents the first system capable of simultaneously capturing 3D images of rapidly swimming bacteria and monitoring the dynamic evolution of biofilm architecture at single-cell level. HoloCon is composed of three integrated modules: a real-time 3D particle tracking module based on digital in-line holography (DIH) integrated with machine learning, a customized spinning disk confocal microscope module that receives information from DIH, and a fully integrated data analysis module ready for the research community to use. Aim 2 centers on addressing the key scientific questions of how resident biofilms repel free-swimming cells attempting to colonize and invade the biofilm. New information revealed by HoloCon with be combined with bacterial genetics, biochemistry, and surface engineering tools to paint a comprehensive picture about the interactions between the sessile and planktonic bacterial populations at sub-micron spatial resolution and <10 ms temporal resolution. The central hypothesis is that the interaction between a swimming cell and an established biofilm depends on the swimming behavior of the invading cell, the topography of the resident biofilm, and the biochemical interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. Revealing the resistance mechanism to biofilm will add significantly to our understanding on the competition between bacterial populations in nature, and on how ecological functions are tightly coupled with the cell biology of individual bacterium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there is a need to reduce leakage when part of an intestine is surgically removed, and the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed). Resultant infections may produce complications that may be life-threatening, costly, and detrimental to patient outcomes. The technology is a bioresorbable 3D-printable tube and compressive band combination. The 3D printing allows for a printed, customized surgical solution to accommodate individual anatomical variations. With widespread adoption, this technology has the potential to set a new standard for GI surgical care, improving patient safety and reducing healthcare costs. In addition, this advance may lead to applications that address leakage in other tubular organs and may inspire the development of new bioresorbable medical devices.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a bioresorbable stent and compressive band combination to improve the safety of gastrointestinal (GI) anastomoses.

The collapsible, low-profile device design allows for introduction and delivery through laparoscopic ports for use in minimally invasive procedures. After implantation, the components are resorbed by the body by which time the risk of leakage has passed, eliminating the need for follow-up procedures to remove the device. The expandable, low-profile design can be used in minimally invasive procedures. Benchtop testing has demonstrated the device?s ability to create anastomoses with minimized leakage risk.

Archaeological ceramic analysis is well suited to study this phenomenon because it can yield information on how communities? choices in production, consumption, and use changed or stayed the same before and after cultural contact events. These choices often reflect social and economic affiliations of group members. Data from this project offers insights into how human populations adapt to social change, providing valuable perspectives for contemporary issues of migration and cultural integration. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence showing societies have a wide range of responses to both external stimuli and internal negotiations.

The synthesis of new ribosomes (which make proteins) plays a crucial role in supporting the increased protein synthesis required during the cell cycle and division to make new cells.  However, the role of the synthesis of new ribosomes in cells that are fully matured and incapable of cell division remains much less clear.  Mature skeletal muscle cells are differentiated cells, meaning that they cannot undergo cell division anymore; yet several proteins typically associated with the cell cycle are expressed in skeletal muscle cells, even though they will never divide.  This research project  will investigate the roles of proteins responsible for cell cycle progression in non-dividing cells, such as mature muscle cells, in particular the synthesis of new ribosomes.  Using novel genetically modified mouse models, the researchers will manipulate the cell cycle to explore the effects slowing or speeding up the cell cycle on ribosome production and muscle cell size.  Undergraduate students working from the Principal Investigator?s lab, and from a new Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE), will receive extensive training on muscle biology while supporting this project.<br/><br/>While cell cycle progression has been extensively studied in proliferative cells, the role of cell cycle regulators in postmitotic cells remains unclear.  Fully differentiated skeletal muscle cells can express several cell cycle regulators that are key to ribosome biogenesis ? a cellular process where we hypothesize that the role of these regulators is conserved in postmitotic cells. This research aims to investigate the role of cell cycle regulators in mature skeletal muscle cells, focusing primarily at the level of the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 (CDK4), a central kinase regulating ribosome biogenesis in proliferative cells.  Specifically, this study will:  1) Determine whether CDK4 regulates muscle ribosome biogenesis and muscle cell size, and; 2) Test whether promoting cell cycle progression via a constitutively active CDK4 in differentiated muscle cells causes the muscle progenitor cells, known as satellite cells, to fuse with the mature myofibers. To address these questions, the PI, graduate, and undergraduate researchers will use genetically modified mouse models to specifically and conditionally knock out or overexpress key regulators of the cell cycle, such as CDK4, in mature myonuclei.  If the hypothesis is correct, the results from this proposal will represent a paradigm shift in our understanding of the role of cell cycle in terminally differentiated cells, such as muscle cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Membrane assembly is a spontaneous event driven by the simple fact that oil and water do not mix. This project seeks to understand how membrane encapsulated vesicles (protocells) might have formed and reproduced in the absence of any genetic information. The project investigates how molecules that are amphiphilic (simultaneously polar and non-polar) assemble into vesicle compartments, and how these compartments might drive the formation of additional membrane building blocks. This project tackles whether information can be carried over across generations of vesicles, with offspring adapting to their environment over time. If true, this will demonstrate the feasibility of a form of Darwinian evolution on a system that does not (yet) contain genes. A Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience Astrobiology course where students design a space exploration mission will be expanded. The course is designed to develop a teamwork ethos, critical thinking, data analysis, and public presentation skills. The novelty of the type of laboratory work involved would provide students the opportunity to develop a unique skill set in microfluidics. <br/><br/>This project has three main scientific goals: (i) use catalytic minerals to promote the synthesis and polymerization of organosulfur species to yield amphiphilic molecules. (ii) Probe the capability of such amphiphiles to self-assemble into vesicle compartments and develop a robust methodology for studying their individual and population-wide composition. And (iii) assess if such vesicles display generational heredity ? allowing for a primitive form of evolution by natural selection. Selection pressures, such as changes in temperature and pH, will be applied to determine if the naturally-selected composition of older generations biases that of future ones. Custom-made microfluidic setups will be incorporated to enable the control and manipulation of fluids constrained to the microliter scale, where surface forces prevail over volumetric ones, and allow for the simulation of the out-of-equilibrium conditions naturally found in energy-rich geochemical settings. This interdisciplinary project is at the crossroads between chemical biology, biophysics, and evolutionary biology and is poised to tackle the critical challenge of how the first cells were built.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biofilms are groups of bacteria that stick together via secreted polymers and can be found on many surfaces?from rocks in streams to medical devices. While sometimes beneficial, biofilms often cause problems in industrial and medical settings because they are hard to remove and resist antibiotics. Understanding how bacteria interact with biofilms and switch between swimming/non-swimming states is crucial for controlling harmful biofilms. However, studying these interactions has been challenging due to the lack of tools that can observe both types of bacteria simultaneously. This project aims to develop HoloCon, a new imaging tool that combines three-dimensional holographic imaging and fluorescent microscopy, allowing scientists to see both free-swimming bacteria and biofilms in three dimensions and observe their interactions in real time at the single-cell level. HoloCon will visualize and quantify both bacterial populations in one setup, explaining how resident biofilms repel free-swimming cells attempting to colonize and invade them?a common scenario in natural environments like the ocean. HoloCon will be widely useful to researchers observing cell dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and to others imaging cell or particle trajectories in complex three-dimensional environments such as tissues. The Broader Impacts of the project include its intrinsic merit as the project could impact the work of microbiologists, cell biologists, and developmental biologists. Research tasks will be integrated with educational missions to train future scientists and engineers and inspire public interest through classes, research, and outreach activities in high schools.<br/><br/>The major goal of the proposal includes both the development of a new tool for cell biology studies and the scientific discoveries enabled by the new tool. Specifically, in Aim 1, an innovative imaging tool named HoloCon will be developed, which represents the first system capable of simultaneously capturing 3D images of rapidly swimming bacteria and monitoring the dynamic evolution of biofilm architecture at single-cell level. HoloCon is composed of three integrated modules: a real-time 3D particle tracking module based on digital in-line holography (DIH) integrated with machine learning, a customized spinning disk confocal microscope module that receives information from DIH, and a fully integrated data analysis module ready for the research community to use. Aim 2 centers on addressing the key scientific questions of how resident biofilms repel free-swimming cells attempting to colonize and invade the biofilm. New information revealed by HoloCon with be combined with bacterial genetics, biochemistry, and surface engineering tools to paint a comprehensive picture about the interactions between the sessile and planktonic bacterial populations at sub-micron spatial resolution and <10 ms temporal resolution. The central hypothesis is that the interaction between a swimming cell and an established biofilm depends on the swimming behavior of the invading cell, the topography of the resident biofilm, and the biochemical interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. Revealing the resistance mechanism to biofilm will add significantly to our understanding on the competition between bacterial populations in nature, and on how ecological functions are tightly coupled with the cell biology of individual bacterium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All languages seem to have these two categories, yet what distinguishes them remains nebulous. Further complicating the picture are instances of so-called ""insubordination"" in which a normally subordinate clause gains main-clause status; for example, when Theodore's mother exclaims: ""(that) Theodore eat the cookies?! Absolutely not!"" The existence of insubordination complicates the generalization that clauses can be categorized in a binary of main or subordinate. This doctoral dissertation project seeks to understand clause types and the main vs. subordinate dichotomy, using data from a language that exhibits a previously unstudied form of insubordination. The data gathered advances linguists' understanding of clausal syntax and semantics and is invaluable for language documentation and pedagogical purposes.<br/> <br/>In linguistic science, the characteristics of a main clause are often referred to as evidencing ""finiteness,"" while the characteristics of a subordinate one evidence ""nonfiniteness."" This dissertation project investigates what syntactic or semantic realities underlie these characteristics.

However, the sources and sinks of organic matter associated with this pool of carbon are not well-understood. This project will investigate organic carbon cycling processes that occur as seawater flows through oceanic crust at low temperatures. A large volume of seawater flows through cool ocean crust as it ages, but these sites are not well-studied. Unlike hydrothermal vent fluids, low temperature seeps are difficult to identify because the temperature and chemistry of bottom seawater and cool crustal fluids are more similar. This makes it difficult to find these sites at the seafloor, leaving them largely unexplored. This study will measure the concentration and composition of dissolved organic matter in fluids from two newly discovered sites where low-temperature fluids discharge from seamounts.  In addition, the research will provide new tools for organic matter characterization. As a result, this project will illuminate a part of the oceanic carbon cycle that has often been overlooked. This project also aims to inspire an interest in chemistry and biology among K-12 students by bringing the deep ocean to them. Teachers will develop classroom materials that introduce students to the charismatic octopus families that are attracted to sites of natural fluid discharge, and the fluid chemistry that shapes their behavior, during professional development workshops. The project will also engage students from primarily undergraduate institutions in deep-ocean research. Undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Delaware will also be involved in the project.<br/><br/>The scientific objectives of this 5-year project are to: (1) expand the view of cool, aging crust from one study site (North Pond IODP (International Ocean Discovery Program) Site) to three by following the lead of brooding octopus mothers which have recently been found clustered around sites of moderately warm natural discharge from the Dorado and Davidson Seamounts; (2) broaden the analytical window for dissolved organic matter characterization to better identify signatures of microbial activity; and (3) refine the present global estimate of organic carbon loss from the deep ocean by crustal processes. In addition, societal benefits of the project include educational and learning activities for students from the K-12 to the graduate level that are well-integrated with the research. The project will provide training for one graduate student and more than 10 undergraduate students, half of which will come from primarily undergraduate institutions.

With sea levels projected to rise 10-12 inches by 2050 along the U.S. coasts, barriers to prevent flooding are needed. Currently proposed methods rely on building extensive infrastructure both above and below land or moving residents to higher elevations, all of which are intrusive to the day-to-day lives of Americans. This project aims to prevent flooding in communities built on limestone soil by modifying the permeability of limestone using naturally occurring bacteria. Reducing the permeability of limestone will prevent underground water from rising into communities. The approach is less invasive than existing technologies, does not require excessive excavation, and may allow citizens to remain in their homes despite the sea level rise. It addresses NSF?s mission to ensure the prosperity of the average American citizen. It also involves stakeholders across multiple industries, including industrial microbiology, geochemistry, and construction, and can be applied to large areas of the US, thus potentially creating jobs and tax revenues from many sources. <br/><br/><br/>Microbially-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP), a process that uses naturally occurring bacteria to create calcium carbonate crystals on surfaces, will be employed to reduce the permeability of limestone to water. Upon optimizing and scaling this process, MICP will be used to modify in-ground limestone structures to reduce flooding in coastal communities. With this long-term goal in mind, and within the scope of an SBIR Phase I project, the goals of this proposal are to optimize the growth and MICP capabilities of naturally occurring bacterial strains in conditions that mimic the underground limestone environment and to test the structure, strength, and permeability of the MICP-modified limestone. The above will be accomplished using a suite of microbial growth and urease assays, biochemical and microscopy assessments of calcium carbonate deposits, and physio-chemical assessment of limestone porosity and bond strength. Together, the work proposed will establish the preferred conditions for MICP on limestone in environmentally relevant experimental conditions. This represents the first critical step towards using MICP in coastal communities to reduce or eliminate groundwater flooding as sea level waters rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike most early learned nouns and verbs, logical words such as ?no? and ?not? cannot be learned by observation because they do not refer to anything children can see or experience directly. Yet, the word ?no? is one of the first words most children say. However, how children learn this word and other words like it is not well understood. Discovering the answer to this question would reveal both the basic mechanisms by which children learn abstract words generally, as well as the childhood origins of the most foundational elements of critical thinking, reasoning, and logic. The broader impacts of this project include teaching and training in developmental and languages sciences for graduate and undergraduate students, and sharing of new language corpus resources created through this project with the broader scientific community. <br/><br/>This project aims to disentangle the difficulty of learning the concept of negation from learning the word (or words) that express the concept. Towards this goal, the project studies how infants and toddlers learn words for negation in English in comparison to other languages. These languages span a spectrum of how many different words are used to express related meanings such as rejection, prohibition, and absence. For example, English expresses these meanings with ?no?, whereas other languages use a different word for each of these meanings. This project tests the hypothesis that infants can grasp the concept of negation early in life, but the ease with which they can learn to express it depends on how many different, closely related words exist in the language they are learning by using language corpora and behavioral testing studies with infants and toddlers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will provide a better understanding of how various ER structures, such as tubules and sheets, determine where proteins of the ER accumulate and interact. These studies will ultimately reveal how the ER can serve multiple roles in cells and will assist in generating a more complete picture of the entire ER system.  The project will focus on the role of the ER in immune recognition (i.e., how cells recognize what is ?self? and what is ?non-self?).  The Broader Impact of the work includes its intrinsic merit as the ER as a ubiquitous organelle.  It also could provide understanding of how some viruses escape notice by the immune system.  Other activities include the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in interdisciplinary research that bridges physics, biophysics, cell biology and biochemistry, preparing them for a career in research at universities or in industry. The project will also provide local high school students an opportunity to participate in hands-on learning experiences and benefit other students with optics demonstrations. These outreach activities are designed to inspire students to pursue STEM careers. Through these outreach and training initiatives, this project will contribute to the development of a well-equipped STEM workforce in the United States, fostering the next generation of scientists and engineers. <br/><br/>This research examines the nanoscale organization of the peptide loading complex (PLC) within the ER, focusing on its structural relationship with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1/2). The complex plays a critical role in assembling major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, which are essential for immune recognition. The project aims to determine how ER morphology influences the function of the complex, thereby providing insight into the broader role of ER architecture in cellular processes. By employing advanced super-resolution microscopy techniques such as DNA-PAINT and 4Pi-SMS, the study will map the spatial distribution of PLC clusters and quantify their size and stoichiometry. Additionally, the research will explore how modulating the PLC?s supramolecular organization affects its function, shedding light on the structural determinants of its activity. This investigation will combine expertise in biochemistry, structural biology, and high-resolution imaging, drawing on the collaborative strengths of the Tamp lab (Frankfurt) and the Bewersdorf lab (Yale). By systematically integrating these methodologies, the project aims to build a comprehensive model of how ER nanomorphology supports cellular processes essential to immune function.

New approaches in urban management and community planning are needed to protect life and infrastructure in areas burdened by increased amounts of heavy snow and rain on snow. In Anchorage, rapidly changing snow characteristics in recent years has led to severe property and infrastructure damage. In 2023 and 2024, 24 buildings collapsed under the weight of snow, resulting in one fatality. Most snow monitoring stations are located in nearby mountains and not in urban-population centers. Warnings to clear snow from urban homes and businesses are based on data from these stations despite them being located outside the city. This can lead to difficulties issuing public safety warnings as data may not align with local conditions. Evidence-based information will inform businesses and residents on when and how to safely remove snow. Educational efforts will advance STEM knowledge, ensuring awareness of snow science and load-hazard management. Project outcomes will provide management strategies to improve community planning and prevent building collapse. The findings can be applied to other Alaskan urban areas, such as Fairbanks and Juneau, as well as to other geographical areas facing similar challenges.<br/><br/>The researchers will work with community partners in Anchorage, Alaska, to improve snow- modeling capabilities using an enhanced version of the atmosphere-urban-land-surface model WRF-Urban.

This will help physicians to utilize the best antibiotic at the optimal dosage sooner, reducing the number of exposures for antimicrobial resistance (AMR).  Such infections are responsible for more than 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths annually in the U.S. The integration of the proposed platform with mobile devices for result interpretation ensures that it can be widely deployed, including in resource-limited settings and during emergencies. This adoptability is crucial for promptly responding to future pandemics and ensuring that even remote or underserved areas have access to advanced diagnostic capabilities. This project will help to reduce the economic burden associated with AMR ($20 billion/year) and infectious diseases ($41 billion/year). Once commercialized, the proposed platform is expected to promote better antibiotic stewardship, reducing antibiotic release into the environment. Antibiotics in plants and the food chain pose risks to human and animal health, and contribute to the spread of resistant bacteria, making infections harder to treat and increasing outbreak risk.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel microfluidic platform for rapid and precise AST. Current methods, such as broth microdilution and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion, are limited by long turnaround times of 3-5 days. This delay leads to a postponement in adjusting antibiotics. Even emerging rapid diagnostic systems, while quicker, still require >20 hours to provide results, resulting in >4 doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics before precision adjustments can be made. The proposed platform generates actionable results within 6-9 hours from time of sample, as opposed to the conventional 3-5 days, identifying not only the most efficacious drug but also the appropriate dose. In the short-term, the technology will improve patient outcomes, particularly in life-threatening conditions like sepsis. In the long-term, more precise antibiotic usage promotes stewardship and extends the overall value we can derive from antibiotics before resistance mechanisms become ubiquitous. Three primary areas of risk will be addressed during this project: 1. Compatibility with scalable manufacturing materials used in injection molding, 2. Extending the shelf life to >6 months by lyophilizing pre-loaded antibiotics, and 3. Creating colorimetric interpretation software that can run on mobile devices to provide accessible and objective analysis and readouts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, trace amounts of sulfur exist as dissolved organic sulfur (DOS). Research on DOS in the ocean began in the 2000?s. This is because it is difficult to measure DOS concentration in a solution having almost one million times more inorganic sulfate. While relatively small in quantity compared to inorganic sulfur, DOS plays critical roles in oceanic and atmospheric processes. For example, sunlight degrades DOS into carbonyl sulfide gas, which moves into the upper atmosphere, forming sulfate particles that block sunlight reaching the Earth. Many DOS compounds are essential for microbial growth in the ocean. Additionally, some DOS compounds react with essential (e.g., zinc) and toxic (e.g., mercury) trace metals to affect their solubility and biological availability. To uncover the mysteries of DOS, this study will utilize archived samples collected from over 100 locations in the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Antarctica and collect fresh samples in the North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda. The scientists will measure the total concentrations of DOS in these samples and determine the compounds that make up DOS. Graduate and undergraduate education is a central part of this project. The project will support one graduate student at Old Dominion University and graduate and undergraduate students at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. The scientists will share their research with the public through already scheduled lectures and forums. They will also develop and use a virtual reality (VR) experience to simulate what it is like to go to sea and collect samples for DOS.<br/><br/>This research project will uncover the processes governing the marine DOS cycle in the Pacific Ocean, with three primary objectives: 1) Accurately quantify the DOS inventory across the entire Pacific Ocean to clarify its role in the global sulfur cycle. 2) Identify the abiotic and biotic processes responsible for DOS production and removal along two meridional Pacific transects, encompassing different biogeochemical regimes, hydrothermal plumes, and oxygen minimum zones. 3) Conduct a year-long, monthly collection of depth profiles at the Bermuda-Atlantic Time Series (BATS) to investigate the reactivity of DOS and its components. The research will leverage archived samples from three Pacific meridional transects, spanning from Alaska to Antarctica and Antarctica to Mexico, along with newly collected samples from the monthly BATS cruises.

For example, fruit flies rely on cues such as vertical stripes and polarized light to determine which direction to move. Yet, these visual features may represent only a fraction of those necessary for navigation. The main goal of this project is to understand the detailed network dynamics underlying visual processing and identify important visual features for navigation by combining anatomical, physiological, and computational approaches. The study will represent a significant step toward mechanistically describing the dynamics of an entire neural circuit, from sensory processing to developing spatial and directional senses??abstract cognitive entities. In addition, the proposed studies can inspire broader fields in engineering, including designing computer vision algorithms that can analyze task-specific features from the environment and robots that autonomously navigate in hazardous environments where external help signals such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) are unavailable. Based on these advances, the team will develop a new computational neuroscience course focusing on mechanistic models of neural circuits that have been validated in biological brains. The researchers will also reach out to high school students and families to increase awareness in neuroscience with hands-on lab experiences demonstrating advanced neuroscience techniques, such as using optogenetics to alter the mating behaviors in flies. Finally, they will provide a career workshop to undergraduate students to help efficiently advance their careers in biological sciences.<br/><br/><br/>The team will investigate how information is transformed across multiple stages of the pathway from the optic lobe to the compass neurons (also called EPG neurons), which encode the fly's sense of direction and share similarities with mammalian head direction cells. This pathway, called the anterior visual pathway (AVP), has three major types of neurons. MeTu neurons, which receive input in the Medulla (optic lobe) and send axons to the Anterior Optic Tubercle (AOTU), respond to specific visual primitives such as certain wavelengths and light polarization. TuBu neurons integrate the output of MeTu neurons from a specific spatial area, such as vertical or circular areas. Finally, ER neurons, which are postsynaptic to TuBu neurons and serve as the last stage of visual scene processing before the compass neurons, interact with each other to preprocess information about multiple visual features before they are integrated by compass neurons. The team will identify the visual features that two ER types extract along the AVP. To this end, they will tether flies and place them in a custom-built virtual reality arena that spans 360o azimuth and projects full-color stimuli. Using two-photon calcium imaging, they will monitor neurons? activity in these pathways in response to visual stimuli with various visual features.

However, most work on adaptation has focused on ?small units? like speech sounds, words, and sentences. Much less is known about how people use common patterns in conversation and discourse to develop robust mechanisms for understanding language in context. This project tests the ability to track patterns in reference ? that is, who or what is referred to ? including how human learners extract reference patterns and how doing so changes interpretation of a speaker?s meaning. Understanding this kind of adaptation in language could explain how people adjust to differences in communication styles and why language use changes across generations. This project provides scientific training for the next generation of STEM scholars by supporting the development of skills in experiment implementation, statistical analysis, and written and spoken science communication.<br/><br/>This project focuses on words that depend on context to clarify the speaker?s intended meaning. For example, in ?the professor told the student to edit their paper,? ?their paper? could refer to the student?s paper, the professor?s paper, or a joint paper by the professor and student. The context is useful, in part, because people learn which types of references are most frequent. However, it is not yet known how many different frequency patterns people can track. Using an experimental approach, this project tests how adaptation to specific linguistic patterns influences reference interpretation. Specifically, this study examines whether people track multiple reference patterns simultaneously and how such adaptation is used to develop effective processing strategies. By testing the generalization of adaptation, this project discovers whether different types of referring contexts are considered the same for the purpose of adaptation.

Virtual screening of large numbers of compounds has been very useful in identifying additional drug candidates for experimental validation and subsequent optimization. However, there still exists an unmet need for improved virtual screening due to the billions of chemical compounds and unknown target molecules or biomarkers. AI technologies have had considerable impact in drug discovery. Improved predictions by AI-based technologies can significantly accelerate virtual screening or early-stage drug discovery and hence subsequent drug development in many disease areas, providing broad economic advantages in terms of time and cost in both biomedicine and healthcare.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a general meta-modeling framework of ligand-protein binding affinity prediction by integrating traditional physical docking tools and sequence-based artificial intelligence (AI) models. The technology has more than 1,000 pre-trained, sequence-based, deep learning models using 10 different architectures and more than 200 pre-trained machine-learning meta-models. The combined models have shown superior performance in three different benchmarks compared to exclusively structure-based AI models, suggesting that scalable virtual screening is possible without structural data for accurate prediction of binding affinities. A key advantage of the technology is to leverage the ensembling power of multiple tools and datasets in multi-dimensional ways, reducing model-specific bias and enhancing model-specific strengths. The technology expands the scope of diverse drug targets, providing new avenues for different diseases. In particular, the innovation may help discover and optimize small molecule ligands for challenging target proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These hurdles will be addressed by design of several candidate compounds for each target condition, juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis and pediatric Crohn?s disease, that will take into account the structure of autoantigenic peptides known to interact with both the MHC class II and T cell receptor (TCR). These candidate compounds will be initially tested in vitro in human macrophages to assess their potential to inhibit secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of these compounds, the most efficient ones will be tested for activity in relevant animal models. This approach will allow identifying and selecting the best drug candidates for further development into therapies for pediatric conditions as outlined above.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how these circuits work has been a major goal in cell biology.  Most tools available to researchers involve breaking  molecular circuits, for example by removing one or more of the proteins in the network.  This project will develop a method for adding new connections to the networks inside a cell, by implanting a physical electronic device that can interface with the cellular circuits, providing  a completely new type of tool for studying how cells make decisions and carry out complex behaviors.   If the project works, it could usher in a new era of convergence between molecular biology and microelectronics, with impacts on basic biology, biotechnology, and the semiconductor industry. Broad application of this approach will require a workforce with comprehensive understanding of both electronics and cell biology. A key broader impact of this project is that it will create an unprecedented opportunity for trainees from both electrical engineering and molecular cell biology labs to become cross-trained in both fields, via personnel exchange between research groups as well as pioneering interdisciplinary courses in cellular electronics. Another broader impact will be development of public outreach by showcasing new demonstrations at the Exploratorium science museum. <br/><br/>This project is based on the hypothesis that intracellular signaling network models could be tested more rigorously, and networks reprogrammed to a wider range of behaviors, if it were possible to modify the links between nodes by introducing new functional connections between signaling proteins.  It is difficult to create new connections between proteins using conventional molecular biology approaches. This project will develop a radical solution to address this problem by implanting microelectronic chips into living cells, which will sense kinase activities and/or monitor the concentration of second messenger molecules, and then trigger release of mRNA, siRNA, or small molecules to target specific signaling proteins, effectively ?rewiring? the signaling pathway under electronic control. These chips will integrate biochemical sensors and actuators on a single chip, complemented by wireless communication and power delivery systems, controlled by onboard logic, all engineered to be of a size suitable for implantation into living cells. The device will incorporate nanofabrication techniques and advanced integrated circuit design to achieve a final chip size smaller than 100 m by 100 m, and 10 m thick, allowing it to be accommodated within a single cell. The focus of this proposal is to conduct proof of concept experiments to determine the feasibility of this vision. At each step of the project?s progression, prototypes will be tested within living cells, using the giant amoeba Chaos carolinensis because of its large size and amenability for microsurgical implantation. Testing will be based on sensing and actuating easily-measured kinase molecules to allow verification of proper device function.<br/><br/>This project was jointly funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program, along with the Systems and Synthetic Biology program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.

Infections related to implanted medical devices are shockingly common, as one million implant-related infections occur each year in the United States. These infections are usually treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, overuse of antibiotics can cause multi-drug resistance, leading to more severe infections, making them harder to treat. There is a higher five-year mortality rate for prosthetic joint infections than for breast cancer. These infections not only present significant treatment challenges due to a biofilm formed by colonizing bacteria, but they also impose a massive financial burden on the healthcare system, costing more than $8.6 billion annually. This proposal addresses this critical issue by creating a novel nano-biological coating designed to inhibit biofilm formation and protect against all types of bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, while ensuring high biocompatibility. As such, the primary target market for this technology is medical device manufacturers, particularly in the orthopedic implant sector, anticipating $8 million in revenues by the third year of commercialization. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of a novel mammalian cell-based nano-biological coating when applied to orthopedic implants and demonstrate that the nanoparticles that can limit infection and inflammation while promoting bone growth. Nanoparticles are well known to reduce infection but how they are coated on medical devices remain problematic and undescribed.  This proposal will establish an innovative approach to treat medical devices with nanoparticles to inhibit bacteria via cell stimulation. Several technical challenges that arise from stimulating cells to produce nanoparticles on medical implants, include optimizing nanoparticle synthesis, in vitro characterization and validation, and in vivo proof-of-concept studies. Commercialization of this technology depends on establishing a controlled production system, scaling up production, obtaining regulatory approvals, and achieving market launch. The specific technical objectives of this SBIR Phase I are: (1) Characterization of nanoparticles produced by different cells on Ti6Al4V and stainless-steel orthopedic implants, (2) Determination of the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of such coated surfaces, (3) Determination of bone and fibroblast cell proliferation on such coated implants, and (4) Determination of the performance of nanoparticles produced by the cells as the active ingredient from such coated surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These implants provide mechanical support during recovery and are gradually absorbed by the body, restoring the implant site without requiring removal surgeries. Specifically, this project will develop a bioabsorbable magnesium alloy for maxillofacial fixation. This innovation aims to improve healthcare outcomes by eliminating secondary hardware removal surgeries, which occur in 5-20% of maxillofacial fixation cases and cost the U.S. healthcare system $1.72 billion annually. Permanent metal implants often lead to ongoing risks and expenses, while resorbable polymers, an alternative, are limited by limited strength, unreliable healing, and complex surgical procedures. A bioabsorbable metal implant with superior mechanical robustness and controlled absorption addresses these challenges and offers the potential to capture market share from both titanium and polymer implants. With 19% of the maxillofacial fixation market already using resorbable polymers, a superior bioabsorbable alloy would significantly improve clinical outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a bioabsorbable alloy with a customizable absorption profile tailored for maxillofacial fixation.

This school will offer an opportunity for US based graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to learn a variety of topics on higher rank geometric structures from international experts.

The primary focus of the award is to support travel for early career US-based mathematicians.<br/><br/>The study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups has a long history with connections to many different areas of mathematics including geometry, dynamics and number theory. Some of the earliest advances in the field (of Mostow, Margulis, Ratner) were about characterizing rigidity. For example, showing that a group is isomorphic to a unique lattice in a Lie group. On the other hand, Teichmller theory and Thurston?s theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds involved studying the deformation theory of hyperbolic 2 and 3-manifolds. While Thurston developed this theory in the 70?s (depending heavily on the earlier work of the Ahlfors-Bers school) this deformation theory of flexible groups was largely undeveloped outside of these two examples. This changed two decades ago when Labourie introduced the notion of an Anosov subgroup and Fock- Goncharov gave coordinates for studying certain discrete representations of surface groups in semi-simple Lie groups. Since then, the subject has grown immensely and attracted a multitude of researchers.

Currently, over 70 million tons of PG are produced each year, with over 1 billion tons stored in Florida alone. Improper storage risks contaminating groundwater and harming nearby communities by allowing radioactive elements and heavy metals to leach into aquifers. Moreover, radium in PG can decay into radon, a carcinogenic gas. The proposed innovation aims to address those environmental risks directly and offers substantial commercial opportunity by generating up to $50 million in annual revenue per processing facility, cleaning and converting over 200,000 tons of PG per year. Thus, this innovation addresses a pressing need for sustainable waste management, mitigates groundwater contamination risks, and transforms problematic waste into economically viable resource.<br/><br/><br/>PG is a byproduct of phosphoric acid production and includes naturally occurring radionuclides, making the material radioactive. These radionuclides are found in phosphate rock and are mostly uranium, thorium, and radium.

After separating the double salt from those contaminants, gypsum is regenerated and converted into ammonium sulfate and calcium carbonate through the company?s proprietary process that uses flue gas as a source of CO2.

The LA metropolitan area sits above a deep sedimentary basin that significantly affects the level of ground shaking from local and regional earthquakes. The basin has a complex tectonic history of extension and compression and is also crosscut by numerous faults. This has resulted in a complicated subsurface structure that leads to significant variation in site amplification of seismic waves across the basin, as evidenced by the recorded ground shaking following the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake. In the summer of 2022, a temporary 300-node geophone array was deployed across the entire LA basin, providing a seismic data set with uniform and dense coverage for the first time. In this project, the researchers will analyze these data and combine them with other available seismic and gravity observations in the region to construct a detailed 3D basin model. The model will help explain the level of amplification in different areas of the basin as well as its lateral variations The resulting model may be used to model ground motion for realistic earthquake scenarios, which is vital for evaluating infrastructure preparedness.  In addition, this project will explore the connection between the resulting seismic velocity model with mapped geological features, and the tectonic evolution of the LA Basin. Through the research, the project will support graduate and postdoctoral education, and the scientific findings will contribute to seismic hazard assessment efforts in southern California.<br/><br/>The density of the 300 sensor LA nodal array deployed in 2022 will enable the use of novel passive seismic imaging methods. By extracting Rayleigh and Love surface waves from multi-component ambient noise correlations, it will be possible to measure their velocity dispersion and Rayleigh wave ellipticity in the region. Techniques based on particle motion and apparent slowness will be developed to isolate different modes of surface waves. Both isotropic as well as radially and azimuthally anisotropic basin structures will be investigated using surface wave measurements. By using receiver function and autocorrelation methods, in addition to surface wave properties, it will be possible to determine crustal discontinuities, including major intra-basin sedimentary interfaces, the bottom of the basin, and the shape of the Moho beneath it. The use of gravity data will guide the identification of converted and reflected phases and determine the tectonic extension that the basin has experienced, enabling evaluation of the extent of thermal subsidence that has occurred within it. The dataset that will be analyzed is unique in an academic setting for its density, regularity, and completeness of coverage, allowing for the exploration of new methodologies. These include mapping shallow seismicity to identify possible unknown faults, using reflected surface waves to map the properties of faults within the basin as well as discover new ones, and determining aspects of the stress field through anisotropy. The 3D basin model constructed in this project is expected to be more accurate than the current community velocity models (CVMs), enabling more reliable ground motion predictions for various earthquake rupture scenarios. The new model will be validated through simulations of recent earthquakes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accordingly, organisms normally maintain defense systems to silence (turn off) the gene expression from this potential intruder. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa (an orange bread mold), a defense system operates during the sexual cycle to minimize the production from an unpaired gene. It is called Meiotic Silencing by Unpaired DNA (MSUD), and it utilizes an RNA-based gene silencing system to single out its targets. The goal of this project is to better understand the mechanism behind the MSUD pathway. Since DNA segments lacking a pairing partner are also targeted in worms, mice, and humans, this project will shed light on how DNA pairing could affect gene regulation in a variety of organisms. The investigators will recruit and train undergraduates through different campus student success programs. Research activities from this project will be used to develop lesson modules for lab tours and outreach visits to a local elementary school. Efforts will also be made to promote scientific literacy, interdisciplinary partnership, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education.<br/><br/>In many organisms, robust genome surveillance mechanisms are used to keep transposons and other selfish elements from spreading. One example is the MSUD pathway, which is first described in the filamentous fungus N. crassa. In this pathway, an unpaired gene generates a silencing signal (in the form of small interfering RNAs), which subsequently turns off the expression of this unpaired DNA as well as any other copies in the genome. MSUD utilizes Argonaute and other common RNA interference (RNAi) proteins to suppress the expression of its targets. Using the tools they have developed (e.g., silencing mutants, cellular markers, gene placement systems, and various assays), the investigators will characterize the phenotypes of silencing-deficient mutants and investigate the interactions and specific roles of MSUD components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inflorescence architecture in cereals is controlled in part by the timing in which a developing branch terminates in a grain-bearing unit called a spikelet. While spikelet development is generally conserved across cereals, little is known about the mechanisms that control it at the molecular level. This project aims to dissect the molecular underpinnings of spikelet development and identify control points for precision breeding or engineering high-yielding cereal crops. The proposed work leverages the model cereal Setaria viridis, which is closely related to corn but is small and rapid cycling, making it ideal for lab-based hypothesis testing. It also has a unique inflorescence architecture where spikelets can be converted to sterile branches, and vice versa, through applications of growth hormones. This genetic system enables rapid discovery that can be directly translated to corn and other cereal crops, ultimately impacting crop productivity and food security. The project also provides cross-disciplinary training in advanced molecular and microscopy techniques and computational biology for undergraduates and high school students. A curriculum based on this project will be deployed in high schools and community colleges, from rural to city schools, providing research experiences that link molecular lab skills to concepts in food security and impacting future workforce development.<br/><br/>Inflorescence architecture is an important agronomic trait, directly related to grain yield and harvesting ability. Architecture is determined by position and fate of differentiating stem cell populations called meristems. In grasses, different meristem types and variations in their determinacies give rise to diverse, complex branching patterns of the inflorescence. This proposal is aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling cell fate decisions during inflorescence development and how those decisions determine architecture and grain bearing potential. The work takes advantage of the model grass Setaria viridis because of its unique inflorescence architecture and emerging breadth of genetics and genomics tools. In Setaria spp., inflorescence branches terminate in either a grain-producing spikelet or sterile bristle, and these structures are paired. The loss-of-function bristleless1 mutant is defective in brassinosteroid biosynthesis and fails to initiate a bristle identity program, resulting in homeotic conversion of bristles to spikelets. In contrast, mutations in the spikeletless (spkl) gene convert spikelets to bristles. Spkl encodes a panicoid grass-specific transcription factor and functional ortholog of maize ramosa1 (ra1), a domestication gene that impacts harvestability by conferring meristem determinacy in ears. Despite its importance in evolution and development, the molecular mechanisms surrounding RA1 function in maize and other panicoid cereals is largely unknown. This proposal aims to i) leverage the unique spikelet vs bristle program in Setaria to dissect molecular mechanisms controlling this core genetic module involving RA1 and growth hormones in shaping meristem fate and inflorescence architecture, and ii) extend these findings through comparative approaches to closely related cereal crops maize and sorghum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Forecasting of space weather is often done using physics-based computer models. However, these models often lack skills in accurately predicting day-to-day variabilities, a significant portion of which originates from the lower atmosphere. This project aims to improve the scientific understanding of these variabilities using state-of the-art Whole atmosphere Model-Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics (WAM-IPE). The improvements of the model, and scientific insights gained from this project have the potential to directly enhance the forecasting accuracy of the operational version of WAM-IPE at NOAA?s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), which monitors and provides regular space weather alerts to a wide range of stakeholders. The model improvements and scientific tools developed in this project will be made publicly available, fostering collaboration across the scientific community. In addition, the project will provide training opportunities for early career scientists enabling development of a broad and skilled workforce prepared to address future challenges of our society in short-term predictive space weather science.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance understanding of the connections between day-to- day variability in the ionosphere, ionospheric electrodynamics and neutral wind tides in the Ionosphere- (I-T) region. The neutral wind in the lower thermosphere ~90-150km region is highly variable due to complex spectra of upward propagating waves from the lower atmosphere. Numerical whole atmosphere models have been increasingly used in the investigations of fundamental I-T processes for accurate space weather forecasting. However, these models have a major source of uncertainty stemming from poor understanding of drivers of short-term variability. To address this uncertainty, the proposal will leverage state-of-the art Whole atmosphere Model- Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics (WAM-IPE) model in conjunction with diverse observations from ground- and space-based instruments. Specifically, this study will focus on quantifying the contributions of different tidal components to the variability of the upper mesosphere, middle thermosphere to bottom side F-regions of the Earth?s atmosphere (~80-250 km).  Advanced techniques such as autocorrelation and wavelet coherence analysis will be used. Ultimately, by revealing causal mechanisms linking tidal day-to-day variability to ionospheric changes, this research will play a significant role in enhancing I-T predictability during geomagnetically quiet times, driving future advancements in whole atmosphere modeling, improving operational forecasts at NOAA/SWPC, and strengthening global space weather resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Invasive plants threaten biodiversity by outcompeting native species, disrupting plant-pollinator interactions, and degrading soil conditions, resulting in over $3 billion in annual economic damages in the United States. This project addresses a critical question in ecology: why do some non-native plants become invasive while others do not? Understanding the traits that promote invasiveness is essential for predicting and mitigating the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The findings from this research will inform conservation strategies, enabling practitioners to identify and manage high-risk invasive species and protect vulnerable ecosystems. Beyond its scientific contributions, this project will foster the development of a skilled scientific workforce through the mentorship of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, independent research opportunities, summer educational programs, and a community-oriented ornamental garden initiative.<br/><br/>This research investigates the mechanisms driving plant invasions by examining how aboveground and belowground traits contribute to invasiveness and influence soil communities and ecosystem processes. Specifically, the study will explore the interplay between analogous traits - such as specific leaf area and specific root length, and leaf nitrogen and root nitrogen content - to understand their role in invasions. The project integrates field experiments and modeling to (1) identify plant traits that drive invasions under varying disturbance and resource conditions, (2) evaluate their effects on soil food webs, and (3) investigate how plant traits interact with soil communities to influence nutrient cycling. By comparing invasive plants with closely related native and non-invasive exotic species, this research will advance our understanding of plant-soil interactions in invasion ecology and generate actionable knowledge for managing invasive species.

It can greatly affect the Earth?s climate, air quality, and public health and welfare. Because of the climate change, more intensive wildfires with higher plume injection heights are expected to occur. Despite great importance, the magnitude and even the sign (warming or cooling) of wildfire smoke on the Earth?s climate are still unknown. To address these issues, the project will predict the fire intensity and plume injection height in a timely manner as well as quantify the impacts of fire smoke on the Earth?s energy budget and climate, which are critically important for the policy makers and stakeholders. The improved estimation of fire radiative effects will enhance our ability to predict relative warming/cooling effects on the Earth system and greatly benefit teaching and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students at the Texas A&M University. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the importance of two fire properties, i.e., plume injection height and absorption of dark brown carbon (dBrC) for the radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols (BBAs). For that, the researchers will identify the dominant factors driving the fire intensity distribution which will affect both plume injection height and dBrC absorption. The project will focus on the three scientific issues: (1) radiative effects of BBAs associated with fire plume injection height and dBrC absorption; (2) controlling factors that determine the wildfire intensity distribution; and (3) potential positive feedback between extreme wildfires (wildfires with high intensity) and climate change (e.g., through diminished polar ice/snow cover). To address these scientific issues, the researchers will: (1) incorporate the existing modeling efforts of plume-rise model and dBrC absorption into the NCAR Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2).

Advances in sequencing technology over the past 15 years have allowed for the unprecedented investigation of microbiomes giving rise to an entirely new field of research. It is now clear that nearly every conceivable plant interaction with the environment is mediated, to some extent, through interactions with the microbiome. For this reason, there is profound scientific interest and financial investment aimed at harnessing plant-microbiomes to improve agriculture to achieve greater food security and environmental sustainability. However, these efforts are severely limited as the genomic mechanisms that control plant-microbiome interactions are largely unknown ? information that is essential for enabling plant breeding to enhance agricultural microbiomes. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by identifying the genetic mechanisms that control plant-microbiome interactions in the model legume Medicago truncatula. The legume, or bean, family is the second most agriculturally important crop family. This project will leverage the extensive resources available in Medicago to map the genetic basis of microbiome variation and validate the functional significance of candidate genes that are identified. Additionally, this work will examine connections between known plant-microbe symbiosis genes and interactions with the broader microbiome. This project will also provide research training for high school science teachers from Chicago Public Schools and develop novel teaching modules based on this research that will be implemented in the classroom and broadly disseminated to the science education community.<br/><br/>Plant-microbiome interactions play key roles in environmental stress tolerance; however, the mechanisms that control these interactions remain poorly understood. While much remains unknown about the genetic underpinnings of the overall plant microbiome, there is a considerable body of literature from decades of research interrogating the mechanisms controlling symbiotic interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia). Several of the common AMF and rhizobial symbiosis genes are conserved across plant evolution, even in non-symbiotic species, which has raised the hypothesis that symbiosis genes may also play a role in controlling interactions with the broader microbiome. This project integrates forward and reverse genetic approaches to investigate this hypothesis and fill key knowledge gaps regarding genomic mechanisms that shape the microbiome of legumes. This work leverages resources available for the model legume Medicago by conducting genome-wide association studies of microbiome interactions and examination of the impacts of knock-out mutants for AMF and rhizobial symbiosis genes on the microbiome. This work will greatly advance our understanding of plant microbiome genetics and will serve as a guide for future plant breeding efforts to improve agriculture. Additionally, training high school science teachers and developing novel curricular materials are a major goal of this project. Modern science education standards emphasize teaching the practice of doing science though inquiry-based pedagogical approaches. Achieving this can be challenging for teachers without having had experience conducting research. Moreover, new teaching modules are needed that are aligned with modern standards. Project outcomes will be disseminated broadly through publications and long-term, through public data repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The location of the conference at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA provides an inspiring and historical setting since it is the location of many groundbreaking discoveries. Over a four-day period, attendees from all stages of the profession come together to present their research, exchange ideas, share new techniques, build community and discuss best practices and ideas for STEM education. The conference intentionally supports junior scientist attendees. Scientific breadth is an important feature of DBSUMI, and the conference structure promotes formal and informal interactions among participants to build new collaborations across fields. The conference and the research performed by the attendees focus on creative and original research that leverage animal diversity to answer fundamental questions in the field of developmental biology. Previous examples of fundamental discoveries from research on marine invertebrates include the identification of cyclins and the control of cell division, the role of microtubule motor kinesins, the isolation of green fluorescent protein and the concept of gene regulatory networks. Such discoveries are central to most aspects of modern biology, and curiosity-driven research presented at conferences such as DBSUMI have the potential to lead to additional ground-breaking discoveries. The Broader Impacts of this award are multiple and include supporting trainees and the next generation of STEM researchers, sessions on new tool developments, and a STEM education session.<br/><br/>The DBSUMI conference convenes at the Marine Biological Laboratory every 1.5 years and brings together a large community of over 100 researchers who utilize marine invertebrates for fundamental studies in biology. In addition to research presentation opportunities, attendees are invited to participate in a pre-conference workshop on technology advancement, career development workshops and a STEM education plenary and panel discussion. While originally conceived for investigators working with sea urchins and which generated the first gene regulatory network (GRN), DBSUMI has more recently diversified with respect to research organisms, topics, and the breadth of attendees. This breadth serves as a valuable incubator to build new collaborations across fields. Topics currently discussed cover a range of subdisciplines, including oogenesis, gamete interactions, the oocyte-to-embryo transition, body axis patterning, signaling, organogenesis, regeneration, immunity, and environmental influences on development. Methodologies used by DBSUMI researchers are also broad and include GRN-based approaches, genomics, experimental embryology, cell biology, advanced imaging and evolutionary comparisons. Recent technological advances spurned in part by sea urchin researchers have lowered barriers to work with novel animal systems and has motivated the community to grow by including research on additional marine invertebrates. Parallel research efforts across a wide range of study animals placed within a phylogenetic context has allowed this research community to reveal common mechanisms defining unifying biological principles.

The findings will facilitate a significant improvement in manufacturing capacity for most freeze-dried goods and ultimately provide a pathway towards addressing recurring shortages and securing long-term availability. This SBIR research will produce data critical for process understanding as well as new quality control methodologies necessary for regulatory acceptance of microwave drying. The technology will be initially marketed to research and development units or organizations having a clear and viable downstream pathway towards manufacturing. The key competitive advantages offered by the technology are its ability to be noninvasively retrofitted to both new and legacy freeze-drying systems and its capability of producing uniform high-frequency electromagnetic fields specifically targeted towards frozen materials.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to improve manufacturing performance of high-value freeze-dried materials having limited shelf life using high-frequency microwave heating. The overall goal of the project is to gain the fundamental knowledge required to effectively scale the technology from laboratory to large-volume manufacturing freeze-drying systems. Key research objectives to be addressed include developing new experimental methods for estimating the effective dielectric properties of frozen aqueous solutions and primary packaging, identifying appropriate physics-based models and parameters for system modeling, and implementing model-based closed-loop control strategies to drive the freeze-drying process at optimal rates. To accomplish these tasks, multiple microwave sources will be fabricated and installed on a modified laboratory freeze-dryer together with a suite of temperature sensing technologies. Experimental measurements will provide the data necessary to develop the coupled unsteady electromagnetic and heat and mass transfer simulations for identifying the scale-up characteristics, microwave source interaction, and volumetric heating performance. Free radical production in the vacuum environment and material compatibility with the electric fields over the system bandwidth will also be assessed either explicitly using appropriate probes or implicitly via bioindicators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this work will focus on how neurons populate their membranes with receptors, known as ?AMPA? receptors, that can respond to neurotransmitters. This process requires intracellular membrane vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane of neurons. Though membrane fusion has been studied for decades, the regulation of membrane fusion in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) delivery is still poorly understood. This project will describe key steps in the delivery process and aims to identify novel proteins involved in receptor trafficking during learning and memory. Together, these aims will advance the understanding of how memories form. This work will be performed primarily by undergraduates, both in mentored research projects and in a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE). These efforts will significantly expand the training opportunities available to undergraduate students. <br/><br/>At the neuronal synapse, membrane fusion is not only essential for the delivery of neurotransmitter molecules but also for the insertion of neurotransmitter receptors into the plasma membrane. Though membrane fusion involved in the delivery of neurotransmitters is well-characterized, comparatively little is known about the regulation of neurotransmitter receptor delivery. Membrane fusion during AMPAR insertion into the plasma membrane is driven by SNARE proteins, including syntaxin-3, synaptobrevin-2, and SNAP-47 (S47). This project will investigate the role of S47, specifically focusing on its poorly characterized N-terminal and linker domains. An in vitro fusion assay will be used to describe the function of the uncharacterized S47 domains, and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) will be used to solve the structure of the SNARE protein complex involved in AMPAR exocytosis. These data will provide insight into the regulation of membrane fusion during AMPAR delivery to the plasma membrane. Additionally, an AlphaFold multimer screen of postsynaptic proteins will be combined with in vitro validation of protein-protein interactions to identify new protein regulators of AMPAR trafficking. Combined, these aims will advance our understanding of the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At present, we cannot accurately predict the growth of parasite populations within hosts because we lack a basic understanding of competition for resources among hosts and parasites. In this project, the researchers will answer fundamental questions about host-parasite resource competition using state of the art analytical chemistry techniques to quantify within-host resources. The answers to these questions will allow researchers to predict the course and outcome of parasite infections and, in the long-term, potentially design innovative new treatments. To maximize the impact of this project on both basic and applied sciences, the researchers will teach other ecologists to use their innovative techniques and introduce ecological concepts to biomedical researchers. This project could change our understanding of how parasites interact with their hosts and could lead to new ways to improve the health of humans, animals and plants. <br/><br/>Classical ecological models rarely succeed in providing accurate predictions about parasite population dynamics inside hosts, or parasite?s impact on host fitness, because they fail to capture the resource ecology of the within-host environment. This project will provide proof of concept of a novel approach to studying host-parasite-resource interactions in vivo. The project will employ inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which allows for the simultaneous quantification of multiple elements, in a flagship model system of host-parasite resource competition (Daphnia-Pasteuria). The researchers will quantify (1) the in vivo resource requirements of parasites across their life cycle and (2) the spatiotemporal dynamics of resources at the scales (i.e. tissue and whole-host) that determine parasite and host fitness, over the course of infection. The project will provide the missing data needed to build quantitative, predictive models of parasite population dynamics and host-parasite resource competition in this study system. Furthermore, it will provide a new toolkit for the study of within-host dynamics in other host-parasite systems. Together, these aims will provide the means to build and test a general theory of within-host resource competition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These AI-driven agents disseminate information with varied intentions, including shaping opinions and behaviors. Despite concerns about false information and polarization, the mechanisms through which bots influence human decision-making remain poorly understood. This project investigates the influence of bots on public opinion about controversial topics such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). By analyzing bot-generated content and its interactions with human users, the study examines how bots influence public discourse and human responses, with a focus on linguistic features such as polarization, politicization, and emotional framing. Understanding these linguistic dynamics sheds light on how bots shape public opinion, amplify narratives, and influence the cognitive processes driving individuals? reactions.<br/><br/>This research expands the computers-as-social-actors (CASA) framework to examine bots' influence on human decision-making, with a focus on both theoretical advancement and methodological innovation. Integrating observational and experimental approaches, it analyzes over 26 million tweets using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. The experiment employs LLM-simulated personas as human respondents, comparing their responses to those of real human participants. This approach not only tests bots? influence on decision-making but also demonstrates the potential of LLMs in studying human cognitive processes and decision-making dynamics. Methodological innovations include a bot detection tool leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a sampling technique using LLM-generated personas. These tools ensure robust insights into human-bot interactions while advancing the CASA framework?s predictive capacity. The findings deepen theoretical understanding of human-AI interactions, guide strategies to mitigate bot influence, and contribute to computational social science.

This is an important topic to study because people may behave differently depending on expectations and such thinking can affect important outcomes like pricing. For example, when buying a house Person A may think a price should be based on its current value, but Person B might expect that other buyers will be optimistic about future growth. Thus, Person B may pay more now, thinking they can sell at a higher price later. When many people think like Person B, this can drive up home values beyond their actual worth creating a housing bubble. Another example is salary expectations. When starting a new job Person A might just ask for what they think is a fair salary, but Person B may expect their employer to give a low counter offer after a salary request, and thus ask for more up front, ending up better off. These different strategies can lead to unfair differences in pay. Many economists have shown this to be the case but there is a lack of research on understanding characteristics of people who engage in greater thinking about others? behaviors. This project develops a tool to measure strategic anticipation assessing how much strategy a person uses in how they anticipate, or expect, other people to do in response to their own behavior. If scientists can measure people's strategic anticipation, they can design experiments to test how much it matters in many different settings, such as buying houses and negotiating with other people to get the best salaries. A better understanding of these processes can help people to make better decisions and get fairer outcomes.<br/><br/>This project develops and validates a novel measure of strategic anticipation - the ability to engage in recursive thinking about others' mental states and potential actions. Drawing from economic theories of level-k reasoning and psychological research on theory of mind, the Strategic Anticipation Measure (SAM) provides researchers with a standardized tool to assess individual differences in strategic iterative thinking. The research involves replicating and validating the SAM in a nationally representative sample, ensuring psychometric rigor through measures of discriminant validity and test-retest reliability. Additionally, the project applies the SAM across various social contexts?including voluntary disclosure in test-optional college admissions, self-sacrifice in close relationships, strategic decision-making in resource competition, and responses to shared knowledge in bystander intervention. By establishing the SAM as a reliable measure, the project aims to open new avenues for theoretical and empirical research, advancing our understanding of strategic anticipation in multiple domains of human behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In an era of narrowing profit margins and labor shortages, robotic equipment offers the potential to improve agricultural production. Autonomous nursery robots enable management strategies that are not possible with conventional equipment. For example, nitrogen fertilizer can be applied periodically across a plant's lifecycle, reducing stress, enhancing yield, and minimizing material loss through leaching and volatilization. Other applications include foliar feeding, weeding for reduced herbicide use, and field-variable nutrient assessment. These robots also collect data that farmers can use to refine strategies, transforming intuition into data-backed insight. This capability reduces waste, aligns farming with sustainability goals, and meets market and regulatory demands. Additionally, these lightweight robots reduce anthropogenic soil compaction, a common consequence of traditional heavy machinery, promoting healthier soil. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of novel, tactile-based perception and navigation systems designed to allow small off-road robots to operate in messy, stalky row-crop environments like under-the-canopy of a cornfield. This tactile navigation system supplements traditional visual methods, providing redundancy against sensor occlusion and feature extraction difficulties in the presence of weeds and leaves. Nearby stalks and obstacles can be detected and localized in the robot's periphery using tactile sensing, allowing for autonomous navigation even when visual data is unavailable. Robots equipped with this system can autonomously navigate through production cornfields entirely blind, detecting and positioning plants with accuracy. In-season management strategies can be unlocked with a robust navigation system. Early trials demonstrate that yield can be improved by ~10%, using ~20% less fertilizer when the robot spoon-feeds fertilizer to corn slowly over time, providing a clear indication of the economic potential of the technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Earth?s past, the continents had different arrangements to what we are familiar with today. The theory of plate tectonics, which emerged in the 1960s and was formalized in the 1970s, explains the changing face of Earth in terms of the opening and closing of oceans (i.e., creation and destruction of the oceanic crust that floors them). The coming and going of oceans act to fragment and separate continents then bring them back together in new formats. With over 50 years of scientific inquiry since the discovery of plate tectonics, geologists still do not understand the exact processes responsible for the birth and death of oceans. The Atlantic Ocean is 180 million years old and has not yet shown any signs that it is closing. Geological evidence suggests that a previous ocean existed in a similar region to the Atlantic of today; the Iapetus Ocean, named after the father of Atlas in Greek mythology. Geological constraints on the birth and death of the Iapetus Ocean suggest that it began closing less than 80 million years after it opened. Why the divergent fates of these two oceans? The answer to this question may lie in the respective processes that birthed the Atlantic and Iapetus.<br/><br/>This project will test the idea that the process of ocean formation?the style of continental rifting?can impart differential susceptibility to subsequent closure of the ocean basin that forms. Research will proceed via geological, geochemical and geochronological study of fragments of the Iapetus Ocean preserved at five locations between western Scotland and Arctic Norway. Work will focus on the apparent spatial coincidence of records of Iapetus Ocean opening and closing, and implications for the setting in which the closing process was seeded. The project includes public outreach that will benefit local urban population in Baltimore. Summer research internships will provide opportunities for local high school students to get involved in hands-on research. The team will also lead field excursions to explore the ?Baltimore Ophiolite? ? a rare sliver of ancient oceanic crust preserved in an urban setting.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The Wilson Cycle is a cherished concept in plate tectonics. However, an enduring issue with the model is the inherent strength of passive margins, which should resist the implied process of passive margin collapse to initiate subduction. Supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolites of the Scottish and Norwegian Caledonides record the first instance of subduction initiation across approximately 2,000 km of the Wilson Cycle?s archetypal ocean, the Iapetus. Seeding work on these SSZ ophiolites suggests a potentially ubiquitous association between records of rifting to open the Iapetus Ocean and those of subduction initiation to close it. These associations provide tantalizing clues that margin structure/litho-architecture inherited from rifting may leave certain passive margins more susceptible to subduction initiation via passive margin collapse.<br/><br/>This project will explore the idea of passive margin susceptibility to subduction initiation by testing two hypotheses: (1) Iapetan subduction initiation occurred in regions that also experienced Ediacaran rifting of Rodinia, and (2) Iapetan subduction initiation occurred in an oceanic setting proximal to the Laurentian margin. Testing Hypothesis 1 will involve geochemical characterization and zircon U-Pb dating of enigmatic metavolcanic packages adjacent to the SSZ ophiolites of Unst, Scotland, and Karmy and Leka, Norway. Testing Hypothesis 2 will involve geochemical and detrital zircon characterization of metagraywackes from the cover sequences of the Karmy, Leka and Lyngen SSZ Ophiolites, Norway.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately 80% of infections are associated with bacterial biofilms that delay healing and require frequent interventions. Current solutions often rely on reactive infection management and frequent dressing changes.  This project proposes a novel wound dressing with optimal porosity to enable oxygen exchange while creating a pathogen barrier, integrated with real-time detection of infection indicated by a rapid color change. The platform offers a potential solution for improving the management of acute wounds, chronic wounds, surgical sites, and burn, with a total estimated $200M annual market.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop and validate an aerogel-based biomaterial combining fluid management, biofilm prevention, and rapid infection detection properties into a single platform.

The primary layer aims to promote tissue regeneration while blocking microbial infiltration, and the secondary layer aims to absorb wound fluid while providing a visual indicator of infection. The proposed technology development will optimize the aerogel?s pore structure for effective biofilm prevention, refine the infection-sensing mechanism for reliable detection in under a minute, and ensure the mechanical durability needed for clinical use. If successful this project will demonstrate preclinical safety and effectiveness, with scalable pilot production methods for a prototype wound dressing material, that reduces infection-related complications, minimizes dressing changes, and improve healing outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fully-coherent samples, so-called ?quantum gases?, are achieved when cooled to near absolute zero, but this is technically challenging. Recent work, though, has demonstrated that internal quantum coherence can persist even in thermal gases whose temperatures are well above those required to create a quantum gas. The first goal of this project is to determine the limiting conditions for which quantum coherence is preserved in these thermal gases. As such, it will probe the boundary between the classical and quantum regimes and may aid in the development of low-cost quantum technologies. The second goal is to investigate such a gas as it transitions from a thermal cloud to a quantum gas. Depending on the conditions of the experiment, the quantum properties can be either suppressed or enhanced, affecting the complexity of computations and the precision of measurements. The third goal of this project is to integrate quantum science research into undergraduate education. If successful, this will provide a model to make quantum science research more accessible to undergraduate-only institutions, providing enhanced learning opportunities to underrepresented groups in physics.<br/> <br/>The experimental research program will measure ultracold atomic spinor gases with three main goals. The first goal of the project is to determine the maximum temperature for a Bose thermal gas to exhibit coherent spin-changing collisions. All-optical trapping of spinor gases will be utilized to probe the spinor dynamics of samples as a function of temperature. A thermal gas will be coherently prepared with the desired initial spin state, and the resulting population oscillations will be measured through absorption imaging of the magnetic sublevels. Second, the project will investigate coherent spin-changing collisions in the temperature regime as a thermal gas transitions to a Bose-Einstein condensate. Although the limiting cases are well-understood, there is currently no theoretical model to describe this intermediate regime. It has been argued that spin-locking between the thermal and Bose-condensed components, for example, can lead to either an enhancement or suppression of the coherence of the thermal cloud. The loss of coherence limits the complexity of computation in quantum information systems and the precision of measurements. Experimental studies will provide needed measurements to develop accurate theoretical models. Third, the project will integrate education and research in quantum physics with reduced technical requirements suitable for primarily undergraduate institutions, providing enhanced learning opportunities for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is important to discover how the ideas and data about spatial patchiness develop to help guide future research, shape the growth of ecological science, and facilitate the practical use of the resulting ecological information. This project integrates ecological theories and concepts into a broad synthesis. This is important because it provides an understanding of how synthesis has helped translate ecological knowledge for the public good. Additional broader impacts of the products focus on: 1) The relevance of applying science to urban design, urban planning, and conservation; 2) An improved ability to assess disturbance in social-ecological-technological systems given changing environments and changing human vulnerability; and 3) Support of ecological education and mentoring efforts and programs. Products will be broadly useful for public communication and education, and will include a multi-media collection of resources that will make the results of the synthesis as widely accessible as possible.<br/><br/>This project aims to study how such a fundamental ecological concept as patchiness has progressed by synthesizing insights from an exemplary scientific career.

These particles (also called ?particulate organic matter? or POM) carry carbon into the deep ocean where it is stored for hundreds of years. The storage of carbon in the deep ocean contributes to the drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as loss of nutrients from the surface ocean. Understanding the mechanisms and processes that govern the fluxes of POM is thus directly relevant to the global carbon cycle, marine ecology, and fisheries. This project uses new tools to measure the isotopes of three different elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen). The approach shows promise for addressing a long-standing question: to what extent do bacteria replace the organic matter from algae (the original source of the POM) as particles sink. Results from this study will be important for predicting the amount and dietary quality of POM in a rapidly changing ocean. The project will support Ph.D. students at both Caltech and University of Miami and educational activities for K-12 and college students. <br/><br/>The project takes advantage of a recent analytical development, the measurement of hydrogen isotopes in amino acids as a new tracer. Preliminary measurements suggest that there is a large (up to 20%) shift in the hydrogen isotope ratio of amino acids within POM over the upper 300 m of the ocean, consistent with the depth at which POM degradation is most intense. The investigators hypothesize that the shift in hydrogen isotopes reflects the replacement of phytoplankton biomass with bacterial biomass. The project will test this hypothesis through 1) the analysis of archived POM samples from four different localities in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, 2) measurements of diverse phytoplankton grown in culture, and 3) degradation experiments in which algal biomass is fed to bacteria and zooplankton. In addition to cutting-edge hydrogen isotope measurements, the investigators will employ a suite of additional measurements to characterize the microbial communities and POM being studied. Collectively, this work aims to develop hydrogen isotopes in amino acids as a novel proxy for the turnover of organic matter within marine particles, which could be applied to studies of marine POM throughout the world?s oceans. The project will also develop outreach activities to introduce K-12 and collegiate students to marine science.

Often, speakers align with each other and become more similar in their language patterns. Such alignment is a core feature of human interaction and is believed to occur mostly without conscious awareness. Previous studies have shown that speakers often align on particular word choices with specific conversational partners and switch to a different word choice pattern when communicating with a different partner. In contrast, when speakers align their sentence structure with a particular conversational partner, they tend to maintain that sentence structure choice pattern even when talking to a different partner. This doctoral dissertation project investigates the possible reasons for the differences in partner-specific alignment at the word choice and sentence choice levels. A main hypothesis tested in this research is that word choice and sentence structure choice may serve different functions and may therefore impact communication success differently, especially in the context of joint task performance. This project also provides ample research opportunities for students and aims to increase awareness of alignment as a tool for language educators and speech therapists. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation project uses openly available analysis tools to examine whether speakers align their word (lexical) and sentence structure (syntactic) choices differently depending on their conversational partner in joint task-related dialogue. Specifically, the researchers compare the speech output of participants working in pairs to complete a collaborative spot-the-differences game, either remaining with the same conversational partner or switching partners between rounds of the game. By comparing the alignment patterns of the same-partner pairs with the different-partner pairs, this study will provide insight into the mechanisms and functionality of alignment at different levels of language.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fusion of ubiquitous autonomy and connectivity, along with the widespread adoption of distributed energy resources, is transforming our legacy grid into a multi-agent and distributed infrastructure. The project brings transformative change to power grid management by developing innovative strategies to orchestrate the autonomy of cyber-enabled components (agents) to enhance the grid's efficiency, resilience, and sustainability. This is achieved by addressing three critical research questions: how to leverage agents? autonomy for faster decision-making, enhance the resilience of managing a multi-agent power grid, and integrate societal awareness and carbon footprint considerations into distributed power management models. The intellectual merits of the project include the development of novel machine learning (ML)-assisted optimizers to rapidly solve complex decision-making problems for individual power grid agents, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and generative modeling to improve the resilience of collective power grid agents, and the design and integration of societal benefits and sustainability metrics into the multi-agent decision-making paradigms. The broader impacts of the project include enhancing power grid performance and resilience, educating the public through various media (print media and broadcast news), and offering educational and research opportunities for students, government, and industry professionals.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enhance the efficiency of the power grid whose characteristics are increasingly multi-agent and distributed in nature. The efficient operation of future electric infrastructure depends on leveraging agent-level autonomy to enhance grid management functionalities in a timely, resilient, socially aware, and sustainable manner. To achieve this, the project proposes neural approximators for mapping optimization inputs directly to high-quality, feasible outputs, thereby eliminating agent-level iterations and significantly speeding up agents? computations. In addition, this project seeks to enhance the resilience of a collection of agents by using AI to regulate inter-agent communication parameters, using generative models to address data gaps, and dynamically adjusting information dissemination rates during/post disruptions. Finally, the project plans to incorporate societal considerations into distributed power dispatch models by first studying how design parameters, such as computation granularity and strategies for managing struggling agents, affect the distribution of societal benefits and the carbon footprint of distributed computations. These findings subsequently guide the development of socially aware and sustainable models for distributed grid management. The expected outcome of this research is a set of novel analyses accompanied by algorithms, tools, and techniques that harness the autonomy of power system agents to enhance the efficiency and resilience of the nation?s power grids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are also crucial steps in various optimization algorithms including routing, network design, and information clustering. Compared to distances between higher-dimensional data in abstract spaces, distances in real-life networks possess additional structures which often lead to extremely efficient algorithms that are impossible to achieve otherwise. This project aims to develop novel methods to represent, compress, and sketch distances on networks when geometry is present. This is a timely response to the ever-growing need to summarize massive geometric data. By focusing on simple and practical algorithmic solutions, the project provides a useful toolbox for algorithm designers, addressing important open questions at the frontier of human knowledge. In addition, the integrated education and mentoring plan sets the goal to enhance mathematical literacy and critical thinking skills among local college and high-school students in the New Hampshire and Vermont area. <br/><br/>Geometric constraints on graph metrics arise from the interaction between the graph and its ambient space that often comes with simple topological or Euclidean structures. The project focuses on various types of geometric metrics, such as planar distances, p-norms (i.e., a norm on suitable real vector spaces given by the pth root of the sum ? or integral ? of the pth-powers of the absolute values of the vector components) and their generalizations, and hop distances on geometric shapes. These metrics are common in applications like computer graphics, vehicle routing, and shape analysis, and they also appear implicitly in string editing in bioinformatics and configuration spaces in robotics. The main theme is to design a robust and versatile distance sketching toolbox using geometry, with a tradeoff option between accuracy and efficiency, while remaining lightweight in resource usage. The techniques are involved and rely on the interplay between different research fields, such as metric embeddings, topological graph theory, and geometric algorithms, aiming to study optimization from a graph partitioning perspective. These tools will then be used to tackle problems where current algorithmic solutions are inefficient, inaccurate, or nonexistent.

Efficient and selective electrocatalytic processes for converting electrical energy to chemical energy are essential for a sustainable economy. However, many processes still lack the necessary energy efficiency and product selectivity for practical use. Recent studies indicate that catalytic activity can be enhanced by choosing the appropriate electrolyte cation. To advance this strategy, detailed knowledge of the impact of the supporting electrolyte?s cation on the EDL structure is required but is largely missing. Professor Waegele and his students will use vibrational spectroscopy to examine the distributions of cations and the resulting EDL electric fields as a function of electrode potential. Their studies could provide insights into the key factors influencing the EDL structure and resulting catalytic activity for carbon dioxide reduction, hydrogen evolution, and other technologically relevant reactions. Additionally, Professor Waegele?s team will offer educational opportunities for high school students.<br/><br/>The project team will employ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) to probe the potential-dependent structure of the EDL. To this end, Professor Waegele?s group will use multiple vibrational reporters. Briefly, the team will measure how the accumulation of organic cations in the EDL is controlled by their properties, anion identity, and electrode material and characterize the emergent electric field with vibrational Stark spectroscopy. The team will further develop and apply vibrational reporters as quantitative measures of the accumulation of inorganic cations. Lastly, the team will investigate the EDL environment that is experienced by key reaction intermediates in carbon dioxide reduction. The work could provide fundamental insights into the structure of the EDL by unraveling the relationships between cation distribution in the EDL and interfacial electrostatics during electrocatalysis. Results will likely advance the understanding of the EDL under reaction conditions, where application of classical EDL theories is often inadequate. Further, the project could establish how the structure of the micro-environment influences catalysis. This information is essential for designing electrocatalytic interfaces that selectively and efficiently catalyze many technologically relevant reactions. The project will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and engage non-academic communities, particularly high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Access to clean water is dwindling due to climate-induced droughts and growing populations. Currently, about 800 million people lack access to safe water, highlighting the need for complementary technologies like AWE alongside desalination. Addressing water scarcity requires a broad range of solutions, and AWE offers promising potential. AWE technologies also apply to humidity control and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy reduction, crucial for rising cooling demands driven by growing populations and increasing temperatures. These technologies can efficiently extract water by more than 80-90% compared to traditional air conditioning. This dual-purpose functionality could make AWE a game-changer for domestic, commercial, and industrial systems, drastically lowering energy input for humidity management. By developing innovative materials and devices, this project aims to alleviate water stress and significantly cut energy consumption in HVAC and humidity control applications. Its impact extends beyond water production, addressing critical global challenges like sustainable cooling and energy efficiency while contributing to water and energy security.<br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a functional atmospheric water extraction (AWE) device by addressing four key objectives: device modeling, adsorbent optimization, alternative adsorbent formulations, and testing various form factors for the adsorbent block. The project will create a heat transfer model using standard heat pipe calculators to optimize radiator fin dimensions, spacing, and heating power, ensuring efficient desorption without requiring a vacuum. The target operating temperature for desorption is 60-100C. The proposed device is designed to produce or remove at least 1?1.5 gallons of water within 12 hours under ambient conditions, with higher water yields in environments with greater humidity. This capability is made possible by an advanced AWE adsorbent, which exhibits superior water capacity across the full range of ambient humidities. This innovation is crucial as existing adsorptive water harvesting systems fail to deliver cost-effective, energy-efficient water production across the wide humidity spectrum of 10?80% relative humidity. By optimizing materials and device configurations, this project will lay the groundwork for a commercially viable AWE system that addresses global water scarcity challenges while offering significant energy efficiency improvements compared to existing technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins perform important functions in cells. Cells build proteins using small molecules, called amino acids. Amino acids occur in two mirror image forms: L-amino acids and D-amino acids. L-amino acids are used in proteins, but D-amino acids are not. It is not understood why L-amino acids are specifically used in proteins, but it is known that using D-amino acids can be fatal to bacterial cells. Enzymes within a cell can typically recognize either L- or D-amino acids. There is an enzyme, ProXp-x, which is an exception; it recognizes both. This project will investigate how the enzyme, ProXp-x, prevents D-amino acid use in proteins of soil-dwelling bacteria. This research will determine how ProXp-x recognizes D- vs. L-amino acids, and how ProXp-x protects bacterial cells from D-amino acid toxicity. The findings will fill gaps in the field?s understanding of protein creation and enzyme function, adding to the field?s fundamental knowledge of enzymes and how cells adapt to stress. This project will also train a team of undergraduate researchers, create several exhibits and games about molecular biology and biochemistry for the Joseph Moore Museum (a natural history museum on Earlham College?s campus), and lead to the publication of classroom materials to use the project as an interactive laboratory experience.<br/><br/>The project will characterize how ProXp-x identifies and binds its targets and determine if its activity prevents D-amino acid toxicity in living bacteria. D-amino acids can be mischarged onto tRNAs, preventing accurate protein production. Many bacteria encode D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylases (DTDs), an enzyme that removes D-amino acids from D-aa-tRNAs. Soil-dwelling Rhizobia bacteria do not encode DTDs, but do encode ProXp-x. Unlike DTDs, ProXp-x does not recognize all D-aa-tRNAs or Gly-tRNA. Instead, ProXp-x activity appears dependent on the specific combination of amino acid and tRNA in the aa-tRNA. The project will employ undergraduates to conduct mentored research to study ProXp-x in Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Project aims include using kinetic assays and binding experiments with purified protein and aa-tRNAs to determine how ProXp-x distinguishes between mischarged L- and D-aa-tRNAs, specifically identifying the tRNA features recognized by ProXp-x and the active site residues that recognize the aminoacyl-moiety. Students will also measure R. palustris growth phenotypes and D-aa-tRNA levels in cells to determine if ProXp-x prevents D-amino acid toxicity. Taken together, the project expands the field?s understanding of protein synthesis, enzyme function, and how bacteria contend with D-amino acids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In October 2024, wildfires in Western North Dakota burned over 110,000 acres, significantly impacting croplands, rangelands, and unmanaged ecosystems. Soil microbial communities, which drive nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and plant recovery, are particularly vulnerable to fire-induced disturbances. Disruptions to these microbial processes can lead to long-term declines in soil fertility, reduced crop yields, and compromised land productivity, threatening both local economies and national food security. However, the dynamics of microbial recovery in human-managed systems remain poorly understood. This RAPID project takes advantage of a critical time-sensitive window to investigate wildfire-driven shifts in microbial communities and soil function before they are obscured by seasonal agricultural activities. Without immediate study, key microbial and biochemical transitions may go undocumented, limiting our ability to develop effective recovery strategies. By tracking microbial composition, functional genetic activity, and soil toxicity across different land-use types, this research will provide much-needed insights into ecosystem recovery dynamics. Findings will inform sustainable land management strategies, ensuring that agricultural soils remain productive and resilient in the face of increasing wildfire disturbances. The study will also support North Dakota?s agricultural sector by guiding post-fire recovery efforts that protect soil fertility and mitigate nutrient loss, benefiting both local and national food security.<br/><br/>This study integrates high-resolution microbial and biochemical analyses across three critical post-fire time points: immediately after the fire (November 2024), pre-planting (March 2025), and post-growing season (September 2025). Soil samples will be collected from burned and unburned sites within agricultural, rangeland, and unmanaged ecosystems to compare microbial recovery trajectories. Next-generation sequencing of bacterial and fungal markers will assess microbiome diversity, while digital PCR will quantify functional genes related to nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and carbon cycling. Soil toxicity and respiration assays will evaluate microbial activity and overall soil health. Multivariate statistical analyses and microbial network modeling will be applied to identify key drivers of microbial resilience and functional restoration. This interdisciplinary approach will provide critical data to policymakers, land managers, and researchers working to mitigate the ecological and agricultural consequences of wildfires. Outreach efforts through extension services, field days, and public engagement will ensure that research findings translate into actionable strategies for sustaining fire-affected landscapes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference brings together scientists studying a range of molecules that regulate plant growth. The conference promotes interactions and scientific exchange between researchers with scientific backgrounds and interests that cross disciplines and scales. Such interactions will expose participants to the latest advances in the field as well as to an international research community. This exposure will play an especially significant role in advancing the professional development of early-career scientists helping to accelerate the training of the next generation of researchers. This exchange of information is also critical to develop applications related to these molecules to increase crop yields, stress resistance, and improved post-harvest storage to improve food security. Novel information and ideas from this conference will be shared with other scientists via review and perspectives articles to broaden scientific research on plants.<br/><br/>Diffusible chemical signals play critical roles in the growth, development, and stress responses of plants. These signals are known collectively as plant growth regulators or substances. IPGSA 2025 will bring together established scientists, early-career faculty, students, postdoctoral fellows, and those new to the plant growth substances field to discuss the latest advances in the regulation of plants by these chemical signals. The IPGSA meetings are unique because, unlike other conferences that focus on a single molecule or class of molecules (auxins, ethylene, etc.), the IPGSA conferences span all small molecules that regulate plant growth, thus promoting an integrated understanding of the regulation of plant growth, development, and responses to stresses. The science presented at IPGSA 2025 will involve integrating across scales, providing links between processes at the molecular and cellular levels to growth responses at the tissue and organismal levels. This will include systems-wide studies that have facilitated the development of predictive models for growth-regulator signaling and for signal integration between different growth regulators. Talks will include interdisciplinary areas including the use of mathematical modeling to explore the topology of gene regulatory networks, the use of chemical biology to understand and control hormone signaling, studies of the plant microbiome that integrate microbiological and plant genetic approaches, and the use of a combination of biology, biophysics, and computational approaches to model hormone receptor structure.

Additionally, in communication and magnetic recording systems, synchronization errors can occur in two forms. The first type is a deletion error, where a transmitted symbol is not received. The second type is an insertion error, where an unexpected spurious symbol is received. The propagation of these errors can greatly reduce the performance of these systems.

Current vulnerability detection approaches at the hardware level focus on post-hoc patches applied after hardware is deployed, but to date these solutions have been short-lived and inadequate for long term protection. Furthermore, standard methods to evaluate security at the computer hardware level are basically non-existent, leading to ad-hoc custom solutions. As a result, industry stakeholders do not have the tools they need to compare the security of different architectural designs and cannot make informed decisions about the trade-offs between performance and security. This project proposes new abstract methods for reasoning about hardware vulnerabilities and builds an evaluation infrastructure that can be easily integrated into commonly used hardware design tools to incorporate security metrics. In addition, this project investigates a new angle for reasoning about vulnerabilities at the computer architecture (or microarchitectural) <br/>level resulting in more robust hardware designs. This project introduces a new programming interface for programs to state the desired memory region to be used and an abstract model to represent vulnerable microarchitectural structures. The outcomes of this project have the potential to help industry identify security challenges at hardware design time and make informed decisions about security tradeoffs. The microarchitectural attacks and defenses topics are introduced to computer engineering education as standard modules in both undergraduate and graduate level courses. The developed computer engineering course within the Precollegiate Development Program brings computer engineering concepts to a diverse population of high-school students.<br/><br/>The project addresses modern vulnerabilities in the microarchitecture by introducing a new interface to represent expected regions of memory. This new interface helps address the root of most microarchitectural vulnerabilities: the unauthorized access to sensitive data. The project further explores a method to differentiate ?normal? from ?abnormal? memory access patterns and then uses the normal memory region to establish protection mechanisms. In addition, it expands gem5, a commonly used performance evaluation tool, with abstract-based models that represent microarchitectural attacks to enable computer experts to reason about security challenges. The project includes several case studies in which the proposed security evaluation methods can shed light of the security or insecurity of microarchitectural designs. The novelty of this work lays in exploring a new angle for mitigating microarchitectural vulnerabilities and for exploring security metrics that can be incorporated into the existing hardware design cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much real-world data is indeed of this type, like the link structure of web pages or the call records of cell phones. From this partial data, we still want to answer questions about the entire network, like finding communities within the network. This network inference and network reconstruction is made possible by making assumptions on the process that generated the network.  In addition to the research on network inference and reconstruction algorithms, the investigator will train students, from the secondary to graduate level, in this topic, and disseminate knowledge through a monograph. The investigator has partnered with the Kohl Children's Museum of Greater Chicago to develop exhibits and programming to raise children?s interest and understanding of probability theory and will continue to engage with the public through the media.<br/><br/>The project will study three research directions. (1) Community Detection in Spatial Networks: Traditionally, probabilistic network models have not included a spatial dimension and thus do not accurately reflect transitive behavior in real-world networks, for example, ?the friend of my friend is also my friend.'' The project will work towards a theory for spatial networks, answering foundational questions on statistical limits and developing efficient algorithms for inference. (2) Optimization for Inference: Optimization algorithms have been used with great success for inference problems on networks, yet there are some problems for which we do not know whether an optimization algorithm is the best algorithm for a given task. The project will investigate the power of optimization algorithms for network inference tasks, including semidefinite programming for community detection and quadratic programming for graph matching. (3) Reconstructing Networks: Network reconstruction tasks involve determining the connectivity structure of a large network given a noisy or fragmented copy of the network. The project will tackle open problems in reconstructing a network from unlabeled local neighborhoods of nodes, identifying a graph?s isomorphism class from its local neighborhoods, and planted subgraph recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Formal security models will support these efforts, and enable rigorous proofs of security.  Two main objectives are to design best-possible constructions from elliptic curves and to develop new techniques to ensure security against quantum attackers.

However, trace amounts of sulfur exist as dissolved organic sulfur (DOS). Research on DOS in the ocean began in the 2000?s. This is because it is difficult to measure DOS concentration in a solution having almost one million times more inorganic sulfate. While relatively small in quantity compared to inorganic sulfur, DOS plays critical roles in oceanic and atmospheric processes. For example, sunlight degrades DOS into carbonyl sulfide gas, which moves into the upper atmosphere, forming sulfate particles that block sunlight reaching the Earth. Many DOS compounds are essential for microbial growth in the ocean. Additionally, some DOS compounds react with essential (e.g., zinc) and toxic (e.g., mercury) trace metals to affect their solubility and biological availability. To uncover the mysteries of DOS, this study will utilize archived samples collected from over 100 locations in the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Antarctica and collect fresh samples in the North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda. The scientists will measure the total concentrations of DOS in these samples and determine the compounds that make up DOS. Graduate and undergraduate education is a central part of this project. The project will support one graduate student at Old Dominion University and graduate and undergraduate students at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. The scientists will share their research with the public through already scheduled lectures and forums. They will also develop and use a virtual reality (VR) experience to simulate what it is like to go to sea and collect samples for DOS.<br/><br/>This research project will uncover the processes governing the marine DOS cycle in the Pacific Ocean, with three primary objectives: 1) Accurately quantify the DOS inventory across the entire Pacific Ocean to clarify its role in the global sulfur cycle. 2) Identify the abiotic and biotic processes responsible for DOS production and removal along two meridional Pacific transects, encompassing different biogeochemical regimes, hydrothermal plumes, and oxygen minimum zones. 3) Conduct a year-long, monthly collection of depth profiles at the Bermuda-Atlantic Time Series (BATS) to investigate the reactivity of DOS and its components. The research will leverage archived samples from three Pacific meridional transects, spanning from Alaska to Antarctica and Antarctica to Mexico, along with newly collected samples from the monthly BATS cruises.

Tropical montane habitats change quickly as one travels upslope due to rapid changes in temperature, precipitation, and plant life. Narrow bands of high-elevation habitats are sometimes called ?sky islands? due to their patchy and isolated distributions. These ?sky islands? can harbor species with similarly narrow distributions, creating specialized communities that are isolated across mountain ranges. This research examines the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of bird communities of Polylepis forests in the Central Andes Mountains of Peru and Bolivia. Polylepis forests are the highest-elevation forests in the world, occurring from 3500?5000 meters above sea level. These forests are highly fragmented, with differences in the connectivity and size of forest patches. Researchers will sequence DNA from populations of approximately 30 species of birds that live in Polylepis forests and the adjacent grasslands. The researchers will assess connectivity among populations and determine if certain characteristics, such as the ability to fly long distances, are associated with differences in population connectivity among the bird species. Current species? classification will be evaluated in light of the population-level DNA data and data on bill shape, body size, and feather coloration. This project will provide experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate students by establishing the Museum Undergraduate Science and Exploration Opportunities (MUSEOs) program at the bird division of the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Sciences. This new curriculum will use a near-peer network of mentors to expand entry points and progression routes for students in research and curation.

The high-temperature laser beam used for additive manufacturing of metal alloys usually produces highly heterogeneous microstructures that result in large inhomogeneous residual stresses in 3D-printed materials. Residual stresses are generally detrimental to the performance of a material or the life of a component, thus limiting the wide adoption of additive manufacturing in engineering applications. While the macroscale residual stresses have been widely studied in the field of metal 3D printing, the origin and control of the microscale residual stresses remain largely unexplored. This collaborative research aims to understand and control the microscale residual stresses in additively manufactured stainless steel. Due to its excellent combination of mechanical properties, corrosion, and oxidation resistance, stainless steel is a workhorse material used in a wide range of applications such as cars, ships, airplanes, nuclear power plants, medical implants, etc. The research will investigate the effects of 3D-printed microstructures on the resultant microscale residual stresses in stainless steel by integrating microstructural characterization, mechanical testing, and computational modeling. Mechanistic insights gained will be applied to guide additive manufacturing, so as to mitigate the microscale residual stresses in 3D-printed stainless steel. Results from this research will lay a solid foundation for future development of additively manufactured metallic materials with tailored microstructures and outstanding mechanical performance. The project will promote teaching, training, and learning through multi-discipline approaches, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, and enrich curriculum development efforts, particularly in the interdisciplinary areas of materials science and advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Additive manufacturing of metal alloys via laser powder bed fusion and laser engineered net shaping technologies features highly localized melting processes, fast cooling rates, and strong temperature gradients. These extreme laser-printing conditions result in highly nonequilibrium microstructures that lead to severely inhomogeneous residual stresses in additively manufactured materials. The research aims to elucidate the fundamental relationships between the additive manufacturing methods, heterogeneous microstructures and microscale residual stresses in 3D-printed stainless steel. The project consists of two major thrusts. Thrust I involves 3D printing, microstructural characterization, mechanical testing and in situ synchrotron x-ray measurements of residual stresses in stainless steel for a large range of printing schemes and parameters, and accordingly a variety of printed microstructures. Thrust II involves the development of microstructure-sensitive crystal plasticity finite element models that account for the heterogeneous grain structures and sub-grain solidification cell structures. The impact of both intergranular and intragranular residual stresses on the mechanical responses of printed samples will be systematically studied by combining experiments and simulations. Mechanistic insights gained will be applied to guide the optimization of printing schemes and parameters, so as to alleviate the microscale residual stresses in 3D-printed stainless steel.

A deeper understanding of children?s negotiation abilities is useful in thinking about how children solve problems and resolve conflicts. Moreover, it is arguably more productive to intervene in maladaptive decision-making strategies as they unfold in real-time rather than waiting until adulthood when such errors are harder to undo. Developmental and cross-cultural research in this space is useful for educators and policymakers as they engage in training the next generation of critical thinkers and strategic decision-makers. Indeed, this body of work can assist educators and policymakers in creating teaching methods and curricula that foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills from an early age.<br/><br/>This research program explores the development of strategic decision-making. In everyday life, people often must decide how to handle situations in which they either share the same interests with others or have competing interests. In negotiations, the best outcomes are achieved when each person makes concessions on lower-priority interests to make gains on higher-priority interests. Little is known about how the conceptual skills that support successful negotiations develop in the first place and across societies. Across five empirical studies, the study has five overarching goals: (a) probe early markers of effective negotiations; (b) explore young humans? capacity to engage in effective negotiations involving competing and overlapping interests; (c) observe how efficient agreements vary across age groups and regions; (d) examine dyadic real-time negotiation strategies, including personality factors that lead to efficient agreements; and (e) determine the synchrony (or delay) in one?s basic ability to make efficient agreements and its application in real-time negotiations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, despite its widespread adoption in biotechnology, many questions remain regarding how Cas9 functions in nature. Cas9 main biological function is to protect bacteria from viral invaders known as bacteriophages, or phages for short. These CRISPR-Cas9 systems acquire memories, in the form of DNA fragments, from prior phage infections, allowing bacterial cells to rapidly kill the same phage when it is encountered again in a later infection. This project will explore the hypothesis that a class of phages called ?temperate phages? that are often neglected in CRISPR-Cas studies hold the key to understanding CRISPR-Cas memory acquisition. These results will inform new generations of Cas9 technologies, including molecular recording devices, and highlight how CRISPR-Cas systems and temperate phages together influence the evolution of bacterial communities. The project also details an educational plan that will provide undergraduate students an opportunity to learn more about the arms race between bacteria and their phages and careers in microbiological research.<br/><br/>A central question in CRISPR-Cas memory creation is how cells survive a lytic phage infection long enough to create a new memory and utilize it for defense. Intriguingly, many CRISPR systems target temperate phages, which are capable of entering a program called ?lysogeny?, in which their DNA is inserted into the bacterial chromosome, where it may remain in a dormant form. This proposal tests the hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas systems can exploit the temperate lifecycle by acquiring memories about those phages under non-lytic conditions. Specifically, the proposal examines whether new memories can be made during the initiation of lysogeny (aim 1) and/or after lysogeny has occurred and the phage has integrated into the chromosome as a prophage (aim 2). Finally, the proposal tests whether prophages can influence the ability of CRISPR-Cas systems to acquire memories from other infecting phages (aim 3). Temperate phages are understudied in CRISPR-Cas laboratory experiments, because the rates of lysogeny are significantly higher than spacer acquisition. This proposal will employ new genetic tools to thoroughly dissect the interactions between CRISPR-Cas systems and their natural temperate phage targets, revealing a new paradigm for how CRISPR-Cas immunity is established.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project aims to directly detect dark matter particles by exploring a broad range of possible dark matter masses. Recently, the fuzzy dark matter model has emerged as a promising candidate. In this model, the particles that make up dark matter are so light that they spread out over large areas, rather than clustering in small groups. This characteristic could help explain the size of our galaxy and why there seems to be a minimum size limit for galaxies in general. The project is driven by interests in high-energy physics, but it presents considerable experimental challenges. The research team plans to develop a new system designed to cast a wide net in the ongoing laboratory search for dark matter. The innovative techniques they create could not only help in the search for dark matter but also facilitate the discovery of new forces and enhance our ability to measure energy levels in quantum systems.<br/><br/>The research team will build a system to search for ultra-low mass dark matter by examining how it interacts with nuclear spins. Nuclear spin energy levels will fluctuate based on how they align with the flow of dark matter. As the Earth rotates and the dark matter oscillates, these energy levels will change, creating a unique pattern over time.<br/>The most precise measurements of the energy differences between quantum states?measured in absolute terms?have been achieved using groups of optically ?pumped? nuclear spins. This technique involves using light to control the orientation of a nucleus's spin, effectively aligning the nuclear spins in a specific direction through the manipulation of light.<br/>There is still significant potential to enhance energy sensitivity using current technology. The research team's goal is to achieve a 30-fold improvement over the current best methods, with data readout conducted by a SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device).<br/><br/>The team will conduct two distinct dark matter searches: one targeting dark matter with a frequency higher than the Earth?s rotation rate, and another for dark matter with a mass lower than this rotation rate, that will include investigating the ?Fuzzy? dark matter scenario.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a long-lived (perennial) crop, grapevines are typically cultivated as a clonally propagated stem (the scion) which is mechanically grafted to a genetically distinct, clonally propagated root (the rootstock). Because grapevines are cultivated as clones, individual plants of the same variety are essentially genetic twins. Thousands of clonal stem varieties are planted across the globe and exhibit large variation in growth, berry chemistry, and wine volatiles based on vineyard environmental conditions and management. This variation in growth and performance is known as phenotypic plasticity and impacts both fruit and wine characteristics, a phenomenon known culturally and commercially as ?terroir?, the signature of the local environment on the vine. Because of their clonal nature, one potential mechanism contributing to phenotypic plasticity in grapevines is changes to the epigenome, a collective term for non-genetic DNA modifications that can change how specific genes and gene pathways are activated or deactivated. The goal of this project is to understand which portions of the grapevine genome are impacted by epigenetic changes, how epigenetic change in the root and the stem interact in grafted plants, and how these changes contribute to optimal plant resilience in response to environmental stress. These results will be used to help plant breeders identify the next generation of elite grapevine varieties and grape growers improve grapevine production across diverse growing regions. Integrated education and outreach include providing research training for project personnel in collaboration with industry partners across six states. In addition, project participants will be involved in outreach and hands-on research training activities that leverage existing programs and partnerships to maximize STEM participation of high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>How do long-lived plants (perennials) acclimate to different environments and what is the extent of phenotypic plasticity possible from a single genome? Grapevines are grown as a composite of a clonally propagated stem (the scion) mechanically grafted to a clonally propagated root (the rootstock).  These unique combinations of shoot and root are planted across diverse geographic regions around the world; consequently, grapevines offer a powerful system for investigating the molecular basis of whole-plant, multi-year phenotypic plasticity and enables the experiment disentanglement of the shoot genotype x root genotype x environment interactions across diverse climatic conditions. The goal of this collaborative project is to develop an integrated understanding of how the genome of clonally propagated perennial plants produces ?adapted? phenotypes, from roots to shoots, over time and under different environmental conditions, and to identify the molecular basis of this phenotypic plasticity. This study will use experimental vineyards planted with a single scion cultivar ?Marquette? grafted to three commercial rootstock cultivars, replicated in three different environments (New York, Missouri, South Dakota). The project will use an integrative systems biology approach combining measures of plant physiology, leaf ionomics and metabolomics, fruit ionomics and metabolomics, wine chemistry analysis, and connections between sRNA, mRNA, and cytosine methylation signatures in shoots and roots across sites and their interaction with the spatial and temporal changes that occur in the epigenome in clonal shoots and roots.

Both systems are partly controlled by friction. Microscopic contacts at rock interfaces of the fault or the base of the ice sheet controls the friction in these systems. The details of how these surfaces evolve as rocks fail hold information to better understand future events and to assess hazards. It is impossible to observe these interfaces in nature. The most informative measurements come from sensors placed at the surface. The goal of this proposal is to instead observe an experimental system to determine how interfaces slip and evolve. The experiments listen to ice slip experiments with sensors to study how the faults evolve, and how changes may affect seismic hazards. The project will support a graduate student and a collaboration across three institutions.<br/><br/>The goal of the study is to understand how the evolution of contacts during cycles of shear, slip, and stability control large scale behaviors in both faults and glacial systems. This will be accomplished by directly observing the coupled processes that control nucleation, slow and fast slip, healing, drag, and melting in ice to understand the fundamental mechanisms that drive the evolution of conditionally unstable frictional interfaces. A series of both static and sliding experiments will be performed using a custom cryogenic biaxial apparatus and a sample of ice atop a glass plate. Ice will be used for two key reasons: 1) it is transparent, allowing light and images to be transmitted through it; and 2) it has a low melting temperature, such that exploring a modest range of temperature covers a broad swath of homologous temperature, T/Tm, and thus both brittle and ductile behavior.

Second language (L2) learners whose native language does not use stress to contrast word meaning often face difficulty in perceiving stress in their L2. Even when both languages do use stress contrastively, stress acquisition may be challenging if the two languages differ in their phonetic cues used for stress, or if stress plays a stronger role in differentiating words in the L2 compared to the first. While phonetic training has been shown to be effective for improving the perception of L2 speech segments and tone acquisition, whether it is effective for improving suprasegmental stress perception in a L2 has not been well established. This doctoral dissertation investigates whether the perception of stress by L2 learners may be improved through phonetic training and whether the benefits of training generalize to untrained syllable positions. Additionally, this dissertation investigates the role of attention in the learning of L2 stress. The importance of attention for the acquisition of unfamiliar speech sounds has been discussed by L2 learning models, but few studies have examined its role during phonetic training for non-segmental features. Understanding whether phonetic training is effective for improving stress acquisition and the role that attention plays during training can help inform linguistic theories for L2 acquisition and aid in developing effective pedagogical methods for teaching second language stress.<br/><br/>The doctoral dissertation aims to establish whether the perception and phonological processing of suprasegmental stress by L2 learners may be improved through phonetic training, the role that attentional allocation plays during the acquisition of suprasegmental features, and whether the benefits of training are generalizable to untrained syllable positions. The Automatic Selective Perception model posits that attentional focus is required during the early stages of L2 learning in order to successfully perceive and acquire novel L2 sounds. This predicts that mere exposure to L2 sounds may not result in improving perceptual accuracy if a learner?s attention is not directed towards the feature in question. The present dissertation provides participants with a series of four phonetic training sessions. While all participants are exposed to the same stimuli during training, they are split into two groups with different tasks: a stress group and a segmental group. The stress group receives feedback during training directing their attention to identifying stress placement, while the segmental group has their attention directed to initial consonant voicing. Four pre- and post-tests are given to measure performance differences after training: a sequence-recall task, two discrimination tasks (an AX task and a novel AQX task), and an identification task. In sum, this dissertation aims to contribute to our understanding of the role of attention during L2 stress acquisition and determine whether phonetic training is effective for improving stress perception for first and second language pairs that differ in their instantiation of stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tendency for policymakers to favor reactive solutions while neglecting proactive preventative efforts is perhaps most evident in the context of natural disasters. The benefits of investment in risk reduction can be intangible, particularly if it avoids a disaster, but the mobilization of aid to communities experiencing a natural disaster provides visible outcomes. This illustrates a broader public policy-behavioral dilemma called The Intangibility of Public Policy. The implication is that intangibility of outcomes will cause people to undervalue risk reduction investments and policies, which will lead to excessive levels of public risk.<br/><br/>The project involves a survey experiment that leverages wildfire exposure and forest management to investigate the behavioral implications of the intangibility of wildfire risk reduction. Using secondary data, the researchers identify wildfire relevant locations (zip codes) that were exposed and not exposed to a Type 1/severe wildfire in 2024 and that had hazardous fuels forest thinning in the previous two-year period (pre-thinning) or are planned to have thinning in the subsequent two-year periods (post-thinning). Across the wildfire and management conditions, the survey experiment considers (i) how people perceive the reduction in wildfire risk from previous and planned forest thinning, (ii) people?s preferences for the allocation of wildfire risk reduction investment between prevention and suppression activities, and (iii) people?s willingness to take individual action to reduce wildfire risks. Comparisons across exposure and management conditions provide insights to how people perceive, respond, and support risk reduction following a disaster. This research builds on established interdisciplinary insights in behavioral economics, risk perception, and public policy, with a focus on natural disaster management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Direct imaging requires detecting the exoplanet?s light despite the glare of its host star, but the exoplanet is millions to billions of times fainter than than its host star. Exoplanets that have been directly imaged so far are large and bright like Jupiter. Detecting Earth-like exoplanets that could have life on their surface is the next goal, but this requires instruments that are at least 100 times more sensitive. The investigators will test new technologies designed to bridge this gap. This testing will take place on the Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory in California. In addition, the team will engage undergraduate summer students from underrepresented groups to work on this project, and they will develop educational programs with local high schools. <br/><br/>The main factor currently limiting exoplanet imaging instrument sensitivity is residual ?speckle? noise, which limits exoplanetary signal detection in science images. Speckles originate from a combination of (1) errors left over after an adaptive optics (AO) system has made an initial correction of the atmospheric turbulence, and (2) imperfections in the optical surfaces from the telescope and instrument. This program will implement a new pathfinder wavefront sensing technology at Lick Observatory on the Shane telescope?s AO system (ShaneAO) called the Fast Atmospheric Self-coherent camera Technique (FAST), designed to overcome this speckle noise limit. This project to implement FAST at ShaneAO is called Real-time Exoplanet Direct imager via Wavefront control Of Optical DefectS (REDWOODS).

To tackle these issues, researchers use a method called circuit cutting, which breaks down large, complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be solved independently. However, once these smaller tasks are solved, recombining their solutions into a final answer is not straightforward. It requires sophisticated methods to ensure the combined solution is accurate and efficient, especially for tasks in quantum-based machine learning. This project aims to explore and improve these recombination techniques, ultimately paving the way for more reliable and effective quantum computing. Such advancements could have a transformative impact on fields like artificial intelligence, drug discovery, and secure communication, while also preparing the next generation of researchers to tackle these cutting-edge challenges. <br/><br/>Considering the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, the project will investigate the impact of circuit cutting techniques on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) and quantum machine learning (QML). By investigating the role of information entropy and quantum entanglement, optimizing sub-circuit recombination, and developing advanced cutting techniques, the research aims to minimize sampling overhead while maintaining fidelity.

Turbulence exists in the fluids that we experience every day. The unpredictability of turbulence limits our forecasting ability for everything from weather to air travel. Turbulence also exists in plasmas - the hot, ionized gases that make up most of the visible Universe. Plasma turbulence plays an important role in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from black hole accretion disks to the interstellar medium, where the heating from turbulence enables the formation of organic molecules which are the building blocks of life. Plasma turbulence also limits the performance of potential future fusion energy reactors. This research program will develop a new platform for producing turbulent plasma in the laboratory and new methods for measuring plasma turbulence. The award also supports a substantial effort to develop an open-access plasma laboratory class, which includes designing, building, and testing laboratory experiments that can be easily reproduced by other instructors. If successful, this effort will strengthen the US STEM workforce by spreading plasma physics instruction to a broader range of educational institutions.<br/><br/>Just as hydrodynamic turbulence is built from vortices of fluid motions, magnetized plasma turbulence is built from magnetic islands and current sheets, which serve to transfer the magnetic energy between different spatial scales. This project will use an imploding carbon wire-array Z-pinch, driven by the new PUFFIN generator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as a magnetic island merging platform to generate magnetized plasma turbulence. This magnetized plasma turbulence will be in a previously unexplored regime: sustained, highly collisional, with an ion-skin depth between the driving and dissipative scales, and energy approximately equipartitioned between magnetic, thermal, and kinetic.  Advanced diagnostics, such as Faraday rotation imaging, Thomson scattering, and imaging refractometry, will be used to study the transition from a laminar to a turbulent plasma.  The diagnostics will serve to characterize the evolution of the power-spectrum and intermittent structures above and below the ion skin depth, and the role of an imposed or self-generated mean-field in correlating turbulent structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the oceans must maintain a balance between alkalinity supplied by continental weathering, and alkalinity removed by calcium carbonate burial, at least over long time periods, a reduction in the burial of calcium carbonate on continental shelves would induce an increase in the carbonate ion concentration of seawater to preserve more calcium carbonate in deep sea sediments. If seawater had a greater carbonate ion concentration than today, then it would absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere. However, the exact mechanism(s) responsible for this CO2 variability remain(s) to be determined. To address this key knowledge gap, the investigators seek to test a method for estimating the carbonate ion concentration of seawater in the past. Existing methods for estimating carbonate ion concentration are labor-intensive and expensive. This proposal aims to test a method that would be much faster and much less expensive. The scientific goal is to combine estimates of carbonate ion concentration from marine sediments with the other geologic evidence to determine the relative importance of biological processes and of changes in sea level as factors that contributed to lower atmospheric CO2 concentration during glacial intervals.  Broader impacts activities include training, mentoring, and the involving undergraduate students in research, community outreach events, and workforce development.<br/><br/>The investigators plan to advance the calibration of an existing proxy for calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution, and to determine if the proxy also provides reliable estimates of bottom water carbonate ion concentration. Calcium carbonate dissolution in the deep sea is sensitive to changes in bottom water undersaturation (expressed as Delta [CO32-]), so a proxy method for CaCO3 dissolution (Globorotalia menardii Fragmentation Index ? MFI), if rigorously calibrated, should provide a measure of bottom water Delta [CO32-].  The MFI method is rapid, inexpensive, only requires a microscope, and is suited to the involvement of undergraduate students in research on the global carbon cycle. The immediate goal is to determine if the MFI method can be used to provide a reliable measure of Delta [CO32-] through a 3-pronged calibration effort with previously collected samples: (1) Determine the MFI across a range of water depths in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, where Delta [CO32-] and the rate of CaCO3 dissolution have been measured independently; (2) conduct a global survey, including the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, to compare MFI against climatological Delta [CO32-] to assess potential regional variability in the relationship between Delta [CO32-] and MFI; and (3) determine the MFI from marine sediments from the Central Equatorial Pacific, covering the last 160,000 years, in two cores where Delta [CO32-] has already been measured using B/Ca ratios in epibenthic foraminifera.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their controlling influence the clouds themselves are insubstantial, a collection of millimeter-sized droplets formed around micron-sized aerosol particles carried by small-scale turbulent motions. Ideally the aggregate climatic effect of individually insubstantial clouds could be assessed by studying the microscale physics and dynamics that determe their reflectivity, which could then be used to estimate the amount of sunlight they reflect back to space over the whole globe.  While appealing, this simple scaling up fails to account for the two-way interactions through which clouds affect the large-scale conditions in which they occur, which in turn affect the microscale processes that control the clouds.<br/><br/>Research under this award seeks to understand the net effect of clouds on climate, taking into account the interactions between clouds and climate that, taken as a whole, generate the equilibrated response of each to the other. The Principal Investigator (PI) of the award uses the term ""buffering"" to refer to the effect of the climate scale on the cloud scale based on recent studies, including Sherwood and Feingold (2009), arguing that the effect of fully equilibrated shallow cloud changes on global climate is often (though not always) less than what would be estimated by simply scaling up from cloud scale to global scale.<br/><br/>Much of the work in the project is devoted to the development of a model which can simulate the small scales relevant to clouds and turbulence while at the same time covering the whole globe.  Existing models capable of simulating cloud motions are too computationally intensive to run on a global domain, thus the PI has devised a strategy in which cloud-scale motions are captured with machine learning-based emulators embedded in each grid column of a global model.  The emulators are trained on output from a hybrid model in which fine-scale cloud-resolving models are embedded in each grid column of a global model, a descendant of the model developed by the Center for Multi-scale Modeling of Atmospheric Processes under AGS-0425247.<br/><br/>The new emulator-based model configuration is used to address three questions regarding the equilibrated response of clouds and large-scale climate, the first of which is whether atmospheric adjustments do in fact serve to buffer the radiative effect of aerosols on clouds.  The immediate effect of aerosols on clouds is to make them brighter by distributing cloud water over a larger number of smaller droplets (the Twomey effect), thus buffering would mean changes in liquid water content and areal coverage that counteract cloud brightening.  The second question is whether interaction with large-scale climate reduces the sensitivity of shallow clouds to sea surface temperature (SST) increases, as experiments with fine-scale models suggest strong reductions in cloudiness with ocean warming which would generate further warming. But the reduction in cloudiness found in fine-scale models may be buffered when large-scale equilibration is taken into account.  The third is whether the the adjustment of shallow clouds to aerosols depend systematically on changes in SST when the fully equilibrated cloud response is considered. The question is important as aerosols are expected to decrease as SST increases over the 21st century.<br/><br/>Research under this CAREER award is paired with a suite of educational activities built around the same themes of climate science and machine learning.  One involves the development of a climate emulator with a user-friendly graphical interface for teaching climate science to a broad range of audiences including the general public.  A second creates resources and training opportunities to help high school teachers show their students how scientists develop and use models to study climate and project future climate change.  A third involves public outreach at the Birch Aquarium, where the PI serves as an advisor and contributor to exhibits and public programs on climate and atmospheric science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The transport of these proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is thus critical for proper functions of the cell. For many such proteins, nuclear localization signals (NLS) have been identified that mediate the interaction with a nuclear import receptor, which, in turn, facilitates translocation of the transport complex across the nuclear membrane. Nuclear importation is an important aspect of cell signaling. In this study a protein involved in nitric oxide signaling will be studied in order to gain mechanistic insight into how cytoplasmic signals are relayed to the nucleus. This protein (nitric oxide synthase; NOSIP) is a cargo for the prominent nuclear import receptor Transportin (TNPO1) and molecular details of this interaction will be examined. The project will involve complimentary expertise of the Kehlenbach and Chook laboratories. The cellular, biochemical and structural research project will directly link to a Broader Impact project which provides STEM training to local community college students, through hands-on lab work, literature review, generation of public educational resources and development of a comprehensive database of nuclear import cargoes. The project will help prepare the STEM workforce, educate the public and update the research community about nuclear transport, and also provide the research community with updated bioinformatics resources.<br/><br/>Two major research questions will be addressed in the study of atypical recognition of NOSIP by TNPO1. The first investigates the mechanism of NOSIP recognition by TNPO1, with the goal of deciphering the distinct and novel interaction mode.

The Chook group will also compare the binding of NOSIP to TNPO1 with the interactions of NOSIP with its minor nuclear import receptors. The second major research questions will involve the Kehlenbach group investigating how the interaction of NOSIP with transport receptors and its subcellular localization are regulated by phosphorylation, and how this post-translational modification affects possible nuclear functions such as mRNA-splicing. Together, the Chook and Kehlenbach groups will shed light on the highly unusual interaction mode of TNPO1 with NOSIP as a cargo protein, and on the regulation of the subcellular localization of NOSIP, which seems to play a prominent role in the nucleus.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Germany project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the German Deutsche Forschung Gemeinschaft (DFG) where NSF funds the US investigator and DFG funds the German partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a long-lived (perennial) crop, grapevines are typically cultivated as a clonally propagated stem (the scion) which is mechanically grafted to a genetically distinct, clonally propagated root (the rootstock). Because grapevines are cultivated as clones, individual plants of the same variety are essentially genetic twins. Thousands of clonal stem varieties are planted across the globe and exhibit large variation in growth, berry chemistry, and wine volatiles based on vineyard environmental conditions and management. This variation in growth and performance is known as phenotypic plasticity and impacts both fruit and wine characteristics, a phenomenon known culturally and commercially as ?terroir?, the signature of the local environment on the vine. Because of their clonal nature, one potential mechanism contributing to phenotypic plasticity in grapevines is changes to the epigenome, a collective term for non-genetic DNA modifications that can change how specific genes and gene pathways are activated or deactivated. The goal of this project is to understand which portions of the grapevine genome are impacted by epigenetic changes, how epigenetic change in the root and the stem interact in grafted plants, and how these changes contribute to optimal plant resilience in response to environmental stress. These results will be used to help plant breeders identify the next generation of elite grapevine varieties and grape growers improve grapevine production across diverse growing regions. Integrated education and outreach include providing research training for project personnel in collaboration with industry partners across six states. In addition, project participants will be involved in outreach and hands-on research training activities that leverage existing programs and partnerships to maximize STEM participation of high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>How do long-lived plants (perennials) acclimate to different environments and what is the extent of phenotypic plasticity possible from a single genome? Grapevines are grown as a composite of a clonally propagated stem (the scion) mechanically grafted to a clonally propagated root (the rootstock).  These unique combinations of shoot and root are planted across diverse geographic regions around the world; consequently, grapevines offer a powerful system for investigating the molecular basis of whole-plant, multi-year phenotypic plasticity and enables the experiment disentanglement of the shoot genotype x root genotype x environment interactions across diverse climatic conditions. The goal of this collaborative project is to develop an integrated understanding of how the genome of clonally propagated perennial plants produces ?adapted? phenotypes, from roots to shoots, over time and under different environmental conditions, and to identify the molecular basis of this phenotypic plasticity. This study will use experimental vineyards planted with a single scion cultivar ?Marquette? grafted to three commercial rootstock cultivars, replicated in three different environments (New York, Missouri, South Dakota).

Both systems are partly controlled by friction. Microscopic contacts at rock interfaces of the fault or the base of the ice sheet controls the friction in these systems. The details of how these surfaces evolve as rocks fail hold information to better understand future events and to assess hazards. It is impossible to observe these interfaces in nature. The most informative measurements come from sensors placed at the surface. The goal of this proposal is to instead observe an experimental system to determine how interfaces slip and evolve. The experiments listen to ice slip experiments with sensors to study how the faults evolve, and how changes may affect seismic hazards. The project will support a graduate student and a collaboration across three institutions.<br/><br/>The goal of the study is to understand how the evolution of contacts during cycles of shear, slip, and stability control large scale behaviors in both faults and glacial systems. This will be accomplished by directly observing the coupled processes that control nucleation, slow and fast slip, healing, drag, and melting in ice to understand the fundamental mechanisms that drive the evolution of conditionally unstable frictional interfaces. A series of both static and sliding experiments will be performed using a custom cryogenic biaxial apparatus and a sample of ice atop a glass plate. Ice will be used for two key reasons: 1) it is transparent, allowing light and images to be transmitted through it; and 2) it has a low melting temperature, such that exploring a modest range of temperature covers a broad swath of homologous temperature, T/Tm, and thus both brittle and ductile behavior. This knowledge, analyzed by cutting-edge machine learning data analysis methods and extrapolated up to larger systems, will improve understanding of the mechanics of the entire stick-slip cycle and stability.

When these nutritional ?pulses? occur, they can initiate chain reactions in food webs, as consumers switch from their normal diets to feast instead on the abundant new food items. Understanding the consequences of these food pulses for natural communities ? which organisms are affected, for how long, and if they stop performing their normal ?jobs? to take advantage of the new resource ? can provide insights into how ecological systems function and respond to change. The synchronized emergence of billions of periodical cicadas every 13 or 17 years in the eastern U.S. provides an enormous pulse of insect food for a variety of generalist consumers. The assembled research team will be the first to document the impacts of cicada pulses on the foraging behaviors and population dynamics of one of the most abundant animals on the planet: ants. Results of the study will advance our understanding of how nutrient pulses alter the varied ecosystem services that ants routinely provide, many of which are relevant for both the forestry and agriculture sectors. In addition to training undergraduate researchers in field biology, the research team has created a free digital education program, ?Friend to Cicadas,? the goal of which is to train and empower teachers throughout the entire range of periodical cicadas to provide activities that spark wonder and curiosity in their students.<br/><br/><br/>In this study, the researchers test the hypothesis that most ants will opportunistically adjust their foraging to capitalize on abundant cicada prey, both during the dramatic spring emergence and again when the next generation of cicadas hatches later in the summer. Further, they predict that changes in ant foraging will alter the strength of their competitive and mutualistic interactions, initiating chains of indirect effects in the forest community. Using a combination of direct foraging observations, nutrient baiting, ant exclusion experiments, pitfall trapping, and isotopic analyses, the researchers will quantify the impacts of these biomass pulses on ant foraging at both the population and community levels. Within- and between-years comparisons will enable the team to gauge the impacts of cicada pulses on ant-mediated ecosystem functions, foraging dynamics, and ant-ant interactions. Specifically, the team will document the indirect effects that are likely to occur if shifts in foraging alter seed dispersal, scavenging, and protective services provided to aphids. Using stable isotopes to quantify the trophic position of ant foragers in both emergence and non-emergence years will allow the team to test whether ants initially occupying a range of trophic positions converge when fed a common diet. Moreover, these biomass pulses present a unique opportunity to examine the context-dependency of species interactions in both mutualistic and competitive settings. Taken together, these findings will contribute to the very limited literature describing the impacts of resource pulses on terrestrial invertebrates and provide important insights into how trophic ecology is altered during, and subsequent to, nutrient pulses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In M3D IC technology, the substrate layers are realized sequentially, and these layers are connected through metal inter-layer vias (MIVs). This project addresses significant challenges associated with the process technology for implementing M3D ICs to ensure reliable, compact and efficient designs. The project will facilitate further advances in M3D IC electronic design automation (EDA) methodology to efficiently address the potential challenges in M3D IC technology for full-scale chip designs. The proposed approaches to address the process-dependent challenges in M3D IC will provide future opportunities for M3D IC technology at all design levels ? device, circuit, and EDA.  The educational goals of this project are to (1) develop activities aiming from high-school students to graduate students that focus on hands-on learning such as  a custom lego-like toolkit that captures the EDA optimization problems of M3D ICs and, (2) IC tape-out activities along with emphasizing the need for energy-efficient and compact ICs. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a process-aware reliable and efficient EDA framework for M3D IC designs by addressing the following key concerns: (a) How significant is the impact of MIV on the performance of devices around it in bulk-substrate M3D IC process and how to reduce this impact for efficient and reliable M3D IC designs in this process technology? (b) How beneficial is the back-end-of-line transistor in the ultra-thin selective-substrate process and how to efficiently use this extra dimension for compact and efficient M3D IC designs in this process technology? and (c) How to obtain efficient M3D IC designs for heterogeneous integration considering both bulk-substrate and ultra-thin selective-substrate processes?

As a long-lived (perennial) crop, grapevines are typically cultivated as a clonally propagated stem (the scion) which is mechanically grafted to a genetically distinct, clonally propagated root (the rootstock). Because grapevines are cultivated as clones, individual plants of the same variety are essentially genetic twins. Thousands of clonal stem varieties are planted across the globe and exhibit large variation in growth, berry chemistry, and wine volatiles based on vineyard environmental conditions and management. This variation in growth and performance is known as phenotypic plasticity and impacts both fruit and wine characteristics, a phenomenon known culturally and commercially as ?terroir?, the signature of the local environment on the vine. Because of their clonal nature, one potential mechanism contributing to phenotypic plasticity in grapevines is changes to the epigenome, a collective term for non-genetic DNA modifications that can change how specific genes and gene pathways are activated or deactivated. The goal of this project is to understand which portions of the grapevine genome are impacted by epigenetic changes, how epigenetic change in the root and the stem interact in grafted plants, and how these changes contribute to optimal plant resilience in response to environmental stress. These results will be used to help plant breeders identify the next generation of elite grapevine varieties and grape growers improve grapevine production across diverse growing regions. Integrated education and outreach include providing research training for project personnel in collaboration with industry partners across six states. In addition, project participants will be involved in outreach and hands-on research training activities that leverage existing programs and partnerships to maximize STEM participation of high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>How do long-lived plants (perennials) acclimate to different environments and what is the extent of phenotypic plasticity possible from a single genome? Grapevines are grown as a composite of a clonally propagated stem (the scion) mechanically grafted to a clonally propagated root (the rootstock).  These unique combinations of shoot and root are planted across diverse geographic regions around the world; consequently, grapevines offer a powerful system for investigating the molecular basis of whole-plant, multi-year phenotypic plasticity and enables the experiment disentanglement of the shoot genotype x root genotype x environment interactions across diverse climatic conditions. The goal of this collaborative project is to develop an integrated understanding of how the genome of clonally propagated perennial plants produces ?adapted? phenotypes, from roots to shoots, over time and under different environmental conditions, and to identify the molecular basis of this phenotypic plasticity.

While recent years have seen a blossoming of novel cryptographic techniques and applications, we still do not know if even our elementary cryptosystems are secure. Unlike most scientific domains, including much of computer science, it is impossible to empirically verify that a cryptosystem is secure. Instead, cryptographic security is founded on the conjectured existence of strong computational intractability: the inability of efficient algorithms to solve particular problems. The primary goal of this project is to strengthen the foundations of computational intractability needed for robust cryptography, which will yield a more robust cryptographic infrastructure. Another goal of this project is educational outreach, which will be presented through talks, tutorials, and lectures to encourage collaboration with diverse communities and, in turn, equip individuals with the ability to reason effectively about security.<br/><br/>We propose exploring novel resource-constrained adversarial models to improve our cryptographic foundations. Traditionally, cryptographic attackers were modeled as probabilistic polynomial time algorithms. To circumvent barriers in this traditional setting and strengthen cryptographic security, we consider adversarial models that are alternately more powerful (e.g., algorithms with limited nondeterminism) and less powerful (e.g., algorithms with fixed polynomial time/space). We highlight two concrete aims: (1) improved cryptographic hardness amplification, yielding extremely hard problems from hard problems, and (2) understanding the feasibility of cryptographic security if it turns out that traditional cryptographic guarantees are impossible, planting our security on a firmer footing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the limited geographic extent of scientific surveys, countless cryptobenthic fish species have yet to be discovered and described, and local biodiversity inventories do not exist in most countries. This project explores the biodiversity of cryptobenthic coral reef fishes in the Indo-Pacific by:  1) conducting a series of local and regional inventories through standardized survey and collection protocols, 2) describing new species by considering multiple high-resolution sources of information to delineate closely related species, 3) analyzing the evolutionary diversification of a particularly species-rich lineage (the dwarf goby genus Eviota) and 4) training a new generation of fish taxonomists with strong ties to coral reef nations to ensure reef fish biodiversity research and conservation for years to come. <br/><br/>Inventorying the diversity of life on our planet is a critical challenge that intensifies with the rapid change of the biosphere.

Unfortunately, this is seldom done because 13C/12C measurements are expensive and not regularly done at sea. In this project, the 13C/12C ratio of ocean carbon dioxide will be measured in the Pacific and Indian Oceans using a new instrument that is much less expensive to run and can run many more samples than previous methods.

When these nutritional ?pulses? occur, they can initiate chain reactions in food webs, as consumers switch from their normal diets to feast instead on the abundant new food items. Understanding the consequences of these food pulses for natural communities ? which organisms are affected, for how long, and if they stop performing their normal ?jobs? to take advantage of the new resource ? can provide insights into how ecological systems function and respond to change. The synchronized emergence of billions of periodical cicadas every 13 or 17 years in the eastern U.S. provides an enormous pulse of insect food for a variety of generalist consumers. The assembled research team will be the first to document the impacts of cicada pulses on the foraging behaviors and population dynamics of one of the most abundant animals on the planet: ants. Results of the study will advance our understanding of how nutrient pulses alter the varied ecosystem services that ants routinely provide, many of which are relevant for both the forestry and agriculture sectors. In addition to training undergraduate researchers in field biology, the research team has created a free digital education program, ?Friend to Cicadas,? the goal of which is to train and empower teachers throughout the entire range of periodical cicadas to provide activities that spark wonder and curiosity in their students.<br/><br/><br/>In this study, the researchers test the hypothesis that most ants will opportunistically adjust their foraging to capitalize on abundant cicada prey, both during the dramatic spring emergence and again when the next generation of cicadas hatches later in the summer. Further, they predict that changes in ant foraging will alter the strength of their competitive and mutualistic interactions, initiating chains of indirect effects in the forest community. Using a combination of direct foraging observations, nutrient baiting, ant exclusion experiments, pitfall trapping, and isotopic analyses, the researchers will quantify the impacts of these biomass pulses on ant foraging at both the population and community levels. Within- and between-years comparisons will enable the team to gauge the impacts of cicada pulses on ant-mediated ecosystem functions, foraging dynamics, and ant-ant interactions. Specifically, the team will document the indirect effects that are likely to occur if shifts in foraging alter seed dispersal, scavenging, and protective services provided to aphids. Using stable isotopes to quantify the trophic position of ant foragers in both emergence and non-emergence years will allow the team to test whether ants initially occupying a range of trophic positions converge when fed a common diet. Moreover, these biomass pulses present a unique opportunity to examine the context-dependency of species interactions in both mutualistic and competitive settings. Taken together, these findings will contribute to the very limited literature describing the impacts of resource pulses on terrestrial invertebrates and provide important insights into how trophic ecology is altered during, and subsequent to, nutrient pulses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goals this effort are to sample and speciate air pollutants emitted from the fires and quantify the contribution of structure fires to concentrations and impacts of hazardous air pollutants in the densely populated megacity of Los Angeles. The knowledge gained from this work will inform disaster response policy (risk assessment, hazard control), ecosystem health risks, prediction of human health risks, and recovery efforts in the wake of a growing national hazard: catastrophic urban fires.<br/><br/>The presence of advanced polymer materials (e.g., in carpets, flooring, clothing, appliances, housewares) and metals (e.g., in electronics, appliances, vehicles, fasteners) suggests that the content of urban fire emissions should be complex and potentially more toxic than emissions from traditional biomass burning events. Analysis of field data suggest that structure fires in WUI regions might produce severe exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), halogenated compounds (e.g., PFAS), dioxins, furans, and transition metals, orders of magnitude larger than the exposure from wildfire emissions. Working with leadership and staff at the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), the proposal team has deployed a small network of AirPen and UPAS systems at existing air quality monitoring stations as close as possible to the existing fires in the northern Los Angeles region. This air quality sampling is expected to last for four weeks but may be adjusted to include additional sites or sampling equipment in the future depending on the nature of the fires. Other region-specific data streams: criteria pollutants measured at SCAQMD air quality monitoring stations, fire activity, and remote sensing (e.g., satellite) and weather (e.g., reanalysis, back trajectory) data will supplement the interpretation of the chemical data.<br/><br/>Ash is expected to persist in the region for weeks-to-months following this event and ash samples will be collected from within the burn areas and from fugitive emission events (i.e., windblown dust) and analyzed. The ash samples are likely to contain a different mixture of toxic species (relative to the smoke), and ash exposure will remain a major human and environmental hazard for first responders, cleanup crews, homeowners, and members of the surrounding community. This effort will demonstrate how structure fires and specific structural fuels have the potential to modulate the environmental and health impacts from WUI fires.<br/><br/>Training for both a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar will be supported through the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, we do not know how many of those genes function, including those that encode proteins that are responsible for processes detrimental to humans. This project will characterize the function of an unknown protein that is found throughout many bacterial families, including those that are pathogenic to humans and affect agriculturally important crops. This protein influences the synthesis of the pilus, which is a structure on the surface of bacteria that is used to attach the bacterium to substrates. Pili facilitate bacterial colonization and sometimes biofilm formation. This project will probe how this protein functions, and will provide the foundation for future approaches to manipulate this protein within biomedical and agricultural contexts. This project also will be integrated into an educational component designed to train cadres of future scientists. Aspects of this project will be adapted for teaching graduate and undergraduate students and will allow them to perform scientific research in the laboratory and in the classroom. The project will also support outreach activities to middle school students to expose them to microscope-based analyses and critical data analysis techniques. <br/><br/>The unknown protein Bresu_2828 has been shown to bind to the global genetic regulator GcrA in the non-model bacterium Brevundimonas subvibrioides. Deletion of bresu_2828 leads to decreased stability of GcrA which ultimately leads to a defect in pilus biosynthesis, but the mechanisms through which Bresu_2828 exerts its effects are unknown. The role Bresu_2828 plays in protein stability will be explored by global quantitative proteomics, assessment of in vitro protein interactions, and precision mutagenesis. The interacting proteins of Bresu_2828 will be compared between different bacterial species to define the similarities and/or differences in Bresu_2828 interactomes, thereby comparing function in different organisms. Bresu_2828 has been found to interact with the SciP protein, which is known to impact pilus synthesis in a bacterium related to B. subvibrioides. SciP function will be analyzed in B. subvibrioides by transcriptionally mapping the pilus biosynthesis gene cluster, identifying transcription factors that influence pilus gene expression, characterizing SciP?s role in pilus expression, and analyzing the role of Bresu_2828 in controlling SciP activity.

The NENIMF operates a Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (SIMS) as a resource for earth, ocean, and planetary science research. SIMS measurements analyze solid materials with great precision. The NENIMF SIMS measures the concentration and isotopic composition of light elements (hydrogen, lithium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen). It supports research in two areas relevant to society, volcanoes and climate change. The SIMS can study the volatiles (dissolved gasses) found in magmas and examine climate signals in biogenic carbonates. The NENIMF trains and assists users with performing analyses. Fifty-six scientists from 32 institutions used the NENIMF from 2022 to 2024, and over the last three decades NENIMF instrumentation has supported almost 400 studies.<br/><br/>The NENIMF uses a Cameca IMS 1280 double focusing mass spectrometer with a large radius magnetic sector (585 mm) and ion optics optimized to attain a mass resolving power (MRP=M/?M) of 6,000 without significant loss of secondary ion intensity. The IMS 1280 was recently upgraded with NSF support from single to multicollection with enhanced UV imaging capabilities. In addition to the specialized microanalytical capabilities of the NENIMF, SIMS users are investigating B isotopes in Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt glasses and subduction zone minerals, Zr in rutile geospeedometry, Ti diffusion in quartz, and U-Th-Pb dating of monazite and zircon. New analytical protocols recently developed at the NENIMF include measuring the concentrations of low abundance volatile elements in nominally anhydrous minerals, characterization of the isotopic composition of B at very low concentrations, measurement of volatiles in very small (< 10 m diameter) melt inclusions, and development of isotope and concentration reference materials. The NENIMF emphasizes student learning and training of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. It will continue to involve WHOI?s Undergraduate Summer Student Fellows, Post-doctoral Scholars, and WHOI/MIT Joint Program graduate students in SIMS-focused research projects. The NENIMF will run annual workshops to engage young scientists in SIMS-based research focused on magma volatiles, and it will conduct community outreach at scientific meetings. The NENIMF will strive to make its analytical platforms accessible to many different users, and it will select and support a visiting summer student during each year of these operations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One regulatory mechanism that is used in nature is to poise the protein machines that access genetic information at the start of genes, waiting to initiate the process of converting the encoded information into molecules that execute cellular functions. Chemical modifications of these ready-to-go proteins exert timely control over cellular responses to stimuli by dictating the efficiency with which genes are activated. For this project, the investigator will push the boundaries of current technologies to explore the structural responses to chemical modifications that trigger release from pausing and entry into efficient decoding of genetic information. This program addresses a significant gap in our knowledge of how gene expression is regulated. This program will train junior scientists at multiple education levels to seek fundamental insight into the systems and processes from biochemistry, using the principles and quantitative laws from the physical sciences. Among other outreach efforts, the investigator will bring undergraduate students from different schools to Penn State for research opportunities that will enhance their career potential in science and engineering fields. <br/><br/>To achieve this project?s objectives, new experimental methodology will be implemented for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of highly flexible proteins. While protons are relatively easy to observe by NMR, the PI has shown that the comparatively more challenging direct-detection of carbon yields more quantitative and complete information for intrinsically disordered polypeptides. Recently, the PI used this technique to demonstrate how serine phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II provides a structural switch that plays a role in regulating the critically important enzyme. RNA Polymerase II pauses at the start of genes before entering into productive elongation and these phosphorylation events are associated with release from the paused state. The PI will now broaden the characterization of pause release by investigating threonine phosphorylation on a required co-regulator of RNA polymerase II, named the DSIF complex, which is a second necessary step for pause release. The phosphorylation patterns on RNA Polymerase II change throughout the process of RNA elongation, so this project will extend characterization of serine phosphorylation to model each of the relevant states in an RNA production cycle. Finally, lysine amino acids in a specific region of RNA polymerase II also acquire methyl groups while the enzyme is active on a subset of genes. These modifications can exert combinatorial control with the previously characterized phosphorylation. Therefore, experiments will be performed to test the hypothesis that addition of methyl groups to the amino acid lysine also induces structural transitions, akin to those the PI has observed in association with phosphate incorporation. As a result, this research and associated training activities will yield fundamental, molecular level insights that provide critical molecular insights into gene regulation.

Aromatic compounds are common building blocks throughout synthetic and pharmaceutical chemistry, however the chemical reactions of aromatic molecules to give value-added commodities is often hindered because it results in the generation of multiple products, necessitating costly purification sequences. Dr. Gustafson and his team are studying new chemical reactions aimed at controlling the selective modification of both simple and complex aromatic scaffolds, ultimately resulting in more efficient synthetic strategies towards molecules of interest to the academic and pharmaceutical communities. In addition to providing training in organic chemistry for graduate and undergraduate students, this project also impacts the education more broadly in that it proposes to incorporate Virtual Reality experiences to aid students in the 3-dimensional visualization of molecules. Virtual Reality will also be utilized in outreach programs aimed at SDSU?s general population, as well as local high schools and community colleges.  <br/><br/>Professor Gustafson and his team of collaborators and students design ?organocatalysts? that affect the regioselective C-H functionalization of simple and complex aromatics through electrophilic aromatic substitution and related aromatic radical functionalization reactions. These transformations traditionally yield poor regioselectivities, often preventing them from being adopted as viable synthetic strategies, particularly in more complex settings. For the addition of electrophiles into aromatics, the Gustafson group designs bifunctional Lewis basic catalysts that intercept and direct the electrophile, or electrophilic radical to a specific position. The Gustafson group is also exploring similar strategies for the functionalization of aromatics with nucleophiles in the context of nucleophilic aromatic substitution and vicarious nucleophilic substitution.  For the regioselective addition of nucleophiles to aromatics, they utilize a broad array of classic organocatalytic strategies including cation directed catalysis and hydrogen-bonding catalysis. The ability to site-selectively modify simple and complex aromatic systems greatly simplifies the syntheses of molecules and opens the door for these chemistries to be used in the context of late-stage functionalization strategies. In order to allow for the design of better and more efficient catalysts, the Gustafson group is also performing mechanistic studies with collaborators in computational chemistry and electrochemistry. The site-selective modification of complex intermediates that this work enables has the potential to transform how the late-stage structural optimization of pharmaceuticals, materials and other functional molecules are carried out.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of ECOM is to introduce students and early-career researchers to current trends in optimization as well as to provide a strong networking environment between academia, industry, and the national laboratories. The focus of this fifth meeting will be on the role of optimization for Digital Twins. Digital Twins are expected to have a significant impact on science, engineering, and society. For instance, it is anticipated that they will lead to new developments in identifying weaknesses in structures such as bridges, nuclear plants, and wind turbines. Digital Twins of human organs have the potential to lead to cures of diseases that have long eluded researchers.  The variety of topics to be discussed in the meeting such as stochastic optimization, modeling, partial differential equations, and risk averse optimization are also of much wider interest beyond Digital Twins. The meeting will also provide a unique opportunity for graduate students, postdocs and other early career scientists to take courses from two leading researchers in modeling, optimization, and scientific computing. <br/><br/>ECOM speakers and participants will study the key question of how to best utilize optimization to combine physics-based and data-driven models. This approach, when carried out for the entire complex physical system, for its lifetime, can be termed a ""Digital Twin."" One of the critical components of a Digital Twin, which distinguishes it from classical modeling, is the use of data over the entire lifetime of the physical system to update the Digital Twin. Subsequently, Digital Twins bring together several research areas in mathematics, including modeling, analysis, control, optimization, numerical analysis, and scientific computing.

The type of parts depends on the nature of the object at hand. This proposal is focused on questions amenable to a dyadic approach: the simpler parts are usually some variation of a small, square signal which takes only two values. Huge advancements have been made since Stefanie Petermichl?s discovery in 2000, that one of the most studied operators in analysis, the Hilbert transform, can be expressed in a meaningful way as an average of such simple operators. Central to this project will be the advancement of Petermichl?s work by relating it to several long-standing open questions in harmonic analysis. An especially exciting path will be building a bridge between two ?competing? methods in modern harmonic analysis, the Bellman function method and the sparse operator domination approach. This has the likelihood of becoming a new ?method? in its own, as it involves new ideas from two leading methods in harmonic analysis. The project further includes organization of activities in harmonic analysis, as well as working with and training graduate students.<br/> <br/>The starting point is an open problem on the dyadic square function which has baffled the field for quite some time. Here, weighted inequalities, specifically with Muckenhoupt weights, will be settled. These types of inequalities have recently dominated modern harmonic analysis, and the dyadic square function is one of the most important operators in the field - especially because it can be viewed as the starting point of Littlewood-Paley theory. The question to then tackle will be the sharp power of the Muckenhoupt characteristic in the weak norm in the Hilbert space setting (parameter p=2). All other situations except the Hilbert space setting (p not equal to 2) are known, which makes it even more strange that this question is still open ? usually, the Hilbert space setting is the ?simple? case one extracts all other values from. However, the nonlinear nature of the dyadic square function turns this all on its head, in a quite unique situation. The planned approach, to merge new ideas for Bellman functions with new ideas for sparse operators, has seen significant recent progress. Much broader applications of this approach are anticipated as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first decade of the ONSAP data collection effort is thus just complete, providing an unprecedented opportunity to determine changes in the North Atlantic Ocean, including changes resulting from ice sheet melting on Greenland and in the Arctic. The aims of this project are to quantify the temporal variability of the oceanic circulation, heat and salt transports, water mass components, and eddy processes in the West Greenland boundary current system, and to determine the effects or atmospheric circulation and storms on the water exchange between the boundary current system and the open waters of the Labrador Basin. Results from this project will improve our understanding of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) which the West Greenland boundary current system is part of. Changes in the strength of the AMOC investigated here can have crucial effects on the climate of adjacent countries and world-wide. <br/><br/>The project has four main scientific objectives that will be explored through a variety of data analysis techniques using the decade-long West Greenland mooring dataset from OSNAP. Context for the work will be given through analysis of upstream and downstream timeseries data provided also through OSNAP and by European collaborators. The four main objectives are: (1) to quantify the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of the circulation and water mass components of the West Greenland boundary current system, (2) to document the year-to-year changes in the dominant mesoscale processes in the boundary current ? including the meandering/eddy formation and wind-driven upwelling ? and assess the resulting impacts on shelf-basin exchange of heat and salt and, ultimately, on convection in the basin, (3) to characterize the atmospheric circulation and storm climate that drive the wind- driven exchange between the West Greenland shelf and Labrador Basin, and (4) to quantify observationally for the first time the transport, seasonal variation, and dominant mesoscale processes of the West Greenland Coastal Current. This work, focused on the detailed processes and dynamics of the West Greenland boundary current system, will improve our understanding of the AMOC and its ramifications for climate. It will provide invaluable information for better interpreting the causes of AMOC variability and its links to freshwater discharge from the Arctic and Greenland as well as water mass transformation in the Labrador and Irminger Seas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes in these seasonal patterns, whether due to natural variation or human influence, raise important questions about their effects on the relationships among species and the stability of natural communities. This project investigates how the timing of seasonal life cycles influences interactions among multiple species, especially those involving indirect effects, such as when one species impacts another through a shared predator or resource. Understanding these dynamics is crucial as ecosystems worldwide face rapid environmental changes. This project will also help predict the effects of shifting seasonal patterns on biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and services that benefit society. Members of the public will be engaged in the research through a citizen science initiative, and research training will be provided to undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. <br/><br/>The proposed study will integrate experiments in amphibian pond communities with theoretical models to determine how variation in the sequence and spacing of phenologies of communities is linked to the dynamics of indirect interactions. First, the team will use a pair of complementary experiments that manipulate the sequence and spacing of phenologies of three amphibian species representing a classic one-predator two-prey interaction module. These experiments are designed to test competing hypotheses of how these critical aspects of temporal community structure are linked to the strength and direction of indirect interactions, and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Results from these experiments will guide the development of a temporally explicit community ecology model that incorporates seasonal variation in species? presence, timing, density, and traits. This model will evaluate what factors can amplify or diminish the influence of indirect interactions and examine the short- and long-term consequences of these patterns across different systems.

Nuclear shape adaptations to those forces are critical for cell fate and function. Yet, the physical and molecular principles underlying those adaptive mechanisms remain largely undefined. By integrating state-of-the-art scientific approaches, this project will generate mechanistic understandings of nuclear mechanics and predictive insights into the organization of force-transmitting complexes in human cells. The work will offer novel rationales to design bio-inspired and force-responsive nanodevices for human health. It will also contribute new perspectives on the normal and defective mechanobiology of the nucleus, advancing our understanding of those critical cellular processes and the diseases that are caused by dysfunction in these systems. A key aspect of the project is the training of early-career scientists, graduate students, undergraduates, and STEM-focused high school students to expose them to a unique research experience at the crossroads of physics and biology.<br/><br/>The project will probe and define the physical mechanisms of force transmission at the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes. These complexes are assemblies of proteins, which exhibit low elastic moduli on their own, but that collectively function as mechanotransducing hubs capable of conveying forces across the membrane of the nucleus, via mechanisms that remain poorly understood. The goals are to identify the molecular tenants governing the formation, maintenance and disassembly of LINC protein clusters as a function of forces applied on the nucleus, to measure forces exerted at these clusters with fluorescent optical force sensors and to formulate physical models that define how LINC complex clustering participates to local changes in the shape of the nuclear membrane and force transmission.  The project will integrate theory and experiment.  It will be implemented through a multidisciplinary approach involving super-resolution microscopy, single molecule tracking, FRET imaging, cellular nanomanipulation, engineering of novel optical force sensors, their calibration using DNA origami nanoactuators, and theoretical modeling.

Cells are very small and so they can best be observed with specialized techniques like electron microscopy. Samples must be preserved carefully for study by electron microscopy and care must be taken not to introduce changes that could mislead interpretation of observations.  The best method for preparing tissue for electron microscopy is to rapidly freeze samples and observe them under very low temperatures, a process called cryogenic preservation. Cryopreservation is challenging in plants, and the goal of the proposed research is to develop procedures that overcome these challenges. If successful, this proposal will allow plant cells and tissues to be observed after cryopreservation and give unprecedented information about how parts of plant cells and tissue work together. Understanding how plant cells work will help develop plants that are better able to meet human needs and ensure food security.

The research will include several early career scientists, and they will receive training in techniques and develop skills which are in high demand in science labs and in industry. <br/><br/>Cryogenic preservation is the gold standard for determining cell ultrastructure in its ?native state? by virtue of physical fixation (freezing) to immobilize cell constituents in milliseconds. Volume electron microscopy (vEM) has gained significant traction as a tool for discovering the structure and spatial organization of cell and tissue components. In combination with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), cryo-vEM has the potential to yield a paradigm shift in multi-scale in situ structural biology. However, due to their physical and chemical properties, plant cells are uniquely recalcitrant to fixation. Thus, plant science is strikingly lagging other fields in the revolution of understanding of how macromolecular complexes and cell compartments coordinate to create life. Determining the structure of cells and organelles in fully frozen hydrated chemically untreated and unstained would allow, for the first time, the observation of these entities in their native states.

While we understand much about the basic molecular mechanisms of RNAi and chromatin modifying pathways, we know very little about how these interdependent pathways are controlled or interact temporally or spatially. This project?s overarching goal is to uncover mechanistic details of how the overlapping networks of RNAi and chromatin modifying pathways maintain appropriate gene regulation during stress. Successful completion of the proposed work will advance our understanding of principles of gene regulation and provide key insights into how perturbations to these networks during stress trigger the onset of diseases, such as cancer and infertility. This project will engage undergraduate and graduate researchers by providing paid early career research opportunities, interdisciplinary training, and establishing a regional scientific seminar series and conference that will provide networking and presentation opportunities for trainees while also exposing them to research outside of their institution.<br/><br/>It is evident RNAi and chromatin modifying pathways collaborate. Prior work has identified chromatin modifying factors required for deposition of repressive chromatin marks at RNAi-targeted loci across eukaryotes. However, our understanding of the intricate mechanisms governing complex interactions between these two essential gene regulatory pathways remains rudimentary. Using the C. elegans germline as a model system and interdisciplinary approaches (genetics, physiological assays, multi-?omics approaches, and bioinformatics), we will test the hypothesis that feedback motifs between RNAi and chromatin modifying pathways ensure balance between the pathways to maintain appropriate regulation of a distinct set of genes and protect germ cell identity during heat stress. This project will advance our understanding of (1) the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of C. elegans germ cells during normal conditions; (2) how RNAi and chromatin modifying pathways collaborate to maintain this landscape during environmental stress; (3) how genetic and environmental perturbations affect gene regulatory pathways; and (4) the molecular mechanisms that maintain balance between these pathways to ensure homeostatic gene regulation. Moreover, the development of a tool to computationally identify putative feedback motifs using multi-?omics datasets in any species for any pathway will systematically improve our ability to identify and examine higher-order regulatory motifs that maintain transcriptome homeostasis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, half of all fishes on a typical reef are cryptobenthic, but traditional surveys do not usually include these species. Due to the limited geographic extent of scientific surveys, countless cryptobenthic fish species have yet to be discovered and described, and local biodiversity inventories do not exist in most countries. This project explores the biodiversity of cryptobenthic coral reef fishes in the Indo-Pacific by:  1) conducting a series of local and regional inventories through standardized survey and collection protocols, 2) describing new species by considering multiple high-resolution sources of information to delineate closely related species, 3) analyzing the evolutionary diversification of a particularly species-rich lineage (the dwarf goby genus Eviota) and 4) training a new generation of fish taxonomists with strong ties to coral reef nations to ensure reef fish biodiversity research and conservation for years to come. <br/><br/>Inventorying the diversity of life on our planet is a critical challenge that intensifies with the rapid change of the biosphere. Cryptobenthic fishes, which include the world?s smallest and shortest-lived vertebrates, are a biodiversity taxonomic frontier. This research employs standardized sampling techniques across four locations in the Indo-Pacific that promises particularly rich biodiversity discovery (the Lakshadweep, Philippines, Solomons, and American Samoa) with a cutting-edge integrative taxonomy framework and immersive training of young scientists to boost description rates of cryptobenthic fishes for years to come.

Cells are very small and so they can best be observed with specialized techniques like electron microscopy. Samples must be preserved carefully for study by electron microscopy and care must be taken not to introduce changes that could mislead interpretation of observations.  The best method for preparing tissue for electron microscopy is to rapidly freeze samples and observe them under very low temperatures, a process called cryogenic preservation. Cryopreservation is challenging in plants, and the goal of the proposed research is to develop procedures that overcome these challenges. If successful, this proposal will allow plant cells and tissues to be observed after cryopreservation and give unprecedented information about how parts of plant cells and tissue work together. Understanding how plant cells work will help develop plants that are better able to meet human needs and ensure food security. The methods developed will be shared with others through public databases to allow other scientists to use the methods in their own studies. The research will include several early career scientists, and they will receive training in techniques and develop skills which are in high demand in science labs and in industry. <br/><br/>Cryogenic preservation is the gold standard for determining cell ultrastructure in its ?native state? by virtue of physical fixation (freezing) to immobilize cell constituents in milliseconds. Volume electron microscopy (vEM) has gained significant traction as a tool for discovering the structure and spatial organization of cell and tissue components. In combination with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), cryo-vEM has the potential to yield a paradigm shift in multi-scale in situ structural biology. However, due to their physical and chemical properties, plant cells are uniquely recalcitrant to fixation. Thus, plant science is strikingly lagging other fields in the revolution of understanding of how macromolecular complexes and cell compartments coordinate to create life. Determining the structure of cells and organelles in fully frozen hydrated chemically untreated and unstained would allow, for the first time, the observation of these entities in their native states. This proposal will develop cryopreservation and nanoscale imaging procedures for vEM of plant tissues in a focused effort to address this challenge efficiently for the plant community. Whole cell structures will be elucidated in 3D using cryo-vEM, while nanoscale cellular structure and organelles will be determined using cryo-vEM and cryo-ET. The datasets, protocols, and analytical pipelines generated through this research will be made available to the scientific community and the public through public databases. The proposed work will also provide unique training opportunities for several students and postdocs, training them in state-of-the plant structural biology, much desired expertise in the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding and reversing pollinator declines is one of the great environmental challenges of the 21st century. In the United States, migrating birds that usually eat insects have also been observed foraging in flowers. However, there has been little previous research on songbird flower foraging for this region. Understanding this behavior is important because migratory birds regularly move longer distances than insect pollinators. If birds are transporting pollen along these migratory routes, they could help improve genetic diversity in plant populations, making both natural and agricultural systems more resilient. This research will help raise awareness about the importance of birds and pollination for human wellbeing. For example, one of the project outcomes will be a short film showcasing this topic, which will be paired with other materials to create a teaching module for middle school students focused on the unexpected ways that animals help with plant pollination. Overall, this project is expected to improve understanding of birds and the potential role they play in pollination, a process that is critical to sustaining biodiversity and agricultural systems for future generations.<br/><br/>This project aims to fundamentally advance the way we understand plant-pollinator networks in North America by addressing the following research questions: 1) what individual bird characteristics or environmental factors are associated with the presence of pollen on songbirds?; 2) Are particular plant morphological characteristics associated with a higher probability of flower-foraging and pollen-carrying by songbirds?; 3) Does species richness or the relative abundance of functional groups contribute to resilience factors in bird-flower networks? The researchers will collaborate with bird banding stations to collect pollen samples from songbirds, and use DNA metabarcoding to identify the pollen. These data will be applied to models that will test predictions about the association between pollen presence, bird, and environmental characteristics, and to understand the links between plant characteristics and flower visitation by songbirds. This study has strong potential to stimulate new lines of research in songbird foraging and migration ecology, long-distance pollen dispersal, and plant-pollinator dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These equations are pertinent to a wide array of real-world applications and have been extensively researched. For instance, they are essential in understanding related phenomena in physics and biology, such as formation of severe weather conditions and collective animal behavior. Additionally, they play a vital role in addressing some of the nation?s most pressing issues such as weather prediction, aircraft design and collective dynamics modeling. Developing mathematical theories in this area is both challenging and immensely valuable for comprehending intricate behaviors. The primary focus of this project is to investigate the steady states of these equations. The main goal is to develop a comprehensive analytical framework that enhances the understanding of these steady states, including their existence, singular behavior, and stability. An integral part of this project is the educational component, which will offer training opportunities for students and provide platforms for professional development of young researchers in PDEs and analysis. <br/><br/>This project contains three interrelated directions. The first direction focuses on the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), progressing toward a comprehensive understanding of an important class of steady states with scaling-invariance property. The plan is to first address the existence of these solutions and then investigate their singularity behavior and classification. The second direction aims to understand the stability of steady states of the 3D incompressible NSE, building on the results from the first direction, where new analytical tools with more general applications are developed. The third direction studies the aggregation-diffusion equation. The goal is to study the steady states of the equation and whether the dynamics converge to the steady states, as well as the stability of the related interaction energy.

Both systems are partly controlled by friction. Microscopic contacts at rock interfaces of the fault or the base of the ice sheet controls the friction in these systems. The details of how these surfaces evolve as rocks fail hold information to better understand future events and to assess hazards. It is impossible to observe these interfaces in nature. The most informative measurements come from sensors placed at the surface. The goal of this proposal is to instead observe an experimental system to determine how interfaces slip and evolve. The experiments listen to ice slip experiments with sensors to study how the faults evolve, and how changes may affect seismic hazards. The project will support a graduate student and a collaboration across three institutions.<br/><br/>The goal of the study is to understand how the evolution of contacts during cycles of shear, slip, and stability control large scale behaviors in both faults and glacial systems. This will be accomplished by directly observing the coupled processes that control nucleation, slow and fast slip, healing, drag, and melting in ice to understand the fundamental mechanisms that drive the evolution of conditionally unstable frictional interfaces. A series of both static and sliding experiments will be performed using a custom cryogenic biaxial apparatus and a sample of ice atop a glass plate. Ice will be used for two key reasons: 1) it is transparent, allowing light and images to be transmitted through it; and 2) it has a low melting temperature, such that exploring a modest range of temperature covers a broad swath of homologous temperature, T/Tm, and thus both brittle and ductile behavior. This knowledge, analyzed by cutting-edge machine learning data analysis methods and extrapolated up to larger systems, will improve understanding of the mechanics of the entire stick-slip cycle and stability.

The project will support the training of 30 undergraduate students over 3 years with research experiences in interdisciplinary software engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. These students will be recruited primarily from institutions where students have limited research opportunities, with a special emphasis on providing opportunities to first- and second-year students. Participants will perform research with faculty mentors, participate in community activities, and communicate their work both through traditional publication channels and student research competitions and via department-wide presentations at the end of the summer. A primary goal for the program is to improve the pipeline from college to graduate school and from graduate school into faculty positions; simultaneously, the site actively trains graduate students to act as effective mentors of research assistants, a critical skill for future faculty members. <br/><br/>The project will build on the experience of many of the faculty mentors who have worked with undergraduate students in their individual research.

As such, trade-offs between costs and benefits are an integral part of evaluating the effectiveness of methods and tools. This REU site takes this further by tackling research problems that are at the intersection of software engineering and another field, including privacy, security, mobility, and human psychology and other sciences.

Cellular RNAs are decorated with a large diversity of enzyme-mediated modifications that are post-transcriptionally installed and can modulate RNA function and corresponding gene expression. There exist major gaps in our understanding of RNA modifications, including which RNA molecules are modified and at what sites, which enzymes mediate modification, and how modifications affect RNA function. This project seeks to address these knowledge gaps for the RNA modification dihydrouridine (D), which is one of the most abundant and evolutionarily conserved modifications in biology, through the application of innovative approaches integrating chemical and biological disciplines. The project will also provide unique training opportunities for students at the chemical biology interface and facilitate education and outreach aimed at increasing engagement with nucleic acid chemistry and biology.<br/><br/>The research is focused on the study of dihydrouridine (D), an abundant modification (mod) on transfer RNA (tRNA). D is installed by dihydrouridine synthases (DUS) and is commonly found in the eponymous tRNA D-loop as well as in the variable loop in eukaryotes. The function of D mods in tRNA biology and cellular/organismal processes is largely unknown. This is largely due to the lack of efficient tools to characterize D sites and DUS enzymes (writers), as well as related tRNA mods, and the paucity of targeted functional studies integrating biochemical effects with biological phenotypes. The long-term goal of this project is to characterize D mods and writer enzymes and elucidate their biological role through the application of chemical biology methods in combination with biochemical studies, high-throughput transcriptomic analyses, and cell biological assays. In Aim 1 is to study the biochemistry and structural biology of DUS proteins; Aim 2 is to characterize D mods with chemical sequencing technology and mass spectrometry; and Aim 3 is to study the role of D in tRNA stability and protein translation. Taken together, this research will reveal insights into the regulation of RNA structure and function through enzymatic modification and its role in gene expression regulation.

During space weather events, heating of the atmosphere can cause it to expand to higher altitude, causing dramatic and sudden increases in atmospheric drag. There are examples of satellites which have re-entered the atmosphere prematurely because of this increased drag. There are relatively few direct measurements of the atmospheric density at these altitudes to use to improve models, but the satellite navigation data (e.g. from GPS), can be used to detect the minute changes in orbits caused by this drag, which can be inverted to determine atmospheric density. These observations can in turn be used to improve atmospheric models. In this project we will develop the necessary tools and models to obtain atmospheric density from navigation data, and apply them to actual satellite orbit data. In the future such tools can be applied on a large scale to the navigation data of thousands of orbiting satellites to develop more accurate atmospheric models which will help all satellite operators to keep satellites operating safely.<br/><br/>The proposal aims to develop data assimilation algorithms that will enable estimation of the atmospheric drag on satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) based on their low-resolution Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) navigation data. Drag is defined as a loss of total energy of the satellite due to the atmosphere only. After the effect of solar radiation pressure (which is vectorized and can both decrease and increase total energy), it is possible to determine the atmospheric mass density with appropriately calibrated drag coefficients. The data assimilation algorithms to determine drag consist of a Kalman filter approach wrapped around an orbit propagator which incorporates a high-resolution gravitational field model, taking as input the low-resolution GNSS navigation data of the satellites. This study will identify the methods for separating radiation pressure and atmospheric drag depending on orbital location and satellite orientation. In the future, these algorithms and methodologies can be used to produce a large database of atmospheric densities which can be incorporated into whole atmosphere data assimilation models for nowcasting and forecasting atmospheric density. The methods and algorithms can also be developed further to form the basis for on-board algorithms for satellites to autonomously take evasive action. Existing tools for atmospheric drag measurements are largely proprietary. The tools developed through this effort will be made publicly available, expanding access to cutting-edge research capabilities and supporting scientific innovation across the academic community.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Aeronomy and EMBRACE programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The behavior of large objects, such as the earth or the galaxy, is well described by Einstein?s theory of gravity. However, these two descriptions of our universe do not appear to be fully compatible, and a challenge of contemporary physics is to find a way to bridge this seeming incompatibility. One difficulty with doing this is the fact that the gravitational force between atomic-scale objects is too weak to measure. To overcome this problem, the PI and his students are planning to perform experiments on centimeter-scale objects, which have significant gravitational interactions, with a precision that approaches the limits allowed by quantum mechanics.

The Achilles heel of QIP has been dissipation, the friction that both generates heat and destroys the long-lived quantum correlations among quantum bits (""qubits"") necessary for QIP, so far limiting quantum information systems in both size and complexity.  Such correlations among qubits are called ""entanglement,"" and a goal of this research is to produce any desired entangled state of qubits, which becomes the starting point for a quantum computation.<br/><br/>A powerful approach to address this general problem is quantum reservoir engineering: the idea is to turn the tables on dissipation and use it as a resource for steering a quantum system, such that the dissipation-driven dynamics naturally relax the system to the state of interest.  This CAREER project supports basic research into developing a novel reservoir engineering framework and leverages it for entanglement generation in noisy quantum systems.  From a practical standpoint, this will help identify critical milestones for establishing reservoir engineering as a standard paradigm for scalable and robust entanglement generation, which has applications in all areas of quantum information science, including quantum computing, sensing and communication.  In addition, the proposed research will enable fundamental advances in the physics of quantum systems coupled to a noisy environment by developing theoretical tools to rigorously explore the validity of standard dissipative models in the presence of noise that varies, and is correlated, in time.<br/><br/>The education and training aspect in this project will assume a multi-pronged approach that will expose graduate and undergraduate students to a wide variety of analytical and computational techniques in quantum information and quantum optics.  Aided and informed by close connections with experimental realizations of solid-state qubits, the aim will be to provide the trainees a holistic view of the polyglot field of QIP and address the strategic national need to create a ""quantum-smart"" workforce.  The training aspect will be integrated with broad educational and outreach goals via new and continuing curriculum and course development initiatives, public talks, and promoting open access venues for communicating research results.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Quantum reservoir engineering is an attractive approach for correcting errors and realizing stable quantum coherences autonomously.  The basic idea is to tailor the dissipative environment of the target systems so that this engineered dissipation relaxes the system to and sustains it in a desired target state.  While versatile, existing schemes for dissipative state preparation rely exclusively on time-independent dissipative dynamics, which can leave the protocols susceptible to unwanted spurious dissipation.  The PI's broad vision is that this project will enable a transformative new class of dissipative state preparation protocols with dramatically improved speed, fidelity and robustness to errors.  To this end, the research will broadly focus on two directions: (i) study of dynamics driven by time-dependent dissipation, and (ii) study of dynamics driven by correlated dissipation.  These theoretical studies will involve developing a comprehensive analytical and numerical framework with some of the first explorations of the validity of open quantum systems descriptions, especially in a context where non-trivial dissipation is a useful resource.  For instance, the outcomes of this project will address fundamental questions pertaining to implications of adiabaticity and non-Markovianity for reservoir engineering and provide useful pointers for quantum error correction and error mitigation in the presence of correlated noise.  This has transformative potential not only for the entanglement stabilization protocols envisioned here but also for any platform involving dynamic control of quantum systems.  The PI maintains an active collaboration with experimental groups who will test the ideas on Josephson-junction-based superconducting platforms.  Thus this research will complement and advance the rapidly growing experimental capabilities in quantum control of low-dimensional open systems in the near-term.  Further, it will help strengthen interdisciplinary connections between disparate fields of quantum information/quantum optics, optimal control and strongly-interacting field theories, all of which focus on far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the oceans must maintain a balance between alkalinity supplied by continental weathering, and alkalinity removed by calcium carbonate burial, at least over long time periods, a reduction in the burial of calcium carbonate on continental shelves would induce an increase in the carbonate ion concentration of seawater to preserve more calcium carbonate in deep sea sediments. If seawater had a greater carbonate ion concentration than today, then it would absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere. However, the exact mechanism(s) responsible for this CO2 variability remain(s) to be determined. To address this key knowledge gap, the investigators seek to test a method for estimating the carbonate ion concentration of seawater in the past. Existing methods for estimating carbonate ion concentration are labor-intensive and expensive. This proposal aims to test a method that would be much faster and much less expensive. The scientific goal is to combine estimates of carbonate ion concentration from marine sediments with the other geologic evidence to determine the relative importance of biological processes and of changes in sea level as factors that contributed to lower atmospheric CO2 concentration during glacial intervals.  Broader impacts activities include training, mentoring, and the involving undergraduate students in research, community outreach events, and workforce development.<br/><br/>The investigators plan to advance the calibration of an existing proxy for calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution, and to determine if the proxy also provides reliable estimates of bottom water carbonate ion concentration. Calcium carbonate dissolution in the deep sea is sensitive to changes in bottom water undersaturation (expressed as Delta [CO32-]), so a proxy method for CaCO3 dissolution (Globorotalia menardii Fragmentation Index ? MFI), if rigorously calibrated, should provide a measure of bottom water Delta [CO32-].  The MFI method is rapid, inexpensive, only requires a microscope, and is suited to the involvement of undergraduate students in research on the global carbon cycle. The immediate goal is to determine if the MFI method can be used to provide a reliable measure of Delta [CO32-] through a 3-pronged calibration effort with previously collected samples: (1) Determine the MFI across a range of water depths in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, where Delta [CO32-] and the rate of CaCO3 dissolution have been measured independently; (2) conduct a global survey, including the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, to compare MFI against climatological Delta [CO32-] to assess potential regional variability in the relationship between Delta [CO32-] and MFI; and (3) determine the MFI from marine sediments from the Central Equatorial Pacific, covering the last 160,000 years, in two cores where Delta [CO32-] has already been measured using B/Ca ratios in epibenthic foraminifera.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research in this project focuses on three types of PDEs: reaction-diffusion equations, Hele-Shaw type flows, and chemotaxis systems. These equations capture the evolution of diffusive processes, such as tumor growth, forest fire propagation, chemical diffusion, and crowd motion. The project aims to advance understanding of these equations and their underlying phenomena, with potential societal benefits such as enhanced strategies for managing forest fires and improving understanding of biological processes, including tumor cell behavior. The educational component is a cornerstone of this project, tightly integrated with its research objectives. In collaboration with Auburn University?s outreach programs, the Principal Investigator will engage K-12 students in interactive workshops and science fairs, inspiring curiosity and enthusiasm for science. A key focus of the educational efforts is increasing participation and retention of women and underrepresented groups in mathematics and science. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and early-career researchers through workshops and summer schools directly tied to the research themes. These programs will offer hands-on experiences, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical applications to prepare the next generation of scientists and mathematicians. This project integrates innovative research with impactful education and outreach, strengthening the link between scientific discovery and learning for the benefit of society.<br/><br/><br/>Reaction-diffusion equations are central to modeling phenomena such as front propagation and interface motion in fields like chemical kinetics, combustion, and population genetics. In sufficiently random media, the long-term, large-scale dynamics of these equations are expected to converge to a deterministic propagation process (called stochastic homogenization). While previous research in the area in general dimensions is limited, this proposed research brings new methods and technical tools to study such problems. For example, it will extend several fundamental probability tools that were widely used in PDE problems, including Kingman's subadditive theorem and Azuma's lemma. Furthermore, the methodologies developed here will have applications to other equations. Hele-Shaw flows with source and advection terms are widely used to model tumor growth, where the region occupied by tumor cells corresponds to the positive set of the solution, and the boundary of this region forms the free boundary. The presence of drift and source terms brings significant difficulties and so there are few results in this direction. This project focuses on developing new PDE techniques to address the regularity and the homogenization of the free boundary. The outcomes are expected to provide a deeper understanding of free boundary dynamics and illuminate the effects of stochastic fluctuations on interface motion. Chemotaxis, the directed movement of organisms in response to chemical gradients, is a crucial phenomenon in biology. While chemotaxis models have been extensively studied, most work focuses on bounded domains. This project aims to first establish the global well-posedness of chemotaxis systems on unbounded domains and then investigate the asymptotic spreading properties of solutions, a key characteristic of these systems. These studies will employ tools from various areas of mathematics, including semigroup theory, viscosity solutions and parabolic regularity theory, to explore new aspects of chemotaxis models, with potential contributions to both mathematics and biological sciences.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical computing devices may provide low energy computing devices. Many examples of chemical computing devices are based on macroscopic reaction volumes of the order of 10^23 molecules/mL. An energy-efficient architecture will operate at an optimal number of molecules that produce signals with acceptable levels of noise. Today, it is not clear what minimal volumes of computing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and their reactors can be achieved and whether fast and sensitive read-out and input methods for ultra-low amount of chemicals are available. Furthermore, effective coupling schemes need to be adapted to the microscale (inhibition and acceleration of reaction paths). Innovative ways of dynamically changing a miniaturized chemical computing architecture ? an important prerequisite for complex computations ? are not existent at this time and need to be discovered and developed. This award will allow investigators at Harvard, together with investigators at IBM Research in Zurich, to produce miniaturized reactor arrays and microfluidic supply structures for coupled CRN nodes of picoliter and femtoliter volumes (10^14 and 10^11 molecules). Their fabrication will rely on IBM's well-established microfabrication capabilities in silicon-based lithography, but also on unconventional methods such as thermal scanning probe lithography (t-SPL) (developed by the IBM team). The implementation of coupling schemes of CRNs in different reactors for the purpose of complex computation will rely on the principal investigator's renowned expertise in the chemistry of oscillating CRNs.

Yet, it is an uncomfortable and damaging process?causing pain, tissue damage, infection, scarring, and leakage. Hydrogel bioadhesives have thus emerged, aiming to replace sutures. Since their first development over a half-century ago, they have substantially benefitted surgeries in many ways, such as simplified procedures, short operation time, less discomfort, and reduced post-surgery complications. Hydrogel bioadhesives are soft, wet, and biocompatible and used just like common glues or duct tape. Existing hydrogel bioadhesives are mostly designed for emergency applications such as wound closure and sealing. However, when prolonged adhesion is required, typically in long-term implantation, they are unfit, owing to mechanical mismatch with target tissues and unstable adhesion in the physiological environment. The mechanical mismatch constrains natural tissue movement to cause damage, insufficiently supports tissue physiological functions, and alters the local cell microenvironment to induce abnormal cellular behaviors. Unstable adhesion leads to premature adhesion failure. To address these challenges, this project develops a class of bioadhesive implants by modular design. The bioadhesive implants integrate a liquid adhesive layer and a solid hydrogel layer, where the former provides fast, stable, and strong adhesion between the target tissue and the hydrogel layer, and the latter provides tissue-specific mechanical compliance. This project supports the fundamental research to determine the optimal formulation of bioadhesive implants, investigate adhesion kinetics and properties under various operation conditions as well as long-term adhesion behaviors under fatigue mechanical loads, and elucidate relations between adhesion supramolecular processes and adhesion behaviors. These findings expand the knowledge of bioadhesive design, principles, and mechanisms, and advance various implantable therapies such as bioelectronic medicine, regenerative medicine, and on-target drug delivery. This project also highlights the broader impacts on education and outreach by engaging grades 4-12 and undergraduate students to learn the basics of hydrogels, perform the hands-on making of hydrogels, and participate in hydrogel and bioadhesive research, and by broadly disseminating this research to the general public to increase their awareness of hydrogel bioadhesive technologies and amplify the scientific and societal impacts.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>This project develops a class of bioadhesive implants by modular design, which integrates a liquid adhesive polymer layer and a solid tissue-elasticity-matching hydrogel layer. The bioadhesion is realized by penetrating adhesive polymers into the target tissue and the hydrogel layer and then gelating inside them to form a new polymer network, connecting them through topological entanglements. The polymer gelation kinetics can be tuned to enable fast adhesion and the topological entanglements create deep adhesion to allow strong and stable adhesion. The bioadhesion does not require functional groups from hydrogels, thus broadening the choices of hydrogels (including chemically inert hydrogels) to be used to match the elasticity of diverse biological tissues. The research objectives are (i) design, formulate, and characterize bioadhesive implants, (ii) investigation of complex adhesion behaviors ex vivo, and (iii) mechanistic understanding of linking supramolecular processes to adhesion. To obtain the optimal formulation and guide the practical use of bioadhesive implants, experimental studies will be performed to evaluate adhesion energy, adhesion kinetics, adhesion behaviors associated with adhesive thicknesses, penetration depths, material properties of tissues and hydrogels, and fatigue loading, as well as biocompatibility. To fundamentally understand the adhesion mechanism, theoretical modeling will be established to elucidate the critical supramolecular process of diffusion and gelation of adhesive polymers on the effective development of bioadhesion and how they are influenced by the material properties of hydrogels and tissues. This research also offers an important and emerging topic for educational and outreach activities on hydrogels and bioadhesives and facilitates clinical collaboration and translation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The successful realization of quantum computers has the potential to transform diverse fields such as drug discovery, quantum chemistry, biology, cryptography, image processing, optimization, and machine learning by addressing computational challenges that are infeasible for classical systems. Estimates suggest that general-purpose quantum computers capable of solving real-world problems will require 10??10? physical qubits. A significant obstacle to scaling quantum computers to this level is the hardware infrastructure, which currently relies on room-temperature rack electronics for qubit control and readout, along with bulky, connectorized microwave components?such as circulators and amplifiers?inside dilution refrigerators. This project aims to address these limitations by developing energy-efficient, low-cost, and compact cryogenic chips that enable scaling quantum systems to support thousands of qubits. The research focuses on advancing cryogenic Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs) for qubit control pulse generation and superconducting chip technology for on-chip circulators. These innovations are expected to accelerate breakthroughs in quantum computing while also benefiting related fields such as satellite communication, space-based telescopes, and cryogenic electronics. Furthermore, the project seeks to foster seamless integration between circuit design and quantum physics, laying the foundation for a diverse and skilled workforce in this multidisciplinary research domain. To achieve this, the project will implement a range of educational and outreach initiatives, including online courses, undergraduate research opportunities, career development workshops for K-12 students, and the creation of open-source infrastructure.<br/><br/>The research activities are organized into three thrusts: cryogenic (4K) CMOS IC development, superconducting chip development, and system integration with superconducting qubits operating at 10-100mK. First, a fully analog, low-power, and scalable qubit control scheme will be demonstrated using CMOS ICs operating at 4K, eliminating the need for room-temperature rack electronics. Unlike current digital-intensive control schemes, this project explores low-power microwave pulse generation using analog filter synthesis, enabling significant power savings compared to state-of-the-art digital qubit control circuits. Analog multiplexing schemes will be explored to reduce the cabling overheard between the 4K to 10mK stages. Second, time-modulated Josephson Junction-based non-reciprocal devices will be developed to replace the bulky and costly ferrite-based circulators and isolators currently used in dilution refrigerators. These on-chip, superconducting circulators are expected to offer drastically reduced size and cost when compared to their ferrite counterparts. To aid easier integration with the qubits, these superconducting circulators will be designed to achieve to low intermodulation power while achieving low-loss transmission and high isolation at the input frequency.  Finally, the cryogenic-CMOS ICs and superconducting circulators will be integrated with superconducting qubits to demonstrate a fully integrated closed-loop system for qubit control and readout.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will focus on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), a class of biological molecules that lack a single, fixed three-dimensional structure. Instead, these molecules can interconvert between distinct, transient forms that play important roles in cellular processes such as molecular recognition, signaling, and regulation. The dynamic and flexible nature of IDPs makes them prone to aggregation into ordered amyloid fibrils or to liquid-liquid phase separation into protein-rich droplets important for normal cellular function. Understanding the biophysical principles that lead to these distinct molecular assemblies will provide insights into cellular processes, the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and the design of bio-inspired materials with unique properties. Beyond these scientific outcomes, this project will enhance undergraduate education by integrating computational methods into the biochemistry curriculum. Students will gain hands-on experience in advanced computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and mathematical modeling. The project includes the development of an online biophysical chemistry textbook integrated with real-world examples, programming-focused curriculum modules, and a computational workshop to train undergraduate research students. Students engaged in this project will gain competitive skills for future careers in science, technology, and medicine.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the biophysical principles that connect and lead to distinct aggregation and assembly pathways and will uncover specific factors like protein sequence, solution conditions, and chemical modifications that influence the rich behavior of IDPs. The goals are to characterize the complete conformational landscape of IDPs during fibrilization, to elucidate the factors leading to phase separation of IDPs across multiple length scales, to characterize the formation of correlated segments in proteins that possess a sizeable intrinsically disordered region (IDR), and to develop a model for controlling liquid-liquid phase separation through post-translational modifications. Molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced sampling methods, and machine learning will be integrated with experimental distance distributions to map the complex conformational landscapes of IDPs and model their transition to pathological aggregates or functional assemblies. Coarse-grained and polymer physics models will be developed to study how posttranslational modifications like phosphorylation modulate the phase behavior of low-complexity IDPs.

From its origins in physics, functional analysis has gained a life of its own and has found exciting applications in areas such as quantum information theory and quantum computing as well as control and systems theory. More recently, questions (about semi-definite programming and linear matrix inequalities) arising in the engineering literature have led to the development of a new subfield of functional analysis known as noncommutative function theory. This exciting new subfield sits at the intersection of noncommutative algebra, functional analysis, and operator theory, and it enjoys a wide variety of applications. Rather than deal with completely abstract mathematical objects, noncommutative function theory employs the use of concrete structures known as matrices, which are one of the fundamental noncommutative objects used in science, engineering and industry.

Increasing accuracy in projections of wildland fire activity, fire behavior, and wildland fire weather is the key toward developing more efficient fire control strategies and reducing the risks of wildfires. Recent studies have demonstrated that the tools of artificial intelligence (AI) can help in planning for upcoming prescribed burns by providing higher spatial and temporal fire weather forecasts and can also assist in developing more efficient strategies for wildfire risk mitigation. However, the modeling tools that are currently used to predict fire activity are largely subject to a number of temporal or spatial constraints. For instance, most deep learning (DL) approaches for wildfire risk analytics tend to be restricted in their capabilities to systematically capture the multidimensional information recorded at disparate spatio-temporal resolutions. Furthermore, such DL architectures are inherently static and do not explicitly account for complex dynamic phenomena, which is often the key behind the accurate assessment of wildfire driving factors. Finally, these models primarily rely on supervised learning approaches where a large number of task-specific labels (e.g., fire or no fire) are needed. To address these challenges in wildfire risk analytics, this project will leverage inherently interdisciplinary approaches at the interface of Earth system sciences, DL, computational topology, statistics, and actuarial sciences. <br/><br/>The project aims to introduce the concepts of topological data analysis (TDA) to wildfire predictive modeling, coupling them with such emerging AI machinery as time-aware graph neural networks. The resulting new methods are expected to better capture the shape patterns in the wildland fire processes with respect both to time and space and to assist in a more reliable statistical assessment of wildfire risks. The new high-fidelity predictive approaches will have the potential to deliver forecasts of fire behavior, fire activity, and fire weather at multiple spatial and temporal scales under scenarios of limited, noisy, or nonexistent labeled information. To enhance the utility of the research solutions in wildfire analytics, the researchers in this project will work in close collaboration with stakeholders, particularly, focusing on the insurance sector.

Additionally, about two decades of satellite data show that areas near the volcanoes are deforming due to inflation under the surface. Existing data are scarce partly because the immediate vicinity of the volcanoes is a difficult to access and federally protected Wilderness. This project will add observations in these areas by using small temporary seismic instruments, that can be transported on foot and do not require digging, to address both the accessibility challenges and the need for minimal impact. Combining the new temporary seismic data with modern imaging and earthquake detection methods, the researchers will gain a systematic view of subsurface structures.

The seismic data collection and analysis will engage students from multiple institutions and personnel from regional hazard monitoring agencies to promote professional training and communication to stakeholders.<br/><br/>The Three Sisters volcanic complex is classified by a U.S. Geologic Survey report as a Very High Threat system, with geodetic evidence for ongoing surface deformation, lava flows as young as about 1,600 years, and Holocene eruptions of compositions ranging from basaltic andesite to rhyolite. Yet, there is little knowledge of the 3-D distribution of middle to upper crustal magma storage and microseismicity beneath this multi-vent volcanic complex located within the High Cascades graben. Observational seismology has been limited by the need for minimal impact in a large federal Wilderness. The project will deploy an array of low-impact nodal seismometers to provide the first local imaging of the Three Sisters magmatic system. Analysis of the data will advance understanding of how magma reservoir structure in multi-vent systems is linked to spatial variations in edifice construction and erupted compositions, with dominantly basaltic andesite in the northern part of the volcanic complex transitioning to more prevalent rhyolite eruptions at the southern end. Seismic imaging with the new temporary network data will begin with relatively conventional ambient noise surface wave tomography and then push the boundaries of temporary nodal array imaging by applying anisotropic adjoint tomography. The influences of edifice topography and radial anisotropy on magma reservoir imaging will be tested with numerical 3-D wave propagation and inversion methods. The new data will also be used to scrutinize microseismic activity and conduct receiver function imaging of localized interfaces, which could better define interactions between tectonic and magmatic deformation structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reforms call for the direct election of more than 7,000 of the most important judicial positions in the country. Because judicial independence is associated with salutary governmental and economic outcomes, and public support for judicial institutions is a key determinant of judicial independence and influence, this project has implications for understanding how the direct election of judges might bolster or undermine institutional separation of powers, economic development, and broader international relations. <br/><br/>Most of the accumulated knowledge about the public's support for the judiciary has relied upon surveys asking citizens for their evaluations of hypothetical proposals to reform the country's high Court. The reforms that prompt this study provide an opportunity to test theories about the correlates and consequences of public support for courts in an environment where the stakes are real and cross-national comparisons are feasible. Tracking public opinion over a four-wave panel survey and analyzing unique survey experiments, this research will address three debates.  First, each wave of the survey will reach respondents at a point in the reform implementation that enables researchers to disentangle longstanding theories regarding the determinants of public support for judicial institutions. Second, relying on within-respondent, cross-wave comparisons, the PIs will evaluate the extent to which the electoral connection affects citizens? legal attitudes about courts and judicial authorities, and their willingness to engage them as a result. Third, the PIs will assess how the reform---and citizens' responses to it---affect their willingness to obey decisions they do not agree with and to tolerate noncompliance with constitutional authorities' decisions.

These points are thought to be closely related to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), but the balance of contributions to North Atlantic carbon accumulation from air-sea fluxes and ocean transports is not well constrained. There is significant uncertainty about what the future holds, both for AMOC strength and carbon uptake as they respond to the effects of climate change and other changing forcings. This project will utilize long-term and ongoing observations across the North Atlantic basin to quantify carbon uptake and carbon transport and the variability in these parameters on the time scale of decades. This work will support a variety of efforts to educate and promote underrepresented groups in ocean science. The project investigators will partner with a variety of institutions in Georgia, Florida and in the Caribbean to educate students at a range of levels. They will promote a carbon cycle education website that includes interactive K-12 education materials. This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget.

This analysis will enable evaluation of their combined effects on future carbon uptake as overturning strength is projected to weaken. New observations in Florida Straits will fully characterize the chemical variability in water mass structure on seasonal timescales for the first time, and in combination with air-sea anthropogenic CO2 fluxes derived from transport-divergence/accumulation budgets, the team will validate existing numerical simulations and improve the representation of carbon cycle processes in the next generation of climate models.

Filters are extensively used to compactly represent large datasets in fast memory (RAM) and avoid unnecessary I/Os across databases, storage systems, computational biology, cybersecurity, and networks. Yet modern data-intensive applications are severely bottlenecked by the limitations in filters. A fundamental limitation of traditional filters is that they do not change their representation upon seeing a false positive match. Therefore, the maximum false positive rate is only guaranteed for a single query, not a stream of queries. If users can adapt after seeing false positive matches, they can improve the filter performance for a stream of queries (especially skewed distributions). This project focuses on two goals. First, to design a high-performance, space-efficient, and practical adaptive filter with strong adaptivity guarantees, which means that the performance and false-positive probability guarantees continue to hold even for adversarial workloads. Second, to do a deep dive into various performance trade-offs in applications and integrate the adaptive filter in databases, cybersecurity applications, and computational biology tools. The effort redesigns existing applications and develops new software tools to establish appropriate trade-offs and achieve high performance and space efficiency. <br/><br/>This project has the following top-level approach: develop the theory and an accompanying data structure library for strong adaptive filters under various real-world workloads involving deletions and updates, resizing, and merging two adaptive filters.  It demonstrates the impact of adaptive filters in the real world by integrating the adaptive filter into applications and achieving massive speed-ups and robust performance for skewed and adversarial workloads. This project will enhance the capability of applications across databases, computational biology, and cybersecurity to achieve higher and stronger performance guarantees. Both accelerated computation (allowing quicker feedback and more experiments) and more extensive computation potentially accelerate the process of scientific discovery. Furthermore, this project places a strong emphasis on combining theory and practice. In addition, the research team will also develop teaching material on adaptive data structures and their usage in modern data-intensive applications and make it freely available online.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For many endeavors in this area, the data being analyzed is collected with a natural ordering, i.e., the data can be viewed as an object-valued time series. Despite its prevalence in many applied problems, statistical analysis for such time series is still in its early development. A fundamental difficulty of developing statistical techniques is that the spaces where these objects live are nonlinear and commonly used algebraic operations are not applicable. This research project aims to develop new models, methodology and theory for the analysis of object-valued time series. Research results from the project will be disseminated to the relevant scientific communities via publications, conference and seminar presentations.

For instance, in climate simulations, scientists are interested in identifying, verifying, and evaluating trends in detecting, tracking, and characterizing weather patterns associated with high impact weather events such as thunderstorms and hurricanes. In recent years, topological data analysis (TDA) has evolved as an emerging area in data science. So far, most of its applications have been limited to the single parameter case, that is, to data expressing the behavior of a single variable. As its reach to applications expands, the task of extracting intelligent summaries out of diverse, complex data demands the study of multiparameter dependencies. This project will help address this demand by developing a sound mathematical theory supported by efficient algorithmic tools thus providing a powerful platform for data exploration and analysis in scientific and engineering applications. The educational impact will be accelerated by the synergy between mathematics and computer science and integrated applications. Graduate students supported by the project will be trained to develop skills in mathematics and theoretical computer science, most notably in algorithms and topology, and analyze some real-world data sets. The investigators will follow best practice to recruit and mentor students from underrepresented groups who will participate in the project. The investigators also plan to broaden research engagement via workshops or tutorials at computational topology and TDA venues. <br/><br/>Although TDA involving a single parameter has been well researched and developed, the same is not yet true for the multiparameter case. At its current nascent stage, multiparameter TDA is yet to develop tools to practically handle complex, diverse, and high-dimensional data. To meet this challenge, this project will make both mathematical and algorithmic advances for multiparameter TDA. To scope effectively, focus will be mainly on three research thrusts to: (I) explore multiparameter persistence for generalized features and develop algorithms to compute them; (II) exploit the connections of zigzag persistence to multiparameter settings to support dynamic data analysis, and (III) generalize graphical topological descriptors. From a methodological point of view, the geometric and topological ideas behind the proposed work inject novel perspectives and directions to the important field of computational data analysis. In particular, the project team will investigate several novel mathematical concepts in conjunction with algorithms to address various challenges appearing in the aforementioned thrusts. The resulting TDA methodologies have the potential to complement and augment traditional data analysis approaches in fields such as machine learning and statistical data analysis. The investigators bring together expertise in theoretical computer science, algorithms design, mathematics, and in particular topological data analysis to conduct this research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to fire safety concerns, flame retardant chemicals are traditionally added to reduce fire-risk. However, they can weaken composites and can be toxic, causing hazards when using and recycling the polymer matrix composites. Preliminary experiments indicated novel fire retardant and resistant properties can be engineered into carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites with a nanostructure-modification during manufacturing process rather than relying on flame retardant chemical additives. In this research project, the nanostructure?s active, passive, and interactive roles in inhibiting the mechanisms of smoke generation and matrix burning will be studied and understood. By utilizing the new knowledge in next generation polymer composites in a fire event, the novel fire resistant and retardant mechanisms could protect the integrity of the advanced nanostructured composite without using harmful chemical flame retardants. As a result, this new composite will be difficult-to-ignite, will self-fire-extinguish, produce less smoke, and retain a substantial amount of mechanical load-bearing capability during and after fires. A scalable manufacturing process for the advanced nanostructured carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites will also be developed. The success of this project will benefit human society with an innovative lightweight polymer matrix composite technology and scientific knowledge for breakthrough in functionality, safety, and sustainability. Commercialization potential will be fostered through communication with governmental and industrial stakeholders as well as through the training of students for next-generation entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>This project will conduct tasks to understand the fire retardant and resistant behaviors due to the advanced nanostructured carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites and use such knowledge to better design and manufacture the next generation composites. These tasks will address how the nanostructured composite, without any harmful flame-retardant chemical additives, during a fire, will be able to maintain its integrity, prevent char loss, withstand internal vapor-bursting-pressure, prevent volatile vapor release, and quench local hot spots. Therefore, it will inhibit the polymer?s thermal decomposition process to withstand significantly higher temperatures, inhibit combustible volatiles from contacting and reacting with oxygen in the air, and mitigate risks associated with smoke, fire, and structural failure/collapse. The new knowledge of effectively utilizing nanostructures to improve combustible-matrix composites? fire safety and high temperature performance can potentially be used by other broader ranges of new materials science and engineering developments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting framework is intended to allow students to tailor their educational experience to meet their needs and background. The framework will also allow students to learn robotics using low-cost hardware and will not require instructors with extensive robotics expertise to deliver course content. The deployment of this system has the potential to increase the number of degree programs in robotics at both community colleges and four-year undergraduate institutions. Additionally, leveraging low-cost devices and simulation has potential to increase access to high-quality robotics instruction. <br/><br/>The project will implement a learning system in two one-semester courses covering robotics topics that make extensive use of low-cost hardware and high-realism simulators. The student-centered personalized learning framework will prioritize student autonomy and be used to teach students advanced robotics skills. Course topics will be selected based on advice from a course content advisory committee. After the learning system is developed, the course content will be integrated into the platform. User studies will be conducted to determine the depth at which students master the desired learning outcomes and their experiences using the system. The system will be deployed and evaluated at Lenoir Community College and the University of Nevada Reno. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These lasers are configured to produce periodically stationary pulses by propagating light many times around a loop. Although different physical effects change the shape of the pulse as it traverses the loop, the pulse returns to the same shape once each period (round trip). A significant challenge for the modeling of these lasers is that from one generation to the next there has been a dramatic increase in the amount by which the pulse breathes, necessitating novel mathematical approaches. This project will develop theoretical and computational methods to determine periodically stationary pulse solutions of nonlinear wave equations modeling laser systems and to analyze their stability (robustness in the presence of random noise and other system perturbations). The project will provide computational tools to aid in the design of high energy lasers for medical applications, and of frequency combs for highly accurate measurements of time and frequency, with applications to geo-location systems, time and frequency standards, the calibration of astronomical instruments, and trace gas sensing. The project will provide broad training in applied mathematics for doctoral students and mentoring for junior faculty. In addition, the project will support complementary activity focused on pedagogical innovations. <br/> <br/>The laser models to be studied in this project are based on variants of the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Classically, the spectrum of a stationary nonlinear wave is given by the zero set of the Evans function of the linearized differential operator. The stability of periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of fiber lasers will be characterized in terms of the spectrum of the monodromy operator of the linearization about the pulse. Since the stability problem for time-periodic solutions is formulated on a cylinder, rather than on the real line, any generalization of the Evans function will involve Fredholm determinants of operators on infinite-dimensional function spaces rather than classical determinants of matrices. To avoid the extreme stiffness of the differential equations used to compute the Evans function in this infinite dimensional context, the point spectrum of the monodromy operator will be identified with the zero set of an infinite-dimensional Fredholm determinant of a Birman-Schwinger operator on an infinite cylinder. Numerical methods will be developed to compute Fredholm determinants of such Birman-Schwinger operators. These methods will then be employed to determine stability regions in design parameter space for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of experimental fiber laser systems. The generic instability of stationary solutions of reaction diffusion equations has recently been established by applying a related topological invariant called the Maslov index to the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators. A novel version of the Maslov index will be used to establish general stability results for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also essential for further analysis to fix the bug. Reproducing system-level concurrency bugs requires not only input data but also the interleaving order of system calls. Manually reproducing this type of bug from bug reports is challenging due to its elusive nature and the need for supplementary details. Moreover, bug reports composed in natural language are frequently unstructured, posing a challenge when it comes to extracting essential information. Existing bug reproduction tools are incompatible with this type of bug due to their inability to deal with the specific interleaving schedule at the system call level. To address these challenges and improve the efficiency of reproducing these bugs from bug reports, a novel framework named RepSON will be developed. It will lessen the manual burden of the software developers to debug system-level concurrency bugs that happen frequently in modern software systems. Furthermore, this project will develop a technique for extracting information and generating executable inputs from bug reports that can also be applied to other types of software bugs.<br/><br/>The technical goals of the project are divided into two major tasks. First, an empirical study will be conducted on open-source bug repositories to identify system-level concurrency bug reports and summarize their characteristics for guiding the automated debugging process. Second, an automated framework RepSON will be developed for reproducing bugs in multi-process applications by analyzing bug reports. Natural language processing, data mining, and dynamic program analysis techniques will be employed in the development of RepSON. It will take a bug report as input and reproduce the associated bug by generating input and instrumentation location. To achieve this, RepSON will analyze the bug report to generate the input script and extract system call names that may cause the bug. Subsequently, it will run the program, collect the system call trace to identify potential buggy interleaving, and instrument the code to run it again and reproduce the bug.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, computational notebooks today are most suited for small-scale explorations carried out on a single computer, and are quite difficult to use for large-scale computations on high performance computing clusters or commercial clouds.  This project will develop NBFlow, a software toolkit for converting notebook computations into workflows that are feasible to execute efficiently on clusters or clouds.  This will make it possible to use notebook technologies in conjunction with high performance clusters to enable new discoveries in scientific fields such as high energy physics and geosciences.  These technologies will be used to develop new educational curricula, outreach activities for K-12 students, and research experiences for college students.<br/><br/>NBFlow will support and advance the use of computational notebooks in scientific research and data analysis by bridging the gap between interactive computation and distributed cyberinfrastructure developed for data-intensive sciences.  Today's notebook environments provide easy access to standard artificial intelligence and machine learning toolkits for processing vast datasets with greater efficiency and accuracy compared to conventional methods. However, migrating a notebook from a scratchpad-like analysis to a robust  pipeline, which must be distributed across a cluster or cloud infrastructure, currently requires significant efforts by developers and scientists.  NBFlow will build upon existing NSF investments in the areas of containerization and workflows that will record notebook executions and schedule tasks for concurrent execution.  By experimenting with an integrated notebook-workflow system, this cutting-edge research will advance understanding in data management and distributed computing sub-fields. At the same time, the project will produce novel techniques to robustly capture provenance from notebook-based workflows, a rich source of data in itself, as well as put techniques developed for incremental computation to practice.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful tool for metabolomics due to its excellent analytical reproducibility and ability to detect numerous metabolites in a single measurement. NMR metabolomics is conventionally performed on a high-field (HF) spectrometer, but the recent development of benchtop spectrometers has led to a resurgence of interest in low-field (LF) NMR due to its accessibility, low cost and small footprint compared to HF. NMR metabolomics at both HF and benchtop LF, however, require time-consuming, user-dependent processing and expertise for metabolite identification and quantification. Due to these limitations, both HF and LF NMR are underexplored for metabolomics research in the biological community. This project will fill these critical gaps by developing, validating, and disseminating real-time, high-throughput NMR metabolomic techniques for both HF and benchtop LF NMR for advancing biological infrastructure and research. This interdisciplinary project will prepare the next generation of women and minorities to pursue bioengineering and bioinformatics career?currently an under-represented discipline. The project will also integrate research with educational objectives to target the broader community from K?12 to graduate students and the general public: (a) coursework to strengthen biosignal processing & analysis skills in undergraduate and graduate curricula; (b) internships, targeted to talented women, minority, and low-income college students; (c) hands-on STEM projects to motivate high-schoolers through collaboration with school teachers; (d) disseminate bioengineering research to support K?12 learning through the Society of Women Engineers, West TN STEM Hub, and Girls Experiencing Engineering programs; and (e) educational exhibits at local museums to enable public outreach and exposure to NMR applications. This early hands-on exposure will benefit students of all ages to understand fundamental concepts and realize NMR applications in a broad range of fields?including molecular biology, biomedical engineering and chemical engineering?and ultimately motivate them to pursue a STEM career. <br/><br/>The project will develop, validate, and disseminate open-access metabolomic techniques that will automatically quantify the metabolites in complex biological spectra obtained from high-field (HF) and benchtop low-field (LF) NMR via the following objectives: 1) investigate high-throughput metabolomic methods for HF NMR using deep learning, 2) reconstruct high-resolution and high-throughput spectra from benchtop LF NMR using autoencoder, 3) investigate these techniques for inquiring biological questions, and 4) disseminate metabolomic libraries and techniques for biological research and education via an open-access software. This research will provide a breakthrough in the field of NMR metabolomics by eliminating a major processing barrier for both HF and benchtop NMR, thus making NMR an accessible and effective analytical tool to the biological community.

Thus, the inability to self-report pain makes babies vulnerable to under- and over-treatment of pain. The investigators created and pediatric nurses validated, a preliminary artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered pain classification model based on facial actions from a video dataset of newborn pain.

How do they cause damage?  What causes some tornadoes to be intense and others weaker?  How can we build better to reduce the risks from tornadoes?  Observations in and near tornadoes are needed to better answer these questions. But, observations very near the ground, where people live, and inside tornadoes are very rare since they are difficult to predict and even harder to observe.  Some, rare, observations show that tornado winds can exceed 300 mph, and that the most intense winds are very near the ground, where they are especially hard to measure.  In order to mitigate the hazards posed by tornadoes, it is critical to better understand their basic structure and intensity.  The Boundary-layer Evolution and Structure of Tornadoes (BEST) project will address some of these questions, deploying mobile radars, Tornado Pods, and SwarmSonde balloons in and near tornadoes.  The goal is to resolve tornado structure, evolution, the intensity of winds, and the temperatures and humidities near tornadoes that likely affect how intense they are.  BEST will also examine decades of mobile radar and other data collected in and near tornadoes to better understand how strong, large, and potentially damaging they are.<br/><br/>BEST is a multi-focus study of tornado structure and evolution.  BEST plans a field phase during which unprecedentedly-fine scale kinematic and thermodynamic data will be collected by proximately-deployed DOW radars, Tornado Pods, and SwarmSonde lagrangian drifter balloons.  Dual-DOW baselines of 3-6 km will allow, for the first time, integrated mapping of tornado vector wind structures combined with detailed thermodynamic mapping provided with the densely-deployed Tornado Pods and SwarmSondes.  BEST will compare these new data with a unique database of DOW wind measurements over 200 unique tornadoes.  Approximately 20 of these include dual-Doppler vector wind resolving data.  One includes data from an extremely fortuitous 3 km - baseline dual-DOW deployment near a very large multi-vortex tornado, with dual-Doppler data uniquely resolving the structure and evolution of sub-tornado vortices.

NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate.

However, providing these services is challenging due to the extreme and changing climate, as well as the remote nature of hub communities and Alaska Native villages. We do not currently understand how CISs are interconnected in Arctic communities; however, we do know that these interconnections are sources of both resilience and vulnerability. Furthermore, the different CIS organizations are complex, are responsible for people?s lives and safety, and have characteristics that we must understand further. This project explores how CISs support each other (e.g., increasing broadband in rural Alaska enables telehealth) and create challenges (e.g., local supply chains often delay infrastructure repairs). Unlike most rural communities in the contiguous US, in Alaska, the air service network is denser than the roadway network. In turn, hub communities?i.e., communities that can be reached by commercial airplanes or ports?are critical for surrounding, remote villages as they provide services including delivery of fuel and workforce support. This project considers the interface between urban hub communities and neighboring rural Alaska Native villages, exploring how challenges in hub towns cascade to villages. In collaboration with three hub communities in Alaska, the interdisciplinary research team integrates systems engineering, organizational sciences, civil engineering, and public health to improve the provision of CISs, not only benefiting the towns themselves, but also Alaska Native villages.<br/><br/>This project aims to architect infrastructure interdependencies within hub communities and at the interfaces between urban hubs and rural Alaska Native villages. In doing so, this work paves the way for future research by providing new empirical data and creating a set of management approaches that can help communities immediately improve their CISs. Leveraging semi-structured interviews with CIS stakeholders, operational data collection, and collaborative stakeholder workshops, Phase 1 of the project identifies and maps CIS interdependencies in hub towns. This phase uses fuzzy cognitive mapping and causal loop diagrams to bring together stakeholders? expertise and perspectives. Phase 2 analyzes how the provision of CISs in hub towns cascade to neighboring villages by assessing end-users? perceptions towards their infrastructure services and how they use services in hub towns. End-users? perspectives are captured through semi-structured interviews and transportation demand surveys. As CIS organizations in Arctic communities are complex, and are responsible for people?s lives and safety, they are considered High Reliability Organizations (HROs); thus, this project uses HRO Theory to provide a solid bridge between social and technical issues. Phase 3 evaluates the organizations involved and provides stakeholders with a concrete assessment of where they stand and how they can become more robust organizations, and thus a more resilient system of organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the course of this five-year project, fifteen institutions of higher education in Ohio will join together to form the Ohio Pathways to Undergraduate Computing Success (OPUCS) project. This consortium of nine four-year and six two-year institutions will devise transfer pathways that will increase the number of students who complete their Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science with a focus on supporting women students.

OPUCS will also provide and study the impact of innovative structural support to women computing students at the academic institutions involved in the consortium.<br/><br/><br/>The OPUCS project objectives are to (1) establish a statewide consortium of nine four-year independent institutions, six two-year community colleges, and 15 industrial partners; (2) develop clearly articulated curricular pathways for students from two-year institutions to computer science bachelor degree completion at a four-year institution; (3) increase the number of students who transfer from two-year to four-year institutions and to complete their bachelor degrees within two years of transfer; (4) increase the number of women transfer students studying computing; (5) increase the number of women who complete internships with our industrial partners; and (6) establish an Association for Computing Machinery?s Council on Women in Computing (ACM-W) chapter at 75% of the consortium institutions. To complete these objectives, the project team will (1) develop an agreed-upon curriculum for the first two years of a computer science program among all OPUCS institutions; (2) use that curriculum as the basis for development of formal articulation agreements; (3) provide specific, detailed, and ongoing training to academic advisors so that students have a planned pathway for degree completion in four years; (4) provide faculty development training to improve the quality of instruction across the consortium; (5) train admission counselors so they are prepared to talk with prospective students about opportunities in computer science; and (6) provide tailored recruitment materials based on proven strategies from the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT). Contributions to knowledge will come from investigation into two research questions: (1) To what extent does building a clear academic pathway and offering a familiar social/professional support network among the institutions involved in that pathway lead to an increase in the number of women studying and completing post-secondary computing degrees across Ohio? and (2) Which activities of the OPUCS consortium are perceived as most impactful by women pursuing computing degrees?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HPC infrastructures commonly employ containers, which provide lightweight and isolated environments for running applications. Nevertheless, containers in HPC infrastructures encounter security challenges, including insecure container images and vulnerabilities related to isolation. Existing container image scanners face a major challenge of low coverage, while current container runtimes struggle to ensure both security and performance for HPC workloads simultaneously. This project addresses these challenges by developing secure containers specifically tailored for HPC infrastructures. The project introduces innovative solutions, including the development of an efficient image vulnerability scanner and a secure container runtime. These systems incorporate various customized optimizations for security and performance targeting HPC workloads. Additionally, educational efforts are made to integrate the research findings into graduate and undergraduate curriculum development. Outreach activities are conducted to encourage participation from underrepresented groups and promote cybersecurity awareness and HPC expertise in the states of Texas and Delaware.<br/><br/>The project consists of two primary tasks. The first task focuses on designing an efficient image vulnerability scanner using innovative and feasible techniques. The research team designs a novel method for container image vulnerability detection based on cross-language code similarity detection. This approach combines graph neural networks with a language-agnostic code representation that leverages natural language processing techniques. Furthermore, it designs an efficient and scalable online search solution. The second task involves developing a secure and high-performance container runtime by utilizing a lightweight virtual machine hypervisor. Additionally, the runtime is optimized based on the characteristics of HPC workloads with the goal of improving both security and performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cognitive science has blossomed. Our understanding of animal minds has radically expanded. AI research has blazed past longstanding milestones like playing Go or writing credible essays. These fields study the same phenomenon?intelligence?in diverse forms, both natural and artificial. But they remain siloed, and each lacks a coherent foundation. This is most glaring in AI, where our capacity to engineer powerful AI systems has vastly outpaced our capacity to understand them. By building dialogue between the major disciplines studying natural and artificial intelligences, our project will produce a roadmap for Accelerating Research Collaboration on Artificial and Natural Intelligences (ARCANI). To create this roadmap, ARCANI will link several international research networks, drawing on insights and conversations that cross disciplines, career stages, and countries. The integration of these research networks will also help diversify participation in the study of natural and artificial intelligences. It will train a cohort of early career researchers in new ways of doing science and international collaboration. Through the existing Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute, the ARCANI team has an excellent record of fostering collaboration and leadership amongst researchers from underrepresented groups and developing nations. ARCANI allows us to scale up our efforts, improving training, collaboration opportunities, and skill development for young scholars across many disciplines. The ARCANI roadmap will lead to the development of theoretical foundations spanning from animal behavior to AI. It will establish a vibrant trading zone for sharing novel methods, data, and computational frameworks. And it will translate foundational concepts and empirical insights into practical technologies. These interdisciplinary efforts are poised to transform the ways humans think about the environment, interact with computer systems, and build AI to support science, art, and human endeavors more broadly. Such outcomes will enhance US scientific leadership in many critical lines of research.<br/><br/>Our Network of Networks brings together researchers from the biological, cognitive, social, and computer sciences to develop new approaches to Accelerating Research Collaboration on Artificial and Natural Intelligences (ARCANI). ARCANI aims to break down disciplinary silos and develop a comprehensive framework for exploring human, animal, and machine intelligences. We will link networks in ethology, complexity science, comparative cognition, neuroscience, robotics, and AI, with nodes in every habitable continent. We have identified three promising areas for accelerated advance through network-to-network collaboration: (1) theoretical foundations of intelligence (DEFINE); (2) leveraging the data revolution to redesign the study of cognition (DESIGN); and (3) naturalistic approaches to AI and robotics (DEPLOY). Each area will be explored by a cross-network working group, holding several virtual meetings and one in-person meeting. Early career researchers (ECRs, including grad students and postdocs) will play a prominent role; the Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute (DISI) will help recruit diverse and exceptionally gifted ECRs. Working groups will address three questions: WHAT are the gaps in existing knowledge? WHO in their networks is best positioned to come together to address them? HOW can AccelNet support sustainable international collaboration to close those gaps? These questions will drive surveys of existing research, definition of key concepts, and frank assessment of barriers. Working groups will summarize their findings in white papers, which we will publish as agenda-setting documents. Working group members will join the leadership team in crafting a 2024 Implementation proposal, providing a roadmap toward transformational cross-network collaboration on the foundations and applications of research on artificial and natural intelligences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given its high prevalence, there is a need for an automatic and scalable method to inform diagnosis and behavioral therapies. While prior work on finding early-emerging and reliable quantitative biomarkers of ASD has focused on non-motor features, abundant research evidence has revealed patterns of impaired motor imitation in a wide range of children with ASD, making motor imitation deficits a promising avenue to find a phenotypic biomarker. However, traditional imitation assessment methods often rely on expert-based observation, which is costly, time-consuming and error-prone, and lacks objectivity and scalability. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning make artificial intelligence a promising technology to design an objective, reproducible and highly-scalable multimodal system functioning not only in well-equipped clinical setups but also at home for assessing imitation performance in children with ASD. However, critical challenges such as the design of specific imitation tasks for ASD assessment, the collection and labeling of multimodal data for training machine learning algorithms, and the development of novel fine-grained representations human movements and metrics for comparing such movements need to be addressed to test the validity, scalability and reproducibility of automatic motor imitation assessment algorithms to inform ASD diagnosis.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to design, develop and test an objective, reproducible and highly-scalable multimodal system to observe children performing a brief video game-like motor imitation task, quantitatively assess their motor imitation performance, and investigate its validity as a phenotypic biomarker for autism. Accomplishing this goal will require an interdisciplinary approach which combines expertise in autism, child development, computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, this project will: (1) design motor imitation tasks that are relevant for ASD assessment, (2) design, test and validate a scalable and flexible system to collect and label multimodal data of children imitating a sequence of movements; (3) design a novel fine-grained representation of human movements that can be learned efficiently and is suitable for comparing the children's movements to the movements they need to imitate; (4) develop novel computer vision and metric learning algorithms for learning and comparing multimodal representations of human movements, and (5) use such metrics to generate candidate imitations scores that can be used as potential quantitative biomarkers for ASD. The motor imitation assessment methods to be developed in this project could be used in a wide variety of applications beyond assessing children with ASD, such as providing imitation performance scores for video-based rehabilitation therapy, surgical skill assessment, athletic activities and other movement-based instructional activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator will develop an electronic textile-based headband (sports sweatband-like) combining functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) methods for brain imaging. Also, a mobile phone application (app) integrated with the headband will be developed for personalized neurofeedback training both at home and in hospital settings. The main challenges addressed here for accurate brain imaging in real-time are focused on developing highly sensitive and reliable hardware as well as advanced data processing algorithms (software) to extract relevant biomarkers for input into artificial intelligence (AI) models. Additionally, ensuring user-friendly phone app interfaces and effective personalized neurofeedback training protocols for users, especially in home-based settings, demands multidisciplinary innovation. This project aims to advance the development of an electronic textile-based headband capable of monitoring multiple biomarkers, such as fNIRS hemodynamic response and EEG along with signals from complementary sensors, while simultaneously conducting cognitive assessments in real-time. This research project will also address a critical limitation--variations in fNIRS signal quality due to skin tone differences.

Approximately 60 million years ago the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) moved over the Samoan and Rarotonga plumes. The OJP is the largest volcanic structure on Earth. This project will sample seamounts on top of the OJP to study the interactions between plumes and the overlying large and thick OJP. Early-career scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students will take part in the cruise. In port the science team will lead ship tours for local public schools and media. While at sea the PIs will make a training video that outlines how to prepare for and carry out a successful cruise. <br/><br/>Recent work offers tantalizing hints that the currently active Samoan hotspot may be a long-lived mantle melting anomaly, or hotspot, that has been active since the Cretaceous. Many of the 87 to 106 Ma volcanoes in the Magellan Seamount Chain, located north of the OJP, have Samoan hotspot geochemical signatures. Critically, their ages and locations match predictions for the Samoan hotspot made using absolute plate motion reconstructions. The implications for identifying a Cretaceous segment (87-106 Ma) of the Samoan hotspot are profound. First, using the same plate motion models, reconstructions of the Samoan hotspot show that the OJP passed over the Samoan plume at ~60-30 Ma, and over the Rarotonga plume?a second, possibly-long-lived hotspot?at ~60-50 Ma. Second, passage of the extraordinarily thick OJP lithosphere over the Samoan and Rarotonga plumes would have resulted in lower degree plume melts with stronger enriched mantle (EM) signatures than anywhere else along the Samoan and Rarotonga hotspot tracks. The hypothesized relationship between thicker lithosphere and stronger EM signatures is supported by the Cretaceous Samoa-related Magellan Seamounts, which exhibit a robust relationship between older (and therefore thicker) lithosphere and stronger EM signatures. A 43-day seagoing dredging expedition to sample the seamounts along the modeled traces of these two hotspot tracks on top of the OJP will test whether the OJP passed over the Samoan and Rarotonga plumes, and whether this resulted in generation of extreme EM melts. A combination of geochemical analyses and 40Ar/39Ar ages will uniquely identify contributions from these two hotspots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, improving network resiliency, transparency, and cybersecurity have emerged as a national priority. Smart Manufacturing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning show promise in achieving these objectives, yet struggle to materialize at the manufacturing network level. Particularly small and medium-sized manufacturers struggle in their adoption of these data-driven, value added technologies due to a lack of resources and incentives. Consequently, they cannot participate in many high-value manufacturing networks that often require certain technologies and data sharing. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project supports research that intends to address this challenge through a Blockchain-enabled framework that leverages secure and private Federated Learning which meets the unique requirements of defense manufacturing networks. This framework enhances the availability and integrity of critical supplies, as well as strengthens and diversifies the defense industrial base. The project?s secure and privacy-preserving data sharing and collaboration mechanisms can be applied in various domains beyond manufacturing, such as healthcare, finance, and supply chain, empowering individuals and organizations to share data securely and collaborate effectively. The results have potential to transform industry, drive economic growth, foster innovation, and enhance societal well-being. <br/><br/>The project?s research problem stems from manufacturing networks? inability to securely and efficiently exchange data and leverage network level Federated Learning. The project aims to increase the resiliency of distributed and dynamic manufacturing networks, specifically including small and medium-sized manufacturers, by providing access to a secure private Blockchain platform that enables decentralized, secure, and transparent communication channels. This enables manufacturing network level learning through Federated Learning while respecting data ownership and ensuring retention of competitive or controlled (raw) data and machine learning models. To achieve these goals, the project utilizes Federated Learning by integrating a private Blockchain to manage metadata, access controls, and model updates. Unlike existing approaches, the framework focuses on specific challenges and requirements of manufacturing networks. This means ensuring confidential data remains local under full control of the individual nodes while leveraging Blockchain for efficient coordination of the Federated Learning process as well as reducing overhead cost for smaller network participants that are resource constraint. The project advances the state-of-the-art in Federated Learning and Blockchain technology through efficient algorithms for model aggregation and coordination in the presence of heterogeneous data for manufacturing networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Waters from the Pacific flow through Island Southeast Asia as the Indonesian Through-Flow (ITF) and into the western Indian Ocean. Nutrient conditions in the ITF are insufficient to support optimum feeding and growth of SBT larvae, and numerous links between the nutrient cycles and food chain remain unknown. There are very few measurements of both major and trace nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron made in the region.  These nutrients support phytoplankton that form the base of the food chain and affect higher trophic levels, including SBT. This work will investigate the potential sources of major and minor nutrients to the region, including island inputs, Australian dust, monsoon rains, and sedimentary fluxes which will help develop a ?nutrient budget? and reveal which sources contribute the greatest to the success of early SBT life stages. This project is a US contribution to the 2nd International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2) that will advance understanding of biogeochemical and ecological dynamics in the poorly studied eastern Indian Ocean. The project will support an early career postdoctoral researcher and outreach activities will include participation in Open House events and REU summer program at home institution.<br/><br/>The ITF can undergo potential changes to the distributions of major and trace nutrients during passage through the straits of southeast island Asia. Coastal currents can resuspend shelf sediments containing nutrients like Si and Fe, while the atmospheric deposition of both natural and anthropogenically derived material from Australia and southeastern Asia can supply N, P, Fe, and other trace metals. Monsoon rains also supply nutrients via wet deposition of aerosols and runoff. These inputs introduce nutrients to the surface ocean of the ITF, where phytoplankton can convert inorganic nutrients to biomass and in turn fuel the entire food chain. In this research aerosols and water column trace metals will be investigated, as a complementary component to another NSF-funded BLOOFINZ project which seeks to understand the N cycling and food-web dynamics of the southern bluefin tuna spawning grounds. The proposed research will address three hypotheses: (H1) The ITF receives inputs of bioactive trace elements from wet and dry atmospheric deposition and resuspended sediments, and (H2) transports these nutrients across the Indian Ocean via the South Equatorial Current (SEC). (H3) Inputs of Fe from atmospheric deposition of mineral and anthropogenic aerosols or continental shelves could help alleviate N limitation in the ITF. To investigate these hypotheses and understand the inputs, removals, and cycles of trace metals in the ITF, the concentrations, elemental ratios, and fluxes of material in aerosols and marine dissolved and particulate phases will be quantified and compared.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the Ross Sea region, the cold, dry environment has allowed preservation of Adlie penguin bones, feathers, eggshell and even mummified remains, at active and abandoned colonies that date from before the Last Glacial Maximum (more than 45,000 years ago) to the present. A warming period at 4,000-2,000 years ago, known as the penguin ?optimum?, reduced sea ice extent and allowed this species to access and reproduce in the southern Ross Sea. This coastline likely will be reoccupied in the future as marine conditions change with current warming trends. This project will investigate ecological responses in diet and foraging behavior of the Adlie penguin using well-preserved bones and other tissues that date from before, during and after the penguin ?optimum?. The Principal investigators will collect and analyze bones, feathers and eggshells from colonies in the Ross Sea to determine changes in population size and feeding locations over millennia.  Most of these colonies are associated with highly productive areas of open water surrounded by sea ice. Current warming trends are causing relatively rapid ecological responses by this species and some of the largest colonies in the Ross Sea are likely to be abandoned in the next 50 years from rising sea level. The recently established Ross Sea Marine Protected Area aims to protect Adlie penguins and their foraging grounds in this region from human impacts and knowledge on how this species has responded to climate change in the past will support this goal. This project benefits NSF?s mission to expand fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes. In association with their research program, the Principal Investigators will create undergraduate opportunities for research-driven coursework, will design K-12 curriculum and assess the effectiveness of these activities. Two graduate students will be supported by this project to update and refine the curricula working with K-12 teachers. There is also training and partial support included for one doctorate, two master and eight undergraduate students. General public will be reached through social media and YouTube channel productions.<br/><br/>A suite of three stable isotopes (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) will be analyzed in Adelie penguin bones and feathers from active and abandoned colonies to assess ecological shifts through time. Stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen (?13C and ?15N) are commonly used to investigate animal migration, foraging locations and diet, especially in marine species that can travel over great distances.  Sulfur (?34S) is not as commonly used but is increasingly being applied to refine and corroborate data obtained from carbon and nitrogen analyses. Collagen is one of the best tissues for these analyses as it is abundant in bone, preserves well, and can be easily extracted for analysis.  Using these three isotopes from collagen, ancient and modern penguin colonies will be investigated in the southern, central and northern Ross Sea to determine changes in populations and foraging locations over millennia.  Most of these colonies are associated with one of three polynyas in the Ross Sea. This study will be the first of its kind to apply multiple stable isotope analyses to investigate a living species of seabird over millennia in a region where it still exists today. Results from this project will also inform management on best practices for Adelie penguin conservation affected by climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experiences such as field trips, summer programs, and hands-on outdoor activities have been repeatedly shown to increase retention, maximize learning gains, and improve students? attitudes, perceptions, and feelings toward STEM topics. Unfortunately, field trips can be costly, and physical disabilities and logistical and administrative constraints can restrict access to field-based learning opportunities for many students, potentially hindering their interest in geoscience. This project addresses this important impediment to inclusivity by developing the first immersive, online Virtual Field Trip (VFT) that capitalizes on the exciting imagery and experience of paleontologic fieldwork. The novel VFT will help address issues in exposure to geoscience content by providing high school and early-college teachers with freely available, geoscience-inclusive resources which can be easily incorporated into their existing classes.<br/><br/>This project will capitalize on the broad appeal of both dinosaur paleontology and virtual field trips (VFT) by combining them into an innovative new resource for educators.

The number of seeds produced by perennial plants over time shows incredible variation across species and locations, from consistent levels of annual reproduction to boom and bust years of seed production exhibiting extremely high temporal variability, known as ?mast seeding?. Linking relationships among plant reproduction, environmental drivers, and species interactions has primarily focused on aboveground factors such as pollinators and weather conditions; while belowground plant traits, such as root attributes and symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungal networks, have been largely ignored. The purpose of this project is to bring together the aboveground phenomenon of mast seeding, with belowground traits and belowground species interactions using multiple global databases and long-term field data. This study has the potential to reveal new drivers of annual fluctuations in reproduction in natural and managed forestry systems. In addition to exploring the impact of mycorrhizae on reproductive dynamics, this project may inform forestry practices. Many forestry trees are inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi, and this work could allow foresters to develop more efficient tree regeneration techniques. The project will provide a mid-career scientist protected time and interdisciplinary training. Training opportunities for an undergraduate student and a postdoctoral researcher from diverse backgrounds will also be enable by this interdisciplinary study. <br/><br/>This work will use five global databases on mast seeding, and mycorrhizal fungal associations and plant-traits (e.g., TRY, FRED, MycoBD, FungalRoot), with data from a ten-year field study of mast seeding. The investigator has expertise in mast seeding and will work with a collaborative partner with expertise in plant-soil-microbe interactions and structural equation modeling. The project will test hypotheses about how belowground plant traits and mycorrhizal associations influence the range of mast-seeding conditions (e.g., temporal variability, time-lags) observed globally across taxa, over a range of environmental conditions.

These lasting and predictable fluctuations in temperature and rainfall are known as ""climatic dipoles"" and often emerge across years or decades. A well-known example of this phenomenon is El Nino, where wet conditions across the southern United States are associated with dry conditions to the north. Most ecological studies collect data at local or regional scales. As a result, the continental-scale effects of climatic dipoles on ecological and environmental processes are largely unexplored. Climatic dipoles may provide insight on important phenomena such as animal migrations, agricultural and forest productivity, insect outbreaks, and the emergence of diseases. This study will use long-term observations of bird movements from thousands of citizen scientists, decades of seed production records in trees, and animal population numbers collected throughout the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). The project will partner with and guide existing citizen science programs to better predict the effects of climate on animals and plants. The team will organize ""ecoclimatology"" workshops to provide training to early-career scientists interested in both climate science as well as ecology.<br/><br/>The research poses a novel framework of methods applied for space-time pattern discovery, used by climate scientists to analyze variability, to identify climate-ecological dipoles across North America. The overarching hypothesis is that many ecological phenomena are entrained at continental scales by dipole modes of climate variability. Specific questions include: 1) do atmospheric circulations and climatic dipoles synchronize seed production in trees (known as masting) and avian irruptions at continental scales?; 2) do unique modes of climate variability affect the population dynamics for multiple taxa (seed-dependent birds, small mammals, and ticks) at disjunct NEON sites and across multiple time lags?; and 3) how might historic and future environmental change influence these climatic-ecological relationships? Analyzing three decades of data from Project FeederWatch and a recently compiled data set of tree masting at hundreds of sites, the research will explore the use of empirical orthogonal functions to understand climate variability impacting plant and animal communities during a time of rapid environmental change. Ecological observatory networks, such as NEON, and citizen science databases are increasingly rich in information. Employing these analytical approaches from climate science will represent a key advance for ecological research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, AI has been emerging as a prominent tool for biological data analyses including assisting with medical diagnostics as well as the detection of disease-related mutations in genetics and genomics. We aim to employ AI to improve and refine gene functional annotations as well as predict functions for previously unclassified genes in Arabidopsis, a model plant system. Given that biological systems including plant-pathogen interactions are exceedingly complex and genes to phenotype relationships require an understanding of diverse layers of biological information, we will utilize a deep learning- and network-based framework that can integrate multiple heterogeneous datasets to obtain more accurate inferences of gene functions. We will validate our computational findings using experimental approaches. Specifically, we will focus on a set of genes that are related to ?Sulfur?, which is considered ?the 4th major phytonutrient? using genetics and plant pathology approaches. We expect a variety of deliverables to a wide range of users including researchers both nationally and internationally, educators in high schools, systems biology and bioinformatics specialists, and the plant research community in general. This will provide biological insights, gene prioritization, and testable hypotheses to plant researchers. Moreover, we will discern the molecular mechanisms of newly identified genes in plant defense. This project will also significantly contribute towards local education and outreach priorities through a minority-oriented program, PlantGIFT (Plant Genomics Internship For Teachers. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Network science and deep learning, a subtype of machine learning enable predictive modeling from large and multi-dimensional datasets and elucidate the complex relationships among various layers of ?omics to predict the function(s) of the proteins. We aim to apply a hybrid method encompassing network biology and deep learning computational approach to predict gene functions for the unclassified genes as well as refine the Gene Ontology for the inadequately annotated genes. Specifically, we will generate a suite of diverse co-expression networks using transcriptome studies derived from a wide spectrum of biotic and abiotic stress treatments including plant-pathogen interactions. These co-expression networks will be integrated to transcription factor-targets and protein-protein interaction networks. Network topological features will be extracted from the above-described diverse ?omics networks and integrated into the predicted function(s) for each node. Moreover, we will predict Arabidopsis genome-wide gene functions using a deep neural networks-based integrative framework that can efficiently perform network embedding on heterogeneous networks. The precision of these computationally derived gene function predictions will be independently validated through genetics- and pathology-based experimental assays. In particular, we will focus on a GO term ?sulfur? and investigate the biological functions of 60 genes and a pair of regulatory transcription factors in biotic and abiotic stresses including plant defense. We will also establish PlantGIFT (Plant Genomics Internship For Teachers) to integrate research, education, and outreach for minority participation in genomics and plant sciences.

This project's novelties are EDA domain knowledge-aware graph machine learning, training acceleration, and algorithm-hardware co-design and optimization. The project's broader significance and importance include: (1) to advance the field of machine learning in chip design, highlighted in National Artificial Intelligence Initiative; (2) to deepen the understanding of interactions among EDA domain knowledge, graph learning, and GPU acceleration; (3) to enrich the computer engineering curriculum and promote participation from undergraduates, underrepresented groups, and K-12 students in STEM fields through relevant programs.<br/><br/>The project will develop a design paradigm for efficient, scalable and practical algorithm-hardware co-optimized solutions to significantly accelerate large graph machine learning on EDA tasks using a single GPU.

In support of these needs, the RESCUE project will design a three dimensional (3D) networks architecture that exploits the advances in the field of next generation wireless networks to provide a prototype solution such that an integrated communications system for disaster relief operations is realized. Additionally, an innovative massive multiple access mechanism and a dynamic spectrum sharing model will be introduced to increase the public safety system?s capacity and improve the spectrum utilization, respectively, during the relief operations. A new Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solution will be proposed to support scenarios of Global Positioning System (GPS) denial by utilizing the next generation networks technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The outcomes will have long-lasting benefits for the communications, and in turn the well-being, of the victims and first responders during disaster relief operations.  Furthermore, the project will provide unique training for graduate and undergraduate students at the crossroads of reinforcement learning and next generation networking technologies.<br/><br/>The RESCUE project will introduce a novel 3D networks architecture that exploits terrestrial and aerial base stations to provide the necessary redundancy of communications during disaster relief operations.

This project will incorporate methods from the weather and climate fields (stochastic parameterization and ensemble modeling) to better model and predict the result of these wave-particle interactions. This project will expose the broader space physics community to these compelling tools from the weather and climate fields.

The primary objective of this project is to study the interaction of LGWs with radiation belt electrons using event-specific diffusion coefficients to more accurately capture the rate of pitch angle scattering and precipitation into the Earth?s atmosphere for eventual implementation into a stochastically parameterized diffusion model. Stochastic parameterization is a modeling scheme where the variables representing the sub grid physics (i.e., diffusion coefficients representing wave-particle interactions) are selected randomly from a distribution instead of using a deterministic average. This allows for explicit variance of the sub-grid physics and better error quantification through ensemble modeling. Quantifying and understanding the temporal and spatial scale sizes of the variability of each wave mode is a crucial first step in implementing a complete stochastically parameterized radiation belt diffusion model.

Remarkably, a common strategy that has evolved to help organisms across all kingdoms of life deal with desiccation is through the synthesis of a special class of proteins known as intrinsically disordered proteins. Despite their importance in protecting animals and plants from drying out, how these proteins work is unresolved. This project will combine experiments that span individual molecules to whole organisms to understand how disordered proteins provide protection from dehydration across all kingdoms of life. As part of this study, this project will recruit students from rural communities via remote-learning and include them in cutting edge, interdisciplinary research which will facilitate their integration into the US STEM workforce. <br/><br/>Proteomes across all kingdoms of life contain a significant fraction of sequences that are intrinsically disordered and do not adopt a stable three-dimensional structure. Instead, these sequences exist in an ensemble of rapidly interconverting conformations that can be highly sensitive to changes in the cellular environment in which they function. Interestingly, many of these disordered proteins are implicated in mediating resistance to environmental stresses, including desiccation, in which the physical-chemical composition of the cell changes dramatically. The goal of this project is to gain a holistic understanding of how disordered proteins and the cellular environment come together to provide protection to the cell during extreme desiccation. Towards this goal, the project will employ a multilevel, interdisciplinary, and integrated approach. Starting at the molecular level, in vitro and computational experiments will be performed that will provide insight into how desiccation-protective disordered proteins function in conjunction with well defined and controllable environments. This information will be integrated with high throughput, sequencing-based studies of disordered protein-mediated desiccation protection performed in yeast (cellular level), and a multicellular animal model (the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, organismal level).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues.

This project seeks to study how soft and fully biocompatible materials can be leveraged to interact directly with signals from the body without damaging tissue. A transistor fabricated from these materials will be used to create the circuits necessary for bioelectronic devices to acquire and modulate the activity of neurons in the brain. The outcome of the research will benefit society by improving the design of bioelectronic devices currently used for patients with conditions such as epilepsy or Parkinson's disease by eliminating the need for implantation of bulky or rigid materials in the body. This project will also facilitate understanding of the principles underlying interactions between the body and electronic devices.

Fungi and bacteria are microorganisms that often live in a close association and play a key role in transforming and detoxifying metals in the environment. In spite of this importance, there is relatively little understanding of how the interactions between bacteria and fungi influence the transformation and/or detoxification of metals. The goal of this project is to address this knowledge gap by identifying how fungal-bacterial interactions affect metal transformation. This will be achieved through a novel multidisciplinary research approach employing advanced, state-of-the-science analytical techniques. Knowledge gained through this project will allow the engineered control of metal transformations for a wide range of applications in environmental cleanup, biorefining, production of nanoparticles, and other beneficial applications. Successful completion of this research has strong potential to benefit society through improvements in environmental remediation and industrial manufacturing. This project will improve the Nation?s STEM workforce by providing a unique training opportunity for student researchers that bridges diverse fields such as environmental engineering, microbiology, geochemistry, bioinformatics, and art.<br/><br/>Remediation of metal contamination is a major environmental challenge because, unlike many organic pollutants, metal species cannot be degraded and can only be extracted or biotransformed to less toxic forms. While past approaches to biotransform metals have focused primarily on single microorganisms, host-microbiome interactions have shown potential to biotransform surrounding environments and improve host resiliency. However, the mechanisms for metal biotransformation by microbial host-microbiome systems are largely unknown. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the rules of life that govern fungal microbiomes. This goal will be achieved through a specific focus on fungal microbiomes, which include a fungal host, endosymbionts (endobacteria), and symbionts (exobacteria that live extracellularly) as a model host-microbiome system. The specific research objectives of this project designed to achieve the goal are to: understand the effects of metals and metalloids on the diversity and transmission of fungal microbiomes (facultative and obligatory); and determine the role of fungal microbiomes in metal tolerance by mediating the uptake, transformation, and sorption of metal ions, nanoparticles, or other metal species. A deeply integrated multidisciplinary approach will be used to investigate physiological, genetic/genomic, and metabolic processes that govern the structure and function of fungal microbiomes in the presence of metals. This will be achieved using novel state-of-the-science isotope probing, advanced microscopy, spectroscopy, and integrated genomics, transcriptomics, and metallomics to elucidate how the microbiome influences the metabolic activity of the host towards metal ions. Successful completion of this research has strong potential to identify new genes and/or pathways for metal tolerance and biotransformation, as well as expand our mechanistic understanding of the structure and function of fungal microbiomes in nature. This knowledge has strong potential to benefit society by facilitating applications in remediation, water treatment, electronics manufacturing, antimicrobial production, medicine, and related fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computational thinking is a means to understand and solve complex problems using computer science concepts. Despite its increasing importance, as reflected in national standards and initiatives, no single preservice teacher prepared to teach computational thinking has graduated from the teacher education programs in West Virginia, and the situation nationally is similarly challenging. Most often, a sole focus on computer science provides no explicit connection to disciplinary classroom settings and student context, missing important opportunities for preservice teachers to recognize what computational thinking may mean in their future classrooms. Without systemic changes in teacher education, preservice teachers are likely to develop insufficient levels of understanding of and interest in the computational nature of science. Consequently, preservice teacheers will be limited in providing their students with important knowledge and skills necessary to participate in the workforce of the future. To address the issue, this project aims to develop and implement a computational thinking-infused curriculum in science methods courses. The project intends to co-design and pilot science lessons in schools where elementary preservice teachers are placed. The research agenda of the project is designed to investigate the impact of the efforts on the teaching of preservice teachers.  By the end of the project, the participating preservice teachers are expected to know, practice, and teach critical computation thinking-infused science lessons. Project activities are anticipated to result in a model and a set of resources that can be tested and used in teacher education nationwide to cultivate preservice teachers? computational thinking-enhanced STEM learning and teaching.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to help preservice teachers develop interest, competence, and a positive perception of the utility value for incorporating critical computational thinking into their science instructional practices. Project research questions focus on measuring these constructs and identifying computational thinking practices and processes exemplified in preservice teachers? teaching efforts over time. Approximately 100 preservice teachers, enrolled in science methods courses in the Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education Program of West Virginia University are intended to participate over two years. Preservice teachers are intended to have the opportunity to practice, design, and teach contextualized science lesson units that integrate both computational thinking processes and practices with the 5E Instructional Model, a widely accepted constructivist, inquiry-based instructional model for teaching science. Project research aims to determine the impact of computational thinking-infused activities on preservice teachers? motivations and teaching. Then the project intends to employ a research-practitioner partnership perspective during full-time preservice teacher placement experiences. Selected preservice teachers are to be involved in iteratively co-designing, with multiple stakeholders from the local education community, piloting, and testing computational thinking-infused science lesson units in placement classrooms. Through the dissemination of project activities, research outcomes regarding how to integrate a critical computational thinking lens with the 5E Model, and developed materials, this project intends not only to help develop preservice teachers? understanding of and interest in the computational nature of science teaching but also likely enable teacher educators and in-service teachers nationwide to recognize its relevance to pedagogy, content, and context, contributing to students? preparation toward future STEM workforce.
