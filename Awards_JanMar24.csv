Understanding CME evolution is particularly important as they are major drivers of severe space weather. The low-corona segment of the CME structure is known as the coronal dimming: an area dominated by short-lived open magnetic field that grows and decays as the magnetic field is dragged out into interplanetary space. To understand CME evolution as a whole, one has to study the evolution of dimmings in conjunction with the CME morphology and its physical properties from the solar corona all the way to the Earth. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the CME and dimming evolution through initial 50 events using solar observing satellites including Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO). The CME morphology and magnetic structure will also be investigated using the Potential Field Source Surface and Graduated Cylindrical Shell models. The CME properties will be identified in the solar wind data and linked to geomagnetic disturbance values on Earth. Another 150 dimmings will be added to the event catalog and related to CME solar wind properties and geomagnetic observations on Earth. The project will support a female scientist and NSF-sponsored REU students and NOAA-sponsored Hollings summer students will be responsible for data preparation and testing. The dimming event catalog will be made publicly available as part of the Big Earth Data Initiative project to improve rapid and long-term access to key data to support research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The amount of time this transit takes is also the amount of time available for chemical reaction to occur. At the same time, the exact path that rain takes through watersheds - whether through shallow soils or deep, fractured bedrock - influences which reactions occur and at what rates. Consequently, observations of river water chemistry can be described equally well by models that attribute all variation to changes in either flow paths or flow rates. This ambiguity is problematic as the predicted effects of climate change on water resources are different depending upon the exact processes governing flow and reaction. To provide new insights into the controls on river water chemistry, this project will develop new approaches for analyzing variations in chemistry over time to separate the effects of flow paths from flow rates. The project will engage undergraduate students through an engineering design course, internships, and public outreach on local water quality issues.<br/><br/>This work will leverage the information content of time-series data to constrain the coupled timescales of subsurface water transit and solute acquisition. To avoid some of the assumptions embedded in past work, non-parametric approaches will be used to infer geochemical kinetics and solute generation mechanisms. After being validated against 2-D numerical and analog experiments, the analysis approach will be used to elucidate the role of Critical Zone structure in the climate-weathering feedback as well as account for the non-linear behavior of trace element and isotopic proxies to improve mixing models. The results of these applications will be used to inform a new global analysis of weathering processes and their implications for planetary habitability with a timescale-agnostic framework for comparing terrestrial and marine systems. To lower barriers to collecting time-series data, undergraduate engineering design teams will develop a design-for-purpose autosampler. To help engage more undergraduate students in geoscience research, the project will develop a new, outreach-based course on local water quality issues.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Geobiology & Low-Temperature Geochemistry programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

US portion of the collaborative effort will be co-funded by Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Communications and Information Foundations Program (CCF).  <br/><br/>The proposed effort aims at: (a) establishing a partnership among academic research teams from Ukraine, Poland, and the US; (b) building a resilient and collaborative research and education program of excellence in Ukraine in machine learning (ML) for satellite lidar sensing of Earth; and (c) exploring radically new concepts in generative compression for the storage or communication of compressive lidar measurements.

Spaceborne lidars today are limited in spatial resolution and coverage since laser reflections are only measured along 1D footprint line scans. Compressive lidars take sparse measurements of Earth from hundreds of km above Earth to then computationally reconstruct the 3D imagery with resolution and coverage, as if the data was collected from just hundreds of meters in height. To date, satellite lidars do not use data compression to avoid loss of information. CS lidars, however, rely on deep learning reconstruction algorithms covering orders of magnitude larger areas of Earth where the opportunity of data compression arises naturally. This project will thus explore radically new approaches to data compression using generative models which have shown the potential to produce more accurate image reconstructions at much deeper compression levels. The project will recruit a fresh cohort of talent in Ukraine and Poland who will be galvanized to embark on enduring careers that revolve around the intersection of machine learning and Earth remote sensing. <br/><br/>Spaceborne lidar is an important imaging technology that is used to unravel the topological structure of the Earth?s surface and its forests which have a profound effect on ecosystem processes that determine nutrient, water, and carbon cycles on Earth. Spaceborne lidars today are limited in spatial resolution and coverage since laser reflections are only measured along 1D footprint line scans. In between these, vast amounts of landscape remain without sampling illumination. To overcome this limitation, a new generation of satellite lidars are being developed at NASA taking on a radically new sensing paradigm where the traditional 1D line scanning is abandoned and replaced by sparse and wide-field-of view lidar illumination, coined compressive satellite (CS) lidars. The objective is to compressively sense Earth from hundreds of km above Earth to then computationally reconstruct the 3D imagery with resolution and coverage, as if the data was collected from just hundreds of meters in height. NASA?s satellite lidars to date do not use data compression of the measurements to avoid loss of information. CS lidar, however, relies on deep learning reconstruction algorithms covering orders of magnitude larger areas of Earth where the opportunity of data compression arises naturally. NASA?s CS lidar team is currently not exploring this problem and thus the proposed exploratory research effort is valuable, complementary, and timely. While traditional image compression relies on hand-crafted encoder/decoder pairs, the research team will explore radically new approaches to data compression using generative models which have shown the potential to produce more accurate image reconstructions at much deeper compression levels. CS lidars promise to significantly enhance both the field-of-view and imaging resolution of satellite altimetry where data compression becomes increasingly important.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process, known as regression testing, is widely used in software development practice. A major problem in the generation of test cases is the presence of flaky tests:  tests that non-deterministically pass or fail on the same version of the code. Failures from flaky tests can mislead developers about their recent changes, waste developers? time, and reduce developers? trust in software testing. Many software development organizations have reported that flaky tests are one of their biggest problems, because they confound assurance goals.   This project aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of regression testing in the presence of flaky tests. It will produce tools that aim to be efficient and effective at resolving the inherent nondeterminism.  The work focuses on (1) reducing the cost of flaky-test detection and debugging techniques by predicting important test properties, (2) developing new techniques to predict flakiness-related properties, (3) speeding up and reducing the resources needed by regression testing, (4) developing new techniques to systematically detect flaky tests, and (5) reducing the flakiness in Android user interface testing. The project will also produce curriculum for education and training on the topic of programming in the face of nondeterminism, and will work with industry to transfer technology. <br/><br/>The research on flakiness will move from the typical, black-box approaches to a new level for detecting, debugging, and fixing through novel, white-box and learning-based approaches. The approach will use static and dynamic analyses to compute state pollution, which may affect test flakiness based on the test execution order. The work involves combinatorial design theory to improve the efficiency of order-dependent test detection. Special attention will be paid to flaky tests in graphical user interfaces using record-and-replay and test input generation.  Test  coverage computations, which can be used to predict whether a code change will affect the test's output, will use a machine learning approach.   The work will result in tool implementations and large-scale evaluations in open source and proprietary environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The direction in which a cell divides with respect to the tissue around it determines the position of the two daughter cells. This direction can therefore contribute to tissue shape; for example, oriented cell divisions are implicated in building the tubes that help comprise the lung and kidneys. Placement can also contribute to cell type diversity; oriented cell divisions help to explain how the brain is populated with a range of different cell types. This project takes advantage of recent technical advances in both microscopy and CRISPR-mediated genome editing to examine division orientation across multiple cell and tissue types in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. This work will resolve the molecular mechanisms that orient cell divisions with respect to the tissue.  The Broader Impact include the intrinsic nature of the research as all multi-cellular organisms utilize asymmetric divisions to sort cells in tissues.  Additional activities include promoting diversity in science, the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, along with post-doctoral researchers.<br/><br/>Cell division is controlled not only in time, but also in space. Regulated division orientation can drive asymmetry, as is often the case with stem or progenitor cells that produce daughters with different cell fates, and is also implicated in determining tissue shape and size. Previous work shows that division orientation is determined at metaphase, and is controlled by an evolutionarily conserved set of proteins. These proteins, which include the microtubule motor dynein, combine to produce a pulling force that acts on the mitotic spindle, drawing it into a particular alignment. In order to function correctly, the pulling force must be restricted to a particular region of the cell periphery. However, the precise location must vary according to the cell type. The mechanisms that control localization of the pulling force are unclear, and appear to be diverse. The investigator proposes firstly to study how the pulling force is localized across cell types. He proposes secondly to study a critical spindle orientation factor called Mud (in flies), NuMA (in vertebrates) and LIN-5 (in nematodes), and to determine the function of endogenous variants that are not predicted to promote localized pulling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A worldwide effort is underway to create larger, more reliable quantum computers, enhancing their ability to execute complex quantum algorithms. Despite this progress, practical quantum computing faces significant challenges, including the susceptibility of quantum bit (qubit) devices to environmental noise, producing inaccurate results. Furthermore, the limited availability of algorithms that can leverage quantum computers in the near term is a significant hurdle, as existing algorithms require millions of noise-free operations beyond the current quantum hardware capabilities. The gap between the quantum hardware necessary for solving real-world problems and today's quantum computing technology is significant. This award seeks to bridge this gap by focusing on scalable and resilient quantum computer architectures through an integrated approach to hardware and software design and developing software tools to help users leverage existing and future quantum hardware. Moreover, this award will create a broadly accessible quantum computing curriculum and support outreach activities to engage and educate undergraduates in quantum information sciences.<br/>  <br/>This project focuses on two research thrusts. The first thrust concentrates on co-designing Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and Runtime to enable efficient and resilient architectures and introduce new hardware-software primitives to help scale distributed qubit control. On the ISA front, the project will investigate how flexible instruction sets offered by most quantum hardware platforms, which allow new gates by calibrating pulses, can be leveraged without overly increasing the calibration complexity. For enabling a large number of operations on a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer (FTQC), required by most real-world applications, this project will develop a runtime capable of detecting noise amplification events due to unstable qubit devices and mitigating them by moving data and learning optimal noise mitigation policies. The second thrust of this project will focus on developing software tools to facilitate efficient empirical design and evaluation of quantum algorithms. To that end, the project will develop tools to design, tune, and debug hybrid classical-quantum workflows. Moreover, the project will study the efficacy of partially fault-tolerant quantum computer architectures, where only a subset of operations are protected against errors, and investigate if co-designing ISA, runtime, error correction, and applications can push partial FTQC toward practical utility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Theoretical bounds identified through this research projct will assist transit agencies in designing deep learning models, such as choosing the right sample size and identifying the appropriate model architecture, to optimize transit decision-making quality. A new deep learning paradigm will be created to overcome the limitations of existing works, thereby assuring optimal decision-making outcomes in transit systems. This researched paradigm intends to leverage decision errors to update parameters in deep learning models so that they move toward optimal and reliable decisions directly.

Methanol produced from carbon dioxide could be used as a fuel and material feedstock, rendering this chemistry useful for rebalancing the carbon cycle (i.e. cycling the greenhouse gas CO2 to this reduced building block form). Currently copper-based catalysts are sluggish when reacting with carbon dioxide and unstable when converting it to methanol. To improve these copper-based catalysts, an templating method will be used to rapidly create and test new nanoparticle compositions and structures for catalysis. This research aims to establish a flexible and tunable method for catalyst development, including understanding the fundamental molecular interactions of the catalyst with industrially relevant materials, with the goal of increasing catalyst stability and activity. More efficient catalysts would facilitate the transition to a sustainable closed-loop fuel economy and reduce our reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels. Additionally, this research will include student training at both the graduate and undergraduate level to help prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers dedicated to addressing pressing environmental challenges. The project also provides targeted opportunities for female freshman undergraduates to begin early engagement in research and to be provided with mentors.<br/><br/>Under this award, Kara Stowers and her research team at Brigham Young University are studying the template-mediated synthesis of copper-based nanoparticle catalysts for the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol. This project addresses existing catalyst weaknesses in order to improve carbon dioxide conversion and further facilitate methanol as a renewable energy carrier.  The scientific goals are to (i) optimize the interface active sites of Cu-based nanoparticles to increase catalytic activity, (ii) identify synthesis conditions that provide stability against nanoparticle aggregation, and (iii) optimize bimetallic compositions of Cu-based nanoparticles to increase reaction selectivity. The experimental approach uses spin-coating to synthesize a metal organic framework (MOF) as a thin film template at ambient pressure and temperature, which should allows for the rapid and reproducible generation of arrays of nanoparticles onto industrially relevant supports after template removal. Using MOFs as a template affords extreme flexibility in tuning of metal cluster centers and bimetallic combinations, and is expected to allow for the reproducible modification of Cu-oxide nanoparticle composition.  The team also aims to control spatial and size distributions and oxidation states within these nanoparticulate frameworks. The projected outcomes of the work are to facilitate rational design of Cu-based nanoparticle catalysts with improved catalytic activity, and with improved catalytic stability from reduced aggregation and bimetallic compositions optimized for improved catalytic efficiency. Synthesis of copper metal nanoparticles via thin films on industrially relevant supports should offer an expeditious and scalable strategy for catalyst synthesis and testing. The impact of this research on the field is expected to be in improved technologies for carbon dioxide conversion as well as in a new strategy to carry out nanoparticle assays for rapid, scalable catalyst development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Generative AI systems are built on unimodal and multimodal combinations of language, speech, and vision machine learning models. Generative AI models such as the chatbot ChatGPT and the text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion offer innovative and practical tools. However, this technology has inherent problems. Generative AI models learn implicit associations and cognitive errors documented in psychology from large-scale sociocultural data. Generative AI error pose implications for performance disparities in AI, as well as AI ethics, particularly concerning the impact of generative AI on individuals and society. Outputs from easily accessible generative AI models contain associations and errors that amplify issues that are challenging to mitigate for both AI developers and users. This project will develop methods for evaluating associations and errors in generative AI, assess the impact of generative AI on society, and analyze how generative AI shapes human cognition and agency. The project will advance knowledge by developing methods to address bias in machines, human-AI collaboration, and society. The open-source tools and materials presented by this award will raise awareness among a range of stakeholders, including the student populations, researchers, developers, industry, the open-source community, AI users, policymakers, and the public. This effort will enhance AI education at the University of Washington by introducing a generative AI ethics curriculum across disciplines and divisions.

The project's primary objective is to empirically analyze the societal impact of generative AI, contributing to the ethical and responsible development and deployment of AI. The project seeks to evaluate and characterize associations and errors in generative AI systems by developing principled and generalizable detection and measurement methods. Leveraging the findings and current evaluation methods, the research will devise approaches that automatically identify and reduce these signals in generative AI models, taking into account the specific task, application, context, and use case. These approaches will encompass techniques such as training data augmentation, embedding space processing, fine-tuning, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from feedback. By examining generative AI biases in comparison to implicit and explicit biases of humans at the state and country levels and identifying emergent generative AI errors, the project will uncover the broader societal impact of generative AI.

Although found in everyday materials from tires to paints, polymer nanocomposites also have future potential as advanced functional materials in applications from energy storage to water purification.  This research will provide a fundamental understanding of chemistry, physics and engineering principles that can be brought together to investigate a new type of composite containing a mixture of charged polymers and particles coated with similar or different charged polymers to achieve properties not possible with traditional composites.   In short, the overall goal is to promote the progress of science leading to new and improved advanced materials.  One fundamental issue is controlling molecular interactions that determine how particles are distributed in a composite material. One challenge with this ?mixing? approach is a tendency for particles to aggregate.  To overcome this limitation, a second fundamental issue in this study is the fabrication of highly loaded composites where the polymer is incorporated into a scaffold, analogous to water swelling a sponge.  To accelerate the discovery of new materials, a smart experimental approach will be used where data will be characterized and fed back immediately to formulate a new composite.  This process is continued until the optimum formulation is found.  Students performing this research will gain valuable skills in data science, enhancing career opportunities, and learn to utilize valuable resources (materials, equipment) sustainably. Graduate and undergraduate students also participate in annual public events including Nanotechnology Day at Penn,  Philly Materials Day, and the Philadelphia Science Festival.  A particularly unique program is ?First Exposure to Research in STEM,? which provides a structure for introducing first-generation, low-income students to their first research project. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Polymer nanocomposite (PNC) structure determines their properties. However, the full potential of PNCs is hindered by lack of control over structure-property relationships, partly due to the prevalence of non-equilibrium structures. Here, PNCs containing discrete nanoparticles (NP) in a polymer matrix or those fabricated from bicontinuous, nanoporous scaffolds are designed, processed and characterized to understand their fundamental thermodynamic, interfacial, and dynamic principles.  The objectives of this work are to (1) elucidate how brush charge density affects NP dispersion in polyelectrolyte (PE) matrices of varying charge and polarity and explore kinetic pathways towards percolated structures, (2) investigate infiltration kinetics of polar polymers into scaffolds, and (3) develop autonomous experimentation (AE) to accelerate discovery of PNCs with distinct structures. Aim 1 investigates PE-NPs in polymer matrices of increasing polarity. Aim 1a studies PE-NP/matrix miscibility to provide insight into brush-matrix electrostatic interactions. Aim 1b studies phase separation to guide the  identification of kinetic pathways that produce percolation of charged brushes. Aims 2a and 2b investigate bicontinuous metal and polymer scaffolds, respectively, infiltrated with polar matrix polymers. Infiltration kinetics and properties are studied as a function of pore confinement and scaffold type. The significance of these studies involves the discovery of pathways for fabricating (bi)continuous structures for enhanced energy storage or water purification applications. In Aim 3, AE-optical microscopy will be used to map the phase diagram of PNCs, whereas AE-GISAXS, in collaboration with scientists from Brookhaven National Laboratory, will identify materials and processing conditions that produce percolated PNC structures with advantageous mechanical properties and conductivity.  In summary, fundamental studies of PNCs) combined with data-science-driven characterization will act synergistically to advance knowledge for materials discovery in this project.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For such safety-critical domains, the current toolkits usually fall short in uncertainty quantification, a key feature that is necessitated for informed decision-making. Given the enormous data collected by IoT devices on-the-go, scalability is another key enabler of real-time IoT sensing and management with low latency. Further, how to endow learning with adaptivity and robustness to unpredictable dynamics in IoT is of utmost importance, especially with humans-in-the-loop. Before embracing the full potential of safety-critical IoT, novel tools have to be developed to address these major challenges. Towards this goal, this CAREER proposal advocates fundamental research that aspires to advance the current tools for real-time IoT sensing and management, with direct impact on a number of safety-critical domains, including healthcare, transportation, and environmental sensing. Leveraging the PI's institutional resources, the PI will transform the proposed research goals into educational activities, through i) mentoring graduate and undergraduate students; ii) curriculum development that cross-fertilizes the fields of machine learning, communications, signal processing and networking; as well as iii) interdisciplinary collaboration with UGA's Center of Cyber-Physical Systems. This seamless integration of research and education is central to the PI's career path and is well aligned with UGA's mission ``to teach, to serve, and to inquire into the nature of things."" To further promote the societal embracing of the emergent IoT technologies, the PI is committed to disseminate the research outcomes to the general public, in particular K-12 students, through short courses, online videos, and workshops.<br/><br/><br/>This proposal puts forth an ambitious plan by tailoring advances in contemporary Bayesian machine learning tools, namely, Bayesian function approximation, Bayesian bandit optimization, and Bayesian reinforcement learning, to address the aforementioned challenges. This fresh Bayesian flavor naturally innovates existing toolkits with uncertainty quantification and robustness, essential to safety-critical IoT. The resultant approaches will not only benefit key IoT-enabled tasks, but also markedly push the envelope of these disciplines by incorporating IoT-driven constraints. Specifically, three complementary and intertwined research thrusts will be pursued. Thrust 1 (T1) puts forth a fundamental uncertainty-aware function learning framework, which not only directly benefits the prediction-oriented IoT sensing task in T1, but also contributes to Bayesian optimization for open-loop blind IoT management in Thrust 2 (T2), where the decisions made by the IoT controller do not affect the IoT state. Thrust 3 further builds on T1 and T2 to scale up Bayesian RL for real-time closed-loop IoT management with full interaction between the IoT state and the IoT controller. The ultimate pursuit is a holistic framework that integrates novel algorithms with uncertainty awareness, scalability, and adaptivity for real-time IoT sensing and management, the associated rigorous analyses for robustness to unpredictable dynamics, and the deployment to real safety-critical IoT applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They can dissipate and store mechanical power but cannot generate positive net power. The lack of power generation limits movements that require the user to move against gravity, such as going upstairs or transitioning from sitting to standing.  This lack of power may induce uneven loads in the body, which can increase the likelihood of chronic back pain and increase the effort to walk. Active prostheses have the potential to overcome these fundamental challenges. However, commercially available powered prostheses are heavier, noisier, more expensive, and generally less accessible than unpowered versions. The overall goal of this project is to reimagine existing rigid prosthetic components as compliant mechanisms that reduce mass, energy consumption, audible noise, and part count of powered prostheses. Muscles take advantage of the elasticity of tendons (in series with the muscle) and ligaments (in parallel with the muscle) to efficiently transfer power from the muscle to the joints. This project will provide a new understanding of how to engineer elastic components in parallel with electric motors as engineered ligaments to make powered prostheses more attractive and accessible.<br/><br/>The performance and behavior of compliant mechanisms depend on three fundamental factors: 1) material properties, 2) geometry, and 3) load-deflection response. This project will develop new knowledge to design the load-deflection response and geometry of compliant mechanisms that connect in parallel with electric motors to reduce motor torque. This reduction implies lighter, more energy-efficient, and quieter prostheses, as it requires lower reduction ratios, fewer gears meshing, lighter motors, and less heat dissipation. This collaborative project between the University of Notre Dame and Brigham Young University will establish two scientific contributions: 1) a robust convex optimization framework to design the load-deflection response of a parallel spring that guarantees motor torque reduction in multiple locomotion activities despite parametric uncertainty (e.g., user mass, walking speed); and 2) a design framework for compliant mechanisms with optimal load-deflection profiles to reimagine existing rigid components and implement the benefits of parallel compliance without a tradeoff in terms of mechanical complexity or extra components. The application of these innovations will result in an Open-Source Compliant Ankle, with open-source designs available online that complement the existing NSF-funded Open-Source Leg. The research team will collaborate with non-profit organization 2ft Prosthetics and local Amputee Support Groups to incorporate the feedback from prosthetic users, manufacturers, and clinicians into new designs. The outcomes of this research will include the organization of a conference workshop, new content in a graduate-level class on Wearable Robotics, and a 3-week summer program for local middle schoolers interested in STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In both low dimensional topology and operator K-theory, the PI will use analytic tools to study questions about these spaces, such as how they are curved or how objects can be embedded inside them. These questions have a wide range of applications in biology and physics. The educational and outreach goals of this project involve math and general STEM enrichment programs at the middle and high school levels, with a focus on programs aimed at students from underserved communities and underrepresented groups, as well as mentorship in research at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>In low dimensional topology, this project focuses on furthering our understanding of instanton and monopole Floer homologies and their relation to Khovanov homology, and using this to study existence questions of families of metrics with positive scalar curvature on manifolds, as well as questions about knot concordance. Separately this project also involves computationally studying knot concordance, both by a computer search for concordances and by computationally studying certain local equivalence and almost local equivalence groups that receive homomorphisms from the knot concordance groups. In operator algebras, this project focuses on studying their K-theory and its applications to invariants in geometry and topology. The K-theory groups of operator algebras are the targets of index maps of elliptic operators and have important applications to the geometry and topology of manifolds. This project involves studying the K-theory of certain C*-algebras and using them to study infinite dimensional spaces; studying the noncommutative geometry of groups that act on these infinite dimensional spaces and, in particular, the strong Novikov conjecture for these groups; and studying the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for high dimensional expanders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What becomes important and practical is the description of the density and the statistics of the interacting waves. Arguably the most recognizable and fundamental objects within this theory are the wave kinetic equations. These equations, their solutions and their approximations have been used to study a variety of phenomena:  water surface gravity and capillary waves,  inertial waves due to rotation and internal waves on density stratifications, which are important in the study of planetary atmospheres and oceans; Alfvn wave turbulence in solar wind; planetary Rossby waves, which are important for the study of weather and climate evolutions; waves in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and in nonlinear optics; waves in plasmas of fusion devices; and many others.

This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research which aims to address these gaps by working at the intersection of bio-inspired design, systems engineering, and engineering design to establish quantitative tools for addressing system resilience when minimal information is available. Biological ecosystem characteristics will be investigated for their ability to guide system designers in the early design stages towards better response and recovery, including situations involving targeted and/or random disturbances. Ultimately, the project will develop knowledge and methods to ensure that human systems can withstand disturbances ? especially important for the critical infrastructure systems that supply our water, power, or medicines ? by safeguarding against potential failures and costly downtime. Collaborative feedback from ecologists, industry, and academic experts will ensure that the interdisciplinary work maintains each domain?s critical features. Additional deliverables from this project include a ?Walk Like an Engineer? program, which engages participants of all ages and abilities in engineering inspiration scavenger hunts through local parks, led by both a bio-inspired engineering design expert and a Nature Center host. The themed nature walks, which will focus on topics such as ?Nature?s Systems? and ?Nature?s Resilience?, will encourage participants to see themselves as design engineers learning from nature. The program will advance the United States future workforce by nurturing interdisciplinary communication skills and early interest and excitement in STEM-based design, while also teaching the public about nature and engineering in a connected manner. <br/><br/>This project supports the long-term goal of enhancing the early integration of resilience into the system design process, allowing designers to make proactive choices to create more sustainable and resilient systems that can withstand disruptions and recover effectively. The research objectives of this project are to provide quantitative tools for assessment of biological inspiration in engineering system design, extend the use of effective bio-inspiration into system recovery, and formulate practical design tools for achieving system resilience from biological ecosystem principles found to be effective. Ecological Network Analysis will provide a quantitative method for extracting desirable traits from resilient biological ecosystems (e.g., food webs) and applying them to human engineered systems. Of interest is how these traits can improve a system?s robustness and recovery, which will be tested using a variety of case study types and criticality levels, including supply chains, water distribution networks, power grids, and industrial resource networks. The most beneficial biological systems traits will be further investigated to generate fundamental engineering principles, such as the impact of topology versus weights on nature?s systems characteristics. A study of targeted versus random disturbances will provide additional insight into where these biological systems characteristics have the most value for engineering designers seeking system-level resilience. The project?s research objectives are integrated and enhanced by the project?s educational objectives: to create and foster engineering excitement before students typically self-exclude from STEM; teach the public about how nature and engineering can be connected; and create STEM access for and inclusion of students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Evaluation of the educational outreach activities will also provide important documentation for the use of nature to increase interest in engineering at all ages, as well as in underrepresented and underserved groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The widespread acceptance of these cell models, coupled with their growing commercial availability and ease of deriving patient-specific cells, have underscored their potential to revolutionize our understanding of human physiology and function. To date, however, limited techniques exist for comprehensive investigation of the properties of such cell models over time, which greatly impedes their translation for physiology investigations, disease modeling, and pharmacology research. This project will address these technical challenges and develop automated lab-on-a-chip platforms for comprehensive chronic monitoring and control of cell physiology. This will be accomplished via innovations in materials, device fabrication, circuit design, software development, and system integration. The research results represent important steps towards the next generation lab-on-a-chip health monitoring and modulation systems. If successful, the outcomes will significantly simplify the operation, expand the possibilities, and create new opportunities in many programs of biomedical research, in which automated lab-on-a-chip devices with reduced human exposure are highly demanded. The education activities will integrate with the technical developments through multidisciplinary training of students in bioelectronics research, introduction of new undergraduate courses on optoelectronic biomedical systems. Outreach plans involve lectures and designing pedagogical demonstration kits to educate K-12 students as well as active research participation by local high school students.<br/>This project will develop and validate automated lab-on-a-chip platforms that allow for direct high-content, real-time, multiparametric interrogation of multiple parallel live cell properties and their interplay at meaningful levels of spatiotemporal precision inside standard cell culture environment. The project includes three research objectives: (1) explore cellular-scale components for crosstalk-free electrical recording, stimulation, and triple-parametric fluorescence recording of in vitro live cell function. The structure-property relationships of those components will be investigated to optimize the device performance. Optical and electrochemical modeling will be performed to yield fundamental insights into their characteristics; (2) develop compact lab-on-a-chip platforms for automated, long-term, multiparametric probing of live cell models under controlled cultivation conditions. The full compatibility with incubator culturing environment is beneficial for work with dangerous pathogens, such as COVID-19, toxic substances, and radioactivity. Advanced hardware and software designs will enable independent control of each modality, fast measurement, and data analysis. This will eliminate the need of significant technical expertise to manually analyze the high-content data generated, dramatically save the time efforts, reduce error, and improve accuracy for the experimenters; (3) validate the platforms via rigorous benchtop measurements and high-content on-chip screening of induced pluripotent stem cells-derived neurons. The performance will be benchmarked against commercial systems.

For example, when choosing whether to have a risky, but potentially needed, medical procedure, a patient may need to consult several doctors that have different specializations, knowledge, and backgrounds, leaving the patient to aggregate this information and determine a course of action. This interdisciplinary research explores how to support individuals, organizations and governments in making better decisions through a novel approach that explores the way decision-making and information are interrelated. Decisions are shaped not only by how individuals weigh information, but also by how they weigh the information sources, such as who exactly is providing this information. Through blending advances in psychology and computer science, the project seeks to explain previously unexplainable behavior and better predict judgments in new situations. Such knowledge can facilitate decision support systems across many domains. Additionally, this research holds the potential to reveal new pathways towards translating complex artificial intelligence (AI) systems into a form that is more compatible with human cognitive processes. <br/><br/>The project proposes a new theory of judgment that fuses psychological theory with operational and theoretical advances from computer science in the areas of data aggregation and artificial intelligence. The theory of ordered judgment provides the first operational framework for empirical tests of the role of ordering in judgment and beyond, and impacts both psychological and computer science research. For psychology, the theory of ordered judgment has many implications for how to display data to facilitate accurate processing that can be useful for decision-support and human factors work in contexts ranging from graphical user interfaces to operating machinery. For computer science, this work contributes to the crucial area of explainable artificial intelligence by articulating direct links between complex computer algorithms and human reasoning.

These systems have found applications in diverse fields, including ecology, engineering, and social sciences, yet their high-dimensional nature makes them challenging to study. This often leads to significant theoretical and computational difficulties, known as the ?curse of dimensionality.? Recent advances in applied mathematics have shed light on these complexities, revealing that complex NetID patterns can arise from low dimensional interactions. Building on these insights, this project is dedicated to developing a theoretical and computational framework to address the estimation problems within these models by exploiting the underlying low dimensional structures. The overarching goal is to create efficient, physically interpretable surrogate models that bridge the gap between qualitative analysis and quantitative data-driven applications, ranging from sensor network optimization to modeling the environmental and climate impacts on fish migration. This research program will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, featuring a graduate summer school at the intersection of NetIDs and machine learning. There will be a particular focus on engaging female and underrepresented minority students in this vibrant field, blending machine learning with differential equations. The project's findings will also enrich mathematical data science course materials for both undergraduate and graduate education.<br/><br/>This project aims to make fundamental mathematical, statistical, and computational advances for solving NetIDs' estimation problems. The research will focus on three primary areas: (1) Developing innovative sampling strategies for optimal data recovery in NetIDs with linear interactions by exploiting their inherent low-dimensionality in terms of sparsity, smoothness, low-rankness. (2) Establishing robust statistical estimation of NetIDs with nonlinear time-varying interactions by combining machine learning, numerical analysis, and functional data analysis to create physically consistent estimators that bypass the ?curse of dimensionality,? while exploring the identifiability and convergence as sample sizes increase. (3) Investigating the statistical predictive properties of Graph Neural Differential Equations, aiming to derive upper bounds for their transferability and generalization error. The results of this project are expected to address the computational challenges of large-scale Graph Neural Networks and bridge theory and practice in NetIDs research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its elements are precisely the symmetries of the algebraic closure of the rational numbers.  In practice, though, this group is particularly difficult to study.  There are continuum-many of these symmetries, most of which cannot be computed by any computer (or Turing machine) running any finite-length program whatsoever.  However, the symmetries that mathematicians encounter on a regular basis are essentially always computable -- perhaps because these are fundamental to the group, or perhaps just because noncomputable symmetries are naturally more difficult to examine and work with.  This project aims to determine just how much difference there is between the computable symmetries (as a group) and the larger group of all symmetries. The research work lies at the interface of logic and number theory and is likely to attract the interest of both communities. Graduate students from CUNY Graduate Center will participate in this project.<br/> <br/>An analogous situation exists with the field of all real numbers:  only countably many real numbers have computable decimal expansions, so the vast majority of real numbers are noncomputable, yet the computable ones are the only ones ever encountered in daily life.  Here, it is known that the computable real numbers form a subfield extremely similar to the full field of all real numbers, an elementary subfield with exactly the same first-order properties. This grant will fund research to attempt to determine whether Gal(Q) is analogous in this way:  do the computable symmetries form an elementary subgroup of the full group?  (Or, at a minimum, are the two elementarily equivalent?)  If so, then mathematicians should be able to determine many results about the full group just by examining the computable symmetries, which are far more accessible.  If not, that would suggest that the absolute Galois group is a thornier object than the field of real numbers, with its noncomputable symmetries somehow essential to its character.  However, even then, it is possible that the subgroup might be elementary for relatively simple properties (e.g., purely existential statements about the group), in which case this project will attempt to find the first level at which the subgroup stops imitating the full group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Osteocytes play several important roles in regulating bone matrix properties, but several urgent questions must be addressed before interventions can be designed that act on these cells to improve the bone matrix quality and the resulting tissue fracture resistance. This project will determine how osteocytes toughen bone tissue through acting on other bone cells as well as by their direct interactions with the surrounding bone matrix.

However, the commercial applications of such process technologies remain limited due to key barriers in design complexity, flowsheet integration, and operation under uncertainty. This project aims to develop a computer-aided strategy to augment process intensification synthesis, operability optimization, and modularization clustering. The proposed approaches will be the first of their kind to systematically identify the optimal selection and integration of modular and/or intensified process units in grassroots design or retrofit operations, which currently rely on human engineering experience. Of particular interest to this study are plant-scale bulk chemical production processes, which are among the largest energy users and carbon emitters in the domestic industrial sector. The industry-university project team with researchers from Dow Chemical Company, Texas A&M University, and West Virginia University is uniquely positioned to accelerate MCPI in industrial practice through this GOALI project. The methodological developments will be demonstrated in industrially relevant case studies and compared to state-of-the-art patented processes. The project findings will be incorporated into online learning modules and hands-on workshops to disseminate the methods and tools to the industrial community in a timely manner. The project team also will jointly train next-generation MCPI engineering leaders via academic and industrial research opportunities chosen from a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>This project will develop advanced computational methods and a systematic framework to design optimal, intensified, and highly operable bulk chemical processes based on modular process intensification principles. The framework centers on a phenomena-based representation which employs general thermodynamic-based driving force constraints to quantitatively identify the optimal modular intensification opportunities at the systems level (e.g., mass/heat transfer enhancement, multi-functional task integration), while creating the opportunity to discover innovative unit and flowsheet designs that may be new to current industrial practice. The research also will generate a fundamental understanding of the impact of modular intensification on operability under uncertainty. The resulting methodology will deliver optimal and operable modular/intensified process designs by systematically addressing the interactions and trade-offs of process efficiency, economics, and operability. Key pillars of the research plan feature: (i) phenomena-based process synthesis synergizing physical laws, mathematical optimization, and machine learning to efficiently search the combinatorial design space, (ii) integrated synthesis with data-driven flexibility and controllability to generate optimal modular chemical process intensified (MCPI) designs with guaranteed operability performance, and (iii) a similarity-based clustering algorithm to automate the translation of phenomena-based solutions to unit operation-based flowsheets. The methodological developments will be demonstrated on industrially relevant case studies including ethylene glycol and methyl methacrylate production. The resulting methods, software, and industrial case studies will produce design tools and concrete examples of their benefits, improving existing processes with a win-win combination of economic, energy, and sustainability through MCPI design principles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through multi-agent simulations and real-world experiments, it aims to reveal how cooperation can emerge and persist within self-organizing energy systems, and how it can lead to collective benefits such as energy savings and climate adaptation. By harnessing collective efforts, this work aims to catalyze a shift towards collective infrastructure systems. Beyond its targeted scientific contributions, the project includes an interactive educational program featuring games and simulations fostering public understanding of cooperation as a vital aspect for energy equity and sustainability. The goal is for findings to empower architects, planners, and policymakers with knowledge and tools to design and manage connected communities where buildings share, rather than compete for, energy resources. The project aspires to inspire a new way of thinking about how collective collaboration can create better energy systems.<br/><br/>This project will investigate how cooperation can emerge and be sustained among groups of buildings that strategically pool distributed energy resources (DERs) to enhance shared resilience and sustainability. It will establish an interdisciplinary framework to investigate cooperation within multi-agent energy systems. The technical approach synergistically combines reinforcement learning-based control policies, multi-agent simulations, and empirical validation. It seeks to formally model the complex reciprocal interactions underlying cooperative energy behaviors within connected communities. The overarching goal is to elucidate quantitative design principles and policy guidelines that embed cooperative intelligence within engineered, self-organizing architectures to enhance collective resilience and equitable resource allocation. The first thrust of the project involves developing an adaptable simulation testbed to evaluate cooperation trajectories under various energy management schemes, community configurations, and decision protocols. This flexible virtual testbed will enable systematic evaluation of factors that influence emergent cooperation. The second thrust entails an empirical analysis to diagnose how real-world socio-technical elements?from human preferences to technology diffusion asymmetries?shape cooperative outcomes. Grounding insights in data will uncover actionable pathways for implementation. Finally, interactive web platforms and games based on constructivist learning will cultivate public understanding of decentralized systems and cooperative intelligence for equitable and resilient energy access.

The increasing frequency of such events is alarming and naturally leads to concerns that the severity of heat waves is outpacing the rise in mean temperature.  But the extent to which the hottest days are warming faster than the average temperature increase is hard to quantify, and certainly heat waves would become more severe even if the hottest days warmed at the same rate as all the other days.  One challenge is that heat extremes are rare by definition, thus there is limited sample size to make statistically robust conclusions.  The sample size issue is particularly challenging as the extent to which the hottest days warm faster is likely to vary from one region to another. A further challenge is that we do not have a satisfactory understanding of the physical mechanisms that might lead to stronger warming trends for hot days than for average days.<br/><br/>Work under this award addresses both the extent to which temperature increases are greater for the hottest days and the physical mechanisms the might be responsible.  The analysis of temperature trends compares trends for the 50th and 95th percentiles of the temperature distribution on a regional basis and uses various statistical methods to overcome sample size limitations and account for natural variability.  The analysis also considers output from the simulations available from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Large Ensembles created with the Community Earth System Model (CESM).  Work addressing physical mechanisms focuses the extent to which drying of the soil contributes to temperature extremes, in particular that drying accompanies heat waves and drying limits the extent to which the surface can cool through evaporation and transpiration, thus leading to greater warming.  The dependence of temperature extremes on soil moisture and evapotranspiration is explored by applying a surface energy budget equation to observations and model output, and through idealized experiments with CESM.<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER proposal seeks to build a bridge between climate and data science to foster more effective collaboration between the two fields.  One activity is the development of an educational module for a freshman class in environmental science intended to teach statistical thinking through hands-on data analysis.  The module uses Juypiter notebooks to give students access to observational data for their own hometowns, and guides them through the calculation of means and extremes and their variation over time.  Another activity is a workshop for 30-40 graduate students working at the interface between data science and climate science, to be held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The workshop is mostly devoted to a 'science hackathon' in which teams of students with a mix of disciplinary backgrounds will work together to solve specific problems related to climate extremes. The award provides support for 20 attendees at the workshop who are chosen through an open competitive process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geotechnical site investigation is critical to safe, cost-efficient, and resilient civil infrastructure. However, it remains a challenge for civil engineering practice. Insufficient site investigation is a primary reason for project budget and timeline overruns or insurance claims on construction projects. The cone penetration test collects subsurface data and is used throughout geotechnical and environmental engineering practice. Engineers use cone penetration test data cautiously when soils and conditions vary from the standard soils that data interpretation methods were developed and validated with. Findings from this research are intended to provide engineers with a more capable framework for site investigation by (1) estimating advanced engineering parameters from cone penetration test data for standard and non-standard soil types, therefore allowing engineers to do more with the data, and (2) quantifying uncertainties associated with site investigation data for both standard and non-standard soils, therefore enabling engineers to propagate uncertainties to predicted performance of infrastructure, and evaluate the value of additional data. This project integrates research with an education and outreach program for community college transfer students that aims to increase the number of students who successfully transfer to and graduate from four-year Civil Engineering programs. The project will support outreach events at local community colleges, organization of an annual transfer student workshop, including research lab tours and outreach demonstrations, and hosting undergraduate community college transfer students in research intern positions.<br/><br/>This research will advance site investigation methods by examining fundamental soil-load interactions during cone penetration testing and characterizing uncertainties stemming from soil parameter estimation. The objectives of this research are to (i) investigate relationships between soil type, soil properties, initial conditions, critical state line position and shape, and cone penetration test data, (ii) investigate uncertainty quantification for cone penetration test-based soil parameter interpretation in standard and non-standard soils, and (iii) explore uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in the broader context of site investigation. An integrated program of advanced laboratory testing, a system-level computational cone penetration model, and physical cone penetration tests will characterize the fundamental role of the soil critical state line and initial state on cone penetration test data. The anticipated outcome of this investigation is a critical state line-based interpretation approach for cone penetration test data that will be developed and validated across a range of standard and non-standard soils. A large dataset of soil properties and site investigation information will be used to investigate uncertainty associated with soil parameter estimation from site investigation data. This assessment will enable a framework for uncertainty-informed site investigation that will propagate uncertainties from site tests to design and predicted performance, enabling engineers to use quantifiable metrics for site investigation decisions alongside their engineering judgment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They can dissipate and store mechanical power but cannot generate positive net power. The lack of power generation limits movements that require the user to move against gravity, such as going upstairs or transitioning from sitting to standing.  This lack of power may induce uneven loads in the body, which can increase the likelihood of chronic back pain and increase the effort to walk. Active prostheses have the potential to overcome these fundamental challenges. However, commercially available powered prostheses are heavier, noisier, more expensive, and generally less accessible than unpowered versions. The overall goal of this project is to reimagine existing rigid prosthetic components as compliant mechanisms that reduce mass, energy consumption, audible noise, and part count of powered prostheses. Muscles take advantage of the elasticity of tendons (in series with the muscle) and ligaments (in parallel with the muscle) to efficiently transfer power from the muscle to the joints. This project will provide a new understanding of how to engineer elastic components in parallel with electric motors as engineered ligaments to make powered prostheses more attractive and accessible.<br/><br/>The performance and behavior of compliant mechanisms depend on three fundamental factors: 1) material properties, 2) geometry, and 3) load-deflection response. This project will develop new knowledge to design the load-deflection response and geometry of compliant mechanisms that connect in parallel with electric motors to reduce motor torque. This reduction implies lighter, more energy-efficient, and quieter prostheses, as it requires lower reduction ratios, fewer gears meshing, lighter motors, and less heat dissipation. This collaborative project between the University of Notre Dame and Brigham Young University will establish two scientific contributions: 1) a robust convex optimization framework to design the load-deflection response of a parallel spring that guarantees motor torque reduction in multiple locomotion activities despite parametric uncertainty (e.g., user mass, walking speed); and 2) a design framework for compliant mechanisms with optimal load-deflection profiles to reimagine existing rigid components and implement the benefits of parallel compliance without a tradeoff in terms of mechanical complexity or extra components. The application of these innovations will result in an Open-Source Compliant Ankle, with open-source designs available online that complement the existing NSF-funded Open-Source Leg. The research team will collaborate with non-profit organization 2ft Prosthetics and local Amputee Support Groups to incorporate the feedback from prosthetic users, manufacturers, and clinicians into new designs.

The flow of polymer melts dictates a wide range of societal impacts, including: the enormous energy consumption associated with polymer processing; the range of polymers that can be efficiently manufactured; the properties and performance of products, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and coatings; and, the recycling of plastics products. As a result, additives are used to influence the flow properties of polymer melts. The global market for these products, termed ?rheology modifiers,? currently exceeds $7 billion/yr. <br/>Numerous challenges motivate the development of new, generalizable and scalable strategies for rheology modifiers that give enhanced performance at lower loading and can be tailored for a broad range of applications. Drivers include: growing awareness of the potential health and environmental impacts of rheology modifier leaching; increased global focus on energy efficiency; emergence of new manufacturing technologies ? especially additive manufacturing ? with bespoke rheological requirements; recognition of the need for improved recycling pathways. Supramolecular polymers, in which the molecular units are held together by reversible bonds, combine the softening effects of molecular additives at the high temperatures used for the production of plastics with the typical polymer-like behavior that imparts plastic materials their useful mechanical properties at ambient temperature. This project will combine the structural control of supramolecular polymers developed by Shenhar with the rheological expertise developed by Craig to pursue fundamental principles that will unlock this new class of rheology modifiers.  <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project tackles critical, fundamental questions about the rheological modifications that are possible through the blending of supramolecular polymers into traditional polymer melts. A combination of synthesis and characterization will be used to test and refine quantitative structure-activity relationships for this relatively unexplored set of materials. Supramolecular polymers represent a promising and untapped material class for next-generation rheology modifiers. Supramolecular polymers combine the plasticizing effects of low-molecular weight additives with a rich combination of Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheology that can be tuned through molecular structure. Despite their promise, supramolecular polymers are largely unutilized as rheology modifiers. The research plan seeks to provide new and generalizable principles for the rheology of these new blends of two material classes. The proposed work seeks: (i) to develop a robust understanding of the unique rheology of each supramolecular component, including the heretofore unexplored rheology of their respective melt phases; (ii) to characterize the rheology of blends of supramolecular and covalent components, establishing design principles through which the supramolecular polymer confers unique rheological behavior to the covalent melt; (iii) to explore supramolecular blending as a facilitator of melt extrusion and additive manufacturing (3D printing) of traditionally intractable polymers. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compared to traditional search engines, they provide a coherent narrative, which could potentially facilitate the exploratory phase of users' searches. Generative AI responses are more readable, coherent, and contextually appropriate; hence, they sound authoritative and definitive. However, existing generative AI models are subject to problems such as hallucinations, unsupported misleading answers, outright misinformation, and hidden biases. Another issue is that the majority of user queries are ambiguous. Current systems, including those that employ generative AI models, do not appropriately consider ambiguity by providing users with alternative answers to their queries. The vision of this project is to enable users to use generative AI models to obtain an interpretable, diverse, and unbiased set of alternative answers, viewpoints, subtopics, or aspects as required for various questions or tasks in information access, where each distinct answer or viewpoint is faithfully attributable to a set of evidence and supporting information sources. This project aims to make information access easier, more effective, and more trustworthy for users.

Off-policy methods are an alternative approach, which provide much more data efficiency because they are not restricted to only training on on-policy data and can even be used to train on existing offline data. This suggests that to truly unlock the potential of reinforcement learning, we must develop principled off-policy algorithms. This project is focused on advancing RL by looking at a framework that aims to provide a unified, principled objective that applies to both standard and off-line RL settings and will allow us to efficiently solve large-scale, real-world, sequential decision-making problems.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will examine the dual formulation of this objective, which gives rise to a principled off-policy objective that sidesteps issues present in the more commonly used primal formulation. This objective will lead to algorithms particularly suitable for large state-action spaces, long horizons, and sparse rewards encountered in real-world problems. The PI will explore connections between existing and new imitation learning and reinforcement-learning methods and the proposed framework. The PI will show that both imitation learning and reinforcement learning methods are unified under this objective and present theoretical guarantees for this class of methods. Finally, the PI will extend the dual framework to leverage pre-training and fine tuning for improved sample efficiency. This includes exploring methods for incorporating out-of-domain datasets and multiple modalities in self-supervised pre-training, especially relevant for applications in household robotics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is certainly the case when one studies wave turbulence theory. This theory is focused on the fundamental concept that when in a given physical system a large number of interacting waves are present, the description of an individual wave is neither possible nor relevant.  What becomes important and practical is the description of the density and the statistics of the interacting waves. Arguably the most recognizable and fundamental objects within this theory are the wave kinetic equations. These equations, their solutions and their approximations have been used to study a variety of phenomena:  water surface gravity and capillary waves,  inertial waves due to rotation and internal waves on density stratifications, which are important in the study of planetary atmospheres and oceans; Alfvn wave turbulence in solar wind; planetary Rossby waves, which are important for the study of weather and climate evolutions; waves in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and in nonlinear optics; waves in plasmas of fusion devices; and many others. This project will tackle foundational questions in wave turbulence theory through rigorous mathematical analysis. In addition, the project will promote collaborations, facilitate the dissemination of interdisciplinary research, and provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to work on a multifaceted and forward-looking line of mathematical research.<br/><br/>This project tackles challenging problems at the intersection of the physics and the mathematical analysis of nonlinear interactions of waves that are central in the study of wave turbulence theory. These problems include the rigorous derivation of wave kinetic equations, the analysis of the 4-wave kinetic equation for the Fermi- Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) chain and the well-posedness of a geometric wave equation via Feynman diagrams in the energy regime. The research proposed will not just address important open problems but will contribute to the interdisciplinary development of several new and complex tools both in mathematics and physics. The proposal aims at providing these tools by blending Feynman diagrams, harmonic analysis, probability, combinatorics, incidence geometry, kinetic theory, dispersive PDE, quantum field theory and the FPUT chain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dielectrophoretic molecular transport (DMT), which works at small length scales, flexibly separates most solutes out of water but it is not used because current mathematical models are unable to accurately predict its behavior. This CAREER project seeks to develop and validate models of DMT equilibrium and transport behavior. These models and the improved understanding of DMT that will result from this project will enable its use and could result in, for example, lab-on-a-chip diagnostics which broaden access to important medical tests and improve well-being. This project will accomplish this while creating an equitable and inclusive pipeline to graduate education that will broaden and strengthen participation in scientific research.<br/><br/>The primary research goal of this CAREER project is to develop and validate models for dielectrophoretic molecular transport (DMT). To accomplish this objective, a microfluidic device with transparent electrodes and insulation has been developed that permits real time, spatially resolved spectroscopy measurements of solution composition between and around electrodes while controlling initial concentrations, field strengths and gradients, and flow rates. Spatially and temporally resolved concentration data will be used to develop, improve, and validate mathematical models of field-dependent activity coefficients, which will be used to predict equilibrium states and coupled transport in complex solutions. Not only will these constitute the first accurate models of DMT but will also expand our understanding of this transport phenomenon by assessing the importance of structure-field interactions. Integrated with this research project is an undergraduate, research-oriented alternative to Senior Design, which will lead students from starting a research project through to creating and disseminating research products. The research component of this CAREER proposal will serve as a core, guaranteed research opportunity for students within the course. Incorporating research and mentoring into a familiar classroom setting significantly reduces cultural and institutional barriers while reducing uncertainty and time cost associated with undergraduate research. In doing so, this plan will increase participation in undergraduate research and ideally position students to continue and thrive in their future education and career.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such digital systems include storage systems and search engine as well as web services. Spreading out digital systems across machines has multiple benefits including (1) the ability to survive machine failures by moving computation to a different machine and (2) the ability to leverage the capabilities of multiple machines to finish computations faster. To realize these benefits, the machines within a distributed system must coordinate amongst themselves to ensure the result is identical to an idealised illusion of executing the computation on a single machine. This project will make coordination significantly faster by developing a new abstraction, deadline-ordered multicast (DOM), which combines: (1) Multicast: The ability to simultaneously transmit a message from a sender to multiple receivers and (2) Synchronized clocks: Technology to ensure that, at any instant, clocks on various machines display the same value of time and that these clocks progress in lock step with each other.   The project will demonstrate how DOM can be used to accelerate widely used computer systems, such as distributed databases, coordination services, and blockchains. The project will also train both undergraduate and graduate students using a variety of approaches to understand the benefits of synchronized clocks when thinking about distributed systems. <br/><br/>Distributed systems are at the heart of computing today and include widely used systems such as distributed databases, fault-tolerant key-value stores, and distributed ledgers. At the core of these systems are distributed protocols such as crash-fault-tolerant consensus, concurrency control, and Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus. Much effort has been expended on improving the performance of distributed protocols over the years including recent efforts that leverage richer network services to improve distributed protocols. Such services include switch multicast, programmable switches, programmable network-interface cards, in-network priority queues, and control over routing. However, many distributed systems today are deployed by cloud tenants, who have no access to such rich network services, making it impossible for them to benefit from the improved protocol performance enabled by such rich network services.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new network primitive called deadline-ordered multicast (DOM) that will make it easier to construct high-performance distributed protocols on the public cloud. DOM leverages 2 key techniques: (1) the recent availability of synchronized clocks as a service, which now permit tightly synchronized clocks in the public cloud and (2) multicast, which struggled to find traction in the Internet, but is ideal for the one-sender-multi-receiver communication at the heart of distributed systems. DOM delivers a multicast message from a sender to multiple receivers at or after a message's deadline and delivers multiple messages in deadline order. DOM provides a consistent order (the order of deadlines) in which different receivers process a set of messages, accelerating several distributed protocols in the process. This proposal will develop the DOM abstraction, design an optimized DOM service, and prototype several applications demonstrating DOM's value.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At these frequencies, multi-antenna transceiver (TRX) arrays are key in overcoming the high path-loss and boosting the signal-to-noise ratio, critical for maintaining robust communications. Unlike single-antenna systems, designing large multi-antenna arrays entails significant challenges due to (i) mismatches and non-idealities, and (ii) the large number of control parameters. Existing arrays mostly rely on look-up-tables (LUTs) and offline compensation. Such static solutions, however, can neither capture all possible operation modes nor provide real-time adaptivity to the propagation conditions and communications/sensing tasks. This collaborative research project with Swiss researchers at ETH Zrich will result in novel intelligent large-scale multi-antenna array architectures with highly reconfigurable 140 GHz frontends. Unlike today's systems that are blind to imbalances and mismatches in the array, or only make static corrections, employing detectors and adaptive array calibration/beamforming will result in an adaptive array, thus performing better as conditions evolve, and lowering the cost to calibrate a large array. The research will directly impact applications in beyond-5G and 6G communications, sub-mm-wave radar, and next-generation satellite/intersatellite links. To disseminate research results, the project will provide open access to the array models, array calibration/beamforming codes, and array demonstration measurements.<br/><br/>The ULTRA (Ubiquitous Large inTelligent arRAys) project aims at addressing large-array design challenges with a holistic approach that jointly considers mm-wave electronics, antenna arrays, digital baseband processing, and calibration algorithms. The main objective is to design large and scalable array architectures at D-band 140GHz with intelligent calibration as well as adaptive in-field beamforming. The work is divided in several thrusts, including Analytical and Behavior Modeling of Non-idealities in Large Scalable Arrays, Designing Reconfigurable D-Band Frontends as Performance Tuning ""Knobs"", Designing Non-Intrusive D-Band Frontends Performance ""Sensors"", Blind Array Calibration and Beamforming Algorithms, and ULTRA 140-GHz Array System Integration and Demonstration. Both beam-independent non-idealities (e.g., phase/gain/power mismatches) and beam-dependent non-idealities (e.g., antenna coupling/crosstalk) will be modeled. For array antenna load compensation, a reconfigurable load-modulated-balanced-amplifier transmitter and a Marchand balun receiver with non-foster terminations will be investigated. D-band orthogonal phase/gain tuning blocks will also be explored. Non-intrusive in-situ real-power and impedance detectors will be used to detect antenna mismatches/coupling (beam-dependent non-idealities). Transmitter/receiver (TX/RX) loopbacks will measure gain/phase/power mismatches (beam-independent non-idealities) in array elements. Signal processing and machine learning algorithms for blind, on-the-fly array calibration and residual impairment compensation will be pursued. Digital beamforming methods that adapt their key parameters to the instantaneous channel conditions and calibration/beamforming algorithms will be implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) prototyping boards to interface with the D-band TRX array for offline/online close-loop operation of the ULTRA system.

The overarching premise of this research project is that the current organization of design teams around analysis disciplines (e.g., thermal analysis, structural analysis) or around physical components (e.g., engine, battery, exterior body) may not be the ideal way to architect human-AI teams. Considering the differences between humans and AI systems in terms of their capabilities, there may be alternative ways to divide tasks and responsibilities in system-level design problems among humans and artificial members within a team. This research will contribute to the field of design science through a systematic and comprehensive analysis of team architectures in hybrid human-AI teams and the impact of those different architectures on design outcomes. Rather than assuming a pre-defined role for AI, this project will follow a top-down Systems Engineering approach to identify best practices for defining roles for AI in a design team using computational models of human and AI decision-making processes. An experimental study using a video game platform will engage human users to work alongside AI teammates in solving a design problem to assess the impact of human factors in this context as well. The findings will inform how AI technology should be integrated into the engineering design workforce with proper task allocation in order to reduce system development time and costs for future enterprises in multiple industries, spanning from smart healthcare to defense. The project will generate broader impacts by engaging a diverse group of undergraduate students into research using the STEM-SI program at Lehigh University. Integrated with the research program, the education plan will improve pedagogical practices in statistics and machine learning for engineering systems applications using e-training games. Outreach workshops within local communities will attract broader interest in data science by engaging middle school girls in data-related challenges in engineering using the CHOICES program at Lehigh University. <br/><br/>This research addresses the lack of fundamental principles to guide task partitioning and division of labor for hybrid human-AI teams, accounting not only for heterogeneity among decision-makers (represented by a select set of characteristics), but also for important human factors. The project will use multi-agent simulations to model generalized agents that solve context-free design problems following Bayesian decision-making processes. These agents will be characterized in terms of task performance, self-confidence, and confidence in other team members. A computational analysis will use various problem partitioning and task assignment strategies from decomposition-based design and machine learning to quantify their impact on team collaboration considering diverse agent characteristics. Mirroring this simulation scenario, behavioral experiments on an electric vehicle design and control game will present a collaborative design decision-making problem for hybrid human-AI teams with alternative task allocation scenarios in a controlled setting. These experiments will collect behavioral data that capture the effects of human factors, including bias, workload, and job satisfaction, and that will be used to validate or refine the computational findings. As a by-product, this research will develop an open infrastructure to study human-AI collaboration in design teams by sharing the experimental platform with the broader scientific community. This project will also integrate video game platforms developed for the behavioral study into existing mechanical engineering courses and data bootcamps to teach undergraduate and graduate students data analytics. Outreach workshops will use the same game platforms to increase data literacy and promote STEM careers among middle school girls.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerous infectious disease outbreaks over the past two decades have demonstrated the need for epidemiological modeling. They also revealed shortcomings of existing scientific techniques to accurately predict epidemic dynamics and to devise effective control strategies. This project will establish a new efficient simulation method that makes it possible to assess rare but highly consequential events. It will be used to identify decisive risk factors concerning the fabric of virus-spreading interactions that can facilitate large epidemic outbreaks. A well-documented example are superspreading events that played an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigations will be focused on models for diseases similar to COVID-19 and HIV as archetypal cases. The improved understanding and models of epidemiological processes will be used to devise and analyze efficient preventive strategies with the goal of providing more reliable guidance for the general public and health-policy decision makers, saving lives and resources.<br/><br/>Traditionally, the dynamics of infectious diseases are studied on the basis of deterministic compartmental models, where the population is divided into large groups, and deterministic differential equations for the group sizes are employed to investigate disease dynamics. Classical examples are the deterministic SIR and SIS models. This is a strong simplification of reality that ignores to a large extent the heterogeneity in contact patterns and biomedically relevant attributes across the population as well as the stochastic nature of infection processes. Both have a decisive impact on the dynamics at the early stages of epidemic outbreaks and need to be incorporated to enable reliable predictions. Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods can sample more realistic stochastic agent-based dynamics, but cannot efficiently assess the preconditions leading to rare consequential events. The project will address this challenge with a new numerical technique that allows one to efficiently sample important but rare epidemic trajectories of realistic models under suitable constraints. The research will renew attention on the crucial role of rare events in the genesis of large outbreaks, including combinations of bottlenecks in contact networks and the stochastic nature of the disease dynamics. Risk-factor analysis based on the new method will provide answers to cutting-edge questions in disease diffusion concerning outbreak preconditions, information flow, and control strategies. This approach will open new avenues for research on the prevention and control of epidemics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Human Networks and Data Science program (HNDS) of the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response, continual learning is emerging as a promising paradigm to meet this demand. Distinct from other learning paradigms, continual learning emphasizes the ability to maintain performance on previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new information. It focuses on rapid adaptation to new environments by appropriately recalling past knowledge and actively seeking side information to accelerate learning and improve accuracy. However, current methods in continual learning are predominantly empirical and lack a clear theoretical foundation, limiting their wider application and hindering further progress. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a principled framework for continual learning, consisting of novel theoretical insights and practical algorithmic designs. The research outcomes will substantially advance our understanding of continual learning, enrich its algorithmic framework, and provide scalable algorithm packages. The outcomes will be integrated into machine learning courses at all levels, benefiting students across disciplines such as electrical engineering, statistics, and computer science.  The project will actively involve underrepresented students in STEM, synergizing research and education at undergraduate and graduate levels, and developing introductory materials for K-12 students through AI apprenticeship programs.<br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to pioneer a methodological framework of continual learning for autonomous machine learners navigating dynamic data environments. The framework addresses three essential facets of continual learning. First, it will establish mathematical foundations of continual learning and scalable online algorithms to recollect an evolving memory for fast adaptation and capability expansion. Second, it will develop methods to amplify learning efficiency from informative, even less reliable, pseudo labels. Lastly, it will develop approaches for expanding the predictive power with task-specific assistance from peer learners who possess cross-modal data. The developed foundations will lead to novel algorithms to empower intelligent engineering systems to learn more efficiently and effectively in an ever-changing world. The project will also offer deep insights into pivotal machine learning questions, such as understanding the fundamental trade-offs between adaptivity and forgetting in dynamic learning environments, gauging the maximal influences of minor yet jointly dependent data perturbations on modeling results, and quantifying a model's room for improvement when the underlying law of probability remains elusive. Furthermore, these developments are anticipated to have broader impacts, enabling resource-constrained machine learners to continually broaden their learning capabilities in complex practical applications, such as intelligent transportation systems and cellular performance management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our overarching vision is to simplify RFFE complexity and enable superior transceivers by developing chip-scale functionalities with smaller size, higher efficiency and more tunability. Among RFFE components, piezoelectric acoustic microsystems emerge as a key solution, boasting four orders of magnitude smaller sizes and lower losses than conventional electromagnetic (EM) counterparts.

Hence, overcoming longstanding challenges related to existing acoustic platforms and device designs in mm-wave spectrum is the primary objective of this proposal. The project's broader impacts encompass societal benefits through innovations in wireless technologies and their applications, alongside educational outreach initiatives aimed at inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers. Committed to STEM education, the project closely integrates research into undergraduate and graduate curricula, mentoring of students, and K-12 learning modules. The research will be closely integrated with undergraduate-level course of Microwave Engineering and graduate-level course of Microelectromechanical Systems. Dissemination through webinars events ensures wide-reaching impact, and industry collaboration fosters practical applications of research findings in RF acoustics. The technologies enabled by our project have the potential to significantly lower power consumption in the power-hungry RFFE, which presently accounts for approximately 30% of power usage in smartphones, contributing to longer battery life and lower energy consumption.<br/><br/>This CAREER project is dedicated to advancing miniature piezoelectric acoustic devices for efficient and adaptive RFFE signal processing, with a specific focus on the challenging mm-wave spectrum. The technical strategy comprises three interrelated research thrusts addressing critical gaps in current technologies: 1) development of mm-wave low-loss acoustic platforms: pioneering low-loss and wideband thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platforms leveraging higher-order Lamb modes to facilitate acoustic transducers and waveguides beyond 30 GHz; 2) RF acoustic traveling-wave signal processing components: designing compact traveling-wave RFFE signal processing elements using patterned sub-wavelength metallic structures and piezoelectric transducers on LN thin films, contributing to the miniaturization of acoustic devices whilst maintaining low loss; 3) adaptive piezoelectric device tuning: investigating an efficient tuning mechanism for adaptive piezoelectric devices, utilizing electrostatically actuated metallic beams near the piezoelectric surface, enhancing device performance, enabling applications in dynamic wireless environments. The proposed compact size and adaptivity of acoustic microsystems may drive further miniaturization of wireless transceiver hardware with lower power budget.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their ubiquity, ripples preserved in the geological record are invaluable to interpret past or remote climates, atmospheric conditions and fluvial regimes. In this context, understanding how ripples form is crucial to relate their size to environmental factors. According to conventional wisdom, decameter-scale dunes and decimeter-scale ripples on Earth emerge from clearly different processes related to wind motion and sand transport. However, recent experiments shattered this clean distinction by showing the emergence of an unexplained second type of wind ripple, somehow akin to water ripples and large ripples on Mars. The proposed investigation of this potentially ubiquitous new type of bedform can alter the interpretation of ripples in the field and the geological record, and shed light into some unexplored complexities of sediment transport. Broader impacts include the development of several public exhibits intended for K-12 students and educators, in collaboration with outreach experts at TAMU. The project will also provide research and educational opportunities for two early career principal investigators and undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This research will investigate the emergence of these new ?hydrodynamic? (also called ?drag?) ripples on Earth using a combination of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and grain-scale transport simulations. The goal is to uncover the physical mechanisms controlling the origin and scaling of meso-scale bedforms (ripples) on Earth, and by extension, on water and other planetary bodies such as Mars, Titan and Venus. The three objectives are: validate and calibrate Hanratty?s hydrodynamic model, estimate the transport saturation length, and explain the transition from ?impact? to ?hydrodynamic? ripples. The central hypotheses are that there is a hidden sub-scale modulation of the aeolian transport layer that can explain the new observations and that hydrodynamic-driven instabilities become less relevant at a large enough grain size, for which only ?impact? ripples are to be expected.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, they are expensive, limited in supply, and sometimes difficult to remove from the products. In this project, Dr. Guan will focus on cobalt, an inexpensive and earth-abundant metal, to study the reactivity of molecules bearing cobalt-hydrogen bonds, which are poorly understood, but are key intermediates in many cobalt-catalyzed reactions.

For example, one isoperimetric-type inequality gives the mathematical justification that a metal rod will have the strongest resistance to twisting forces if its cross-sections are circular. This project investigates several geometric questions related to isoperimetric and Sobolev-type inequalities, including the following: if one only has measurements of a given rod's resistance to twisting forces, how much geometric information can be recovered about the shape of the rod's cross-sections? Questions of this type have powerful and sometimes unexpected applications in other branches of mathematics. A fundamental part of the project is a two-pillared educational component. First, the Principal Investigator (PI) will organize a workshop for women in analysis at Carnegie Mellon University, integrating research and education through mini-courses, research talks, and opportunities for junior researchers.

Various scientific reports emphasize the critical need for decarbonization technologies such as carbon capture to mitigate CO2 emissions and combat climate change. However, conventional heat-based carbon capture systems face technical challenges that limit their utility, including high energy requirements and the thermal degradation of absorbent materials. Electrochemical carbon capture (ECC) processes are being developed as an alternative to thermal-based processes. ECC processes are advantageous because they can operate at moderate temperatures and are plug-and-play and modular. ECC processes are also more efficient than similar thermal processes, relying solely on electricity potentially sourced entirely from renewables. This project will develop an innovative ECC process that employs engineered soft interfaces for a scalable, modular, and environmentally sustainable method of CO2 separation. This approach advances carbon capture science and supports the National Science Foundation's mission to promote scientific progress and national health by directly addressing CO2 emission mitigation. The project's educational and outreach initiatives, embedded in the investigator?s Climate Learning Integration in Modern Education model, aim to inspire future STEM generations. These initiatives will be particularly impactful within underrepresented communities because they integrate cutting-edge research into the educational content through project-based learning, fostering a well-informed and environmentally conscious society.<br/><br/>The project aims to advance ECC by employing engineered soft interfaces at liquid-liquid interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions. This novel approach addresses current ECC process performance limitations, such as the reliance on costly ion-selective membranes and oxygen gas sensitivity. These engineered interfaces will be developed and optimized for enhanced CO2 separation performance and system energetics. State-of-the-art scanning electrochemical microscopy will assess the interface performance, ensuring precision and innovation in the research methodology. The broader implications of this work extend to various electrochemical applications, including electrochemical-based water treatment and energy storage. Furthermore, integrating this research with STEM education through novel educational modules offers an effective platform for knowledge dissemination and student engagement in climate change solutions. Specifically, undergraduate pre-service STEM teachers will participate in the research through project-based learning techniques, which can inform the development of their curricula. This comprehensive approach highlights the project's potential to significantly contribute to our scientific understanding of ECCs and their capabilities in combating climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recyclates have been unable to replace virgin plastics because of their poor mechanical performance. This leads to resource depletion, waste, and pollution challenges. Preliminary work suggests that altering the internal structure of recyclates, by introducing distinct, self-assembled phases within them, improves their mechanical performance. However, investigating the deformation and failure of these self-assembled structures, which is necessary to enable their wider adoption and use, is extremely challenging due to their complex nature. This award supports fundamental research to predict how deformation and failure occurs in recyclates through sophisticated experiments and artificial intelligence. The findings will enhance scientific understanding and foster the development of advanced, recycled materials that could benefit multiple U.S. industries, advance sustainability, and conserve national resources. In parallel, the education, outreach, and borader impact activities aim to shape a diverse and agile U.S. workforce by offering new engineering skills and improving career prospects of marginalized individuals, with emphasis on individuals reentering the workforce from incarceration. <br/><br/>This grant aims to support research that advances understanding of the deformation and failure of recyclates exhibiting self-assembled internal morphologies of improved strength and toughness through an integrated experimental and computational approach.

By exploiting the built-in energy potential present in immiscible polymer blends of heterogeneous recyclates, their internal architecture will be altered. This way, composites of enhanced mechanical properties with phase-separated, self-assembled three-dimensional morphologies, induced by thermophoresis, will be developed. The structure-property space of these recyclates will be explored and their complex failure and deformation will be investigated, while developing sophisticated experimental mechanics instrumentation to support such efforts.

The amount of nitrous oxide emitted from rivers is difficult to estimate due to a lack of knowledge of the conditions that favor its production. Nitrous oxide is produced in abundant but small zones where oxygen is not available. However, the size of these ?microzones? makes them extremely difficult to locate and measure. This project will investigate the formation of low oxygen microzones in controlled conditions that mimic river sediments. Experiments and numerical simulations will be used to determine how bacteria growing in the sediments regulate the formation of these microzones. Knowledge of how bacteria control the size, location, and duration of low oxygen microzones will provide key information needed to estimate river nitrous oxide emissions with greater certainty. This research will not only reveal the processes responsible for nitrous oxide emissions from riverbeds and inform the design of strategies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it will also improve understanding of how low oxygen microzones regulate contaminant transformation and nutrient cycling in groundwater. The research team will train future environmental engineers by mentoring postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Further, the team will lead activities to enhance public understanding of how shallow groundwater influences water quality in rivers, including a Groundwater Basics STEM summer program and field demonstrations for K-12 students and the public at a river restoration site.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine how nitrous oxide production is linked to the dynamics of anoxic microzone formation in river sediments.

Remarkable strides in the theory and application of this toolset over the past three decades, combined with a similarly impressive acceleration in computing capabilities, have helped proliferate the use of optimization software in science, engineering, business, and beyond. Yet, the commercial optimization solvers being utilized in practice often lack rigorous numerical guarantees which, largely unbeknownst to users, may cause them to return inconsistent results. Such outcomes can lead practitioners to draw incorrect conclusions about the problem or system being analyzed and ultimately lead to misguided and erroneous decisions. The rather unpredictable and non-negligible plausibility of these and other incorrect outcomes, which can be traced to the compounding and deleterious effects of roundoff errors, detracts from the implicit trust placed on optimization solvers, and it is specially concerning as these cyberinfrastructures are being widely employed on ever larger and more numerically complex problems. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will seek to establish the next generation of optimization solvers with robust numerical guarantees by integrating and building on a mature suite of algorithms for avoiding roundoff errors at low computational cost. The envisioned contributions will result in reliable, open-source optimization solvers that will be made available to academics, practitioners, and the public at large. In addition, the project will design and launch a recruitment and multi-tiered summer research internship program to increase underrepresented student engagement, build critical skills for succeeding in graduate study, and foster interdisciplinary learning communities.<br/><br/>This CAREER research project will develop rigorous theory and computational methods to enable the reliable, fail-proof solution of real-world linear programs and mixed integer programs, which is a pivotal guarantee beyond the reach of optimization solvers that work exclusively with finite-precision floating-point arithmetic. To that end, the planned activities will include transforming various inefficient subroutines based on exact rational arithmetic required to validate and/or repair optimization solver outputs, which remain the primary computational bottleneck of mixed-precision optimization solvers with numerical guarantees. The research activities will build on a suite of integer-preserving matrix factorization algorithms, which are primed to be integrated into these state-of-the-art solvers. In addition, the project will explore how to repurpose previous exact primal optimal solutions and exact dual feasible solutions to further enhance the capabilities of mixed-precision optimization solvers with numerical guarantees on numerically challenging problems. The associated activities will include deriving sparse matrix factorization updates, leveraging them to build novel local search methods, and implementing the resulting algorithms on open-source solvers. It is expected that the envisioned theoretical contributions will also have fundamental implications beyond the development of optimization software.<br/><br/>This CAREER award is jointly funded by the Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) Program of the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate and the Operations Engineering (OE) Program of the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) in the Engineering (ENG) Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The amount of nitrous oxide emitted from rivers is difficult to estimate due to a lack of knowledge of the conditions that favor its production. Nitrous oxide is produced in abundant but small zones where oxygen is not available. However, the size of these ?microzones? makes them extremely difficult to locate and measure. This project will investigate the formation of low oxygen microzones in controlled conditions that mimic river sediments. Experiments and numerical simulations will be used to determine how bacteria growing in the sediments regulate the formation of these microzones. Knowledge of how bacteria control the size, location, and duration of low oxygen microzones will provide key information needed to estimate river nitrous oxide emissions with greater certainty. This research will not only reveal the processes responsible for nitrous oxide emissions from riverbeds and inform the design of strategies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it will also improve understanding of how low oxygen microzones regulate contaminant transformation and nutrient cycling in groundwater. The research team will train future environmental engineers by mentoring postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Further, the team will lead activities to enhance public understanding of how shallow groundwater influences water quality in rivers, including a Groundwater Basics STEM summer program and field demonstrations for K-12 students and the public at a river restoration site.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine how nitrous oxide production is linked to the dynamics of anoxic microzone formation in river sediments.

However, controlling these robots is difficult and comes with the risk of robots falling. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in addressing the falling challenge by using computer simulations when teaching robots how to walk. However, the robot behaviors learned in simulation often underperform in the real world due to the difference between the simulation and the real physical robot. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project supports research that investigates a novel approach that simultaneously learns from both simulated and physical experiments. This novel approach in this project aims to leverage the advantage of simulations, such as scalability, while using the data from real robots. Ultimately, the project will maximize the potential of AI and robot learning algorithms to allow more capable and safer robots. Additionally, the project incorporates educational activities to engage students with real-world robot learning environments, fostering a broader understanding of robotics.<br/><br/>This project will investigate a novel class of learning algorithms, Learning from Multiverse (LfM), which concurrently learns from both large-scale, inexpensive physics-based simulation and expensive, real world ground-truths to bridge the well-known ?sim-to-real? gap in legged robots. The fundamental principle of the project involves seamless and continuous learning from both simulated and real experiences, as well as structured mathematical reasoning of experimental data. This approach differs from the majority of existing learning algorithms that rely solely on either simulation or real-world experience. This research involves the development of three main components: (i) autonomous and safe learning environments in the real world, (ii) novel robot learning algorithms that simultaneously leverage simulation and reality, and (iii) explainable artificial intelligence to understand hardware experiments.

Of those with MCI, up to 15 percent develop dementia down the line. Unfortunately, there is an increased shortage of healthcare workers, and the cost of at-home nursing care is prohibitive. To meet this challenge, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to democratize interactive robot learning to enable care partners (e.g., spouses, children, nurses) to program and personalize a robot's behavior through intuitive modes of interaction to assist the care member (i.e., person with MCI) with activities of daily living. Robot learning is achieved using Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which is about computational methods and interfaces to enable end-users to teach robots new skills through interaction (e.g., skill demonstration). Traditional robotics deployments typically rely on a large number of experts and create robots that are expensive and not easily adapted. Instead, LfD offers a scalable alternative by leveraging efficient algorithms and interactions with non-expert end users. Despite its potential, and decades of research, LfD has not been deployed broadly, in part because these systems do not provide the care partner end-users with insights into the robot's understanding of the world or how the users can be better teachers. This award seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional robotics (such as cost and scale) and modern robot learning approaches (the fact that they are relegated to the laboratory) by enabling robot learning to be accessible and scalable to support aging in place for persons with MCI. The eventual goal is to have a robot that can be used in the home of someone with MCI to help them with their daily tasks, and that the robot can be easily programmed by someone who does not have specific technical training.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the research team will develop new LfD algorithms and interfaces in partnership with collaborators at the Cognitive Empowerment Program at Emory University, members of the MCI community, clinicians, and researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in a transdisciplinary research effort. With the oversight and input from MCI focus groups, the research team will collaboratively execute three research thrusts. First, the team will conduct transdisciplinary research to collect and open-source a first-of-its-kind, multimodal, longitudinal dataset from care partners interacting with a robot with the goal of programming it via LfD to carry out assistive tasks for care members. Second, the team will formulate novel, explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques enabling users to gain a ?theory of mind? of the robot, specifically to foster users gaining insight into the behavior of the robot while learning to collaborate via mixed-initiative LfD interactions. Third, the team will develop novel, peer-teaching LfD algorithms that enables the robot learner to develop a theory of mind about an LfD teacher (i.e. the care partner alongside the person with MCI), leverage that insight to tutor a human teacher, and provide explicit feedback for how the teacher can provide better instruction to the robot. The success of the techniques developed will be based upon improving the robot?s performance at specific tasks, reducing the amount of time required for the user to train the robot, and improving user experience in terms of workload, stress, and perceived usability of the robot. The outcome of this research will be open-source datasets, interfaces, and roadmaps guiding researchers in democratizing robots, transitioning LfD from the laboratory to the real world. Finally, the research team will also develop a new educational outreach program in partnership with high school educators to integrate robotics into their classrooms in underserved communities in Georgia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project also combines material research with educational and outreach activities that aim to increase learning opportunities for students of all ages, inside and outside the traditional classroom. The investigators and students involved in this project participate in outreach activities organized either in-house or at local schools to increase exposure of K-12 students and the general public to modern scientific topics in materials science in a fun, project-oriented environment. Lesson plans are designed and experimental demonstrations of basic optical properties of matter are built for the middle-school summer camp ?Physics Inside Out? at Purdue. To maximize impact at the high-school level, the activities engage teachers in summer research. In particular, the teachers are developing inquiry-based lesson plans incorporating concepts related to quantum science into the high-school curriculum. The researchers also design hands-on activities with take-home materials for the annual meeting of the Hoosier Association of Science Teachers.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The principal objective of this project is to establish wurtzite ScAlN as a viable photonic platform for novel infrared applications.  This project exploits the unique native properties of ferroelectric ScAlN and further manipulates them within designed structures to facilitate utilization of the near-infrared range of the spectrum. In particular, optical transitions between quantized states in the conduction band of near lattice-matched ScAlN/GaN heterostructures are utilized to expand device capabilities to generate, detect, and modulate infrared light. III-nitride semiconductors have unique electronic properties that make them suitable for advancing the functionality of semiconductor devices into spectral ranges currently inaccessible with other material systems. The innovative approach employs the emergent photonic material Sc-Al-nitride to mitigate strain-related issues that have impeded progress of nitride photonics into the infrared in the past. The research effort is interdisciplinary and involves material design and growth, structural characterization, and optical characterization. ScAlN/GaN heterostructures are designed using extensive band-structure calculations. To achieve maximum material purity and monolayer-control of the atomic structure, the Sc-containing materials are grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on high quality quasi-bulk GaN substrates. A central task is to identify the epitaxial growth conditions that satisfy the most stringent requirements imposed by near-infrared optical processes. To correlate microstructure with optical and electronic properties, the structure of the semiconductor materials is comprehensively characterized with high-resolution x-ray diffraction, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, and atom-probe tomography. The band structure of the materials is probed experimentally with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and photoluminescence. The research contributes to the fundamental understanding of the physics of intersubband optical transitions and nonlinear optical processes. These infrared materials are expected to immediately enable emitters and photodetectors with functionality unmatched by current technologies (wider spectral range, higher speeds, and better temperature performance). They are also ideal candidates for photonic integrated circuits as well as monolithic integration with Si electronics. Successful second-harmonic generation on chip opens avenues for other nonlinear processes such as difference frequency generation and parametric down-conversion. Moreover, the novel Sc-containing semiconductors are beneficial for other applications in electronic (e.g. high-electron mobility transistors), ultraviolet, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, and plasmonic devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While this technology is very attractive, maintaining stability of Na-O2 batteries is a significant challenge. In the present project, PIs Nikolla and Greeley seek to alleviate this issue by developing a combined experimental/theoretical approach to advance understanding of the deactivation mechanisms of Na-O2 cells driven by changes at the cathode/electrolyte interface, with the goal of improving cell cyclability.  The research plan will involve: (i) determining the factors that govern deactivation and byproduct formation, both as a function of electrochemical potential and under resting conditions (no applied current), in Na-O2 batteries, (ii) elucidating the effect of incorporating oxide electrocatalysts to tune the product formation at the cathode of Na-O2 battery cells, so as to minimize cell deactivation, and (iii) developing a general framework to guide the design of cathode/electrolyte interfaces that result in stable cycling of Na-O2 batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technique offers the opportunity to construct and repair parts in layers using both powder and wire feedstocks. Wire feedstocks necessitate high laser energy for melting and may form unstable melt pools resulting in reduced processability. Conversely, powder particles, being smaller and possessing a higher surface area, are easier to melt and fuse with reduced instability. This research project integrates the advantages of both powder and wire deposition ? powder's improved processability and wire's higher deposition rate ? to establish a new manufacturing paradigm of co-axial wire feed-powder feed laser directed energy deposition. The resulting knowledge enables wider adoption of wire-based additive manufacturing, holding the potential to fabricate sound large-scale parts for power generation, propulsion, and space exploration at reduced cost and material waste. Thus, the research augments U.S. manufacturing, competitiveness, and economy. Furthermore, this research is complemented by educational and outreach initiatives that empower future engineers and scientists to achieve professional excellence while prioritizing personal well-being. The project provides comprehensive professional and leadership training, facilitates strategic networking opportunities, and assists individuals in making informed career choices.<br/><br/>The specific goal of this research is to unveil the fundamental mechanisms governing the relationships between processing, microstructure, and properties in co-axial wire feed-powder feed laser directed energy deposition (DED) of metals. The fundamental differences in parts created by DED using wire or powder feedstocks under as-built conditions are laser-material interactions, melting and solidification phenomena, and the overall bulk behavior. Consequently, the research objectives of this project encompass: (i) comparing deposit formations in the co-axial wire feed-powder feed process with singular powder and wire feed processes; (ii) assessing the evolution of melt pools and quantifying crucial microstructural characteristics; and (iii) establishing correlations between tensile strengthening mechanisms and a spectrum of varying wire-to-powder feed ratios. By pursuing these research objectives, the project aims to address fundamental questions, including: (i) the impact of powder addition on the processability of wire DED such as reduction in Rayleigh-Plateau melt instabilities; (ii) the specific role played by powder particles in influencing the shape of melt pools and the development of solidification microstructures; and (iii) the variations in individual tensile strengthening mechanisms due to powder incorporation.

Given the ongoing disappearance of tropical forests, many pinhole borers may already be extinct. This project will summarize what is known about these beetles and their symbiotic fungi while generating new data about them using modern DNA sequencing and microscopy technologies. Because the lack of taxonomists working on pinhole borers and their symbiotic fungi is a biosecurity gap for the U.S ? both the beetles and the fungi can become pests ? this project will train graduate and undergraduate students as the next generation of entomologists and mycologists. Outreach goals include the broad dissemination of accurate information about wood borers through curating information on Wikipedia, and a specific campaign to encourage homeowners in the United States to retain dead wood on their properties as a refuge of biodiversity in urban landscapes.<br/><br/>This project will undertake a simultaneous revision of two symbiont groups that are charismatic, important, and sometimes pestiferous, but suffer from the typical taxonomic impediments. The main goals of the project are to identify, classify and describe the pinhole borer beetles and their symbiotic fungi, in addition to documenting the many interactions between these two groups and the trees in which they live. Attaining these aims are enabled by phylogenetically analyzing DNA sequence data from thousands of individuals and collecting new morphological data using photographs and microscopy to identify beetle-fungus interactions.

While global reductions in CO2 emissions are necessary, CO2 emissions from cement production have increased 1.5% per year from 2015-2021. Two thirds of the global increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in 2019 were attributed to cement production. Improving the durability of new concrete structures is a critical strategy for reducing GHG emissions. Although proper air entrainment is critical for concrete frost durability, conventional air entrainment methods are often ineffective in modern-day mixes. As concrete technology continues to develop at a rapid rate, and as novel alternatives to traditional concrete emerge, a more robust air entrainment solution is needed; one that can overcome known adverse interactions and can be adapted for increasingly complex systems. This work will explore the hypothesis that Pickering stabilization can be used instead of/in addition to current air entrainment approaches for exceptional bubble stability and size control, accelerating adoption of low-carbon building materials without sacrificing their long-term durability and thus sustainability. This research will be integrated into a K-12 education/outreach (EO) program to enrich research, education, and outreach experiences simultaneously. The goal of the EO plan is to develop a diverse, research-literate workforce that can leverage their unique experiences and perspectives to introduce creative, impactful solutions for change. This work will develop the workforce by building a diverse pipeline through a research-integrated K-12 education and outreach program, an undergraduate/graduate training program focused on best practice in inclusive pedagogy and community building, and an annual concrete career week that will introduce grade 8-12 students to hands-on research experience from the work and 5 other concrete career options via facility tours with industry professionals.<br/><br/>The project will use molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and experiments to test the hypothesis and develop a fundamental model to describe the mechanisms controlling Pickering stabilization of air bubbles in cementitious systems. The main goal of the research-education activities is to develop a strong integrated program focused on developing air-entrainment solutions via Pickering stabilization, while advancing the STEM workforce in research literacy, diversity, and inclusion.

The enhanced properties increase the suitability of using liquid metal pastes for extrusion-based three-dimensional (3D) printing and lead to new applications in soft robotics and stretchable electronics, which contribute to the economic and societal advancement of U.S. manufacturing. The solid particle-liquid metal mixtures are suitable materials for additive manufacturing of a variety of applications such as control systems, soft matter actuators, and distributed sensors. The research is complemented by new learning modules that seek to actively engage students across the educational spectrum by integrating entrepreneurial literacy with research-based activities focused on additive manufacturing, materials processing, and digital modeling. These modules are delivered through local programs and via a mobile science lab to schools and teachers across Nebraska and elsewhere to enhance classroom learning for ethnically, geographically, and socio-economically diverse students. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to establish a universal strategy for incorporating solid particle additives into liquid metals to enhance their physical and rheological properties without compromising their fluidic attributes. Typically, the solid particle additive is a metal such as nickel, tungsten, or copper and the liquid metal is gallium or its compounds. The high reactivity and cohesive energy of gallium-based liquid metals offer challenges at the solid-liquid interface, which are overcome through an interfacial engineering approach where an intermediate layer is introduced to concurrently act as a corrosion barrier and wetting agent.

A critical consideration when designing longitudinal studies is a power analysis that outlines the sample sizes needed to ensure a high probability of detecting important effects of interest. However, there are no guidelines or tutorials to help applied researchers conduct such power analyses. In addition, researchers usually plan their longitudinal studies under budget constraints and there is a lack of literature providing methods of calculating optimal sample sizes under such constraints. The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive statistical framework, software tools, illustrative examples, and training materials for the optimal design of longitudinal studies in STEM education. Specifically, the statistical theory, tools, and training developed by this work will be broadly applicable to longitudinal designs for STEM education programs, and other social programs in health science, psychology, and public policy. This project contributes to STEM education by estimating design parameters for outcomes commonly used in STEM education and illustrating design and analysis methods using data from prior longitudinal studies of STEM education programs.<br/><br/>This project is designed to achieve four integrated research and education goals.  First, the investigator will develop a statistical framework to guide the power analysis and optimal sample size planning for longitudinal experimental and quasi-experimental studies in STEM education using all currently available methods, and then compare their results to help researchers select the most appropriate design and analytic methods for their longitudinal studies. Next, the project will develop empirical estimates of the design parameters using data from ongoing and prior longitudinal studies with outcomes commonly used in STEM education.  The research will execute the formulas in two new tools (i.e., PowerUpR-Growth and an R Shiny App) and develop accompanying software documentation.  Finally, this project will develop illustrative examples, training materials, and workshops on the design and analysis of longitudinal STEM education programs. The statistical framework and tools have the potential to provide a more practical and flexible way to identify more efficient longitudinal designs and assist researchers in evaluating the long-term effects of their STEM education programs. The guidelines, examples, training materials, and workshops will be made publicly and freely accessible to diverse and broad groups of students, researchers, and practitioners across STEM education areas and disciplines.  <br/><br/>This is a Faculty Early Career Development Program project responsive to a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education.

The project aims to: (1) enhance powder-spreading dynamics through multimodal particles and a hybrid powder dispenser, and (2) improve laser-powder interaction and microstructure control. If successful, the project outcomes may expand material choices, making production more cost-effective and sustainable across various AM processes such as binder jetting and laser/electron beam powder bed fusion. The project provides research opportunities to a diverse pool of undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups and veterans. Through hands-on research experiences, outreach activities, and the creation of video animations, the project will engage underrepresented communities and high school students in the field of metal additive manufacturing. <br/><br/>The CAREER research project aims to address three fundamental research problems: (1) Non-spherical powder characteristics, such as morphology and size, impact powder-powder interactions, potentially leading to lower packing density and non-uniform powder beds. This will be addressed by developing a deposition mechanism using multimodal powder sizes and an innovative non-contact electrostatic powder spreader. (2) Laser-powder interaction is affected by characteristics such as shape, morphology, and size distribution. The shift in the stable/unstable keyhole mode due to the shadowing effect of non-spherical powder at higher laser scan speeds will influence the process map, and mechanical interlocking of particles. Comprehensive investigations into laser-powder interactions will be undertaken, using in-situ observations such as synchrotron X-ray imaging and multi-physics modeling. This approach aims to unravel the underlying physics and formulate processing strategies to effectively address anticipated defects. (3) Locally reduced cooling rates from the shadowing effect influence solidification, impacting microstructure and resultant mechanical properties. This will be addressed by adjusting process parameters and applying post-heat treatments, such as hot isostatic pressing, which is expected to achieve equiaxed grain structures for improved strength and ductility comparable to wrought alloys.

However, the existing computational prediction methods typically perform as standalone applications, and their use in conjunction with other protein modeling tools cannot be automated. To address these gaps, this work develops an efficient framework for the accurate placement of membrane proteins in cell membranes while enabling integration with other computational tools frequently used to design or assess membrane protein structure in a modular manner. This approach facilitates the modeling of proteins and peptides with potential therapeutic use, including developing antimicrobial peptides and proteins specifically designed to assume functions and the investigation of protein variants that cause various diseases. <br/><br/>This work aims to develop computational tools for modeling protein binding to membranes that can be used in multiple ways, using the Rosetta suite as a platform.

The project will expand the University of Cincinnati?s transdisciplinary innovation hub to student populations across three states (Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana), which will increase student participation from two local high schools and one University-associated internship site to 10 schools and four internship sites at the University of Cincinnati, Bowling Green State University, University of Akron, and Ohio University. Scaling within each state will extend transdisciplinary instruction and learning to different student and teacher populations both rural and urban with underrepresented and underserved populations, and to new regions within a state-wide educational system. The modern STEM workforce needs diverse, cross-trained professionals with both strength in their discipline and the ability to address complex scientific problems. To meet the needs of the scientific and technological workforce, the project will educate students and train teachers in concepts that bridge biology, technology, and engineering disciplines, demonstrating the interrelatedness between science and engineering using innovative technological advances. Participating high school students will study the behavior of biological organisms and learn how to apply animal behavior to the design of their own autonomous robots (animal-robot sensorimotor systems). Student interns will work with near-peer undergraduate and graduate student researchers and faculty mentors to actively engage in ongoing research in biology and/or engineering laboratories where they will participate in the design and execution of experiments and the collection, management, and analysis of collected data. The project connects students and teachers with locally-relevant science, engineering, and technology industry partners to see how science and engineering are applied to solve critical problems for the benefit of society. In parallel, the project will create school-to-university internship sites that connect the transdisciplinary knowledge gained by students with real-world experience. Project activities will provide students with conceptual knowledge, practical research skills, and awareness of career pathways in the biological sciences and robotics industries. <br/><br/>With the introduction of the curriculum across states, researchers will test the robustness and replication of the intervention across state boundaries that differ in their educational standards. Researchers will study the impacts of the transdisciplinary curriculum and research internships on students? learning, interest, and self-efficacy in STEM, and teachers? implementation of a transdisciplinary curriculum in ways that are responsive to local school contexts. Investigators will study, (1) What is the impact of transdisciplinary learning and real-world application via research internships on students? scientific inquiry practices?, (2) What is the impact of transdisciplinary learning and real-world application on students? interest and self-efficacy in STEM?, and (3) What changes do teachers make in how they teach through a transdisciplinary curriculum in ways that are responsive to their local school contexts? Researchers will use written science inquiry assessments and surveys of students? STEM interest and self-efficacy to document the impact of the transdisciplinary curriculum on student outcomes through a multilevel design to account for variation among teachers, classrooms, and schools. Additionally, the project will provide a scaled model of how science, technology, and engineering practices can be cultivated through culturally responsive teaching, and evidence of how teachers learn how to implement transdisciplinary learning. This project will have broader impacts by documenting how transdisciplinary learning can impact students? interest and self-efficacy in STEM, informing the design of future interventions to incorporate more features of transdisciplinary practice. Findings will impact transdisciplinary education research and practice in areas of teacher practice, teacher preparation, and professional development.

These materials host several novel and highly tunable states of matter, each with transformative potential across different science and technology sectors. Modeling these systems is incredibly challenging, however, and often requires the development and use of advanced computational methods. This project focuses on performing state-of-the-art numerical simulations of quantum materials where the electrons interact strongly with the motion of the atoms. While these interactions are believed to play a key role in different families of quantum materials, previous numerical studies have often concentrated on oversimplified models with unrealistic parameters primarily for various technical reasons. This aspect has generally prevented the scientific community from obtaining definitive answers to how these interactions influence the properties of different materials. The PI?s team will leverage new simulation capabilities to perform detailed simulations of different quantum materials while including realistic descriptions of the interactions between the electrons and lattice of atoms that form the material. The team will also provide predictions for various spectroscopic measurements to guide future experiments on these materials. Combined, this project will help identify organizing principles for quantum materials and facilitate their use in future scientific and technological applications. <br/><br/>This project will also broaden participation in computational science and provide training in cutting-edge computational methods to enhance the scientific workforce. For example, the PI?s team will develop new training materials and open-source codes for performing numerical simulations of quantum materials, which will be disseminated in partnership with the University of Tennessee?s Center for Advanced Materials & Manufacturing, an NSF MRSEC center. Finally, the PI will continue existing efforts aimed at increasing opportunities for underrepresented minorities in physics through partnerships with the APS Bridge and Nuclear Physics in Eastern Tennessee programs.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>Understanding the properties of strongly correlated quantum materials is a forefront challenge for the scientific community. These materials often host strong electron-electron and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, which produce correlated electron liquids that defy theoretical descriptions based on single-particle theories. Modeling their behavior often requires nonperturbative numerical methods; however, addressing realistic e-ph interactions remains as a key challenge. This project addresses this problem by applying state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods to study broad classes of models for quantum materials hosting strong e-ph interactions, leveraging a new open-source implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) algorithm developed by the PI?s group. This code can simulate a broad class of Hamiltonians and uses hybrid Monte Carlo methods to sample the phonon fields efficiently and overcome the long autocorrelation times typically associated with these simulations. The PI and his team will use these capabilities to perform numerically exact simulations of models beyond the canonical Holstein model with physically realistic descriptions of the phonon subsystem. Specifically, they will study how the e-ph coupling influences the emergent properties of materials ranging from unconventional superconductors to kagome metals to graphene-derived systems. They will also predict spectroscopic measurements on such systems to guide experimental studies and provide crucial validation of their results. A particular focus for this project is on generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like e-ph interactions, where the atomic motion couples the electron?s kinetic energy via a modulation of the overlap integral. This interaction has been linked to novel phenomena ranging from mobile (bi)polarons, high-temperature superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, novel charge or bond orders, and topological states of matter. <br/><br/>This project will also broaden participation in computational science and provide training in cutting-edge computational methods to enhance the scientific workforce.

In response to a stimulus (such as temperature), these polymers can be repeatedly re-shaped without re-molding and re-used prior to the product?s end-of-life. Re-shapable polymers are also useful for soft robotics applications as they enable programming of the material motions via the use of a multi-material approach. The challenges are, however, to create materials with maximized ability for shape changes while controlling the morphing temperature and the materials? self-healing characteristics. This project will take advantage of the capability of dynamic covalent bonds to dissociate and re-form, and the temperature-sensitivity of this process, to support controllable material shape morphing. The project will explore the effects of chemical substitutions at a dynamic bond and other molecular parameters of polymer materials (such as polymer chemical identity, number of dynamic bonds, etc.) on material functionality. Advanced instrumental techniques will be used to study the role of molecular motion in the material morphing and self-healing properties. The project will create a fertile training ground for participating graduate, undergraduate and high-school students. The PI will work with undergraduate students to provide research experiences and will be engaged in diversity-enhancing and outreach activities with the goal of encouraging female and minority students to pursue studies in materials science and careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/><br/>PART II: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The ability to make re-processable, re-shapable polymer materials can transform the future of commodity polymers and afford novel products for advanced biomedical and soft robotics applications. This project will study dynamic covalent polymer networks based on the maleimide-furan Diels-Alder (DA) reaction and aim to uncover the main underlying principles of developing materials with desired thermomechanical and shape-morphing characteristics. The focus will be on understanding how molecular and structural characteristics of the network determine the materials? thermal, self-healing and shape-morphing properties. While the current DA polymer (DAP) materials made with 2-substituted furans (2-DAPs) suffer from low thermal stability, aging of their self-healing properties, and insufficient control of shape morphing, this project will address these challenges and develop a new family of DAP materials with practical thermal stability, self-healing and shape-morphing characteristics. This will be achieved by introducing stronger DA crosslinks (controlled by substitution in the furan ring) and understanding of the relationships between molecular parameters of the network (chain rigidity, length of the polymer strands, presence of entanglements), molecular motions and macroscopic viscoelastic properties of DAP materials. The project will involve synthesis of DAP networks using 3-substituted aminofurans (3-DAPs) with improved temperature resistivity, studies of stereochemistry and thermodynamics of DA junctions using DSC, FTIR, and NMR techniques, and exploration of the contributions of entanglements in material thermomechanical properties and self-healing properties using neutron reflectometry (NR) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching techniques. The above studies will serve as a foundation for creating shape-morphing DAP constructs with programmable morphing of their permanent shape via the mechanism of network plasticity. The main outcome of the project will be the development of the knowledge relating molecular parameters, stereochemistry of DA crosslinks, molecular diffusivity within DAP networks, and the resultant material self-healing and shape morphing characteristics. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the US has experienced a worrying increase in maternal mortality over the last two decades, resulting in the US reaching the highest rate among developed countries. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication related to high blood pressure. Each year, preeclampsia afflicts 8-10% of US pregnancies and can lead to maternal and/or neonatal death unless it is detected and treated in early stages of the pregnancy. It remains a challenge to identify women at higher risk of preeclampsia, as several factors, notably age, race, and the history of pre-pregnancy diseases, can contribute to developing the condition. This project will build innovative technologies to allow computers to understand and predict the likelihood of a woman developing preeclampsia during pregnancy, particularly among women from minority racial groups. Building such a system requires massive data, ranging from demographic to individual health records, to train the computers to predict preeclampsia. The main novelty of this project is in its capacity to learn from clinical data that are often imperfect, suffering from missing or incomplete records with possibly very little information on preeclampsia cases, and to remain fair toward subpopulations of various racial groups, including Native Americans, when predicting the risk of preeclampsia. The technologies developed in this project will also have the potential to help build tools that can help in early detection of other diseases. <br/><br/>This project investigates developing novel machine learning (ML)-based clinical decision aid tools for early detection of preeclampsia (PE). The main novelty of this project is in its capacity to effectively address several issues specific to learning from PE datasets that, if not addressed, continue to impede the clinical implementation of ML-based early detection of PE: (Challenge I) PE datasets often face inherent class imbalance; (Challenge II) Constructing reliable ML models for early PE detection necessitates mining large and diverse datasets, such as electronic health records, posing a significant challenge to the scalability of existing ML models; and (Challenge III) PE disproportionately affects certain racial groups, notably American Indian/Native American women, turning the fairness of such ML models into an ethical concern due to these disparities, and posing a challenge in adopting ML for disease detection. In response to these challenges, the investigator will (1) develop a new class of parameter-free classifiers to effectively address the bias resulting from class imbalance, thus eliminating the need for computationally expensive hyperparameter tuning, a common issue with cost-sensitive learning models for class imbalance; (2) develop a novel scalable classification method for learning from large-scale PE datasets through formulating the learning task as a sequential decision-making process, guiding data sampling in classification; and (3) develop a class of fair classifiers based on tractable optimization models that balance fairness and accuracy as well as novel performance-fairness metrics to simultaneously measure fairness and accuracy for imbalanced data. The investigator further studies adapting the fair ML model for online learning settings within a novel scalable framework that can handle massive data. Successful implementation of the proposed ML-based PE detection models will enhance identification of pregnant women at a high risk of preeclampsia, while reducing racial biases in relevant maternal health management systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though these soils account for only 2% of soil globally, they have a disproportionately large impact on water quantity and quality due to their shrink-swell properties, which lead to the formation of cracks that in turn strongly influence key hydrologic processes including water and contaminant transport, infiltration, runoff, and plant water use. Currently, there are no ways of predicting the cracking behavior of these soils or including the effects of these cracks in model simulations. The goal of this research is to improve our ability to measure and predict crack formation in shrink-swell soils, with the ultimate goal of improving models of water flow in soils. This will allow us to better manage and predict the movement of water and pollutants within the environment. In addition, the project will include training opportunities for K-12 teachers to learn about soil science activities and lessons, with the goal of attracting students to the field at a young age.<br/><br/>To date, the dynamic physical properties of shrink-swell soils have not been adequately quantified beyond individual sites. Further, theoretical models describing the soil water content-bulk density relationship depend on empirical parameters that lack physical meaning. To address this gap, this project will integrate multiple proven, non-invasive geophysical measurement types at several locations to allow for the accurate field-scale quantification of the soil water content-bulk density relationship. The goal of the proposed research is to improve understanding of and ability to quantify dynamic properties of shrink-swell soils at the field scale by providing a physically-based, non-site-specific representation of the soil water content-bulk density relationship. This objective will be reached using the following objectives: 1) Quantify the relationship between soil moisture and bulk density at the field scale in shrink-swell soils at multiple sites, 2) Quantify the number and size of soil cracks based on surface and subsurface imagery, and 3) Produce field-scale estimates of effective soil hydraulic parameters for characterizing soil shrinkage, swelling, and crack development. The educational objectives of the proposed work are to 1) Broaden participation in soil and Earth sciences by hosting multiple train-the-trainer soil science education workshops for K-12 educators, and 2) incorporate project findings into an existing open-source introductory soil physics textbook. This research will provide a physically-based theoretical model of the soil water content-bulk density relationship at the field scale and lay a foundation for the integration of that model into existing numerical models.

Although Na-O2 batteries are promising, limited long-term stability, and lack of fundamental, molecular-level understanding of the mechanisms that govern durability, have impeded progress. The PIs seek to address this challenge by combining experimental and theoretical studies. The insights from the work will lead to a general framework that can guide the design of the cathode/electrolyte interfaces to enable stable cycling of discharge products for Na-O2 batteries. Also, the PIs will partner with local K-12 students in the Metro Detroit area and West Lafayette, IN to involve economically disadvantaged students in summer research internships and student research exchanges. <br/><br/>Aprotic Na-O2 batteries have gained significant attention as viable alternatives to commercial Li-ion batteries. Owing to their high theoretical energy densities and reversible redox chemistries, Na-O2 batteries offer opportunities to achieve high discharge capacities and low charge overpotentials by controlling the nature of discharged products at the cathode. While this technology is very attractive, maintaining stability of Na-O2 batteries is a significant challenge. In the present project, PIs Nikolla and Greeley seek to alleviate this issue by developing a combined experimental/theoretical approach to advance understanding of the deactivation mechanisms of Na-O2 cells driven by changes at the cathode/electrolyte interface, with the goal of improving cell cyclability.  The research plan will involve: (i) determining the factors that govern deactivation and byproduct formation, both as a function of electrochemical potential and under resting conditions (no applied current), in Na-O2 batteries, (ii) elucidating the effect of incorporating oxide electrocatalysts to tune the product formation at the cathode of Na-O2 battery cells, so as to minimize cell deactivation, and (iii) developing a general framework to guide the design of cathode/electrolyte interfaces that result in stable cycling of Na-O2 batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This resource recovery approach is driven by national and global challenges related to population growth, climate change, and resource scarcity. Rural agricultural regions are prime locations for resource recovery because they are typically abundant in organic waste streams such as animal manure and agricultural crop residues while also requiring fertilizer for crop production. Rural agricultural regions may generate so much organic waste that excess waste is shipped to other watersheds. Therefore, these regions could receive increased economic benefits and reduced environmental impacts if the excess waste was not shipped out and instead used as a feedstock for the recovery of energy and nutrients. However, such rural regions face challenges in implementing resource recovery technologies due to limited technical and economic resources, unavailable or inaccessible data, and lack of contextual policy support. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this CAREER project is to promote sustainable, context-sensitive resource recovery in rural regions. Successful completion of research and educational objectives on the topics of data science, life cycle modeling, policy, and stakeholder engagement will provide a data-driven, cost-effective framework to bridge the gap between research and implementation of resource recovery technologies in rural agricultural regions. Stakeholder engagement and policy dissemination will facilitate increased adoption of best practices for organic waste management.<br/><br/>Current organic waste management practices such as landfilling and incineration negatively impact the environment by emitting greenhouse gases, harmful contaminants, and pathogens. However, recovery of resources such as energy and nutrients from organic waste can reduce such negative impacts. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop, apply, and assess a data-driven framework that integrates data science, life cycle modeling, and policy analysis to promote sustainable, context-sensitive resource recovery in rural agricultural regions. The recent emergence of powerful data science tools can effectively predict outcomes such as recovery efficiency, economic impacts, and environmental impacts. While larger wastewater utilities are beginning to use data science methods to improve treatment efficiency and reduce chemical and energy use, the use of data science in rural organic waste management is unexplored. Therefore, an opportunity exists to utilize data science tools with accessible datasets and generalized methods integrated with stakeholder engagement and contextual policy support. This strategy can provide a data-driven, cost-effective framework to bridge the gap between research and implementation of resource recovery technologies in rural farming regions. Implementation of this framework could allow rural farming regions nationally and internationally to strategically utilize their organic waste to best reflect their environmental, economic, social, political, and geographical context. The long-term educational goal is to increase the ?impact competencies? in civil engineering students by providing training and practice on sustainable development, data science, and policy. In pursuit of this, the educational objectives of this proposal include integrating undergraduate and graduate learning modules and creating a pathway within the civil engineering MS curriculum that includes one year of stateside community-engaged service integrated with a research thesis. Broader impacts of the educational plan result from stakeholder engagement with community partners in undergraduate and graduate courses and providing needed yet underrepresented skills in data science and policy to undergraduate students that they can use to transition to the marketplace or graduate school.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This presents challenges for on-device AI to continually learn new knowledge without forgetting prior learnt knowledge. To address this, continual learning (CL) aims to build AI models that are incrementally updated over a sequence of tasks without forgetting. However, when CL applications are deployed on resource-limited edge devices, learning efficiency can suffer, and this is rarely explored in prior work. This project seeks to build an on-device CL framework that will allow continual on-device learning based on local data without forgetting prior learnt knowledge, while enhancing the efficiency of compute, memory, and data use. Specifically, the project will pursue (1) an efficient on-device CL framework that avoids catastrophic forgetting; and (2) extensions that address practical deployment requirements, including limited training data availability and limited labeling in large datasets. Exploring these two cases enhances the applicability of the proposed approach.<br/><br/>This project promotes personalized, intelligent user experiences powered by AI, while preserving data privacy and adapting to new information in real-time. It will allow AI models to learn from new data incrementally, reducing the need for large, centralized datasets, thereby promoting privacy.

A major obstacle is that the high variability inherent in civil structures causes laboratory-developed algorithms to struggle without expert guidance. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research to address this issue. This work introduces an approach to translating raw, multi-source sensor data into functional analytical models which realistically represent the as-built structural behavior. Three data types are considered: spatial data from images and laser scanning, non-destructive evaluation data such as ground penetrating radar, and response data from accelerometers and strain gages. In addition, the methodology introduces the use of a structural ontology (a graphical map of structural component relationships) as a way to encode domain knowledge in a way a computer can understand. This creates a link between specialized sensor measurements and broader functional models, with reduced input from an engineer. It is envisioned that the results of the research would support various future applications in infrastructure assessment, including the creation of digital twins. These anchor sensor data to an analytical model of the structure, enabling practicing engineers to interpret physical behavior more effectively, run simulations, and facilitating asset management decision. <br/><br/>The technical approach of this work addresses three open research problems: (1) model-oriented identification of structural components from spatial and non-destructive evaluation data, (2) reasoning on encoded domain knowledge to establish structural component relationships, (3) fusing response data with component information to represent as-built behavior. To address (1) and (2), the framework uniquely combines a structural engineering ontology (domain knowledge) and probabilistic graphical models (reasoning) using a machine learning framework. It begins by identifying individual structural components (e.g. beams, reinforcement) in the data, then reasoning on their relationships and functions in 3D space. Thus, the diverse and noisy information obtained from computer vision techniques (e.g., component types, geometry) can be synthesized into a candidate structure that makes contextual sense. To address (3), candidate structures are combined with response data (accelerations, strains) via system identification techniques to infer unobservable properties such as boundary conditions, material properties, and connection stiffnesses.  The final output is a calibrated model capable of analysis through standard tools like finite elements. In parallel, this work integrates research products into core engineering courses. Students will interact directly with the data, learning how create structural models of real-world structures while learning about AI and its applications in civil engineering. The structural ontology will be leveraged an interactive learning guide, allowing students to explore structural relationships as they work on a problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These nanobubbles are highly sensitive to pressure changes and can release their contents when exposed to sound waves. Although these ultrasound-responsive nanobubbles hold promise for delivering drugs or aiding in medical imaging, their production with nanometer size and uniform size distribution has been challenging. This award supports fundamental research to develop a new method, called ultrasonic shearing, to create uniform-sized nanobubbles that can be tuned for size and chemistry as needed. The method integrates ultrasonication and shearing using an impeller to achieve monodispersed nanobubbles. This advancement could lead to large-scale manufacturing of nanobubbles with applications in biomedicine, such as gene and drug delivery for diseases such as osteoporosis. Additionally, this technology could enhance wastewater treatment systems by improving processes like oxygen transfer and air flotation, thereby reducing pollution. The project also includes educational efforts to increase the understanding of scalable nanobubble manufacturing and their biomedical applications, particularly among women and underrepresented minority groups, aiming to contribute to both scientific progress and societal benefits as well as the development of a skilled workforce.<br/><br/>Various nanobubble sizes exhibit distinct behaviors, yet understanding their synthesis remains limited due to the absence of an efficient manufacturing method allowing precise size and size distribution control. Furthermore, there is a lack of fundamental knowledge on the relationship between the processing parameters and the acoustic properties of nanobubbles. This research advances nanobubble manufacturing methods by investigating the ultrasonic shearing mechanism, employing a combination of computational modeling and experimental methodologies. The inherent energy dynamics in the manufacturing process is simulated by calculating ultrasonic shear energy and nanobubble surface energy. Through the empirical assessment of temperature shifts within the emulsion, a correlation is established between the droplet vaporization and energy derived from ultrasonic shearing. Integrating this model with the ultrasonic shearing method enables the development of systems capable of tailoring nanobubble size as a function of ultrasonic shearing, incorporating variables such as ultrasound intensity, shearing rate, and process duration. This technique can generate programmable nanobubbles with controlled cargo release mechanisms. Additionally, the research aims to identify nanobubble subpopulations with enhanced responsiveness to ultrasound using tissue-mimicking materials for medical imaging applications. Finally, the project explores the interplay between ultrasonic shearing, therapeutic-encapsulated nanobubbles, and cellular dynamics, particularly in osteoporosis, to uncover potential therapeutic approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is motivated by a fascinating and crucial process happening in our body every moment: a cell squeezes through pores much smaller than itself. For example, red blood cells around 8 ?m, frequently squeeze through endothelial pores around 0.5 ?m in our spleens. This is their regular ?physical fitness test?, which destroys aged cells and diseased cells in malaria and blood disorders. Another example is the neutrophil, the most abundant white blood cell, which exits the circulation to fight infections in the tissues by squeezing through endothelial pores in the blood vessel walls. In cancer, circulating tumor cells also squeeze through these pores to metastasize in distant organs, which is the major contributor to cancer mortality. To squeeze through such narrow pores, all these cells have to experience extreme mechanical deformation. Slight changes of molecular structures in the cell would have significant consequence on the cell?s survival. In this project, advanced computer simulations will be applied to predict how different components of the cell affect its ability to pass through small pores. This research will also be complemented by educational and outreach programs based on curriculum development, hands-on construction of tensegrity structures, and a cell squeezing demonstrator to inspire K-12 students to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>The research goal is to reveal the biomechanics and mechanobiology of transendothelial migration (TEM) of cells by multiscale modeling and its integration with experimental data.

Such overgrowths in the abnormal crystal structure are termed pseudomorphic phases. When deposited as a multilayer, where each film contains thousands of overgrowth-substrate combinations, a large proportion of the film volume can be synthesized to contain the pseudomorphic phase at ambient temperatures and pressures; previously such phase transformations were accessible only via extreme pressures or temperatures. These pseudomorphic phases can be highly attractive from both structural and functional viewpoints, and show high stability under extremes of pressure, temperature and strain rate. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research to explore advancements to the thin film synthesis technique in order to obtain a fundamental understanding of the pseudomorphic phase transformation and the resultant properties of the pseudomorphic phases in a multilayered architecture.

Shortly after the first continents emerged above sea level (~3.2 to 2.6 billion years ago, Ga), microbes evolved the ability to perform oxygenic photosynthesis, which led to an oxygen-rich atmosphere and massive increase in primary productivity. Was the oxygenation of the oceans and atmosphere directly related to weathering of Earth?s first continents? This study will develop a record of the concentration of phosphorus in ancient oceans ~2 to 0.5 Ga to examine if the evolution of marine microorganisms was linked to weathering of early continents when the Earth was covered in ice. Ultimately, phosphorus abundance may have enabled the evolution of aerobic and multicellular organisms. The research will be integrated into new Earth sciences curricula developed with local high school teachers for neighboring rural districts. The project will develop open-access classroom and field-based learning modules and virtual field trips that connect students to the Cambrian explosion?the evolution of macroscopic animals?in the Pennsylvania landscape. The efficacy of the new curricula will be assessed through serial knowledge assessments implemented before and after exposure and ?knowledge boosts? in subsequent years. Mid-Atlantic high school teachers will be trained in various resources to be implemented in their classrooms.<br/><br/>Microbes have been intimately linked to carbonate minerals and the chemical evolution of Earth?s surface since life began. The metabolic innovation of oxygenic phototrophy >2 billion years ago contributed to the rise of oxygen, increased global primary productivity, and permanently changed biogeochemical cycles. However, little is known about why microbes evolved the ability to photosynthesize relatively late in the history of life, and what controlled the pace of subsequent microbial evolution. The primary goal of this CAREER award is an assessment of phosphate availability?an essential nutrient for all life?in the environments that host textural and geochemical evidence for primitive microbes and emergent metabolisms. Was the reduced productivity of the Mesoproterozoic a symptom of a phosphate reservoir depleted by oxygenic phototrophs? Was the evolution of crown group eukaryotes and metazoans fertilized by weathering-derived phosphate from Neoproterozoic global glaciations and the breakup of supercontinents? This project tests the hypothesis that enhanced phosphate availability was essential to the evolution of eukaryotes and metazoans by reconstructing seawater [P] via carbonate-associated phosphate (CAP) on existing Precambrian sample sets within the context of Proterozoic global glaciations, tectonics, and existing temporal and diagenetic frameworks. The research will improve our understanding of CAP and its utility for geo- and astrobiology by (1) analyzing CAP in the same Precambrian samples that have a wealth of existing diagenetic and geochemical data, and (2) performing growth experiments to develop mineral-specific CAP-[P]seawater calibrations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is inspired by the need for assistive robots that help elderly and disabled adults perform everyday tasks. The crucial challenge lies in fostering seamless and safe interaction between humans and robots. When people rely on assistive robots, they need robots that learn what the user wants (i.e., the robot understands the human) and clearly communicate their intent (i.e., the human understands the robot). The investigator's team will develop hardware and software tools to facilitate communication between robots and humans through visual, auditory, and haptic interfaces. This project will also support robotics education by i) teaching deaf and blind high school students to build interfaces that communicate with assistive robot arms; ii) mentoring college seniors as they program ""learn & share"" robots that test the limits of the unified framework; and by iii) bringing engineering faculty outside of traditional inclusion groups into a safe space to discuss their journeys. <br/><br/>The insight driving this research is that effective communication informs learning and vice versa. Users with knowledge about their robot's learning enhance their ability to operate it, while the robot's learning dictates what it should communicate. With this insight in mind, research performed in association with this CAREER award has three main objectives: (from human to robot) learning to assist the human robustly and intuitively, (from robot to human) communicating robot learning with personalized and interpretable feedback, and (co-adaptation) unifying learning and communication under a single, interconnected dynamical system that allows the robot and the human to interact and adapt. User studies will evaluate these contributions, involving participants controlling a robot arm in daily living activities. A unified formalism where learning and communication are two components of the same mathematical framework is the main scientific contribution. By combining these elements, the project transcends the limitations of separate development tracks for learning and communication, advancing knowledge in previously unattainable ways.

Increasingly, many firms seek to integrate cyber threat intelligence (CTI) about emerging threats and their relevance to vulnerabilities within their assets. However, much of the current CTI analyst practice is reactive, in which analysis manually examines exploits (software that circumvents vulnerabilities and allows an attacker to manipulate cyber-assets) after an attack. More proactive approaches to using CTI might prevent many cyber-attacks; in particular, sources such as Dark Web hacker forums often include signals about possible emerging exploit trends and attack vectors. However, these large, international, and ever-evolving platforms often contain millions of posts, a scale that makes conventional CTI analysis prohibitive, limited, error-prone, and time-consuming. Therefore, this project seeks to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled analytics techniques based on text analysis and network science to identify emerging trends and to link exploits to vulnerabilities. The models and results produced from this research will be integrated into curricula for cybersecurity students and data scientists to help rapidly grow a well-trained workforce in proactive AI-enabled CTI analytics. <br/><br/>This CAREER project seeks to develop two thrusts of proactive CTI research. The first is a novel Diachronic Graph Transformer (DGT) to detect and predict emerging exploit terms, semantics, and trends through advancing methods for balancing word embedding stability and capturing their shifts   over time.  The second is a self-supervised neural information retrieval method, entitled the Exploit-Vulnerability Self-Supervised Linker, that links hacker exploits to vulnerabilities in a manner consistent with CTI analysts' procedures and that accounts for a technology's configurations, dependencies, and other characteristics. The data and methods from this research will be integrated into three thrusts to improve cyber-AI education: (1) new lessons for an AI for Cybersecurity course at Indiana University, (2) resources to enhance the cybersecurity curricula of NSF CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service institutions, and (3) proactive CTI learning modules for the AI+ platform offered by the Open Data Science Conference, one of the world's largest data science communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen peroxide is an important product for numerous applications including clean water and as an efficient oxidant in chemicals manufacturing. However, it is currently produced at industrial scale via an indirect process that involves reactions of organic chemicals and requires large scales to be economical. For distributed manufacturing, it is desirable to develop a ?greener? process that directly reacts hydrogen with oxygen. However, new catalysts are needed to accelerate the rate of hydrogen peroxide synthesis and avoid side reactions that lead to complete hydrogen oxidation to water. Recent work has suggested that the application of certain organic coatings to common supported metal catalysts can improve hydrogen peroxide synthesis yields, however the way these improve performance is not understood.  Professors Nikolla and Medlin and their teams will systematically vary the properties of the organic-metal interface to identify molecular features associated with high hydrogen peroxide yields. They will also conduct reaction kinetic studies to understand how interactions between the reactants and organic coatings specifically lead to enhanced rates. The research will be carried out by a multi-institutional team that includes collaboration with international and national laboratory partners. The educational component of the project will include training and exchange programs for graduate and undergraduate students and development of new online educational tools related to the research problem.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professors Eranda Nikolla of the University of Michigan and Will Medlin of the University of Colorado Boulder are studying how the near-surface environment influences direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis on supported metal catalysts. Organic ligands are widely used in the synthesis of metal nanocrystals that can be employed as well-defined catalysts. While in many cases it is desirable to remove the ligands, in other instances the retention of ligands can lead to desirable catalyst performance. One important example in which ligand effects have been found to yield major selectivity improvements is the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from H2 and O2 over Pd catalysts. While there have been some indications that the ligands function via (i) blocking of contiguous surface sites responsible for O2 activation and (ii) promotion of proton shuttling to adsorbed O2, the elementary-step mechanisms by which the coatings enhance selectivity in H2O2 direct synthesis are poorly understood. To develop structure-reactivity relations for hydrogen peroxide synthesis, Professors Nikolla and Medlin will systematically vary (a) the structure and density of ligands, (b) the metal nanoparticle size, shape, and composition, and (c) the solvent properties. The prepared materials will be characterized in depth and utilized in kinetic studies to understand the origins of selective catalysis. The project will involve collaborative efforts in nanoparticle synthesis, characterization of ligand-protected catalysts, reaction kinetic studies, and computational studies of chemistry at organic-modified metal surfaces. Although the project will emphasize the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, the principles developed here can be extrapolated to diverse catalytic reactions, particularly since the elementary steps in direct synthesis and its undesired side reactions are broadly important in many chemistries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If stable, black holes perturbed with gravitational or other form of radiation, after a temporary change, would eventually return to their initial state. The investigator aims to advance the current knowledge of perturbations dynamics by including interaction of electromagnetic radiation with gravitational waves. This interaction is significant as astrophysical black holes are thought to be surrounded by an accretion disk of matter which, in particular, contains electromagnetic waves.

In this context, in-storage indexing devices (ISIDs) have emerged to enhance the functionalities of storage devices, leading to improved performance, efficiency, and cost-effective data processing. By storing index information alongside the data it indexes within the same storage device, ISIDs offer several advantages over traditional indexing methods. These advantages include reducing data movement, improving access speed, minimizing network impact, enabling efficient data management, and freeing host computing for critical tasks. To design efficient ISIDs, several challenges need to be addressed. Firstly, there is a need for low-cost and open-source research platforms to facilitate the reproduction and comparison of research work, promoting quick adoption of ISID advancements. Secondly, integrating the fragmented advancements of individual ISID components is crucial to capture their holistic impacts and interactions effectively. Thirdly, addressing diverse workload requests, interference in multi-tenant environments, and data distribution considerations requires new research methods for overall operation optimization. This CAREER research project aims to overcome these research challenges and promote the adoption of ISIDs, contributing to the advancements of storage systems. This project will explore and develop innovative methods to unleash the full potential of ISIDs in modern data management systems. By addressing the core challenges, the project seeks to revolutionize data storage systems and make significant contributions to the field of storage technology. This project will share the findings with undergraduate and graduate students through computer science programs and open up career opportunities to female students, underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students.

The developed infrastructure will be available to the research community through a web-based portal.<br/><br/>This research makes significant empirical contributions to the ISID design and development space by addressing major challenges posed by in-storage indexing. Specifically, it advances the state of knowledge by investigating the following questions: (1) How can we design and develop new ISID models that accurately capture the behavior of internal modules, such as the index manager, request handler, data access parallelism, index-induced wear leveling, and garbage collection? These insights will enable scientific design advancements and detailed tradeoff analysis for ISIDs. (2) How can we develop efficient dynamic model calibration techniques using coarse measurements to parameterize queuing models that accurately capture burstiness and variability in ISIDs? (3) How can we emulate index manager delays using different data structures and sizes and utilize black-box and gray-box calibration techniques to identify ground truth for ISIDs? (4) How can we design a new re-configurable indexing architecture and index cache that ensures deterministic tail latency, low overhead prefetching and eviction, and improved membership checking through object signatures and ML-based feature learning in ISIDs? (5) How can we design tenant-local eviction policies that consider the effect of allocating space for index and data, recognizing the dependencies between them for efficient data access in ISIDs? (6) How can we minimize log-checking overhead and avoid in-storage hash computations while exploring the trade-off between consistency and performance by allowing read-only tenants to bypass the log and access their own consistent index in ISIDs? (7) Does capacity variance, which gracefully reduces ISID capacity as flash pages become bad, provide a better alternative to wear-leveling for ISIDs?

Recent work has shown that models in healthcare lack robustness, and do not perform equally well across all patients and settings. Recent work in general model robustness have failed to translate to health settings in part because they do not consider the diversity of patients, conditions, and contexts that models will be used in. This project will create new ways to improve model robustness, and empower researchers to target more ethical deployments. This research will identify improvements for data use and model training that prioritize actionable models in health, by focusing on the nuance and complexity of health data. Ultimately these advances will also contribute to machine learning in other high-stakes areas such as lending, education and legal systems, that rely on routinely collected data to generate insights. Beyond the direct and long-term societal impact of these advances, this work will help lay the foundation for a new undergraduate-focused summer course focusing on bringing a larger, and more diverse, pipeline of students into machine learning in health. <br/><br/>The importance of patient safety combined with poor model robustness limits the practical utility of ML in healthcare, and ethical deployment requires developing methods and metrics to ensure state-of-the-art models are robust.

First, targeting representational robustness to data error and change, it will build resilient models across patient subpopulations and variations in care through contrastive self-supervision in deep metric models. Second, in model learning, it will improve algorithms for stable training, balancing fairness/robustness trade-offs by combining private and public data for clinical prediction tasks.

Epidermal cells in plant leaves, especially pavement cells (PCs), exhibit interdigitated puzzle shapes. Shape formation of PCs serves as an ideal model to understand principles governing cell morphogenesis and tissue growth in developmental biology. During the development, PCs change from small rounded polygonal shapes into large interdigitated puzzle shapes, under the regulation of the extracellular plant hormone and multiple key molecules accumulated at the plasma membrane (PM). This developmental process also involves reorganization of cytoskeletal components and dynamic cell-to-cell communication. The multiscale mathematical model proposed in this research will have a broad range of applications from tissue engineering to biomanufacturing and biotechnology. The PI will develop a satellite undergraduate research program based on University of California, Riverside (UCR), a Hispanic-serving institution with many first generation college students. The program will also recruit students from California State Universities and high schools in local public school district. Research symposia and summer research programs will be organized through the coordination with department of mathematics, Association of Women in Mathematics at UCR Chapter, Interdisciplinary Center for Quantitative Modeling in Biology at UCR, and nearby colleges to promote public awareness on research and career paths in mathematical biology.<br/><br/>The morphogenesis of PCs is a complex process. During the early stage, extracellular hormone induces nanoclustering on the PM of individual cells to initiate cell polarization. It is followed by nonhomogeneous mechanical forces exerted along cell wall and a subcellular signaling gradient to regulate cell-cell interaction. Stable cell polarization, further the interdigitated jigsaw cell shapes, will be established under the regulations between the nanoclustering signals and structural components in the same cell and regulations of Rho GTPase signals between neighboring cells. Different hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism underlying the PC morphogenesis, while most of them focus on either chemical signals or mechanical properties in PCs. The proposed study will test new hypotheses that include both the chemical signaling network and mechanical properties, as well as interactions between them, and therefore provide novel insights into the fundamental principles of cell shape formation and tissue development. This project will develop a multiscale model using the local level set method to incorporate both chemical signals and mechanical properties in a multicellular environment to test different hypotheses on the shape formation of PCs.

They are used in trace gas spectroscopy for the detection of chemical hazards and disease-correlated biomarkers, in stellar spectroscopy in the search for Earth-like exoplanets, and as critical components of optical atomic clocks. Although their use is now ubiquitous, optical frequency combs are largely confined to specialized optics laboratories. However, this is changing. Recently, optical frequency combs have been realized using chip-scale microring cavities and the nonlinear Kerr effect. The promise of these ?microcombs? lies in the possibility of replacing a research laboratory dedicated to precision measurement with a comb-on-a-chip platform that can perform precision measurements far from the optics lab. As with many precision measurement instruments, microcomb precision is limited by material thermal noise, a limitation which is worsened by the small volume of the microring. Building on recent work investigating how material noise affects comb precision, Drake and her team will develop a technique for microcomb noise reduction based on novel cavity geometries and comb operation. Decoupling material thermodynamics from the properties of the comb light represents an important and necessary milestone for the use of microcombs as state-of-the-art precision measurement instruments.<br/><br/>The PI proposes an in-depth investigation of the coupling of material thermal noise to the properties of microresonator optical frequency combs with the dual goals of better understanding and predicting the fundamental noise processes in microresonator optical frequency combs and creating microcomb systems with reduced thermal phase noise in both their microwave and optical frequencies. While the thermodynamics of matter are generally well understood, the intersection of thermal noise and nonlinear optics remains largely unexplored. In microcombs, the transduction of thermal fluctuations in the resonator material properties to noise on properties of the comb light (the microwave repetition rate or the optical comb modes) is highly dependent on the details of the comb state, include the Raman self-frequency shift and the presence of dispersive waves. This project encompasses a theoretical and experimental study of the connection between thermal and frequency/phase noise in microresonator frequency combs by introducing geometries and techniques that alter this relationship and that can be utilized to produce ultra-low phase noise signals. The overall goal of the research is the generation of low phase noise signals (primarily microwave and potentially optical as well) in low-cost, room temperature systems with the potential for future photonic integration. The PI will also develop a summer academy for area STEM educators focused on design and construction of optics-based projects (Optical Technology Inventors and Makers Academy, OPTIMA). Attendees will learn the principles of optics and optical design and will be encouraged to create optics projects that can be used as teaching material in their classes.

Cell migration plays a major role in many settings including cancer metastasis, wound healing, and the immune response. For example, breast cancer cell migration is considered a major risk factor for metastatic bone or lung tumors and fibroblast migration in wound healing has roles in diabetes and necrotizing enterocolitis (life-threatening intestinal wounds that affect 10% of premature babies). This project aims to understand the intrinsic properties of cell migration, i.e., how internal forces of a cell respond to the properties of the surrounding, external environment and drive cell migration. To do this, The PIs will develop a novel mathematical model of a migrating cell. The model combines pre-existing knowledge of cell migration and cell properties with an imaging method that can measure subcellular forces. The model will yield force information throughout the cell, not just at the measurement locations. Accompanying that model with appropriate statistical analysis will help identify how the external environment can effect migration via internal subcellular force generation. This, in turn, will help us better understand how to inhibit (e.g. cancer) or promote (e.g. wound healing) cell migration in order to improve patient outcomes. The project will mentor and train graduates from multiple disciplines, undergraduates from institutions lacking research opportunities through Indiana University Indianapolis?s NSF-DMS REU program, and socioeconomically disadvantaged high schoolers through the American Chemical Society Project SEED/STEM. Plans include outreach via presentations and minisymposia at several conferences, open-access publications, YouTube postings, in-class modules, local community presentations (Science on Tap), and the STEM Youth Enrichment Summer program for underrepresented high schoolers. <br/><br/>Cell migration is driven by its intracellular forces but is mainly directed by extracellular properties and perturbations. To understand how extracellular properties determine internal forces to direct cell migration, the PIs plan to accomplish three specific aims: 1) Develop a model that integrates experimentally measured intracellular tensions and uses them to establish a force architecture throughout the cell, 2) Use that model and the experimental measurements to identify which subcellular components play major roles in cell migration, and 3) Use modeling and experiments to understand the response of internal forces and migration of the cell to the external properties. Through this approach the PIs will be able to identify several primary pathways (external properties to subcellular components to directed motion) by which external properties use subcellular forces to direct migration. In the model, the cell will be represented by a set of interconnected viscoelastic springs modeling the membrane and other subcellular components. The flow will be modeled using a novel lattice-Boltzmann approach for steady-state Stokes flow. Fluid-structure interaction will be modeled using the immersed boundary method. The model will be calibrated and validated using the experiments. The internal tension experiments will use imaging methods and various molecular tension sensors to capture the force landscape within a cell, particularly at focal adhesions, cytoskeletal junctures, and the nuclear envelope. The external environmental alteration will include the extracellular matrix stiffness, chemotactic gradient, and flow properties. Correlation, sensitivity, and principal component analyses will be used to identify potential migratory pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The spatial distribution of larvae from a given population, also known as the dispersal kernel, is an important parameter both for basic understanding of marine ecology and evolution, as well as for management and conservation of marine resources. Larval dispersal kernels are often studied using computer models which simulate the dispersal of larvae within ocean circulation models. However, there are very few measurements of marine larval dispersal with which to evaluate these computer models, due the cost and infeasibility of current genetic tagging methods. This project uses isolation by distance (IbD) population models, which the project team has shown gives similar results to genetic tagging methods, but at a fraction of the cost. Dispersal kernels are thought to be shaped by both species traits, such as the amount of time spent as planktonic larvae, as well as the environment through which the larvae disperse. To tease apart the effects of species traits and regional seascapes, the team is taking advantage of the unique setting of the South Pacific, where the numerous isolated archipelagos each independently replicate the dispersal process the team is studying. Six reef-fish species at ten locations in each of the New Caledonia, Vanuatu, and Fijian archipelagic seascapes are being sampled, IbD estimates of dispersal kernels are then used to select a set of computer models, and the models are simulated across twenty years of oceanographic data (many generations of fish) and a selection of species traits. The results of this research are being used to improve the design of networks of marine protected areas in each of the archipelagos in a way that accounts for variability in larval dispersal over time. This research builds on the efforts of the Diversity of the Indo-Pacific Network (DIPnet), created by the project?s principal investigators and senior personnel to promote collaborative research on the ecology and evolution of the immense biodiversity of the Indo-Pacific. The project also provides training for postdoctoral scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, and supports capacity building workshops for local policymakers and students.<br/><br/>Populations of most marine species are functionally, demographically, and genetically connected by planktonic dispersal of tiny larvae. Understanding the spatial distribution of dispersal events (the dispersal kernel) is a fundamental goal of marine ecology and is critical to predicting population dynamics and evolutionary outcomes. Yet, general principles for predicting dispersal outcomes across communities remain elusive. The project team is developing the first-ever data-assimilated biophysical models of larval dispersal by: 1) applying isolation-by-distance (IbD) theory to estimate mean parent-offspring distance (?IbD) for six reef fish species co-sampled and RAD-seq genotyped at three isolated South Pacific archipelagos that each replicate the IbD process with relatively continuous reef systems, 2) using empirical estimates of ?IbD to constrain biophysical models of larval dispersal, which are iterated over twenty years of high-resolution hydrodynamic models, to test hypotheses about the relative role of species traits and seascape characteristics in shaping larval dispersal kernels, and 3) developing a new conservation portfolio approach to design managed area networks that capture temporal variability in larval dispersal over many generations, and engaging with local stakeholders in each archipelago to implement this approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a consequence, there is an urgent need to ensure trustworthiness of these systems when deployed in practice. The goal of this project is to design novel techniques for reasoning about neurosymbolic programs, which are programs that include DNN components. For traditional software, formal methods have provided powerful techniques for reasoning about program correctness. However, these tools struggle with programs that include DNN components due to the difficulty in reasoning about correctness properties of DNNs. This project's novelties are algorithms and techniques for designing trustworthy neurosymbolic programs by quantifying uncertainty of DNN components in a rigorous way. By doing so, downstream components can account for uncertainty in the DNN predictions; for instance, a robot may act cautiously if it believes an obstacle might be present. As a consequence, this project can have significant impacts by improving the reliability of modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which are increasingly pervasive in our world. Further, a new graduate class on trustworthy machine learning is being created, and novel applications of generative AI in computer science education are being explored.<br/><br/>The fundamental idea of the project is to leverage conformal prediction, a strategy for quantifying uncertainty of arbitrary blackbox models that comes with theoretical guarantees. The broad idea is to convert a given model into a conformal predictor that outputs a set of labels (called a prediction set) that is guaranteed to contain the ground truth label with high probability. For example, a conformal object detector can detect all objects in an image with high probability, with some of the detections marked as uncertain. Several techniques for reasoning about programs based on conformal prediction are being explored. First, the notion of conformal Hoare logic, an extension of Hoare logic designed to formally reason compositionally about neurosymbolic programs where the individual DNN components are all conformal predictors that come with conformal guarantees, is being developed. Second, a strategy for converting a traditional neurosymbolic program into a conformal one, by applying conformal prediction to the individual DNN components and then propagating uncertainty through the whole program, is being developed. Third, conformal synthesis strategies for synthesizing neurosymbolic programs that come with conformal correctness guarantees is being developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research for creating strong, tough, and sustainable materials through new knowledge of small-scale fracture in architected materials. Bio-derived and/or biodegradable materials will be created with precise microstructures using advanced manufacturing tools. Mechanical testing and computer modeling on both small- and large-scale materials will reveal how cracks grow and propagate in complex structures. This knowledge will be used to inform the design of new sustainable materials for aerospace, construction and automotive industries. It will further be used to develop new programs and courses for promoting sustainable materials use in the next generation of engineers. <br/><br/>Emerging strategies using architecture to enhance toughness often have bioinspired designs, but they largely ignore how architecture affects the development of fracture process zones, especially at small length scales. This is especially true in anisotropic or hierarchical structures, which can have complex fracture processes occurring at multiple length scales. This research will reveal how architecture can inhibit and redistribute material-scale damage when introduced at relevant fracture length scales. Architectures will be made using sustainably sourced materials with features at or below the constituent fracture process zone size using both macro- and nanoscale additive manufacturing. Concomitant simulations will use elastic-plastic-damage finite element modeling to reveal how different structures can spread, deflect, or impede damage to create larger architectural fracture process zones and enhance toughness. These efforts will be incorporated into a new undergraduate outreach initiative on sustainable materials design that aims to recruit underrepresented community college students into university STEM programs. It will also be used in a graduate course on architected material design where students will try to develop new sustainable materials solutions to existing engineering problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zooplankton include many different types of organisms that can be broadly categorized as crustacean or gelatinous, with most fish and whales preferring crustaceans as a fat-rich food source over gelatinous animals, which are higher in water content. Historically, the California Current ecosystem off the U.S. West Coast has been dominated by crustacean zooplankton, such as krill and copepods, but in 2014 there were huge abundances of a type of colonial, gelatinous zooplankton known as pyrosomes, which caused widespread damage to fisheries by fouling fishing gear and dominating catch. Although the arrival of pyrosomes coincided with an extensive marine heatwave, lower abundances have since persisted despite a return to cooler ocean temperatures. Analysis of time series data from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) indicate that pyrosomes were also observed in the California Current many decades ago when the ocean was not particularly warm. This study combines analysis of past samples from CalCOFI, ocean circulation models, and biological models to understand the causes of these quickly growing pyrosome populations in the California Current.  It supports training for undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, the project is reaching K-12 students through a unique partnership with the San Diego County Office of Education that is developing Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-aligned resources for middle and high school science teachers in California. The educational resources are being disseminated through the California Science Project and California Environmental Literacy Initiative. Public outreach in San Diego (CA) is through the Enhancing Your Horizons San Diego conference and the San Diego Regional Competition of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl, and in Santa Cruz (CA) through the Seymour Marine Discovery Center.<br/><br/>Predicting how ecosystems respond to accelerating climate change is a major challenge. The recent appearance of the pyrosome Pyrosoma atlanticum in the California Current is a major perturbation to the ecosystem, and the cause remains unknown. Both ocean physics and plankton food-web dynamics are key determinants of variability in pelagic community composition in this ecosystem, yet unraveling the degree to which variability in physics (through warming and advection) combines with shifting biological interactions (through nutrient cycling and altered food-web dynamics) to determine composition and function is complicated. This project combines the analysis of past historical samples from seven decades of the CalCOFI time series, data-assimilative and non-data assimilative ocean circulation models, and biological population models to determine the role ocean physics and biological interactions have played in shaping pyrosome abundance, trophic dynamics, and population growth and mortality in the California Current. This novel framework is providing mechanistic understanding that is required to predict how plankton communities respond to climate change.<br/><br/>The Physical Oceanography Program contributed funding for this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As BCI create intricate connections between the nervous system and technology by measuring biological signals from individuals and translating them into commands for devices, and they hold great potential for treating neurological disorders. Neural interface technologies have the potential to revolutionize the field of rehabilitation by allowing the nervous system to control novel devices that can offer new hope and possibilities for regaining control and independence despite physical limitations. However, developing computer algorithms that can effectively interact with the human nervous system remains a challenge.

This CAREER projects seeks to develop a new neuromechanical simulation framework that models how patients adapt to walking rehabilitation. The framework will lay the foundation for a new and potentially transformative approach for patient-specific prescription of gait rehabilitation.

The research activities are divided into two interconnected foci. Focus one will capture muscle activity and kinematics from a diverse population - young adults, older adult fallers, and stroke survivors -  while walking in the error-augmentation environment. Focus two will develop a simulation framework to model individual-specific adaptation to this environment. This project will first develop a theory-based framework in which neuromuscular control is optimized via exploration to maximize walking balance and minimize effort.

The approach prioritizes fairness by enhancing statistical algorithms to perform equitably, particularly in scenarios with limited sample sizes and where sensitive attributes are restricted by legal or societal norms. In parallel, this project addresses privacy by developing a general framework for studying the privacy-accuracy trade-off under new privacy constraints emerging with the advances in generative AI.

While existing research explores the wellbeing of employees in single teams, there's a gap in understanding how being part of multiple teams influences the experiences and overall wellbeing of individual team members and teams in organizations. This project addresses the relationship between multiple team membership (MTM) and wellbeing, crucial for organizational productivity. Individuals navigating multiple virtual teams experience ?context variety.? In other words, they move between diverse technological, task-related, and socio-psychological contexts. This includes using different platforms and emerging technologies (e.g., AI nudging tools), facing varying task requirements, and experiencing different levels of inclusion and psychological safety across teams. Despite being a common experience, prior research hasn't explored how team context variety influences individuals? and the entire team?s wellbeing, including both positive and negative outcomes, such as excitement or burnout. This research aims to integrate scholarly perspectives on teams, management information systems, and human resources, contributing to a richer theoretical understanding of MTM dynamics. The outcomes will contribute to improving workers' wellbeing and fostering inclusive work environments.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to: a) understand how technology, task, and socio-psychological variety across teams affect individual and team wellbeing when team members are simultaneously members of multiple teams, and b) to help organizations, managers, and employees design supportive workplace experiences. The project focuses on multiple levels of analyses: the individual, the single team, and the meso-level, which is defined as a liminal space across multiple teams within an organization. The research team relies on a mixed method approach, including interviews to capture a holistic view of the lived experiences of multiple team membership of knowledge workers and develop a theoretical model, experiments to granularly analyze technology affordances, and surveys to confirm the proposed theoretical model we develop and to better capture variety in task and socio-psychological contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wirelessly-connected biomedical devices are an indispensable part of such remote healthcare solutions. With the increased longevity of patients, the long-term reliability of the wireless transceivers used in biomedical devices is becoming a concern. Furthermore, the sensitive nature of personalized healthcare raises concerns about the data security. This CAREER project will study the security threats and failure mechanisms in radio frequency integrated circuits (RFIC) and develop intelligent, low-energy analog solutions so as to create a trusted wireless transceiver with the capability to detect and cure impairments. The proposed research in this CAREER project will fundamentally change the remote healthcare solutions by developing a new class of miniaturized self-healing and trusted wireless transceivers that can provide high-speed connectivity at the device level. Moreover, this project enhances the foundational knowledge in hardware security by introducing novel low-energy analog encryption techniques for use in secure data communications. The education plan in this project will significantly enhance the knowledge of students in communications and hardware security. Through collaboration with industry, students will have the opportunity to work with industrial mentors and gain practical knowledge in electronics. The plan also contains initiatives focused on STEM education in K-12. As part of this effort, summer workshops on secure electronics and data communications will be offered to local high school students and their teachers, followed by design competitions to inspire the students to seek post-secondary education in STEM related fields. Lab visits and boot camps will also be organized as part of outreach activities to share resources and facilitate the knowledge transfer to teachers and students.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to develop intelligent, self-healing and trusted wireless transceivers by introducing low-energy analog asymmetric encryption and adaptive self-healing. The proposed research consist of two research thrust areas: (1) low-energy trusted data communications with smart threat detection capability, and (2) intelligent self-healing. Both research thrusts benefit from energy-efficient analog neural networks (ANNs) to improve the functionality. Applying innovative asymmetric analog encryption on the modulated waveforms in the wireless transceiver, an energy-efficient end-to-end encrypted wireless communication link is created. The proposed design will use scalable linear time-invariant (LTI) to generate the keys needed for encryption and decryption. A low-energy ANN will monitor the transceiver parameters for any sign of potential attack and notify the encryption engine accordingly. The transceiver will also be authenticated using low-overhead device fingerprinting techniques. Similarly, a low-energy adaptive analog self-healing unit will be developed to increase the reliability by detecting the performance degradation and abnormalities, and actively adjust the transceiver parameters. The self-healing unit uses an innovative dual-loop adaptive structure. The first loop is built within the analog front-end (AFE) and is always engaged to monitor short-term performance degradations while the second loop relies on a low-energy ANN and samples the data selectively to correct for long-term defects. The ANNs used in both research thrusts are built using energy-efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs) and are co-designed to reduce the delay and area overhead. The outcome of this CAREER project will enhance the remote healthcare by accelerating the adoption of smart personalized solutions in medical community, particularly for long-term treatment of chronic diseases. It will also lay the foundation of a smart, self-healing and trusted electronic platform for biomedical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students liking and believing they are good at math (positive math affect) is crucial to their continued study in STEM disciplines. Increasing the number of students with positive math affect and supporting their capacity to pursue STEM careers requires engaging and effective mathematics course sequences. However, the practice of separating students into upper and lower-level math courses often limits access to important mathematics as well as to STEM fields for many students. Tracking organizes math coursework both within and across the secondary grades functioning as a gatekeeper for many students. De-tracking pathways, on the other hand, have the potential to broaden access to important mathematics and, ultimately, to STEM fields. This project examines student and teacher experiences with the de-tracking of math sequences in a public school district in Western Oregon. It examines how a district-wide cohort of middle school students, as individuals and in groups, identify with and define what it means to be good at math, and how these identities shift over time as they progress through math sequences. It also establishes a partnership between a mathematics education researcher and a school district (Research Practice Partnership) to study changes in pedagogy, define problems of teaching practice, and design solutions as the district transitions to de-tracked classes. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the de-tracking of one school district's math sequences; in particular, the project follows a cohort of middle school students in both tracked and de-tracked conditions. It aims to capture both individual math identities--how students relate to mathematics--and normative (group) identities--how students are recognized as competent math learners in public spaces. Math identity ""portraits"" are constructed by analyzing the students' drawings of who or what math was to them, written responses on how they know when someone is ""good at math,"" and responses to a Semantic Differential survey designed to elicit beliefs about the five strands of math proficiency. Using mixed methods analysis, the project synthesizes the analysis of data collected from the students at three points in time to construct both individual student math identity ""snapshots"" that can then be compared across time as they move through tracked and de-tracked sequences. As the district moves to fully de-tracked middle school math pathways, the Research Practice Partnership will collectively determine which problems of practice are critical in supporting newly integrated math classes and examine evidence of multiple ways that students can legitimately show mathematical competence and foster productive mathematical dispositions. This will include adopting and evaluating new pedagogy, curriculum, and assessment methods designed to increase the number of students who are seen, and see themselves, as proficient math learners.<br/><br/>The award is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

It can help lock device automatically to prevent data theft when the user is unknowingly away from his/her device. The research will explore and address the challenging scenario of having multiple moving objects simultaneously. The second part investigates a liveliness detection technique by checking the consistency between the user?s head movement pattern extracted from vision analysis and the pattern from the corresponding mmWave data for more secure facial authentication. It has the potential to defend against the most advanced attacks such as 3D projection attack and can work in any lighting conditions. The third effort will implement a prototype system and evaluate its performance with regards to security and usability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lacking tools to adjust to these changes, tropical plants might struggle to survive. This study will investigate how two tree species, Pterocarpus officinalis and Dalbergia ecastaphyllum, cope with changes in temperatures and water supply and how these changes are affecting their physiology. The study site is located in the Corredor Ecolgico del Noreste, a natural reserve in the Caribbean that represents freshwater coastal wetlands. Working with natural resource managers, community, and scientists, data will be collected to characterize the effects of climate change on these trees with the goal of advance knowledging that can be applied to inform management decisions about coastal wetlands restoration.<br/><br/>In the past decade, Puerto Rico and the broader Caribbean region have witnessed a historical increase in temperature. Trends suggest that this warming trajectory will continue, accompanied by other climatic extremes, including rising sea levels, extreme precipitation events, and intensified atmospheric disturbances. Coastal tropical vegetation is in a perilous situation, where in the context of a warmer planet and rising sea levels, vegetation might not have the physiological mechanisms for acclimation. This study?s goal is to assess the ecophysiological responses of nitrogen-fixing species in tidal freshwater wetlands in response to warmer temperatures and increased salinity under the same mesoclimate conditions. The research will investigate 1) how warmer climate and increased salinity affects photosynthesis and regulation of osmotic balance, and 2) how these environmental changes affect activity and efficiency of nitrogen fixation. Using an interdisciplinary approach involving plant physiology, ecology, climate change science and metabolomics, the study will include field observations of two tree species, Pterocarpus officinalis and Dalbergia ecastaphyllum, that share the same mesoclimate but different hydrologic conditions, and greenhouse experiments in which air temperature and saline conditions will be modified. Data examined will include light and temperature response curves to assess leaf thermal tolerance, plant morphological traits, hydraulic conductance, osmotic potential, 13C and 15N isotopic analyses for nitrogen fixation, as well as nutrient analysis and non-targeted metabolomic analyses to create a profile of metabolites related to salt stress and temperature changes. The combined approach will be applicable to informing plant selection in conservation management efforts, thus enhancing the potential benefits these critical ecosystems provide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry can be described as the study of systems of polynomial equations and their solutions, whereas topology is the mathematical discipline that studies notions such as ?shape? and ?space"" and develops mathematical techniques to distinguish and classify such objects. A notion of central importance in these areas is that of a ?moduli space? - this is a mathematical ?world map? that gives a complete inventory and classification of all instances of a particular mathematical object. The main research objective of the project is to better understand the structure of these spaces and to explore new phenomena, by importing techniques from neighboring areas of mathematics. While the primary aim is to advance knowledge in pure mathematics, developments from these areas have also had a long track record of successful applications in physics, data science, computer vision, and robotics. The educational component includes an outreach initiative consisting of a ?Math Circles Institute? (MCI). The purpose of the MCI is to train K-12 teachers from around the country in running the mathematical enrichment activities known as Math Circles. This annual 1-week program will pair teachers with experienced instructors to collaboratively develop new materials and methods to be brought back to their home communities. In addition, a research conference will be organized with the aim of attracting an international community of researchers and students and disseminating developments related to the research objectives of the proposal.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research component is to develop new methods via topology and geometric group theory to study various moduli spaces, specifically, (1) strata of Abelian differentials and (2) families of polynomials. A major objective is to establish ?asphericality"" (vanishing of higher homotopy) of these spaces. A second objective is to develop the geometric theory of their fundamental groups. Asphericality occurs with surprising frequency in spaces coming from algebraic geometry, and often has profound consequences. Decades on, asphericality conjectures of Arnol?d, Thom, and Kontsevich?Zorich remain largely unsolved, and it has come to be regarded as a significantly challenging topic. This project?s goal is to identify promising-looking inroads. The PI has developed a method called ""Abel-Jacobi flow"" that he proposes to use to establish asphericality of some special strata of Abelian differentials. A successful resolution of this program would constitute a major advance on the Kontsevich?Zorich conjecture; other potential applications are also described. The second main focus is on families of polynomials. This includes linear systems on algebraic surfaces; a program to better understand the fundamental groups is outlined. Two families of univariate polynomials are also discussed, with an eye towards asphericality conjectures: (1) the equicritical stratification and (2) spaces of fewnomials. These are simple enough to be understood concretely, while being complex enough to require new techniques. In addition to topology, the work proposed here promises to inject new examples into geometric group theory. Many of the central objects of interest in the field (braid groups, mapping class groups, Artin groups) are intimately related to algebraic geometry. The fundamental groups of the spaces the PI studies here should be just as rich, and a major goal of the project is to bring this to fruition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Failure of the building exterior can lead to cascading water intrusion, extensive interior damage, and disruption to businesses. The cost of repair resulting from such damage can be significant. High- and mid-rise buildings are designed to last for decades. During a building?s lifespan, urbanization and climate change pose major and evolving risks to the building exterior, yet significant technical barriers prevent these risks from being adequately considered in building design and resilience analysis. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support research that focused on developing new methodologies to assess these evolving risks to improve the lifetime performance of a building exterior in hurricanes and enhance resilience of coastal urban communities. These methodologies will be encapsulated in a user-friendly, cloud-based online application, UrbanWinds, for engineers to quickly evaluate wind loads and building risk change in preliminary design or planning stages of new buildings, and to assess changing risk of an inventory of buildings at urban scales. Through the integration of research and education, unique hands-on and collaborative learning experiences for diverse groups of middle and high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will be designed through a portable STEM kit. This activity is expected to produce next-generation engineering and education professionals who are trained in principles of wind engineering, state-of-the-art experimental and computational modeling techniques, and STEM teaching skills. This award will contribute to the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Data generated from this project will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https:/www.DesignSafe-CI.org).<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to assess the nonstationary (?evolving?) hurricane risks to urban building envelopes (?exterior?) during urban development in a changing climate. A deep learning-based data-driven model of wind pressures on urban buildings as a function of changes in surrounding building clusters under urban development will be investigated. Wind tunnel tests will be conducted to provide wind pressure data for developing the data-driven model. Reynolds number effects on complex aerodynamic loading on clustered buildings, which have not been studied in the literature, will be investigated using the large-scale NSF-supported NHERI Wall of Wind Facility at Florida International University. Traditional fully coupled probabilistic methods may be impractical to assess uncertainties of wind direction for building clusters due to significant computational costs. Adding nonstationary risks due to climate change presents an enormous technical challenge. A new reliability- and scenario-based methodology will be developed to capture the nonstationary characteristics of hurricanes and site-specific wind direction effects. Combined, the above efforts will advance the field of building design and urban resilience planning by capturing essential nonstationary characteristics of risks to building envelopes due to urban development and climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How individuals perceive social touch depends on many factors, including their reproductive state. One important example of this influence of reproductive state is that postpartum mothers find touch cues from infants extremely positive, which is essential for highly sensitive maternal caregiving and offspring development. There is very little scientific knowledge about how the maternal brain changes across pregnancy and early postpartum to promote the positive perception of infant touch. This project will study how specific areas of the cerebral cortex that receive touch-related information become more sensitive to infant touch cues as pregnancy progresses and as mothers gain early caregiving experience. This project will also broaden educational opportunities and scientific outreach through new student education courses, new research experiences for students, public zoo and museum exhibits, and by mentoring the next generation of brain scientists from underrepresented groups. The scientific approach and techniques used in these studies will be taught to students from a range of ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds, with the goal of attracting them to this field and increasing diversity in the biological and behavioral sciences. <br/> <br/>The experiments in this project will investigate the neural basis of maternal positive receptivity to offspring touch, with a focus on the role of cortical perineuronal nets (PNNs). Female reproduction and the onset of motherhood involve widespread neuroplasticity that underlies this critical social interaction. Importantly, this neuroplasticity occurs in cortical sites involved in processing touch, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1; mediates tactile discrimination) and the insular cortex (IC; processes affective components of touch). Cortical plasticity is regulated by perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures surrounding the somata and proximal dendrites of parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons. PNNs are physical and molecular barriers to synaptic plasticity and expression of these ?master regulators? of plasticity changes across times of significant sensory and behavioral flux. Recent experiments reported impaired maternal behavior associated with PNN overexpression in the rat S1 facial microvibrissae area. The current project tests the overarching hypothesis that female reproduction involves changes in PNN expression in S1 and IC, and that these changes alter cortical function critical for tactile regulation of maternal caregiving. This hypothesis will be tested in female rats by: (1) using histochemistry and rt-qPCR to determine changes in PNNs and associated mRNAs in S1 and IC across natural female reproduction, in response to exogenous steroid hormones mimicking pregnancy, and in response to repeated pup exposure and (2) using viral and chemical strategies to determine the effects of PNN underexpression or overexpression in the S1 or IC on maternal caregiving behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, programming is cognitively demanding and hard to learn. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated a great potential to address this challenge by generating complex programs from natural language, eliminating the need to memorize and grapple with program syntax and semantics. Despite this breakthrough, as a statistical method, LLMs suffer from a number of issues when applied to domains like program generation that emphasize functional correctness, safety, and robustness. For instance, recent studies have shown that LLMs may generate code that does not align with user intent, has security vulnerabilities, or violates coding standards. These issues consequently diminish programmer productivity and trust in LLMs. This project will advance the understanding of the limitations of LLMs in program generation and develop principled regulation approaches to enhance the correctness, safety, and robustness of LLM-generated code. The research findings and education activities of this project will inform the design of new instructional materials and pedagogical approaches to prepare computer science students for future careers in the age of large language models.<br/><br/>This project follows a mixed-methods research design that combines empirical data-driven studies, algorithm development, and tool building. While there have been many recent efforts in evaluating and improving LLM-based program generation, it remains unclear what types of program generation errors LLMs make, whether different kinds of LLMs make different types of errors, and why they make such errors. This project will bridge the knowledge gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of the symptoms and characteristics of program generation errors made by various LLMs using grounded theory and developing root cause analysis methods to investigate the correlation between program errors and the internal states of LLMs. In addition, the project will develop new error localization and mitigation methods that leverage the internal states of LLMs to precisely target the root causes of different kinds of errors at a low cost. The project will also make the first attempt to mitigate non-functional concerns in LLM-generated code by developing new lightweight model adaptation methods. With these advancements, this project aims to fundamentally chang the way LLMs are trained and updated for safe and reliable code generation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Objectives include the use of graft molecules for modifying the surface of redox active nanoparticle and assessing its effect on both colloidal stability and electron transfer through a variety of in-situ measurements. Variations in charge, steric and chemisorption functionality of the grafts will be used to understand the effects on rheology and redox mediation to establish structure-property relations and transport mechanisms. The developed nanofluids will also be optimized for interaction with carbon dioxide to maximize catalytic conversion and explore absorption capacity. Integrated with these are educational objectives, centered on developing modules for undergraduate students to use graphical user interface (GUI)-based computational methods.

This project will identify optimal steel and concrete interface conditions that can perpetually limit chloride influenced corrosion damage considering both traditional and sustainable alternative concrete mixture formulations. The research effort will be integrated with an education goal to improve the ability of civil engineering students and practitioners to address often overlooked corrosion durability issues in civil infrastructure. Research experiences for high school students will be used to enhance interests in STEM careers among underrepresented groups.

Corrosion starts as small, localized pits that can grow and accumulate into more widespread corrosion damage. However, under some conditions the pits can stop growing by the process of repassivation. The project aims to: 1) identify steel and concrete interface conditions required to promote repassivation of chloride-induced pitting corrosion, 2) establish the mechanisms controlling pit shape evolution and damage progression, and 3) identify optimally corrosion resistant interface conditions based on multi-scale damage forecasting models calibrated to exposure testing results. The ability of the interface condition to promote repassivation of localized pits will be quantified according to pit stability coefficients measured by single pit growth experiments accounting for cathodic limitations due to moisture levels and the porous-reactive nature of binder formulations. Split bipolar electrochemistry coupled with a multi-physics model will yield pit growth kinetics and shape evolution considering the quality of the steel and concrete interface. A multi-scale corrosion damage forecasting model that can simulate the transition of localized pitting corrosion to macro-scaled corrosion damage will be used to inform optimal interface conditions that maximize corrosion durability considering traditional and novel carbon-sequestering concrete formulations.

Tracking and accounting for protections of data privacy has emerged as a pivotal requirement in contemporary data protection regulations. As a result, those who are responsible for using personal data, so-called data controllers, must actively enhance the privacy safeguards they provide. This project addresses the intricate challenges surrounding privacy accountability within the mobile software ecosystem, characterized by the opacity of third-party code modules, particularly third-party libraries. Existing methods for achieving privacy accountability primarily emphasize data transparency, often overlooking essential principles like data minimization and purpose limitation and facing integration challenges within mobile software development lifecycles. This research project seeks to address these limitations by presenting innovative approaches to enforce privacy accountability throughout the mobile software development process. The goal is to establish a more privacy-conscious and accountable mobile ecosystem, benefiting both users and data controllers. The outcomes of the research will contribute to educational curriculum and training to help developers achieve privacy goals plus additional outreach through workshop and bootcamp venues. <br/><br/>The project's technical objectives are divided into three research thrusts: (1) understanding privacy accountability challenges in the mobile third-party code modules; (2) designing a privacy-accountable disclosure framework; (3) continuously enforcing privacy accountability properties in mobile software development lifecycle. The technical contribution of this research lies in advancing the socio-technical understanding of privacy non-compliance risks and accountability challenges within the mobile software supply chain. Additionally, it involves designing novel technical foundations that seamlessly integrate various methodologies and disciplines. This includes program analysis, formal methods, natural language processing, and human subject research, culminating in a privacy-accountable disclosure framework and continuous privacy accountability enforcement mechanism.

It may result in the catastrophic rupture of critical components. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research enabling novel micromechanical creep testing techniques, and it furthers the fundamental understanding of creep deformation mechanisms in advanced materials such as multi-principal element alloys. This research contributes to enabling superior creep-resistant materials, which benefit critical sectors of the U.S. society such as energy, transportation, aviation, propulsion, and space exploration, with far-reaching beneficial consequences on human well-being, economics, and environmental sustainability. This award also integrates research and education by supporting various outreach activities and creating new opportunities for underrepresented students to engage in scientific research.<br/><br/>Creep strength is arguably the most important mechanical property for structural alloys operating at high temperatures. Standard creep tests are expensive and time-consuming, and they require bulk samples. When developing new materials, however, high-throughput techniques that are capable to test small samples are typically required. This is particularly important in the case of multi-principal element alloys, due to needs to explore their vast compositional space. Nanoindentation is a high-throughput test suited for small samples, and it has been the primary technique to screen not only creep, but also fatigue, and fracture properties of these materials. This CAREER award funds research that attempts to advance nanoindentation as a high-throughput technique for fast screening of creep properties. The research combines multiscale modeling, micromechanical tests carried out at high temperature within a scanning electron microscope, and machine learning to establish a relation between nanoindentation and uniaxial creep properties. The research also broadens the fundamental understanding of high-temperature deformation mechanisms in body-centered cubic refractory multi-principal element alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cell migration plays a major role in many settings including cancer metastasis, wound healing, and the immune response. For example, breast cancer cell migration is considered a major risk factor for metastatic bone or lung tumors and fibroblast migration in wound healing has roles in diabetes and necrotizing enterocolitis (life-threatening intestinal wounds that affect 10% of premature babies). This project aims to understand the intrinsic properties of cell migration, i.e., how internal forces of a cell respond to the properties of the surrounding, external environment and drive cell migration. To do this, The PIs will develop a novel mathematical model of a migrating cell. The model combines pre-existing knowledge of cell migration and cell properties with an imaging method that can measure subcellular forces. The model will yield force information throughout the cell, not just at the measurement locations. Accompanying that model with appropriate statistical analysis will help identify how the external environment can effect migration via internal subcellular force generation. This, in turn, will help us better understand how to inhibit (e.g. cancer) or promote (e.g. wound healing) cell migration in order to improve patient outcomes. The project will mentor and train graduates from multiple disciplines, undergraduates from institutions lacking research opportunities through Indiana University Indianapolis?s NSF-DMS REU program, and socioeconomically disadvantaged high schoolers through the American Chemical Society Project SEED/STEM. Plans include outreach via presentations and minisymposia at several conferences, open-access publications, YouTube postings, in-class modules, local community presentations (Science on Tap), and the STEM Youth Enrichment Summer program for underrepresented high schoolers. <br/><br/>Cell migration is driven by its intracellular forces but is mainly directed by extracellular properties and perturbations. To understand how extracellular properties determine internal forces to direct cell migration, the PIs plan to accomplish three specific aims: 1) Develop a model that integrates experimentally measured intracellular tensions and uses them to establish a force architecture throughout the cell, 2) Use that model and the experimental measurements to identify which subcellular components play major roles in cell migration, and 3) Use modeling and experiments to understand the response of internal forces and migration of the cell to the external properties. Through this approach the PIs will be able to identify several primary pathways (external properties to subcellular components to directed motion) by which external properties use subcellular forces to direct migration. In the model, the cell will be represented by a set of interconnected viscoelastic springs modeling the membrane and other subcellular components. The flow will be modeled using a novel lattice-Boltzmann approach for steady-state Stokes flow. Fluid-structure interaction will be modeled using the immersed boundary method. The model will be calibrated and validated using the experiments. The internal tension experiments will use imaging methods and various molecular tension sensors to capture the force landscape within a cell, particularly at focal adhesions, cytoskeletal junctures, and the nuclear envelope. The external environmental alteration will include the extracellular matrix stiffness, chemotactic gradient, and flow properties. Correlation, sensitivity, and principal component analyses will be used to identify potential migratory pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, predicting the location and conditions that promote soft tissue failure can be challenging since the required local biomechanical characterizations cannot be realized using traditional experimental approaches. To address this longstanding challenge in soft tissue biomechanics, this work will leverage pioneering optics-based mechanical testing and imaging approaches, to attempt to experimentally characterize the local environment of tissue defects in mouse arteries. Experimental findings will be used to inform a computational model of aortic rupture. Outcomes and technological advances stemming from this research will be applicable to failure analysis in soft tissues from multiple physiological systems.

However, one of the major limitations that prevents wider adoption of WPT is its stringent orientation and alignment requirements in existing implementations. Current efforts from both academia and industry resulted in either 3-dimensional (3D) multi-coil structures that are too bulky for most applications or 2-dimentional (2D) planar coil arrays that only addressed misalignment issues while leaving the orientation issue unresolved. The goal of this CAREER project is to achieve efficient omnidirectional WPT systems with new spatial calibration methodologies that can dynamically shape the magnetic field direction to match the orientation of the receiver device for optimum power transfer without using a bulky 3D structure. By addressing this major challenge of WPT, this project will benefit a wide range of applications, from low-power implantable or ingestible medical devices with orientation/location uncertainties inside the body to higher-power consumer electronics, without the need for careful orientation and position alignment with the wireless transmitter, revealing the full potential of wireless power technology. In terms of education, this project will provide undergraduate students with chip-level design experience, opportunities to interact with industry professionals on practical applications, and new courses. These education activities will bridge gaps between university education and industry needs with better training of students to address the nationwide workforce demand in industry. The outreach activities in close collaboration with various organizations will also help develop a broader STEM workforce by increasing the participation of students from various groups and providing them with more opportunities to obtain the knowledge and skills to pursue career goals as engineers or scientists.<br/><br/>To achieve 3D omnidirectional WPT without using bulky 3D structures, a controlled 2D near-field coil array will be developed to shape the magnetic field with real-time spatial calibration techniques to determine and generate the optimal phases and amplitudes driving the coils in the array. Three system-level approaches will be explored for different application scenarios with different constraints, namely: 1) Receiver Backward Excitation, which is inspired by the theory of reciprocity in classical electromagnetism to sense the receiver-driven signals in reverse to pick up potentially optimum driving signals at the transmitter; 2) Transmitter Forward Excitation, to analyze the reflected impedance by sensing the transmitter-driven voltages and currents, and then calculate the optimum driving parameters; 3) Feedback Guided Searching, by optimizing the search space and then utilize feedback signals from the receiver to search for optimal driving parameters. In addition, a pseudo-2D approach with thin-film receiver structure will also be developed when the transmitter does not have the flexibility to implement a planar multi-coil array. In each approach, theoretical analysis and hardware development of system-level topologies, chip-level integrated circuits, and closed-loop control techniques will be performed for prototyping and measurement. To improve system efficiency, adaptive optimizations of coils and resonant links and development of nonlinear power and voltage regulation techniques will be performed with measurement verifications. The successful completion of this CAREER project will enable wider adoption of WPT, trigger innovations, open new trends for omnidirectional wireless powered applications, and generate broad impacts in our society.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems (CCSS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the idealizations, the models will add three-dimensionality aspects and dynamical effects caused by different water densities, i.e., by buoyancy. Results will be cast in a framework that includes the slope of the continental shelf, buoyancy effects and Earth?s rotation influence. As broader impacts, the study is expected to improve understanding on a process that affects dissolved and suspended materials near the coast. It also will train a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and two undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The proposal will explore three-dimensional pathways for coastal upwelling under vertically stratified ocean conditions. The study will use a series of idealized 3D numerical simulations, contrasting the customary 2D descriptions associated with Ekman dynamics.

Thus, simulations will address the coupling between surface and bottom boundary layers through a framework based on the slope Burger number, which compares buoyancy and Coriolis frequencies. The Burger number is expected to diagnose whether the onshore flow is along the bottom or in the interior of the water column. A particularity of this study, in addition to examining three-dimensional structures, is the assessment of the role of baroclinic instability in shaping the upwelling structure via eddy stirring along isopycnals.

Each cell is enclosed by an extracellular<br/>matrix. You can think of an extracellular matrix as a housing that protects and contains<br/>a cell?s contents. In plants, that housing is particularly strong and rigid and is composed<br/>of a wide variety of biopolymers. One such polymer is known as extensin. As its name<br/>implies, extensin plays an important role in controlling plant growth and extension, and<br/>it does so by forming a polymeric molecular scaffold or frame. This work aims to<br/>understand what governs scaffold formation at the molecular level and how we can use<br/>this knowledge to design new biopolymers that mimic or imitate the properties of<br/>natural extensins. In the face of global climate change, our reliance on fossil fuels must<br/>be reduced, not only for use as transportation fuels, but also as chemical/polymer<br/>feedstocks.

Monomeric EXTs self-assemble to form insoluble polymeric<br/>cell wall scaffolds. Very little is known about what governs EXT self-assembly at the<br/>molecular level. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been previously used to explore<br/>the behavior of EXT self-assembly. These studies showed that EXT monomers<br/>spontaneously self-assemble into intricate dendritic scaffolds. Furthermore, different<br/>EXT types displayed different self-assembly behaviors, whereby some EXTs favored<br/>more xy-plane growth (termed ?branching?), while others displayed z-plane growth<br/>(termed ?stacking?). These changes were attributed to differences in the repetitive,<br/>modular, and amphiphilic nature exhibited by different EXTs. To better understand the<br/>molecular drivers of EXT self-assembly, three objectives are proposed.

Though the microservices architecture has many advantages, it has one critical drawback.  Observing how user requests (e.g., to buy a book) are processed by services is extremely challenging because they involve myriad interactions among many simpler (micro)services.  This lack of observability complicates important management tasks, such as problem diagnosis and resource management.  Previous research has demonstrated the strong potential of distributed tracing---which captures graphs of how microservices interact to process requests---to provide microservice observability.  But, results in real-world settings have been disappointing.  This gap between potential and reality occurs because research efforts assume principled trace graphs that capture a variety of behaviors and have no data loss.  But, in practice, services are never well-instrumented and data loss is common.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to create a new tracing platform that automatically infers the data needed to make traces principled. Doing so will actualize distributed tracings' vast potential for microservice observability, improve the utility of existing tracing-based management tools, and enable transformative new tools. These outcomes will improve the resiliency and efficiency of the software services society depends on.  Insights from this project will inform age-appropriate course material and projects in a college course on debugging cloud systems, a high-school research program, and a middle-school outreach program.<br/><br/>This project proposes a novel tracing platform that automatically enriches span-based traces with two sets of primitives.  1) The happens-before concurrency/wait primitives and 2) the holes and holes covering primitives.  The former allows requests' critical paths to be identified, enabling slack analyses, targeted performance debugging, and precise resource allocation decisions.  The latter allows areas of data loss to be expressed in traces along with predictions of what work might execute in them.  Since scheduling decisions may obfuscate causal structure, the project will investigate active probing methods to tease out concurrent and waiting relationships.  To account for uncertainty, it will explore probabilistic data models to represent the primitives.  The project will demonstrate the value of the primitives by modifying an existing auto-scaling solution and performance-debugging tool to use them.  It will also demonstrate a new trace subgraph sampling approach made possible by the holes and holes covering primitive.  The proposed platform, improved management tools, and inference methods will be publicly available to benefit the computer science and microservice observability communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How individuals perceive social touch depends on many factors, including their reproductive state. One important example of this influence of reproductive state is that postpartum mothers find touch cues from infants extremely positive, which is essential for highly sensitive maternal caregiving and offspring development. There is very little scientific knowledge about how the maternal brain changes across pregnancy and early postpartum to promote the positive perception of infant touch. This project will study how specific areas of the cerebral cortex that receive touch-related information become more sensitive to infant touch cues as pregnancy progresses and as mothers gain early caregiving experience. This project will also broaden educational opportunities and scientific outreach through new student education courses, new research experiences for students, public zoo and museum exhibits, and by mentoring the next generation of brain scientists from underrepresented groups. The scientific approach and techniques used in these studies will be taught to students from a range of ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds, with the goal of attracting them to this field and increasing diversity in the biological and behavioral sciences. <br/> <br/>The experiments in this project will investigate the neural basis of maternal positive receptivity to offspring touch, with a focus on the role of cortical perineuronal nets (PNNs). Female reproduction and the onset of motherhood involve widespread neuroplasticity that underlies this critical social interaction. Importantly, this neuroplasticity occurs in cortical sites involved in processing touch, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1; mediates tactile discrimination) and the insular cortex (IC; processes affective components of touch). Cortical plasticity is regulated by perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures surrounding the somata and proximal dendrites of parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons. PNNs are physical and molecular barriers to synaptic plasticity and expression of these ?master regulators? of plasticity changes across times of significant sensory and behavioral flux. Recent experiments reported impaired maternal behavior associated with PNN overexpression in the rat S1 facial microvibrissae area. The current project tests the overarching hypothesis that female reproduction involves changes in PNN expression in S1 and IC, and that these changes alter cortical function critical for tactile regulation of maternal caregiving. This hypothesis will be tested in female rats by: (1) using histochemistry and rt-qPCR to determine changes in PNNs and associated mRNAs in S1 and IC across natural female reproduction, in response to exogenous steroid hormones mimicking pregnancy, and in response to repeated pup exposure and (2) using viral and chemical strategies to determine the effects of PNN underexpression or overexpression in the S1 or IC on maternal caregiving behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen peroxide is an important product for numerous applications including clean water and as an efficient oxidant in chemicals manufacturing. However, it is currently produced at industrial scale via an indirect process that involves reactions of organic chemicals and requires large scales to be economical. For distributed manufacturing, it is desirable to develop a ?greener? process that directly reacts hydrogen with oxygen. However, new catalysts are needed to accelerate the rate of hydrogen peroxide synthesis and avoid side reactions that lead to complete hydrogen oxidation to water. Recent work has suggested that the application of certain organic coatings to common supported metal catalysts can improve hydrogen peroxide synthesis yields, however the way these improve performance is not understood.  Professors Nikolla and Medlin and their teams will systematically vary the properties of the organic-metal interface to identify molecular features associated with high hydrogen peroxide yields. They will also conduct reaction kinetic studies to understand how interactions between the reactants and organic coatings specifically lead to enhanced rates. The research will be carried out by a multi-institutional team that includes collaboration with international and national laboratory partners. The educational component of the project will include training and exchange programs for graduate and undergraduate students and development of new online educational tools related to the research problem.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professors Eranda Nikolla of the University of Michigan and Will Medlin of the University of Colorado Boulder are studying how the near-surface environment influences direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis on supported metal catalysts. Organic ligands are widely used in the synthesis of metal nanocrystals that can be employed as well-defined catalysts. While in many cases it is desirable to remove the ligands, in other instances the retention of ligands can lead to desirable catalyst performance. One important example in which ligand effects have been found to yield major selectivity improvements is the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from H2 and O2 over Pd catalysts. While there have been some indications that the ligands function via (i) blocking of contiguous surface sites responsible for O2 activation and (ii) promotion of proton shuttling to adsorbed O2, the elementary-step mechanisms by which the coatings enhance selectivity in H2O2 direct synthesis are poorly understood. To develop structure-reactivity relations for hydrogen peroxide synthesis, Professors Nikolla and Medlin will systematically vary (a) the structure and density of ligands, (b) the metal nanoparticle size, shape, and composition, and (c) the solvent properties. The prepared materials will be characterized in depth and utilized in kinetic studies to understand the origins of selective catalysis. The project will involve collaborative efforts in nanoparticle synthesis, characterization of ligand-protected catalysts, reaction kinetic studies, and computational studies of chemistry at organic-modified metal surfaces. Although the project will emphasize the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, the principles developed here can be extrapolated to diverse catalytic reactions, particularly since the elementary steps in direct synthesis and its undesired side reactions are broadly important in many chemistries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, in the process, it was seen that a more straightforward explanation is preferred -- embodied in the famous Occam's razor or principle of parsimony. With a similar goal, this project conducts fundamental research seeking to advance the state-of-the-art in understanding the parsimonious principles of physics governing the behavior of a complex physical system under uncertainty. The resulting software framework enables the users to utilize data from a wide range of physical systems to unlock the important aspects of their behavior by analyzing the identified mathematical equations. With this framework, the project investigator provides the community of researchers and educators with a powerful and amenable tool to comprehend and predict the actual behavior of various real-world systems in the presence of uncertainty. <br/><br/>Harnessing already developed knowledge in understanding simplified physical systems with similar behavior, the framework builds a novel paradigm using interpretable deep learning for discovering parsimonious governing equations to describe the behavior of complex physical systems under uncertainty. New approaches to utilizing low-fidelity models in defining the system's behavior are also explored, providing even more computationally efficient tools to incorporate prior knowledge. These advancements and the developed software allow the framework to be applied to various application domains. The framework is evaluated with testbed problems such as the behavior of a 20-story building and a benchmark turbulence modeling problem. Furthermore, the resulting framework is applied to other critical problems of complex nature through collaborations, e.g., the spread of wildland fires, enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and the spread of pollutant plumes. The project also emphasizes the importance of identifying parsimonious governing equations to describe the behavior of complex systems through education and outreach activities. Results from the project are submitted to reputable journals and presented at national and international conferences. One graduate student is mentored as part of the project, and findings are incorporated into an undergraduate probability and machine learning course. K-12 outreach efforts led by the project investigator include modules on the discovery of equations, machine learning basics, and using software to infer from data based on the research outputs from this project presented at middle/high school summer workshop programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While existing research explores the wellbeing of employees in single teams, there's a gap in understanding how being part of multiple teams influences the experiences and overall wellbeing of individual team members and teams in organizations. This project addresses the relationship between multiple team membership (MTM) and wellbeing, crucial for organizational productivity. Individuals navigating multiple virtual teams experience ?context variety.? In other words, they move between diverse technological, task-related, and socio-psychological contexts. This includes using different platforms and emerging technologies (e.g., AI nudging tools), facing varying task requirements, and experiencing different levels of inclusion and psychological safety across teams. Despite being a common experience, prior research hasn't explored how team context variety influences individuals? and the entire team?s wellbeing, including both positive and negative outcomes, such as excitement or burnout. This research aims to integrate scholarly perspectives on teams, management information systems, and human resources, contributing to a richer theoretical understanding of MTM dynamics. The outcomes will contribute to improving workers' wellbeing and fostering inclusive work environments.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to: a) understand how technology, task, and socio-psychological variety across teams affect individual and team wellbeing when team members are simultaneously members of multiple teams, and b) to help organizations, managers, and employees design supportive workplace experiences. The project focuses on multiple levels of analyses: the individual, the single team, and the meso-level, which is defined as a liminal space across multiple teams within an organization. The research team relies on a mixed method approach, including interviews to capture a holistic view of the lived experiences of multiple team membership of knowledge workers and develop a theoretical model, experiments to granularly analyze technology affordances, and surveys to confirm the proposed theoretical model we develop and to better capture variety in task and socio-psychological contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For scientists to understand how these cellular cities function, they need to map where each protein citizen lives and works. However, this is quite a challenge because current scientific tools are either not detailed enough or only focus on a few proteins at a time. This NSF CAREER project introduces a new method named Optogel Proteomics, which acts like a high-tech GPS to track proteins with remarkable precision that is smaller than a single cell. By using hydrogels and a powerful microscope, the investigators will isolate and study proteins from exact locations within the cell. The first mission is to explore the nuclear lamina, a meshwork wrapping a cell's nucleus that can change due to cancer or aging, to discover what proteins are present and how they may influence cancer progression and the aging process. This project not only aims to pioneer this new technology but also to share it widely, enhancing research in biology and engineering. Additionally, the project?s leader, a woman scientist, is dedicated to bridging the gender gap in science through special camps and workshops, empowering the next generation of female scientists. <br/> <br/>This NSF CAREER project seeks to overcome the limitations of subcellular spatial proteomics through the development of Optogel Proteomics. By employing expansion microscopy, photoreactions, and multi-photon microscopy, proteins within precise subcellular locations can be isolated and subsequently analyzed via mass spectrometry (MS). The project's objective is to provide an unbiased, high-resolution proteomic analysis of subcellular structures, with an initial focus on the nuclear lamina, which has been implicated in cancer-related and age-related heterochromatin loss. The novel Optogel Proteomics will be validated against the newly developed super-resolution microscopy method, Label-Retention Expansion Microscopy (LR-ExM). The broader impacts include the dissemination of Optogel Proteomics and LR-ExM, enhancing research capacity in life sciences at minimal costs.

Does it flow slowly through the mantle, or quickly through melt-rich channels? Answering this question will help understand where seafloor volcanoes form and how frequently they erupt. The project will acquire new geophysical and geological data in the Galapagos islands. This region has volcanism all the way from the main archipelago to the mid-ocean ridge a few hundred km away. The investigators will combine the new data with theoretical modeling to test different models for magma flow. The results will be important for other locations such as Reunion Island, Azores Islands, and Easter Island as well as global subduction zones. Broader impacts include support and training of a graduate student and postdoctoral scholar, opportunities for early career scientists to participate in the research cruise, collaboration with the Charles Darwin Foundation in Galapagos, and outreach to the public and K-12 students.

Whilst these systems carry out their main function, which is computation, they inadvertently generate traces that could potentially disclose sensitive information through alternative physical or digital pathways known as ?side-channels.? As we become increasingly dependent upon computing systems, it is more critical than ever to know how side-channel signals can be created, how side-channel leakage can be modeled, and how future software systems should be designed to be robust against side-channel attacks. This proposal explores new methods and tools for quantifying and modeling side-channels for a wide range of processors. Successful completion of this project brings new methods, findings, and open-source tools for analyzing and quantifying side-channels. Various designers and industries can gain advantages from these techniques and tools, including hardware designers, computer architects, compiler designers, and software developers. Our findings enable the construction of secure software systems while reducing cost and time-to-market. As an integral part of this research program, we also propose an educational agenda involving K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and broader security community education.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research proposal is to build a comprehensive tool for side-channel leakage analysis. To achieve this, we first need to improve our modeling capabilities, particularly for physical side-channels, and then focus on integrating these models into established simulation and analysis tools. Based on these needs, our proposal is structured into two research thrusts and an evaluation plan. Each thrust is further broken down into three main research objectives. The first thrust is focused on building an accurate tool to estimate power and electromagnetic (EM) side-channels at the software level. Using three research objectives, we plan to build a model that can accurately model various processor architectures as well as other important components (e.g., accelerators) on a system-on-chip (SoC). The second thrust is focused on modeling microarchitectural side-channels. Specifically, the main goal is to build a new tool that can combine established binary analysis tools with known side-channel leakage models. The ideas proposed will be evaluated using a detailed evaluation plan. We will apply our methods to a wide variety of systems and setups with different hardware and software designs. We will consider various scenarios including different microarchitecture designs (in-order, out-of-order, multicore) and different side-channels (physical electromagnetic signals, digital cache side-channels, transient/speculative side-channels).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent innovations in financial technology (fintech) have dramatically reshaped the consumer loan market, including the rise of ?fringetech??digital financial technologies designed to compete with traditional AFS. Yet, we know little about the potentially significant economic and policy consequences of fringetech use for households who are struggling financially?especially low-wage workers who are relying on fringetech in growing numbers.

Findings will be disseminated to help inform emerging debates at the federal and state level about how best to regulate these new financial technologies. The project will also help train a diverse cohort of future scholars and practitioners in finance and fintech research. <br/><br/>This CAREER research and teaching grant will achieve the following objectives: 1) analyze original, large-n survey data to systematically describe when and how different cohorts use fringetech to navigate liquidity problems; 2) utilize original qualitative borrower interviews and a dataset on state welfare, financial protection, and wage laws to analyze how state subsystems shape fringetech use for different cohorts; 3) analyze whether and how people?s fringetech use influences their preferences for economic rules and their public participation; 4) establish a topical lab and course, based on principles of inclusive pedagogy, to promote interest in and research concerning fringetech from students historically underrepresented in those fields; and 5) produce and disseminate research to inform emerging federal and state fringetech regulation, and create publicly available scorecards to help people track fringetech consumer protection in their state. This project will contribute to theories of 1) the welfare state, exploring how state welfare regimes influence financial decision-making; 2) participation, generating a theory of fringetech as a resource for civic engagement; and 3) feedback effects, analyzing how the design and implementation of state financial regulations shape people?s preferences.

However, current account security logs offer unreliable and coarse-grained information for users to differentiate their logins from attackers' logins. Limited data, such as device model and approximate city or province based on IP addresses, can be easily spoofed by attackers, especially in cases of interpersonal attacks. Interpersonal attackers know the victims personally; they may be an intimate partner, family member, friend, or colleague. An interpersonal attacker may live in the same house or town and possess devices with identical models as the victim, making it challenging for victims to conclusively detect unauthorized logins by their attackers.  The key problem here is twofold: (a) there is no unique and non-spoofable device identifier that preserves user privacy, and (b) humans and online services identify physical devices differently. In this project, we aim to tackle these issues by developing a framework of device identifiers that can uniquely identify a device while preserving users' privacy and users are able to recognize and associate those ids with their respective physical device, bridging the disconnect between the methods of identifying devices by humans and software.<br/><br/>This project is designing, implementing, and evaluating novel ways to improve account security logs to enhance unauthorized login detection. The objectives of the project are to (a) design and implement a protocol for deriving unique yet privacy preserving identifiers of devices; (b) explore methods to familiarize users with such device identifiers without disrupting their user experience, and (c) redesign account security logs to incorporate such identifiers and measure their efficacy in detecting unauthorized logs. The broader impacts of the project include: (1) producing guidelines and engaging with developers of online services to enhance account security mechanisms, (2) deploying unauthorized login detection with Madison Tech Clinic (MTC) and Clinic to End Tech Abuse (CETA) in New York City to support survivors of IA, (3) teaching students about nuanced threat models, like those of IA, and (4) increasing the participation of students from minority backgrounds, such as women and LGBTQ+ students, by providing a space to engage and influence technologies with real-world impact on their lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zooplankton include many different types of organisms that can be broadly categorized as crustacean or gelatinous, with most fish and whales preferring crustaceans as a fat-rich food source over gelatinous animals, which are higher in water content. Historically, the California Current ecosystem off the U.S. West Coast has been dominated by crustacean zooplankton, such as krill and copepods, but in 2014 there were huge abundances of a type of colonial, gelatinous zooplankton known as pyrosomes, which caused widespread damage to fisheries by fouling fishing gear and dominating catch. Although the arrival of pyrosomes coincided with an extensive marine heatwave, lower abundances have since persisted despite a return to cooler ocean temperatures. Analysis of time series data from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) indicate that pyrosomes were also observed in the California Current many decades ago when the ocean was not particularly warm. This study combines analysis of past samples from CalCOFI, ocean circulation models, and biological models to understand the causes of these quickly growing pyrosome populations in the California Current.  It supports training for undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, the project is reaching K-12 students through a unique partnership with the San Diego County Office of Education that is developing Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-aligned resources for middle and high school science teachers in California. The educational resources are being disseminated through the California Science Project and California Environmental Literacy Initiative. Public outreach in San Diego (CA) is through the Enhancing Your Horizons San Diego conference and the San Diego Regional Competition of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl, and in Santa Cruz (CA) through the Seymour Marine Discovery Center.<br/><br/>Predicting how ecosystems respond to accelerating climate change is a major challenge. The recent appearance of the pyrosome Pyrosoma atlanticum in the California Current is a major perturbation to the ecosystem, and the cause remains unknown. Both ocean physics and plankton food-web dynamics are key determinants of variability in pelagic community composition in this ecosystem, yet unraveling the degree to which variability in physics (through warming and advection) combines with shifting biological interactions (through nutrient cycling and altered food-web dynamics) to determine composition and function is complicated. This project combines the analysis of past historical samples from seven decades of the CalCOFI time series, data-assimilative and non-data assimilative ocean circulation models, and biological population models to determine the role ocean physics and biological interactions have played in shaping pyrosome abundance, trophic dynamics, and population growth and mortality in the California Current.

Application of large pretrained models to customized tasks or new data is difficult since full retraining of the model is not possible due to the huge size and inaccesibility of the original training data.  The inaccessibility and large size of the training data also renders traditional domain adaptation techniques impractical. To overcome this challenge there has been shift towards modular adaptation methods that enable the fine-tuning of ""frozen"" pretrained models with minimal or no modifications to their internal parameters. Despite the success of these methods in some practical applications, there is a gap in theoretical understanding of the factors affecting the effectiveness of finetuning of pretrained models. This project develops a systematic framework that will lay theoretical foundations and lead to rigorous fine-tuning principles. The project has the potential to impact a wide range of scientific fields and industries that rely on adaptation of pretrained machine learning models. The project's broader impact includes the establishment of educational initiatives for advancing STEM, contributing to the development of the future workforce in modern machine learning.<br/><br/>The project's goal is to establish a unified theory and devise new algorithms with provable guarantees for the emerging paradigm of learning with frozen pretrained models. A mathematical framework will be developed to facilitate the theoretical analysis of the expressive power of frozen pretrained models under various adaptation and fine-tuning methods. The project will investigate three adaptation strategies: (1) parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which updates a minimal portion of the pretrained model's parameters while keeping the rest unchanged; (2) input/output processing, which involves modifying the input entering or the output produced by the pretrained models; and (3) model composition, which constructs a system of multiple pretrained models to address more complex tasks. In addition to analyzing these methods, the project aims to develop novel adaptation algorithms with provable performance guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When this stretching reaches a critical level, the magnetic field lines reconnect, rapidly releasing the stored energy while powering important space weather effects, such as magnetospheric substorms, that can be hazardous to satellites and the power grid on Earth.  Understanding the physics describing the stretched magnetotail and reconnection onset is crucial to modeling and predicting space weather phenomena.  Reconnection onset requires the magnetotail current sheet (CS) to thin down to the scales of the plasma particles, such as protons or even electrons orbits, which are nearly microscopic compared to the vast expanse of the magnetotail.  This project aims to investigate the structure, stability, and reconnection regimes of these overstretched CSs to understand the mechanism of reconnection onset in the magnetotail and explain its observed location far outside the near-Earth region.  The data-mining component of the research will contribute to the relatively under-investigated area of machine learning dealing with little and sparse rather than big data.  The broader impacts of this project include hands-on research training for a graduate student, the career development of early career scientists, and interdisciplinary applications to the methodology developed.<br/><br/>The onset of reconnection in the magnetotail requires its current sheet (CS) to thin down to the thermal ion gyroradius (or thinner) to demagnetize ions (or even electrons) and to provide their Landau dissipation.  However, in isotropic plasmas, the ion-scale CSs inflate too rapidly with the distance from Earth to remain ion-scale at and beyond ~20 Earth?s radii, where most X-lines are observed.  A key to solving this problem was recently found due to the discovery of ?overstretched? thin CS (OTCS): If an ion-scale CS is embedded into a much thicker CS with even a weak field-aligned ion anisotropy, its current density iso contours can be stretched way more than the magnetic field lines.  The goal of this project is to investigate the structure, stability, and reconnection regimes of OTCSs to answer the following fundamental science question: What is the mechanism of the reconnection onset in the magnetotail, which explains its observed location far outside the near-Earth region, and what are its global implications?  The effects of the negative CS charging and electron current domination suggested by recent observations, interplay between tearing and ballooning/interchange modes, as well as roles of external driving and local magnetic flux accumulation, will be investigated using new OTCS equilibria in 2D and 3D PIC simulations.  The impact of OTCS on the global scale structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere will be assessed by adding their empirical reconstructions obtained by mining a multi-mission and multi-decade database of spaceborne magnetometers and new-generation magnetic field architectures to a global MHD model of the magnetosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will be conducted in multilateral partnership uniting Carnegie Melon University (US), Tallinn University of Technology (Estonia), and V.N.Karazin Kharkiv National University (Ukraine). US part of the international research team is co-funded by NSF OISE/OD and CISE/CNS. <br/><br/>Cryptographic algorithms allow us to send secret messages over an otherwise insecure communication channel, such as the internet. These algorithms are extremely important since they enable several aspects of our digital lives, be it online banking, messaging services, mobile phone networks, and many more. To realize such protected communications and maintain the privacy of the parties talking to each other, government agencies set cryptographic standards for adoption. These standards serve as a common language for two devices to talk to one another while keeping the content of the exchange messages protected. For instance, in the US, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends, among others, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption/decryption in civilian communication. AES was chosen after a long competition where many candidates were considered and AES came out as the winning algorithm. Today, there are hundreds of implementations of AES in software form or in pure hardware form, i.e., implemented as a computer chip.<br/> <br/>Outside the US, many other standards exist. In Ukraine, a competition was also held which culminated in 2015 with the selection of Kalyna and Kupyna as the national standards. The existing software implementations of Kalyna and Kupyna have performance and security level comparable to their US counterparts. However, there is no known hardware architecture for the design of Kalyna or Kupyna. There is a need for Kalyna/Kupyna-capable hardware that displays (i) high performance; (ii) low power; (iii) tamper resistance; (iv) small footprint; and (v) physical security. This is the technical goal of this EAGER award, i.e., to execute a broad design space and security space exploration for the implementation of a block cipher (Kalyna) and a hash algorithm (Kupyna). This EAGER project represents a study on how to best implement these algorithms in a computer chip. The research team includes chip designers from the US and from Estonia, as well cryptography experts from Ukraine. The main technical outcome of the project is one fabricated chip containing several variants of the Kalyna and Kupyna algorithms. <br/><br/>This EAGER award also has dissemination goals. Knowingly, the country of Ukraine does not enjoy access to trusted chip fabrication technology. Chip design knowledge is also scarce. We strive to have Ukrainian universities teaching, in the near future, both software and hardware cryptographic engineering. The latter is specific knowledge that, today, is not adequately covered by any university in the country. In order to achieve this goal, the chip design tasks executed in this project will be highly reproducible: design resources will be openly shared on public repositories, including Verilog source files. Synthesis scripts for state-of-the-art commercial chip design tools will also be shared. Finally, the entire design process will be documented in order to showcase the entire concept of the Kalyna/Kupyna chip, step by step, from RTL to layout. This documented effort will be made openly available to the chip design and cryptographic communities at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Isogeny-based cryptography bases its security on the hardness of path-finding in isogeny graphs, and the path-finding problem is believed to be hard even for quantum computers. Based on this, isogeny-based cryptosystems are believed to be secure even in a post-quantum world. This project will focus on studying the structure of isogeny graphs in order to uncover faster algorithms for computing paths and cycles, leading to a better understanding of the security of isogeny-based cryptosystems. These cryptosystems could one day help secure the modern internet, so a concrete understanding of their security, and hence a concrete understanding of the difficulty of path-finding in isogeny graphs, is imperative. The research component is complemented by educational activities focused on incorporating project-based learning involving programming in undergraduate mathematics courses on number theory and cryptography.<br/><br/><br/>Isogeny-based cryptosystems base their security on the difficulty of computing an isogeny between two given supersingular elliptic curves. Such cryptosystems are attractive for their small public keys and their supposed resistance to quantum attacks. SIKE, the lone isogeny-based KEM in the NIST process, was recently completely broken after over a decade of cryptanalysis, highlighting the necessity of relying on the general isogeny problem instead of a weaker one. The general supersingular isogeny problem is equivalent to the problem of computing the endomorphism ring of a given supersingular elliptic curve. The primary research goal for this project is to design and analyze algorithms for computing the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve. The second theme of the project aims to determine the expansion properties of isogeny graphs whose mixing rates have yet to be determined. These generalizations of isogeny graphs could have cryptographic applications so it is important to study their expansion properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to control the photochemical outcome and reaction selectivity through modulating the energy of the light source. Results from this project have the potential to enable faster and tunable reactions which are relevant in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals. This work provides a solid interdisciplinary training platform in the fields of photochemistry, synthesis, spectroscopy, redox, and kinetics for scientists at all levels.

In the developed systems, two different reactive high-valent metal-oxo intermediates are accessible through the photoactivation of two unique metal-oxo bonds which are driven from charge transfer excited states. In this project, the structure-function relationships of the developed oxo-bridged constructs will be investigated to understand how and to what extent electronic exchange coupling between the individual catalytic sites through an oxo bridging ligand in the ground state impacts the charge transfer transitions and how this coupling manifests itself in overall photoactivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physical computing tools, such as robots, can help children develop CS understanding; however, most robots currently available to elementary teachers are relatively expensive and offer little flexibility in terms of which concepts they allow students to learn and how learning happens. The research aims to understand the assets that students and teachers bring to the activities, and capture feedback on implementation from the students and teachers to improve the robot design. The project is potentially transformative in its goal to use Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to create a robot that is more responsive to the range of student abilities found across elementary and middle school classrooms. The project aims to help students develop CS and executive functioning skills such as self-control and planning, which are crucial to school success and successful STEM careers. It also aims to help teachers develop confidence and fluency in integrating CS content into their day-to-day work with students.<br/><br/>This project builds on prior collaborations that yielded a low-cost, working prototype that is adaptable for use in kindergarten settings up to middle school and beyond for a ?low-floor and high-ceiling? functionality and extendibility. The research will implement activities featuring the robot in urban and rural elementary classrooms in Virginia school districts to investigate students? development of CS and executive functioning skills as well as student interest in STEM and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The project will use design-based research methods to explore how teachers scaffold CS learning activities within their classrooms and how to create educational robots and associated materials for students with and without disabilities at the K-12, 3-5 and 6-8 grade bands. The project aims to work with 18 elementary and middle school teachers, with over 1700 students using the robot and associated activities.

Graph theory is a powerful mathematical tool that can enumerate all possible pathways between manufacturing steps using specific rules of connectivity and can produce a ranked list of feasible pathways given case-specific criteria. However, the top-ranked pathways may still lead to concerns regarding overall process resilience - for example, a wastewater treatment facility faces failure risks due to infrastructure aging or extreme weather events. Thus, resilience, defined as the capability to withstand failures and recover from them, is incorporated as an additional metric. Machine learning algorithms can predict risk and failure probabilities from past operational data, which enables resilience evaluation of each feasible pathway. This research program will integrate graph theory and machine learning to fundamentally enhance process synthesis algorithms to generate cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and robust solutions that can be easily adapted to other chemical manufacturing operations, such as plastics recycling or solvent recovery in pharmaceuticals manufacturing. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students, this project will also contribute to the development of open-access educational modules and process systems case studies that feature environmental and social justice themes. Interactive activities for K-12 STEM outreach and competitions will be conducted for students and teachers from underserved communities in the southern New Jersey region.<br/><br/>A key limitation when designing chemical process networks is that the final design is only as good as the initial structural enumeration (superstructure), a large, complex network of chemical processing path options that must currently be defined by the design engineer. Existing superstructure synthesis methods are largely based on heuristics which can sometimes lead to suboptimality since there is no guarantee that all feasible paths have been captured in the initial enumeration. In this project, graph theory will be employed to generate an exhaustive enumeration of the overall process network (in this project a wastewater treatment plant network) through well-defined axioms and a maximal structure generation algorithm, wherein the possible process pathways are represented via the connection of materials and process technology nodes with arcs that represent stream flows. This exhaustive enumeration is followed by feasible pathway analysis to generate a ranked list of solution structures based on cost, energy use, environmental impact, and resilience metrics through a novel two-layer process synthesis algorithm that includes combinatorial, linear, and nonlinear model equations and solvers. The integration of machine learning for regression, classification, and feature importance modeling based on available wastewater treatment plant data and asset inventory will allow for timely prediction of risk and failure probabilities due to aging and extreme events. This enhanced process synthesis methodology will lead to non-intuitive, innovative, cost-effective, sustainable, and robust solutions that will enable stakeholders, such as municipalities and water utility companies, to make informed decisions when designing new facilities or retrofitting existing facilities. Materials developed as part of this project will include computational algorithms, codes, user manuals, tutorials, technical papers, conference presentations, educational materials, factsheets, and K-12 outreach plans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applying an alternating current (AC) electric field to electrolytes in a solution causes them to migrate because of their charge properties. This phenomenon is used in many important applications, including supercapacitors, high-rate batteries, and cellular and biomolecular manipulation like cell sorting. AC electric fields can be regular waves of alternating voltage (spatially uniform) or less predictable, irregular waves (spatially non-uniform). Scientists have assumed that applying AC voltages to an electrolyte solution encourages the electrolytes to migrate in a way that does not affect the overall bulk solution properties. However, recent research studies revealed that electrolyte bulk solution properties change when a spatially non-uniform AC electric field is applied. Effects such as flow reversal, pH shifts, solution osmotic pressure change, and the generation of ion concentration gradients were observed. This project?s objective is to understand how electrolytes and other charged particles respond to spatially non-uniform AC electric fields in bulk solutions over extended periods. This fundamental knowledge can be applied to develop novel technologies for molecular biosensing, water desalination, and high-throughput drug screening assays. The project will also support STEM outreach and educational activities. It aims to develop industrially relevant skillsets for graduate and undergraduate students through interactions with industrial leaders and industry-informed student projects. The investigator also aims to cultivate interest in STEM education and technology-driven solutions to enhance healthcare and societal well-being among high school students from underserved communities.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that the biased AC electromigration under spatially non-uniform AC electric fields facilitates the directed enrichment and generation of concentration gradients of biochemically relevant charged species in bulk aqueous phase and biofluids. The specific research objectives are to (A) engineer a new system for isolating confounding variables from biased AC electromigration, (B) interrogate the influence of spatially non-uniform AC electric field properties on biased AC electromigration behaviors of designated charged species, and (C) elucidate the influence of charged species? intrinsic properties on their biased AC electromigration behavior under designated spatially non-uniform AC electric fields. This project will provide a fundamental understanding of the behaviors of charged species under spatially non-uniform AC electric fields in the bulk solution beyond the electric double layer and at longer times than previously studied (>60 seconds). This fundamental understanding of biased AC electromigration is broadly relevant to many scientific communities; it can be applied to develop technologies that (1) selectively enrich or deplete biomolecules, which will improve the sensitivity and accuracy of biosensing by allowing the detection of concentrations of target molecules that are otherwise below detection limits and (2) generate spatially and temporally controllable and quantifiable two- and three-dimensional gradients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, building a mobile robot is challenging and expensive because robot system developers struggle to cost-effectively build, test, and maintain reliable software. There is a gap in our knowledge of the robotic system development process that hinders building software tooling to support that process. With current tools and techniques, it is especially hard to build a prototype robot that can be upgraded into a safe, reliable, and dependable mobile robot without having to start from scratch. This project aims to create lightweight techniques and software tools that help robot system developers build safer and more capable robots while remaining economically feasible. This work leverages advances in video game development tools to make it easier to test what a mobile robot should and should not do. Building mobile robots requires expertise in several areas, including electrical, mechanical, and software engineering, and coordinating information across these areas can be challenging. In addition to building special software tools, this project puts research and teaching together so that recent advances in engineering, called model-based engineering, can prepare students to be part of an interdisciplinary future workforce that can build, operate, and maintain more reliable mobile robots.<br/><br/>This project utilizes model checking of behavior trees and abstract type inference of physical units to automatically suggest system tests and to help ensure the absence of certain classes of software defects. Automated program analysis and testing are fundamental parts of modern software's continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), but robot developers struggle to automate, track, and assess system testing efforts. Current techniques fall short of the demands of heterogeneous co-evolution of software/hardware systems, especially when systems are validated in the field. The project aims to develop techniques for inferring robotic system test cases from existing artifacts that robot system developers are already using. Additionally, this project seeks to create techniques for inferring and comparing groups of physical units that are commonly used together to better understand programs and discover novel patterns in how physical units are used in robotic system implementations. The expected outcomes of this project include creating a software tool that helps developers detect and track the physical units that co-occur in their software, creating a tool that helps robot system developers measure how much of a behavior tree their system has exercised, and developing test case prioritization strategies for field testing of mobile robotic systems. This research applies notions of model-based test coverage from software engineering to robot autonomy, and a goal of this research area is to lower the barriers to applying formal methods to robotic software systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of what we understand about these alternations comes from organisms like animals and land plants in which one of the two stages dominates the life cycle with the other small and short-lived. However, across the tree of life there are countless examples of organisms in which both stages are of long duration, multicellular, or both. These life cycles challenge common ideas used to explain ecological and evolutionary patterns we see in nature. Macroalgae (seaweeds) display a wide range of life cycle types and consequently are excellent models to test and expand ideas about how life cycles evolve. Undersea forests of seaweeds with a variety of life cycle types dominate the shallow waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula where they are ecologically important and, for most of the species, at the southern end of their geographic range. Using existing samples from previous expeditions to Antarctica, the investigators are uniquely positioned to test and expand knowledge of life cycle evolution and how this intersects with reproductive mode variation. This project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the public. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar as well as a faculty member new to US Antarctic research.

Not only will genetic diversity be documented for an understudied and critical group of Antarctic organisms, but how it changes with latitude, compounded by high levels of endemism, will be explored. This will be accomplished by (i) characterization of latitudinal gradients in genetic diversity of many species and (ii) determination of the reproductive system of five focal foundation species. At present, there are few genetic data for macroalgae, dominant primary producers in coastal ecosystems around the world. This gap is particularly acute along Antarctic coastlines that are experiencing rapid climate change. Furthermore, Antarctica is isolated by the Southern Ocean, decreasing the likelihood of regular migration from other land masses. Latitudinal reproductive system patterns are predicted to be largely driven by recolonization events that increase with latitude due to changes in iceberg scour and sea ice coverage. Thus, Antarctica is the best place to understand what processes underlie reproductive mode variation in populations that are isolated, including many endemic taxa, while simultaneously extending our knowledge about how marginal environments converge with complex life cycles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the behaviors and functions of cells are regulated by physical cues from their microenvironment, emerging research has suggested that the altered mechanics of tumor tissue plays a crucial role in the progression of metastatic cancers. To understand the relationship between the properties of the microenvironment and tumor growth, it is essential to quantify these mechanical properties with high spatial resolution in three dimensions. However, existing mechanical testing tools are mostly contact-based and invasive, making such measurement highly challenging. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to address the current technical challenge by developing an optical technology named photoacoustic-Brillouin microscopy (PABM), which can measure the mechanical properties of cancer cells and their microenvironment in a non-contact, non-invasive, and high-resolution manner. In concert with the research goal, this project will develop educational modules to promote the dissemination of the innovative Brillouin technology and to stimulate a lasting interest in biophotonics for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.<br/><br/>Confocal Brillouin microscopy has been recently demonstrated as a promising non-contact mechanical testing tool. However, due to the lack of knowledge on refractive index and density of the sample under test, existing Brillouin microscopy is mostly used to estimate the relative mechanical change, rather than to provide an absolute measurement of mechanical modulus, making it inapplicable for heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, benchmarking, and comparison across studies. In this project, a novel optical technique named PABM will be developed based on the colocalized excitation of scattered Brillouin light and time-resolved photoacoustic signals. In addition to directly quantifying mechanical modulus, the PABM can provide complementary contrast mechanisms, including stiffness, optical absorption, and acoustic speed. This capability will enable a comprehensive understanding of heterogeneous processes in tumor growth. Taken together, the PABM addresses a significant gap in current cancer research methodologies. The new data and insights gained from this technology holds a unique potential to advance a wide range of research in both biophotonics and cancer diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a broad field to study, so important distinctions are made based on how the class of structures is described (or axiomatized). If the class is describable in first-order logic, it is called an elementary class. First-order logic has many powerful properties, especially the property of compactness. Compactness allows model theorists to build structures with exotic properties and has driven much of the model theory of elementary classes, most notably classification theory. However, many classes of structures are not describable in first-order logic (these are called nonelementary classes). Lacking compactness, the development of nonelementary model theory and classification theory has proceeded much slower than its elementary counterpart. Recent work in nonelementary classes has shown that various fragments of compactness can still hold in some nonelementary classes and are still powerful enough to prove various results of elementary classification theory. The PI will develop more of these fragments in nonelementary classes. Additionally, the PI will run a program to build research infrastructure at their home institution (an R2 institution and HSI).  This program will support undergraduates conducting research in logic, supported by a speaker series that will build connections between expert logicians and faculty and students.<br/><br/>This research will develop fragments of compactness in a variety of ways.  From category theory, methods from accessible categories and from topoi will be used to find compactness principles in certain nonelementary classes.  Drawing on model theory and set theory, generalized indiscernibles and generalizations of the Erdos-Rado theorem will find compactness principles that hold in all nonelementary classes.  Further drawing on set theory, the connections between large cardinals and compactness principles (along with other model-theoretic ideas) will be extended.  The connections formed in categorical logic will be extended to higher category theory to open new areas for model theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The setting of this project is that of abstract elementary classes (AECs for short) which is a setting where one can study classes defined by sets of infinite sentences.

The second part of the project focuses on developing a parallel theory for acts to what the PI has been able to accomplish for modules.   A fundamental notion that will be studied on AECs of acts is independence relations (non-forking for AECs).

The study of surfaces has surprising applications throughout many fields of mathematics and physics. Consequently, the project lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines. In addition to cutting edge mathematical research, the project will promote the progress of science and mathematics through different workshops aimed at graduate students as well as community outreach events. The educational component will also focus on creating an engaging and inclusive place for mathematical interactions for students and early career researchers.<br/><br/>In the past decades, both the theories of Higgs bundles and Anosov dynamics have led to significant advancements in our understanding of the geometry of surface groups. Recent breakthroughs linking these approaches are indirect and mostly involve higher rank generalizations of hyperbolic geometry known as higher rank Teichmuller spaces. The broad aim of this project is to go beyond higher rank Teichmuller spaces by using Higgs bundles to identify subvarieties of surface group representations which generalize the Fuchsian locus in quasi-Fuchsian space. The cornerstone for the approach is the role of Slodowy slices for Higgs bundles. Specifically, the PI aims to establish Anosov properties of surface group representations associated to Slodowy slices in the Higgs bundle moduli space.

The second is modular and extensible program construction: program components must be developed independently and changes internal to one component should not cause cascading changes to other components.  This project's novelties are: a new foundation for extensible descriptions of program properties and invariants, subsuming multiple competing and complementary features used in current languages; its implementation; and its metatheory.  The project's impacts are: regularizing and extending features for specifying program properties in existing languages; simplifying their implementation; and making these features practical for adoption in other languages.<br/><br/>The primary focus of this project is the programming language Haskell.  Haskell has an advanced type system with several features for modular and extensible specification of program properties, most prominently type classes and type families.

The result, for both programmers and implementers, is a constellation of features with frequently surprising interactions and limitations.  This project develops a new core language for Haskell, with a single feature that captures both type classes and type families.  It will simplify Haskell implementations and make the existing features of Haskell more regular and more expressive.  It will enable new features of Haskell, closing the gaps between type families and type classes.  And, it will make it easier for other languages to adopt features from Haskell, by giving them a simpler underlying semantics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The locomotor capabilities of early tetrapods are often modeled with extant salamanders since the latter have a generalized tetrapod body plan. Yet, salamanders exhibit tremendous morphological diversity across environments, providing a framework to assess the mechanical requirements for terrestrial locomotion by comparing morphological change across carefully matched evolutionary lineages. The greater effects of gravity may impose biomechanical constraints that preclude certain salamanders from moving on land, but the habitat that salamanders occupy differs between developmental strategies. Metamorphosis involves the development of an animal across two or more distinct life stages but can be biphasic (aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults) or multi-phasic (aquatic larvae to terrestrial juveniles to aquatic adults) whereas direct development remains in one environment. Thus, biomechanical constraints may be stronger in terrestrial direct developers than biphasic metamorphers since the former do not experience an aquatic stage. This project will integrate physiology, engineering, and evolutionary biology to examine how the interplay between habitat preference and developmental strategy affects the relationship between the structure and function of tissues (e.g., bones) and whole-organism performance (e.g., locomotion). Students will receive research training through a new Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience on Organismal Form and Function and Professional Research Experience for Post-baccalaureates in Biology program. In addition, ?Salamander Safaris? will be hosted during Amphibian Week to promote the participation of students in STEM. <br/><br/>Locomotion places some of the highest physical demands (?loads?) on bones and failure to withstand loads could cause fractures or even death in an animal, yet how bones evolved to support the loads imposed by aquatic vs. terrestrial environments is not well understood. Phylogenetic comparisons of whole-bone mechanics across ecologically diverse species will advance knowledge of how habitat and developmental strategy has shaped the evolutionary morphology of salamander limb bones. Investigators will quantify in vivo bone loading during terrestrial walking through synchronized 3D kinematics and kinetics. Investigators will then apply these loading data to collect the first dynamic measures of limb bone strength by integrating mechanical property testing and 3D digital image correlation. Finally, they will combine these techniques to examine how bone mechanics is affected by water-land and land-water transitions within a lifetime by comparing juveniles and adults from species with different developmental strategies (i.e., direct, biphasic, multiphasic). Bone strength is predicted to be highest in terrestrial direct developers lowest in paedomorphic aquatic salamanders, and intermediate in biphasic metamorphic salamanders. Stronger bones likely assist terrestrial species to withstand internal (muscle) and external (ground reaction forces) loads and then transfer this energy into propulsion. Compared to the femur, the humerus is expected to evolve at faster rates based on the multi-functional role of forelimbs (e.g., digging, reproduction, locomotion) that is likely less constrained compared to hindlimbs whose primary role is for generating propulsion. Findings from this work will contribute new insights into the mechanical requirements of becoming terrestrial.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zooplankton include many different types of organisms that can be broadly categorized as crustacean or gelatinous, with most fish and whales preferring crustaceans as a fat-rich food source over gelatinous animals, which are higher in water content. Historically, the California Current ecosystem off the U.S. West Coast has been dominated by crustacean zooplankton, such as krill and copepods, but in 2014 there were huge abundances of a type of colonial, gelatinous zooplankton known as pyrosomes, which caused widespread damage to fisheries by fouling fishing gear and dominating catch. Although the arrival of pyrosomes coincided with an extensive marine heatwave, lower abundances have since persisted despite a return to cooler ocean temperatures. Analysis of time series data from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) indicate that pyrosomes were also observed in the California Current many decades ago when the ocean was not particularly warm. This study combines analysis of past samples from CalCOFI, ocean circulation models, and biological models to understand the causes of these quickly growing pyrosome populations in the California Current.  It supports training for undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, the project is reaching K-12 students through a unique partnership with the San Diego County Office of Education that is developing Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-aligned resources for middle and high school science teachers in California.

This project combines the analysis of past historical samples from seven decades of the CalCOFI time series, data-assimilative and non-data assimilative ocean circulation models, and biological population models to determine the role ocean physics and biological interactions have played in shaping pyrosome abundance, trophic dynamics, and population growth and mortality in the California Current.

The first theme is developing a general framework to study negative moments of L-functions, formulating full conjectures and proving partial results about negative moments. The second theme involves proving new non-vanishing results about L-functions at special points. Values of L-functions at special points often carry important arithmetic information; the PI plans to show that wide classes of L-functions do not vanish at the central point (i.e., the center of the critical strip, where all the non-trivial zeros are conjectured to be), as well as to study correlations between the values of different L-functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to determine the mechanisms underlying this perception-action interdependence, using a combination of behavioral, psychophysical, physiological, and computational approaches. The work involves the collaboration of two international research teams, one based in the United States and one in Israel. The investigators are also committed to promoting inclusivity and diversity by mentoring talented undergraduates in an EPSCoR state, as well as nationally selected students from groups underrepresented in science. Additionally, the investigators will produce and distribute multimedia science cartoons (SciToons) aimed at K-12 students, teachers, and the general public.<br/><br/>The questions addressed here focus on the mutual interdependence of perception, cognition, and action.  The project integrates novel empirical methods with continuous action tracking, pupillometry, and computational modeling. The first goal is to understand how determinate actions need to be in order to influence visual perception. The second goal is to assess which aspects of visual processing improve when we prepare to act or have been trained to act. The third goal is to determine whether preparing to act enhances visual processing by changing how much attention is paid to the target and/or how quickly it grabs attention. The aim is to advance our understanding of the interdependence between perception and action-driven mechanisms. The work has the potential to  advance technological innovations in the areas of human factors, human-robot interaction (HRI), and artificial intelligence by identifying and exploiting the interactions among cognitive, perceptual, and motor functions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Perception, Action, and Cognition and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The spatial distribution of larvae from a given population, also known as the dispersal kernel, is an important parameter both for basic understanding of marine ecology and evolution, as well as for management and conservation of marine resources. Larval dispersal kernels are often studied using computer models which simulate the dispersal of larvae within ocean circulation models. However, there are very few measurements of marine larval dispersal with which to evaluate these computer models, due the cost and infeasibility of current genetic tagging methods. This project uses isolation by distance (IbD) population models, which the project team has shown gives similar results to genetic tagging methods, but at a fraction of the cost. Dispersal kernels are thought to be shaped by both species traits, such as the amount of time spent as planktonic larvae, as well as the environment through which the larvae disperse. To tease apart the effects of species traits and regional seascapes, the team is taking advantage of the unique setting of the South Pacific, where the numerous isolated archipelagos each independently replicate the dispersal process the team is studying. Six reef-fish species at ten locations in each of the New Caledonia, Vanuatu, and Fijian archipelagic seascapes are being sampled, IbD estimates of dispersal kernels are then used to select a set of computer models, and the models are simulated across twenty years of oceanographic data (many generations of fish) and a selection of species traits. The results of this research are being used to improve the design of networks of marine protected areas in each of the archipelagos in a way that accounts for variability in larval dispersal over time. This research builds on the efforts of the Diversity of the Indo-Pacific Network (DIPnet), created by the project?s principal investigators and senior personnel to promote collaborative research on the ecology and evolution of the immense biodiversity of the Indo-Pacific. The project also provides training for postdoctoral scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, and supports capacity building workshops for local policymakers and students.<br/><br/>Populations of most marine species are functionally, demographically, and genetically connected by planktonic dispersal of tiny larvae. Understanding the spatial distribution of dispersal events (the dispersal kernel) is a fundamental goal of marine ecology and is critical to predicting population dynamics and evolutionary outcomes. Yet, general principles for predicting dispersal outcomes across communities remain elusive. The project team is developing the first-ever data-assimilated biophysical models of larval dispersal by: 1) applying isolation-by-distance (IbD) theory to estimate mean parent-offspring distance (?IbD) for six reef fish species co-sampled and RAD-seq genotyped at three isolated South Pacific archipelagos that each replicate the IbD process with relatively continuous reef systems, 2) using empirical estimates of ?IbD to constrain biophysical models of larval dispersal, which are iterated over twenty years of high-resolution hydrodynamic models, to test hypotheses about the relative role of species traits and seascape characteristics in shaping larval dispersal kernels, and 3) developing a new conservation portfolio approach to design managed area networks that capture temporal variability in larval dispersal over many generations, and engaging with local stakeholders in each archipelago to implement this approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While many approaches to teaching multilingual students tend to reflect deficit-based perspectives, decades of research show that quality mathematics teaching builds on the assets that students bring to the classroom. For this reason, there is a pressing need to develop pedagogies that leverage students? languages in mathematics, and, relatedly, to develop methods for supporting teachers in learning such pedagogies. This project partners with a mathematics department at a public middle school to co-design, analyze, and improve teachers?  translanguaging pedagogies, that is pedagogies that draw on students? full linguistic repertoires as resources for their learning. This project will investigate how teachers make sense of and enact translanguaging pedagogies, how translanguaging pedagogies shape students? mathematical experiences and learning opportunities, and how teachers? learning of translanguaging spaces can be supported. As a result of this work, teachers, teacher educators, and researchers will be able to better understand how students? languages can be leveraged as resources for mathematical learning, contributing to efforts to address persistent opportunity gaps for multilingual students across the nation.<br/><br/>This project employs a series of three qualitative studies using social design experiment methods to address its primary goals. In the first study, the research team and the teachers will co-design pedagogical resources such as lessons, mathematical tasks, and pedagogical strategies to support translanguaging in middle school mathematics. In the second study, the research team will video-record these co-designed translanguaging pedagogies in the classroom, focusing investigation on the character of students? learning opportunities and experiences in translanguaging spaces. In the third study, the project team will develop video clubs to support teachers? learning about translanguaging pedagogies, using classroom video as a key learning resource for teachers. Data will include ethnographic fieldnotes, interviews, video-recorded co-design and video club sessions, co-designed pedagogical resources, and video-recorded classroom observations. The primary outcomes will be: (1) a bank of co-designed translanguaging resources for middle-school mathematics teachers (e.g., lessons, tasks, pedagogical strategies); (2) a bank of videos of translanguaging in action in mathematics to guide teachers, teacher educators, and researchers; (3) empirical evidence about the character of students? learning in translanguaging spaces in mathematics; and (4) empirically-grounded theory of teachers? learning of translanguaging pedagogies. <br/><br/>The award is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide.  With the completion of the human genome project, more and more SNPs have been identified as biomarkers for life-threatening diseases. Detecting such SNPs is of particular importance to the fields of cancer diagnosis, pathogen detection, and various health condition monitoring. The standard methods to detect SNPs rely on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), but are largely limited by their poor sensitivity and bad accuracy. This CAREER project will exploit the newly discovered CRISPR technology to detect disease-related SNPs, improving human health. To provide broader impacts on a national level, this project will pursue the following two education and outreach goals: 1) broaden participation in careers in biotechnology and 2) equip undergraduate and graduate students with the required biotechnology knowledge and hands-on experience. <br/><br/>In bacteria and archaea cells, CRISPR was developed as an adaptive defense system against viral infections. In addition to gene editing, CRISPR technology has been applied to detect nucleic acids in the past few years. This NSF CAREER project aims to study the fundamental properties of CRISPR Cas nucleases through their non-specific collateral activities (also named ?trans-cleavage? activity) and apply the knowledge to detect disease-related SNPs. The central hypothesis is that systematic characterization and optimization of the trans-cleavage activities of the CRISPR Cas nucleases (Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14) will provide a solid foundation to develop novel biosensing approaches for the ultra-accurate detection of disease-related SNPs (less than 0.1% SNPs in wild type can be detected). The major research objectives are: 1) enable an ultra-accurate detection of SNPs using a CRISPR-Cas14 biosensor; 2) design a ratiometric detection of SNPs using biorthogonal CRISPR-Cas13 systems; and 3) demonstrate CRISPR-12 array sensors to identify multiple SNPs simultaneously.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is an important tool in the study of efficient computations and scientific simulations. In all these applications, strong structural constraints associated with the complex combinatorial or geometric structure underlying the problem determine the behavior. This project is concerned with the fundamental properties of basic stochastic processes and how the behavior of these processes relates to the global geometric structure of their different environments. Postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students will be mentored and trained as part of this project. <br/> <br/>The funded research focusses on random processes that are defined by a related geometric or algebraic structure (e.g., Riemannian manifolds and groups). The global behaviors of these processes are determined by this underlying structure. In some cases, these behaviors can provide information on the underlying space and its structure. These explorations are at the interface between analysis, geometry, and probability, with the notion of group structure playing a key part. Partial differential equations and potential theory, i.e. the study of harmonic functions and solutions of the heat equation, are also central.

While automation can increase precision and efficiency, setting up new automated workflows can be costly, requiring expertise and significant up-front engineering time. Because of this cost, automation is largely used for tasks that are sufficiently frequently used that this up-front investment can be recouped, such as in the context of mass production. Domain experts working at smaller scales or with niche workflows cannot benefit in the same ways, hindering their progress. In contrast, this research prioritizes a broader community of fabrication practitioners whose varied requirements demand a broad diversity of automation strategies. This project will help practitioners identify viable opportunities for automation in their work, contribute open-source software and hardware toolkits with which practitioners can author their own automated digital/physical workflows, and organize communities using and maintaining these technologies. These outputs will provide assistance to a wide range of people developing innovative human-centered systems that use digital/physical workflows in their chosen application areas through a series of courses and workshops that will be taught using these technologies and through their open-source release.<br/><br/>This research includes three main areas: formative research on the work of practitioners who span digital and physical spaces, such as fabricators or laboratory scientists; the development of novel devices and hardware modules for automating physical processes including motion control and active end effectors; and end-user software that scaffolds the authoring of automated digital/physical workflows, including modules that support the creation of task-specific artificial intelligence (AI) models for automated event detection.

Many studies suggest that training students through real-world, authentic opportunities such as work-integrated learning experiences and capstone design courses mimicking industry practices better prepare them for professional practice. Unfortunately, workplace contexts vary from company to company and position to position, negating any notion of mimicking all workplaces and industry practices students could encounter. Some authentic learning practices unintentionally exclude students whose life circumstances prevent them from taking advantage of such experiences. This project begins from a different starting point because a focus on what students know, such as theory or skills that support professional judgment, can inadvertently obscure exploration of the nature of knowledge itself and its effects on student learning. To facilitate students? transitions from education settings into the workforce, we need a better understanding of the organizing principles of knowledge which come into play when linking abstract theory to specific situations and applications. This project will contribute to the Research in the Formation of Engineers program by identifying teaching approaches instructors can use to better prepare students for the transition from education settings to the workforce. More broadly, this project is significant because it will explain how students learn what constitutes knowledge and how it is built ? a skill they can apply in any knowledge-oriented context including professional work.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to investigate the ability for undergraduate engineering students to translate engineering disciplinary knowledge acquired in tertiary education into professional settings to solve complex design problems. We call this process knowledge mobilization. We will apply a cutting-edge multi-dimensional conceptual framework for analyzing learning called Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) to characterize knowledge mobilization. We will investigate knowledge mobilization practices of mechanical engineering students who engage in varying levels of open-ended design problems through three contexts having increasing levels of open-ended and multidisciplinary design problems: 1) a junior level design-oriented course, 2) an engineering internship experience; and 3) a capstone design experience. The research will contribute fundamental knowledge on the ways in which students successfully or unsuccessfully mobilize knowledge. This project is creative and original in that it will combine LCT, a relatively unused approach in North America, with interpretive qualitative methodologies to provide in-depth insights from participants to reveal the organizing principles that affect successful or unsuccessful mobilization of knowledge independent of the students? level of understanding of the specific engineering concept. This knowledge structure perspective will build theory into the causes for student learning of engineering knowledge to remain locked within specific disciplines, such as fluid mechanics or solid mechanics. The outcomes of this research will enable instructors to orientate students more overtly towards the norms, values, and knowledge-oriented practices of engineering knowledge in professional settings. Outcomes include a professional development program to train students to use their engineering knowledge to solve problems in a professional setting. Unlike other professional development programs that teach specific skills such as interviewing, this program will develop a professional engineering metacognitive mindset to enable them to think beyond engineering theory and re-organize existing models so that they can adapt them in the face of novel and uncertain engineering situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, human-AI collaborative decision-making performance is often lower than expected. A lack of sufficient and effective engagement between the person and the AI is a fundamental contributor to these disappointing outcomes. Often, decision makers do not engage with the advice provided by the AI system with their full cognitive capacity or, when they do, they engage with it in ways that lead to inappropriate trust and reliance on the system---both under-reliance and over-reliance are a problem.

Despite their importance, the structure and operation of the regions which supply magma to the surface remain poorly understood. It is currently uncertain, for example, whether magma is distributed across ?mush zones? spanning the entire crust or stored in distinct ?magma chambers?. This project will re-evaluate magma storage depths and the origin of chemical variability in volcanic systems in the Cascades using an approach that makes use of small pockets of magma trapped within erupted crystals, termed melt inclusions. Crucially, the CO2 contents of small bubbles within these melt inclusions will be measured directly, in addition to the surrounding melt. This project will contribute to the scientific understanding of volcanism along the Cascade arc, which presents a significant hazard to society. It will also foster close collaborations and a multi-tiered, peer-to-peer mentoring structure between two early career PIs, two graduate students, and multiple undergraduate students. The grant will also support a mentoring program for scientists and a virtual forum for academics to share their stories about adapting to fieldwork, conferences, and workshops.<br/><br/>The volatile contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions provide important constraints on the depths at which mafic magmas erupting in the Cascades were stored and staged prior to eruption. However, the vast majority (97%, N=410) of previously published olivine-hosted melt inclusion data from the Cascades did not measure CO2 in vapor bubble(s). Preliminary Raman analyses of N=339 Cascade vapor bubbles indicates that without these measurements, storage depths have been underestimated by factors of 2-5X. Measuring melt inclusion volatile contents while accounting for CO2 and carbonate in the vapor bubble (using in situ heating experiments) will better constrain magma storage depths in different regions of the Cascades and provide insights into any variations in storage depth along strike (perhaps due to melt H2O contents, crustal stress state, or magma flux rate). While whole-rock trace element analyses are commonly used to assess magmatic processes in both the crust and mantle, whole-rock samples are generally an amalgamation of materials assembled and modified over a great range of unknown depths. Trace element measurements from melt inclusions with known entrapment depths will better constrain assimilation and mixing processes affecting liquid compositions and can reveal where in the crust these processes occur. He isotope data from aliquots of olivine from the same samples will further constrain the extent to which crustal materials have contributed to the most mafic components. Together, these data will provide unique insights into the origins of enriched signatured of continental arc magmas. This study will also assess mantle melting conditions, the processes causing mafic magmas to stall in the crust, and other topics relevant for melt inclusion studies worldwide (e.g., identifying processes forming carbonate in vapor bubbles and testing bubble growth models). Graduate and undergraduate students will acquire skills in a wide variety of hands-on geochemical techniques, data interpretation, coding, and software development. Students will build networks by travelling to different laboratories, interacting with collaborators at academic and government institutions, and presenting their findings at professional conferences. The grant will also support the development and improvement of open-source software tools, helping the volcanological community move to data processing and modelling workflows which are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The PIs will also co-ordinate a virtual forum with panelists and a Q&A to share the voices and experiences of scientists with a broader audience, with a focus on laboratory and field work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there are two major challenges that must be addressed: how to quickly yet rigorously process such large datasets, and how to avoid becoming overconfident in the conclusions reached, given the limitations of the data and knowledge of how such systems work. This research develops a comprehensive framework and set of algorithms for addressing both of these challenges in a general way, so that scientists and other data analysts can use them off-the-shelf, thereby accelerating the acquisition of new knowledge. The work will be developed in the context of two modern application areas of broad interest. The first is to enable biologists to learn about the inner workings of systems that are difficult or impossible to observe directly (such as the internal functioning of cells or the evolutionary history of animal species). The second is to enable ecologists to predict how ecosystems change over periods of time ranging from months to decades, thereby enabling better management of ecosystems and deployment of ecological monitoring efforts. The investigator is working directly with experts in these applications to have an immediate and substantive impact in both areas. In one educational component of the project, the investigator is a core member of the team developing new modern introductory applied statistics courses for undergraduate students at Boston University. The investigator is also writing an accessible textbook on the design and analysis of algorithms for data science, which will be of broad interest to students and researchers in machine learning, data science, statistics, and related fields. <br/><br/>Despite many empirical successes, a lack of machine-learning methods with rigorous guarantees has resulted in systems that unpredictably perform poorly in real-world settings and therefore cannot be trusted for scientific discovery and safety-critical applications. Hence, there is an urgent need to create learning algorithms that are simultaneously scalable to the large datasets and high-dimensional models typical of machine-learning applications; able to accurately quantify uncertainty to ensure correct decision-making despite model misspecification, distribution shift, and data corruption; and are reliable and easy-to-use for the typical machine-learning practitioner. The primary technical objective of the project is to provide a comprehensive solution to these challenges by developing provably correct subsampling Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms with automated tuning procedures. The key technical tool is a statistical-scaling-limits approach to establishing statistical and algorithmic foundations for how to tune basic subsampling MCMC algorithms designed for inference in latent variable and Gaussian process models, and for modified subsampling MCMC algorithms that can improve computational efficiency and numerical stability. These theoretical developments will be translated into practical, user-friendly algorithms with diagnostics that inform the user if the theory is applicable to their problem. The theory and algorithms will also be extended to distributionally robust losses such as maximum mean discrepancy. The research program is highly interdisciplinary, drawing on theory and methods from large-scale probabilistic machine learning, statistics, stochastic analysis, stochastic process theory, and numerical analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research aims to advance our knowledge of how interfaces influence the movement of living microorganisms. The research team utilizes ordered materials called liquid crystals, characterized by properties between liquids and solids, as a model system to study how microorganisms interact with intricate environments. Leveraging the tunable features of liquid crystals, the team explores ways to engineer the interface properties, enhancing control over bacterial flows and structural states. This work carries promising technological prospects as it opens avenues for the development of new functional systems applicable across fields including biosensing, bioremediation, and disease treatment. In addition to the technological impacts, the project is integrated with educational and outreach plans that incorporate examples of soft materials to improve the teaching of physics to life science students, create opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to experience research at an early stage, and make science enjoyable to the general public.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>Active materials are structured systems of interacting elements that propel motion and generate flows. The aspiration to regulate these flows has driven research efforts to develop functional systems applicable across various domains. This project addresses the challenge of establishing effective mechanisms to control flows in active materials. Mainly, it delves into exploring liquid crystal interfaces to govern the dynamic assembly of living active materials. The goal of this research is to deepen the understanding of how ordered materials influence the fundamental behaviors of active materials and how interfaces can be successfully designed to regulate flows within active entities. Self-propelled bacteria are utilized as a model system to investigate the impact of interfacial anisotropy and topological defects on the dynamics of active materials. Employing diverse microfabrication techniques, including lithography, 3D printing, and microfluidics, the team undertakes the confinement of liquid crystals and the engineering of their surface defects to direct the collective behavior of bacteria. The insights gained from this project contribute to the development of transformative applications with practical implications in diverse fields, especially those requiring the transformation of chaotic dynamics into useful work. The project also promotes educational opportunities by integrating education and research through the creation of opportunities for undergraduate students from nontraditional backgrounds to explore projects related to soft materials at an early stage, to prepare them for higher education and careers in STEM. In addition, the principal investigator is developing a distinct approach to improve the teaching of physics to life science students by implementing topics related to soft matter and elucidating the strong connections between physical concepts and biological systems. The insights and knowledge gained from understanding how active materials behave at complex fluid interfaces are also disseminated to general audiences through training modules and educational workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Known as organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), this class of polymers has characteristics believed to originate from ionically charged or polar side chains that readily solvate or interact with ionic species. To date, the choice of OMIEC chemistries is severely limited whereby transformational advancements in ab initio design require much improved fundamental insight into advantageous synthetically accessible molecular structures and thin-film morphologies that could allow for unprecedented levels of ionic-electronic coupling, compatibility with electrochemical doping, and ion percolation effects. To address limitations in materials design and transport phenomena in OMIECs, this project encompasses the following three Aims: (i) synthesize and characterize target OMIEC structures with unexplored side-chain and backbone paradigms; (ii) establish links between OMIEC backbone and side-chain chemistries and electrolyte gating, film swelling, and ion/electron transport properties through operando studies and molecular modeling; and (iii) explore mixed side-chain chemistries (via copolymerization and/or blending) as a route towards additional control over OMIEC properties. It is hypothesized that expanding the design space available to OMIEC materials via new side-chain chemistries, including additional design capabilities incorporated via copolymerization and blending, could enable unprecedented control over OMIEC properties and device performance. <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sintering of nano/microparticles is one of the critical steps in many AM processes. This step often leads to shape distortion of AM parts, preventing their near-net-shape manufacture. This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports an integrated experimental and theoretical research to fully understand the mechanisms controlling shape distortion in AM. Such understanding will enable identification of critical AM process parameters to either eliminate distortions when undesirable, or to control distortions to enable novel methods of 4D printing. The outcomes of this project have the potential to reduce cost of AM parts, positively impacting aviation, automotive, and nuclear industries. The precision manufacturing enabled by this work will help establish American leadership in Industry 4.0. As AM is adopted in aerospace industry for fabrication of large parts (e.g., aircraft wings), research outcomes from the project will be key enablers for their fabrication. Near-net-shape AM will eliminate post-processing, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The project will involve collaboration with K-12 students from disadvantaged schools to expose them to STEM-based careers. The project will train a diverse US workforce in the interdisciplinary areas of advanced manufacturing, computational sciences, and nanomaterials through the development of interdisciplinary curricula.<br/><br/>This project focuses on identifying the mass transport mechanism(s) and their relative contributions to shape distortion in sintering-based AM processes. The preliminary studies have demonstrated that a long-range mass transport must be operational during part distortion in sintering.  The experimental portion of the research will consist of fabrication of 3-D structures of nano and/or microparticles, operando microscopy to observe movement of particle clusters in Focused Ion Beam (FIB)-cut sections during sintering, and extensive ex-situ observations post sintering. A closely coupled modeling effort will involve the development of a mesoscale phase-field model to discover the physical mechanisms of long-range mass transport in non-homogeneous sintering. In addition, a macroscale continuum model will be developed that has capabilities to simulate full scale parts and predict shape distortion and/or residual stresses for industrially relevant configurations. A predictive model will be developed to quantify the effect of parameters such as particle size(s), binder content, constraints, and temperature gradients on part distortion. The research will establish and experimentally validate design guidelines to minimize distortion during sintering of AM parts. Lastly, inhomogeneous sintering will be introduced as a completely new technique to achieve controlled distortion, i.e., 4D printing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

WA CURE is a joint effort by 34 Washington State public community and technical colleges to expand the use of Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). Fifty-eight percent of Washington State?s undergraduate students are enrolled at community or technical colleges. Thirty-seven percent of STEM majors at these colleges identify with historically underrepresented groups, e.g., students of color, first-generation college students, and non-traditional learners such as working adults. Community and technical colleges report similar institutional barriers to adopting CUREs, such as a lack of research culture, institutional support, and connections to research infrastructure. Lessons learned from this project aim to generate useful insights for colleges to overcome these barriers to CURE adoption. <br/><br/>The project?s primary research questions will be: 1) How, and in what way, does participation in a CURE learning community affect a faculty member?s pedagogical practice? 2) To what extent do CUREs, as implemented by participating faculty, affect and potentially close equity gaps across student academic performance, persistence, completion, and transfer? and 3) How, and in what ways, does the college-wide implementation of CUREs identify and validate promising practices about organizational change, scaling CUREs at participating colleges, and replicating CUREs at colleges in other states? These questions will be addressed via three methods: 1) a professional development program to expand implementation of high-quality CUREs, complemented by a shared, open-access CURE curriculum archive; 2) a CURE ?institutionalization incubator? ? the WA CURE Academy ? to cultivate faculty leadership, form strategic action plans, and produce change through CURE implementation; and 3) new assessment and research infrastructure to foster a culture of scholarly teaching and research on CUREs at participating colleges, as well as increase awareness of related research opportunities among these colleges? students and faculty.

To meet our nation?s decarbonization goals, however, technologies are needed that can leverage this renewable electricity to produce useful chemicals and fuels with low carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Electrochemical processes are poised to address this critical need. For example, the electrochemical splitting of water can produce green hydrogen, while the oxidation of green hydrogen can yield carbon free energy on demand.  But the viability of these processes depends on the performance and cost of catalytic materials needed for the electrochemical reactions. These catalysts are typically composed of rare and expensive metals such as platinum, palladium, and iridium. One strategy to improve the performance of these materials is to disperse the metal as individual atoms on a high surface area support.  These ?single-atom? catalysts (SACs) provide maximum metal usage efficiency and display unique catalytic properties.  But key fundamental questions remain about how these catalysts carry out electrocatalytic reactions and what their true structure is under operating conditions.  The project seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of electrochemical catalysis over SACs, and use this understanding to design new materials with improved performance and precious metal usage efficiency. The research will be integrated with educational efforts aimed at engaging students and exciting them about the role of catalysis in sustainability. <br/><br/>Currently, single-atom electrocatalysts suffer from a lack of uniformity in their active site structures.  To address that issue, the project will utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) to synthesize catalysts with highly uniform catalytic active sites deposited on precisely synthesized metal oxide nanocrystalline supports.  A combination of site-specific and in situ spectroscopies will be used to understand the atomic structure of the active sites and how their structure may evolve under reaction conditions. Having identified the nature of these active sites, links will be made between their structure and catalytic behavior. These structure-property relationships will be leveraged to design catalysts with optimal activity, systematically tuning the bonding of the metal site to the oxide support. This continuous tuning will be enabled by electrochemical ion insertion into the metal oxide support. In addition to understanding how the catalytic sites respond to changes in bonding to their support, the project will further demonstrate how their properties can be controlled by changing the electrochemical medium in which they operate. The insights developed in these studies will be used to design catalysts for selective electrochemical oxidation reactions using glycerol, a major byproduct of biodiesel, as a representative substrate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research addresses one of the main challenges facing neuromorphic computing today -- How to make bio-plausible spiking neural networks (SNNs) scalable and efficient for large-scale machine learning tasks while persevering the benefits of sparse, event-driven computation and learning? Currently, SNNs remain very similar to non-spiking networks with the temporal aspect remaining largely unexploited. The project is driven by the motivation that the current gap in SNN efficiency metrics (recognition accuracy, hardware power, energy and area efficiency) will be bridged by a transformative rethinking of spike information encoding in the temporal domain along with exploring nanoelectronic devices amenable for such alternate spike encoding schemes that leverage its inherent stochastic physics for brain-like probabilistic inference. Combining these two perspectives, stochastic biomimetic hardware, encoding information in the temporal domain, has the potential of enabling a new generation of brain-inspired computing platforms that leverages the associated advantages of two complementary insights from computational neuroscience -- how information is encoded in the brain and how computing occurs in the brain. The cross-layer nature of the project ranging from device design, circuit, system and algorithm explorations will serve as an ideal platform to enable interdisciplinary training and education of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The research involves a transformative research agenda, at the intersection of hardware and software, that develops a cross-layer design effort from devices to algorithms and underlying learning methodologies. The project spans cross-cutting explorations across the following thrust areas: (i) Thrust 1 investigates spin device physics and proposes device-circuit primitives suitable for temporal information encoding and learning in stochastic neuromorphic computing platforms. (ii) Thrust 2 considers system development that inherently exploits the temporal encoding of information in stochastic magnetic devices. (iii) Hardware-algorithm co-design resulting from Thrusts 1 and 2 will culminate in Thrust 3 that will consider large-scale system level simulations and performance evaluation across a benchmark application suite. Such an end-to-end framework can enable the fusion of appropriate neuromorphic computing paradigms with the intrinsic operation of the underlying hardware to improve its performance (classification accuracy) and efficiency for complex machine learning tasks.

There is presently a severe shortage of CS teachers that will be exacerbated as more schools embrace CS education. To help mitigate the teacher shortage, this project will implement a model to prepare middle school and high school Technology and Engineering (T&E) teachers in diverse New York State communities to teach CS courses. The implementation model is transferable nationally and this population of teachers can add significantly to the CS delivery system. Four complementary and unifying project components comprise a systems approach to broadening CS education capacity and participation. They are: component 1, implementing a statewide secondary school engineering design-based CS curricular continuum for T&E education with an aligned teacher professional development (PD) program; component 2, recruiting, engaging, and retaining diverse students by situating learning in the context of authentic, culturally relevant engineering design challenges; component 3, establishing a pathway to dual T&E/CS state certification for teachers; and component 4, fostering family engagement in CS education. The curriculum and PD programs integrate culturally relevant pedagogy to address barriers to broadening participation and persistence in STEM. The dual certification and family engagement in CS components are unique and innovative elements that can be adopted by myriad STEM preservice and school-based programs. The prototypical model is situated in twelve middle and high school classrooms in rural, suburban, and urban school districts which reflect New York State?s diverse population. <br/><br/>The project team will collect qualitative and quantitative data from 12 T&E teachers and approximately 300 students through participant interviews, surveys of teachers and curriculum developers, observations, PD institute feedback, results of pilot testing the curriculum including student performance data, student surveys, and teacher and family member reflections. Using mixed methods, the team will empirically and descriptively investigate how the various components synergistically serve as direct or mediator variables for target outcomes. Deliverables include a secondary school continuum of instruction using authentic engineering design challenges that integrate T&E and CS standards; PD materials to train educators to deliver the integrated content effectively; assessments to measure student learning outcomes and teacher growth; a certification pathway to dual T&E and CS state certification for teachers and accompanying training materials; resources to empower families to support their children?s CS learning; and research findings and insights from ongoing program evaluations and assessments. Expanding the CS delivery system through T&E in New York is a model for how T&E teachers nationwide can broaden CS participation. This project is positioned to contribute valuable knowledge, resources, and models that have the potential to shape the landscape of CS education, teacher preparation, and family engagement at both state and national levels.

Multisite randomized trials, or studies in which individuals are randomized to condition within schools, are frequently used to assess the effect of these interventions. The most common question in these studies is whether or not the intervention is effective. While determining whether an intervention is effective is an important question, it does not provide a comprehensive picture of the intervention. Studies should also be designed to determine how an intervention works, or the mechanisms underlying the intervention, known as the mediation mechanisms. In addition, the effect of the mechanism may differ depending on student characteristics, school context, local implementation, or a host of other factors, known as moderated mediation. Assessing moderated mediation is critical in understanding for whom and under what contexts the intervention is effective, and why. Currently, statistical methods and tools do not exist for unpacking complex mediation mechanisms in multisite trials. The purpose of this study is to develop methods and tools to enable researchers to answer questions crucial for unpacking complex mediation mechanisms in multisite randomized trials, including (1) how the total impact of an intervention is mediated by one mediator or multiple concurrent or sequential mediators and (2) how the mechanisms vary by individual and contextual factors. These methods and tools will help researchers better understand the complex effects of interventions so that they can improve and tailor interventions to different individuals and school contexts and thus enhance educational equity.<br/><br/>This project will develop analysis procedures for multisite causal moderated mediation analysis with one mediator or multiple concurrent or sequential mediators. The identification of the causal effects relies on the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, which is usually violated in real applications. Therefore, this project will also develop intuitive sensitivity analysis strategies to assess the potential influence of not only unmeasured pretreatment confounding but also posttreatment confounding. The methods will be applied to the National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM) and Head Start Impact Study (HSIS) to investigate the mediation mechanisms underlying the impact of educational interventions on math performance and their heterogeneity. Comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations will be conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. A user-friendly R package with a graphical interface will be developed to enable empirical researchers to generate a new set of thorough, precise, and valid empirical evidence regarding the heterogeneity of causal mediation mechanisms across individuals and contexts. The usability of the package will be tested through simulations, real data analyses, and focus groups. Courses and workshops will be offered to train diverse students and scholars to adopt the analytic framework and tools developed from this project. All the software documentation and training materials will be publicly and freely accessible. <br/><br/><br/>This is a Faculty Early Career Development Program project responsive to a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education.

For example, populations of tiny living things like bacteria, viruses and fungi, that can?t be seen with the naked eye.  Some microbes make us sick while others are important for our health.  Their balance or imbalance with each other and the surrounding tissues can exert long-lasting and wide-ranging effects on an individual?s state of health or disease. Of particular interest is the microbiota in the oral cavity, as it serves as a potential reservoir for pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria. However, very little is known about the relationship of various diseases and the oral microbiome. The research goal of this CAREER project is to understand the connection between the human oral tissue, the oral microbiome, and how they interact. This will be accomplished by creating an in vitro (in the lab) model of the human gingival (gum) tissue system capable of studying diverse microbial populations and their connection to overall human health.  The goal of the project?s educational plan, called ResAx, is to provide a working model to address the drop in enrollment in low resources academic institutions that could be transposed to other research areas (i.e., medical devices, protein engineering). The multidisciplinary research project will provide opportunities to expand research access and education to undergraduate students enrolled in the BME curriculum at University of Massachusetts Lowell and to support a paid Summer Training Program for rising junior high school students in the local Lowell community.  ResAx aims to provide equitable access to high-quality education experiences to more than 5,000 underserved students.<br/><br/>This CAREER project targets the development of an in vitro gingival tissue system to study the role of microbial communities on human oral health and disease, with potential repercussion on diverse pathologies such as periodontitis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition to representing a large population and economic market, these chronic diseases are emergent drivers of global socioeconomic status. The vision of this CAREER project will be accomplished by: (i) the development and validation of a microphysiological system to study oral host-pathogens interactions and microbiome biogeography under different clinical conditions (healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis); (ii) the engineering of an inflamed gingivitis model based on human primary neutrophils to identify a clinical fingerprint for early dysbiosis presentation; and (iii) a periodontitis model based on activated B and T lymphocytes and clinically driven tissue characteristics to investigate the effect of lipid mediators on inflammation resolution and induced changes on the established polymicrobial community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current manufacturing paradigm treats the material processing stage (i.e., feedstock creation from raw ingredients) and the actual manufacturing stage (i.e., use feedstock to create final products) in a sequential and segregated manner. This sequential view results in a lack of system-level understanding which in turn adversely affects efficiency (production rate and product quality) and resilience (against material uncertainties and process disturbances). This project addresses this challenge by creating an interactive and integrated manufacturing ecosystem paradigm with a broadened system-level view ? aided by multi-disciplinary convergence of three disciplines: material science, manufacturing science, and control science. The research advances the science of manufacturing and strengthens the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem by developing computational models to understand materials-manufacturing interactions, and automation algorithms to enable efficient and resilient manufacturing. The research will be complemented by training of undergraduate and graduate students with special focus on underrepresented groups, multi-disciplinary educational material development, and tutorials and workshops for broader dissemination purposes.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the coupled nature of materials processing and actual manufacturing ? and the utilize this understanding to enable an automation framework towards integrated manufacturing ecosystem. The research objectives are: (i) quantification of the effects of raw ingredients on feedstock properties through an experimentally driven campaign, (ii) understanding of process physics with essential nonlinearities through a data-driven hierarchical modeling framework, and (iii) development of optimal control algorithms for coupled materials-manufacturing ecosystem. In the process, the following fundamental questions will be answered: (i) How to combine the knowledge of raw ingredients and their proportions to predict the rheological and physical properties of feedstock? (ii) How do the nonlinear interactions between feedstock properties and manufacturing dynamics impact the composite properties? (iii) How to formulate reduced order process models with acceptable computation requirements as well as enough physical insights? (iv) How to systematically combine knowledge of rheology and process physics and multi-modal data-stream to create an automation framework that ultimately enhances the feedstock quality in the material processing, and robustness of manufacturing environment?

This carbon is at risk of being lost to the atmosphere and contributing to climate change, due to recent patterns of wildfire that are also related to climate change. Determining how wildfires affect C stored in the soil is difficult, because it is rare that researchers know where a wildfire will take place before it happens, so there are not often measurements of C content from before the wildfire. In addition to assessing how much C is lost to the atmosphere when organic matter is combusted during a wildfire, fires can change how the remaining soil C is transformed, as remaining organic matter decomposes and returns C to the atmosphere. For this RAPID project, the extensive wildfire season in Canada in 2023 offers this team a unique chance to measure fire-induced soil C losses at their previously studied sites and to compare the size of C emissions derived from combustion during the fire vs. decomposition afterwards. In this project, the researchers will test pre-fire samples and return to to obtain and test post-fire samples in order to determine how fires affected carbon cycling. This research offers a critical opportunity to leverage rare pre-fire data to investigate pressing questions about wildfire effects on soil C content in a globally-relevant ecosystem. The findings will inform understanding of post-wildfire ecology and interactions between fire severity and C cycling. In addition, junior researchers will be trained, and the project team will develop new outreach materials to engage the public on the topic of fires and soils.<br/><br/>As part of sampling campaigns in 2019 and 2022 in Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP), AB and NWT, Canada, and the surrounding region, the research group collected a large number of soil samples from sites that had not experienced fire for at least 30 years. They characterized pre-burn soil C and N concentrations, pH, microbial community composition, and respiration (decomposition). The 2023 WBNP fire complex burned 32 out of 70 of the previously sampled sites, representing a range of soil types, including organic-rich peatlands and sandy acidic soils, and dominant tree species. In this project, researchers are pairing post-burn sampling with the existing pre-burn samples to answer two questions: (1) How does fire severity relate to post-burn soil C decomposition rates? (2) How does the relative importance of C losses due to combustion vs. changes in C decomposition rates change over time with increasing fire severity? At each site, researchers will estimate C losses due to wildfire, collect soil cores and quantify soil C, and measure potential decomposition using soil incubations. They will use simple biogeochemical models to extrapolate potential net C losses through decomposition, to quantify the relative magnitude of these two major C loss pathways ? direct losses through combustion vs. changes in C decomposition rates after the wildfires. Further leveraging this dataset, researchers will collect and preserve subsamples of soil for future efforts to characterize microbial community composition. These samples will be compared with pre-burn (and lab-burned) microbial communities from previous sampling campaigns ? another opportunity to take advantage of these unusual pre-fire datasets. Samples will also be preserved for further chemical characterization supported by future proposals, in order to explore the potential role that organic matter chemistry plays in determining post-fire soil C decomposition rates. The research project will provide training for a graduate student, undergraduate field assistants, and a research technician, as well as enhance wildfire and climate change public education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the recent ?Big Data? and ?Open Science? revolutions, scientists have shifted their focus from aggregating individual observations to aggregating massive publicly available datasets. This endeavor is premised on the hope of improving the robustness and generalizability of findings by combining information from multiple datasets. For example, combining data on rare disease outcomes across the United States can paint a more reliable picture than basing conclusions only on a small number of cases in one hospital. Similarly, combining data on disease risk factors across the United States can distinguish local from national health trends. To date, statistical approaches to these data aggregation objectives have been limited to simple settings with limited practical utility. In response to this gap, this project develops new methods for aggregating information from multiple datasets in three distinct data integration problems grounded in scientific practice. The developed approaches are intuitive, principled and robust to substantial differences between datasets, and are broadly applicable in medical, economic and social sciences, among others. Among other applications, the project will deliver new tools to extract health insights from large electronic health records databases. The project will support undergraduate and graduate student training, course development, and the recruitment and professional mentoring of under-represented minorities in statistics. Further, the project will impact STEM education through a data science teacher training program in underserved communities.<br/><br/>This project develops intuitive, principled, robust and efficient methods in three essential data integration problems: meta-analysis, model fusion and transfer learning. First, the project delivers a set of meta-analysis methods for privacy-preserving one-shot estimation and inference using a new notion of dataset similarity. The primary novelty in the approach is the joint estimation of both dataset-specific parameters and a combined parameter that bears some similarity to the classic meta-estimator. Second, the project establishes model fusion methods that learn the clustering of similar datasets. The methods? unique feature is a model fusion that dials data integration along a spectrum of more to less fusion and thereby does not force model parameters from clustered datasets to be exactly equal. Third, the project develops flexible and robust transfer learning approaches that leverage historical information for improved statistical efficiency in a target dataset of interest. An important element of these approaches is a flexible specification of the type of models fit to the source datasets. All three sets of methods place a premium on interpretability, statistical efficiency and robustness of the inferential output. The project unifies the three sets of proposed methods under a formal data integration framework formulated around two axioms of data integration. Data integration ideas pervade every field of scientific study in which data are collected, and so the research contributes to scientific endeavors in the medical, economic and social sciences, among others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teaching and learning in science classrooms are increasingly mediated by technology. Tragically, the use of technology has perpetuated inequities in science education because digital interfaces are designed and used in ways that frequently prohibit blind modes of learning. Consequently, this blind-led project is designed to improve the long-term accessibility of technology-mediated high school science education by improving teacher awareness and preparation. The aims of the project are to: (1) investigate the state of inservice teachers? knowledge about constructing born accessible (i.e., proactively accessible) technology-mediated science classes; and (2) iteratively develop opportunities for pre- and inservice teachers to learn how to construct born accessible technology-mediated science classes.<br/><br/>This project will explore high school teachers' knowledge of the technological, pedagogical, ideological, and legal aspects of creating born accessible technology-mediated science classroom experiences.  The project will seek to explore the factors that influence what teachers know.   The four-phase exploratory sequential mixed methods study will qualitatively explore teachers? knowledge.  The project will then develop and pilot an instrument to measure teacher knowledge.  Finally, the investigator will integrate the qualitative and quantitative research findings. In synergy with the research, the project will develop opportunities for preservice teachers to learn how to create technology-mediated science classes that are born accessible to blind and low-vision students. The education activities will use case-based learning and an iterative instructional design process to develop and implement: (1) a case library, (2) two hybrid units for preservice teachers, and (3) asynchronous open educational resources for pre- and inservice teachers nationwide. The project aims to improve the long-term accessibility of science education to foster blind and low-vision people?s full participation in science.

This research is motivated in part by a grand challenge in the field known as the hydrogen shot, with the target of reaching the production of hydrogen fuel at $1 per 1 kg within one decade. Green hydrogen is obtained as the product of one-half of the overall water splitting reaction. The other half, water oxidation, limits the overall efficiency of hydrogen generation and must be accelerated by earth-abundant catalysts to improve rates and lower costs. Boettcher?s group has developed several catalysts based on nickel, iron, and cobalt with efficient water oxidation ability that are promising for hydrogen technologies. With this grant, his group will study with molecular precision the underlying chemical principles and structures that dictate the high performance of these catalysts and whether these chemical principles hold under industry-relevant conditions.  This will be done by leveraging academic partnerships that facilitate rapid access to advanced surface characterization and computational techniques, and practical feedback from industrial collaborators. In addition to supporting work which will have a high impact on the field of catalysis, this grant will also provide key training to graduate and undergraduate students soon to enter the burgeoning renewable energy workforce, facilitate the continuation of educational outreach among students from the middle school to undergraduate level.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Shannon Boettcher and his research team are studying fundamental chemical descriptors for advanced alkaline water-oxidation catalysts. Water oxidation is characterized by slow kinetics and represents a key constraint in the performance of large-scale hydrogen production through water electrolysis. This oxidation reaction typically occurs on the surface of heterogeneous oxides/oxyhydroxides that are poorly defined, which makes relating structural, compositional, and electronic features to observed activity difficult. Fundamental catalysis science discoveries can address these challenging relations and, importantly, translate learned principles into improved technology for alkaline hydrogen production. With this grant, Prof. Boettcher and his team are building a fundamental understanding of active-site generation, retention, and loss for record-activity earth-abundant Fe-Ni/Co oxyhydroxides. Specifically, they will (1) study how the structure and properties of newly proposed surface Fe-oxo cluster active sites drive high activity in these transition-metal oxyhydroxides; (2) develop chemical descriptors to explain surface restructuring and activation of crystalline oxides (vs. amorphous oxides) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER);  and (3) understand if and how dynamic catalyst surfaces and Fe-based active sites drive record OER catalysis in high-temperature concentrated electrolyte conditions. The work seeks to build a more complete, temperature-dependent, thermodynamic and kinetic understanding of the materials and surface processes central to water oxidation at industrially relevant conditions. These aims will be studied through a combination of computation and experiment, with a significant focus on experiments conducted under operating conditions. Collaborative computational efforts by Prof. Maytal Caspary-Toroker at the Technion in Haifa, Israel, funded separately by the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation, is expected to provide new and more accurate approaches to modeling the thermodynamics and kinetic processes in these complex oxyhydroxides.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israel Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hypergraphs and submodular functions allow one to generalize numerous problems on graphs to a more abstract setting. Algorithms for these more general problems lead to powerful and unified tools for a variety of applications. Moreover, the abstraction often leads to important structural insights and simpler proofs. The research goal of this project is to develop algorithms for a class of problems that originate in graphs and generalize to hypergraphs and submodular functions. The educational goal of the project is to train two graduate students at the intersection of algorithms and combinatorial optimization, and to disseminate several recent developments in submodular functions, hypergraphs, and related graph theoretical results through courses and publicly available lecture notes.

This history of deformation has significant effects on the performance of metals. Current theories to predict performance are highly complex, relying either on intricate approaches or tracking of many descriptors that have no memory path. These prior approaches are impractical for industrial applications. This award supports fundamental research to change this paradigm by developing a new formulation for predicting metallic alloy performance using fractional-order differential equations. In this new formulation, the history of the material is intimately intertwined with the underlying structure of the equations describing the material evolution process. The simplified mathematical description makes it attractive for widespread adoption. This paradigm shift in alloy modeling will improve safety by decreasing uncertainty in life predictions and sustainability as components can stay in service longer with confidence. Importantly, this award also includes outreach activities designed to encourage the participation of neuro-divergent students - students on the autistic spectrum - in STEM. This will be accomplished through involvement in autism-focused schools and education of college faculty to build awareness and greater acceptance for autistic students.<br/><br/>Accurate performance (mechanical response and lifetime) predicting capabilities will only be achieved by accounting for hereditary effects. Nonetheless, current models using, e.g., bounding surface theory or a large numbers of internal state variables (ISVs), with first-order ordinary differential equations, fall short in predicting history (hereditary) effects in metals and alloys. The reason is twofold: 1) there is a lack of understanding of the mechanism responsible for hereditary effects, and 2) the mathematical framework used so far for ISV theory employs first-order ordinary differential equations that are point functions and have, therefore, no memory path. This synergistic experimental and modeling approach will fill this knowledge gap by determining at which length scale hereditary deformation manifests and developing a fractional-calculus crystal-plasticity formulation with a material-informed order parameter depending on an activation volume. This fractional calculus formulation naturally incorporates hereditary effects into the structure of the evolution equations rather than directly through ISVs. The fractional-order crystal-plasticity modeling will be combined with state-of-the-art in situ experiments, i.e., high-temperature transmission electron microscopy and high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy, to unify the mathematics and the physics of plastic deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such process of early food globalization had profound long-term social and ecological impacts, which transformed past societies with consequences lasting until this day. Previous work on this topic has focused on the routes and chronologies of crop movements. However, identifying the specific manner of their cultivation and processing has proven problematic.  Understanding past farming and dietary conditions can also help to understand some of the challenges people face today. Traditional farming techniques can be insightful to global food security and cultivation practices in modern-day marginal environments. <br/><br/>This project addresses these issues by specifically asking: When did millet spread westward from its point of geographic origin? Did culinary practices such as steaming and boiling travel with it? When did wheat and barley spread eastward? Did ancient farmers irrigate the crops or cultivate them under water stress conditions in rainfed systems? The research team focuses on identifying organic residues preserved in pottery sherds to assess relevant receiving areas cooking techniques far from millet?s origin. They examine and evaluate the isotopic compositions of wheat and barley preserved at 41 sites to enable insights into the water management strategies in those regions. By addressing those questions, the implication of the project moves beyond the regional focus. Central to the inquiry is how non-native innovations were transformed within the indigenous social and cultural spheres. In this context, the project will contribute to a global theme in understanding practice- and agent-based early globalization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the conventional Register Transfer Level (RTL) design approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project aims to facilitate the broader adoption of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools to significantly reduce design time, particularly for general architectural design. HLS tools enable higher-level programming and automatic synthesis, yet their application in comprehensive computer architecture studies remains limited. The significance of this project lies in promoting agile hardware development by fundamentally innovating HLS tools, overcoming the productivity challenges at the register transfer level, and unlocking the potential for more widespread application of HLS in diverse computing domains. The developed tool chain will be publicly available and exposed to more users by organizing tutorials, workshops, and demo events. The research will be integrated into education programs with activities on research training for undergraduate and master students, including online students, recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups, curriculum development, and innovative international design competitions co-hosted with industry.<br/><br/>This project aims to revolutionize High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools by introducing a next-generation tool, ArchHLS, addressing two major research challenges. First, HLS tools are superior in synthesizing a specific algorithm into hardware but have limited capability for general domain-specific architecture designs. Second, it is challenging to design general architectures with compatible compilers and to automatically improve the underlying architecture for evolving workloads. To address these challenges, ArchHLS facilitates agile hardware development by making three key innovations. First, ArchHLS decouples architectural design and workload mapping, allowing flexible architecture extraction and customized control flow. Second, ArchHLS automates architecture evolution to adapt to fast-changing algorithms via automated workload compilation, mapping, and computation pattern matching. Third, ArchHLS enables comprehensive and accurate performance profiling for designs to provide feedback for architecture evolution. Beyond advancing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tooling, this research has broader societal implications, aligning with the grand vision of sustainability for computing and computing for sustainability, such as climate modeling and scientific computing. The public availability of the toolchain fosters research dissemination, educational integration, and inclusivity efforts, aiming to benefit diverse communities and promote efficient algorithm/architecture co-design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project supports the research on the use of natural language processing and artificial intelligence to analyze and interpret social media data for dynamic volunteer coordination. It also develops disaster response strategies with an innovative search and rescue knowledge graph, enriched by augmented reality for situational guidance. It aims to transform multi-source, unstructured datasets into actionable insights, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of volunteer efforts and advancing intelligent disaster management solutions.

This Level 2 IUSE:EDU Engaged Student Learning project will advance professional development for novice undergraduate researchers and experienced undergraduate researchers to further support students becoming scientists. Many studies have shown that undergraduate students, including those from groups historically excluded from science, are more likely to complete a degree in science and pursue a career in STEM if they engage in a research project as college students. At Towson University, more than 30 course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been developed to engage students in research within a lab or field course. This has been particularly important for students who do not have the luxury of dedicating time to research outside of class. Many of these students would like to engage in research following the CURE, but without additional graduate students or staff to help mentor them, faculty are often not able to meet this student demand. In this project, a mentoring ecosystem will be developed wherein post-CURE undergraduate researchers interact with each other and faculty to learn together about STEM research, build their identities as scientists, and prepare for research-related pursuits after graduation. The professional development series created for faculty and students as part of this project will advance understanding of how mentoring undergraduates from many backgrounds can be accomplished effectively at an institution without Ph.D. students or dedicated mentoring staff. Results will be disseminated to other departments, colleges, and universities and will provide an important resource to improve faculty mentoring to benefit students while they are enrolled in college and beyond by providing them with the opportunity to engage in science and scientific careers.<br/><br/>This project is focused not just on best practices in mentoring approaches and supporting students but also on how faculty and near peer mentors can be part of a mentoring ecosystem that supports the success of all students in a research group regardless of their identity or background. A Community of Practice approach will be used to engage undergraduate researchers and faculty in separate communities and in a larger group for professional development activities. Creating such a mentoring ecosystem has demonstrated longer-term benefits to students pursuing scientific education and careers versus programs in which faculty are not actively engaged in student professional development. Using surveys and interviews, project participants will be assessed to measure the impact of Community of Practice activities and the mentoring ecosystem on student and faculty identities as scientists, faculty development as mentors, and students? pursuit of science careers. Project findings will provide formative feedback to further refine professional development and mentoring activities. Effective activities will be disseminated both across and beyond the Towson University context.

Brain aging is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that inescapably leads to cognitive slowing and functional decline. As such, corresponding cell-level changes manifest on the organ-level as brain shape changes in the form of cortical thinning, white matter shrinking, and ? most notably ? lateral ventricular enlargement. The research seeks to study how progressive tissue loss drives ventricular enlargement, leads to tissue damage associated with neuroinflammation and axon loss and is clearly visible in medical imaging of the brain. The framework will explain the impact of decade-long brain shape changes on functional brain structures, such as the ventricular wall. This work could lead to potential identification of subjects showing signs of abnormal aging early on. The research will also inform educational activities that aim at educating the public about basic brain aging mechanisms and fostering early interest in science, engineering, and medicine among underrepresented groups in STEM. That includes contributions to the annual Brain Awareness Week as well as research opportunities catered to 10th-graders and undergraduate engineering students.  <br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to combine medical image registration, mechanical characterization, and constitutive modeling to fundamentally understand the relationship between organ-level tissue volume loss and periventricular tissue degeneration during aging.

They form at the world?s mid-ocean ridge spreading centers and are important records of the plate spreading process. Past studies of abyssal hills have treated them as purely random processes. The statistical parameters of such processes, such as mean, variance, characteristic scale, etc., can be correlated to plate spreading conditions, such as spreading rate, magma supply and crustal thickness. In this way, abyssal hills across the oceans can be used to probe plate dynamics through space and time. Recently, however, some studies have reported the detection of periodic signals embedded within otherwise random abyssal hill profiles. Such a signal could be evidence of previously-unrecognized influence on mid-ocean ridge magma processes, such as climate-driven changes in sea level, or deep-seated modulations of magma delivery. This study will use a new, robust algorithm developed by the lead PI. It detects and quantifies (amplitude, wavelength) periodic signals embedded within a random field. The algorithm will be applied to bathymetric data in the North and South Atlantic Oceans. There, decades-worth of surveys and transits provide abundant data for analysis. Periodic values will first be correlated to past spreading parameters to establish basic relationships. Regional variations in periodic values will then be investigated. This will permit investigating possible deep-earth controls on the formation of periodic signals. The result should establish key constraints in the future modeling of mid-ocean ridges. In addition, the code will be made available to the general public with a user-friendly interface. This will enable non-expert researchers and students in a variety of fields to make use of the algorithm. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The existence, or not, of periodicities in abyssal hill morphology has been vigorously debated in recent publications, and some have hypothesized that such periodicities are evidence of external forcing, such as by the impact of Milankovitch cycle-caused sea level fluctuations on the volcanic construction process at mid-ocean ridges (MORs), or internally forced, such as by modulations of mantle upwelling. This project will employ a newly-developed empirically pre-whitening algorithm for detecting and quantifying periodic signals that are embedded in a random field. It will be applied to the abundant archival trackline bathymetry data in the North and South Atlantic Oceans, which samples large and diverse regions of abyssal hills formed at slow-spreading MORs. This will enable testing of a first hypothesis: that temporal periodicities are present in slow-spreading MOR-generated abyssal hills. Preliminary analysis provides initial support, but confidently doing so requires much more than a few anecdotal examples.  The existence of periodicities in the seafloor fabric could have significant implications for understanding and modeling MOR dynamics. If periodicities in abyssal hill morphology do exist, what factors of MOR spreading are they responsive to? This question leads us to a second hypothesis: that variations in temporal periodicities exist that are related to spreading properties and mantle conditions at the MOR at the time of formation. It can be tested directly by correlating periodic parameters to paleo-spreading rates, and indirectly by comparing periodic parameters to aperiodic statistical parameters, such as RMS height and characteristic scale, which are themselves correlated with various MOR parameters as noted above. This project will also investigate whether or not there are regional patterns to the periodicities measured, which could be indicative of responsiveness to mantle heterogeneities. For example, recent modeling indicates that periods and amplitudes of crustal thickness-derived seafloor periodicities will be dependent on mantle permeability, a poorly-constrained parameter that is critical for modeling melt transport in the mantle. <br/><br/>By modernizing the original code for operation in a Python coding environment, the technique will be accessible to a wider audience, and has the potential to be used in interpreting a wide variety of Earth science and other time series (e.g., climate and weather, oceanographic, etc?). The team will promote the code through social media and develop materials to train interested users. Support of an early career scientist and building capacity in computational geoscience is a further broader impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The state-of-the-art silicon power devices are approaching silicon material limits, which urges the exploration of new semiconductors for next-generation power electronics. Ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors possess unique material properties for future power electronics that promise far superior performance beyond the incumbent silicon and maturing gallium nitride and silicon carbide power technologies. Aluminum nitride (AlN) exhibits the largest bandgap and critical electric field in the UWBG semiconductor family with excellent thermal conductivity, which can enable power electronics with higher efficiency, higher voltage, high frequency, and higher operation temperature. However, the performance of current AlN power devices lags far behind AlN material limits due to poor fundamental understanding of AlN epitaxy, surfaces, contacts, and devices. This project aims to significantly advance the development of UWBG AlN-based field-effect transistors (FETs) for high-performance power electronics through innovative integrated material and device engineering. Critical material and device obstacles for AlN power FETs will be tackled, and the project will lead to new fundamental insights into AlN and its epitaxial science, surface, contacts, and power devices. This research is promising to unlock the full potential of UWBG AlN for high-efficiency, high-voltage, fast, compact, and robust power electronics and transformative for other UWBG semiconductors? fundamental research and device development. The successful outcome of the UWBG AlN power technology can increase energy efficiency and security, reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve resiliency and efficiency of the electric grid, enhance penetration of electric vehicles and renewables, and significantly contribute to carbon neutral and net-zero carbon goals. In addition, this project will offer various education opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students on power semiconductors and enhance student diversity in STEM fields, including mentoring undergraduates in research, developing new semiconductor curriculum, organizing outreach and intern programs for K-12 students, broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, and collaborating with semiconductor industry for workforce training.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop high-performance UWBG AlN power FETs through holistic material and device engineering for next-generation high-efficiency, high-voltage, high-temperature power electronics. Five research thrusts are proposed to address crucial material and device impediments toward AlN power FETs with performance close to AlN limits. AlN epitaxy science and engineering in Thrust 1 will obtain a fundamental understanding of growth dynamics and doping mechanisms of AlN homoepitaxy via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and shed light on defects, doping, and carrier transport in homoepitaxial AlN. AlN surface science and engineering in Thrust 2 will significantly enrich the surface science and knowledge of AlN on different crystal orientations using comprehensive material and electrical characterizations and develop effective surface engineering to mitigate adverse surface effects. AlN contact study and optimization in Thrust 3 will enhance and optimize AlN Schottky and ohmic contacts essential in AlN FETs via novel regrowth and processing technologies. AlN power device engineering in Thrust 4 will implement innovative electric field management approaches to prevent premature device failure and develop normally-off AlN power FETs with the aid of device modeling and material innovations from other thrusts. Thrust 5 will realize monolithically integrated AlN power electronics with power FETs, drivers, and control circuits for higher efficiency, higher power density, faster switching, smaller form factor, and higher robustness, which is the first of its kind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work seeks to address the modularity and tunability of three distinct catalyst and ligand classes: hydrogen-bond donors based on urea and peptidic motifs, phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands used in transition metal catalysis, and trialkyloxonium ions. In each application area, the Paton laboratory will develop new mechanistic and statistical models grounded in physical-organic chemistry in collaboration with synthetic experts.

While all atoms in chemical compounds are held together by bonds, not all bonds are created equal.  Some bonds, such as carbon-oxygen bonds, are strong and found everywhere in Nature.  Others, including multiple bonds between late transition metals such as iridium and oxygen or nitrogen atoms, so-called iridium-oxo or -nitrido bonds, are rare.  They are interesting both because of their scarcity and because they are likely to be reactive enough to be useful in forming new chemical bonds and thus acting as catalysts or reagents to promote cleaner and more efficient preparation of useful substances.   The working hypothesis underpinning these studies is that the metal-nitrogen bonds may be more stable than previously believed, with the difficulty being in finding ways to prepare them.  In contrast, the metal-oxygen bonds may only be stable if the iridium atoms have other designed groups surrounding them.  Dr. Brown will also work to develop new materials and approaches to help teach chemical principles about the rates of reactions (chemical kinetics) in ways that will be accessible and engaging to a wide audience.  This will include developing experiments that can be conducted with readily available household materials, and working out ways to measure color changes over time using cell phone cameras.<br/><br/>In this project, Professor Seth Brown and his team at Notre Dame will develop synthetic approaches to terminal oxo and nitrido complexes of late transition metals such as iridium.  Such compounds are rare, and in tetragonal (octahedral or square pyramidal) environments unknown, due to the so-called ?oxo wall? originating in their high d electron count in accessible oxidation states.  The hypothesis that iridium nitrides will actually be sufficiently stabilized by the nitrido ligand to exist in the +7 oxidation state, heretofore deemed inaccessible, will be pursued using ancillary ligands that are either redox-active, allowing the iridium to jump from a common iridium(III) oxidation state (iminoxolenes, calix[4]pyrrolides) or ones that stabilize an uncommon iridium(V) precursor (alkyls or aryls).  Oxo compounds will be sought using iminoxolene or dioxolene ligands capable of electronic stabilization of the oxoiridium moiety.  Any oxo or nitrido compounds that can be generated will be subjected to physical characterization to illuminate their bonding, and their reactivity with organic substrates will be analyzed to see how the novel electronic structures can be used to effect useful oxidations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the process-microstructure-property relationships for additive manufacturing of metal matrix composites via cold spray. The knowledge gained from this program can be translated to aerospace, energy, and defense industries for reliable manufacturing, repair, and safe operation of metal matrix composites for structural applications.

A systematic exploration of single-particle impacts using Laser-Induced Particle Impact Test (LIPIT) will be used to understand the underlying bonding mechanisms in the different bi-phase systems. The information obtained from the single-particle impact experiments will guide the deposition of bulk-scale composites, which will be fully characterized using time-resolved 3D x-ray computed tomography (XCT) and diffraction.

This research will develop a universal framework for the simultaneous design of control policies and safety measures based on recent advances in the mathematical modeling of dynamical systems. In this context, the intersection between safety, control systems, and data-driven methodologies is still nascent and there are major hurdles to overcome for the adoption and acceptance of the safe data-driven paradigm despite the immense progress in data processing capabilities. This project will solve these challenges through the automatic synthesis of safety-aware control laws for highly complex systems as a function of their real-time input-output information. The outcomes of this work will be well-suited for a variety of applications in engineering, biology, and manufacturing that are of essential significance for the economic development and the competitiveness of the nation on the global stage. The project?s research objectives are complemented by a methodical industry outreach and pedagogical plan aimed at blending research and education, strengthening industry collaboration, and boosting the participation of underrepresented communities for the benefit of society at large.<br/><br/>The researched framework leverages the algebraic structure of a novel framework for system representation that systematically encodes its input-output behavior, namely the Chen-Fliess framework. This encoding naturally fits the underpinnings of the data-driven paradigm for control and estimation. This methodology essentially enables the use of algebraic optimization routines on the system?s information, by eliminating the need for a state-space coordinate frame that otherwise will require over-parametrizations that can lead to infeasibility. Consequently, faster and less power-consuming optimization algorithms are researched with the capability of retaining the system?s input-output behavior. Thus, reachability analysis and synthesis of the control barrier functions will then be performed under this algebraic framework to advance these methodologies in the data-driven setting. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) provide an algebraic framework for the analysis and optimization of data-driven control systems, (2) develop input-output reachability analysis in the Chen-Fliess framework, and (3) develop data-driven methods for the synthesis of safe control laws based on reachability analysis and control barrier functions in the Chen-Fliess framework.

This project?s goal is to help analysts reduce their biases through tools that help them critically assess their thought processes using metacognition, or thinking about thinking. Metacognition will be a guiding idea for developing tool features that help analysts be aware of possible biases. Studies of metacognition have shown that it can be helpful in other educational and analysis settings; this project will use ideas from those studies to develop methods that identify potential biases and present activities to help analysts avoid them.

Next, the researchers will work alongside non-profit partner organizations to co-design and develop a suite of metacognitive interventions (Thrust II) and evaluate those interventions in a series of laboratory experiments (Thrust III). Finally, the researchers will assess the extent to which empirical findings translate to real-world efficacy in a case study deployment of metacognitive interventions (Thrust IV).

The economic and human toll of these navigational difficulties is often underestimated. Researchers have found tremendous economic losses resulting from poor architectural design, measured in millions of missed appointments and missed flights, delayed deliveries, reduced performance of new and temporary staff members, and time spent providing directions to visitors. The immediate human costs of stressful buildings can also be substantial, particularly for those whose needs are frequently overlooked in design, such as the elderly and the young, and people with cognitive impairments, among others. Spatial anxiety and frustrating inefficiency are very real phenomena with implications for the wellbeing of those who must work in and navigate through buildings whose designs are not user-friendly. To make the built environment easier to navigate, it is now possible to use virtual simulation tools that analyze a building?s layout, check for ?problem spots? and confusing design features, and evaluate the human effects of altering specific environmental features. Performing such analytical checks on design documents before the building is constructed can save a great deal of financial expense and human grief in the long run. The goal of this project is to use data from actual human navigational experiences to help improve such computational design-evaluation tools. Better design review will contribute to more comfortable and enjoyable public spaces, and produce economic benefits through improved operational efficiency in facilities such as hospitals and airports. <br/><br/>This research proposes a transformative approach to evidence-based design (EBD), a field that has traditionally relied on logistically complex and expensive methods such as post-occupancy studies and participatory design sessions with building users to inform design decisions. The research will leverage the unique capabilities of virtual reality (VR) to create engaging wayfinding evaluation tasks in various facilities, and collect data about how participants navigate through these virtual buildings and react to key environmental features. The researchers will then identify predictable trends in the extensive resulting dataset via machine learning. This approach will allow us to replace the rationalized pathfinding algorithms used in existing crowd-simulation models (which are wildly inaccurate in relation to actual human behavior) with an Evidence-Based Cognitive Agents Model (EBCAM) to produce more realistic simulated human responses to architectural features. As a final step, the researchers will validate the EBCAM simulation by comparing, and, if necessary, fine-tuning, its predictions against data collected from human participants in two real-world buildings. This project also extends human?building interaction analysis beyond wayfinding performance outcomes, by considering broader factors in spatial experience such as uncertainty, emotional response, and spatial memory. The extent of continuous data collection that will be performed regarding psychological factors during wayfinding, unprecedented in previous studies, will allow for testing new theoretical frameworks in the spatial navigation field, as well as enhancing the evidence-based simulation tool. The application of these empirical findings in the form of a simulation tool vastly increases their accessibility in design workflows, potentially making it possible for a much broader range of facilities to receive the benefits of evidence-based review. The general public can benefit from such expansion in evidence-based design analysis, which until now has mostly been limited to wealthy, urban contexts. The research will further enhance the usability of design by incorporating overlooked groups such as older adults, developing a model that reflects their specific needs. The tool will empower designers to work more confidently and creatively, knowing that evidence-based evaluations can help to confirm or refute the value of an innovative idea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the storage-stack infrastructure that underpins current datacenter storage services was designed in the pre-datacenter era, primarily for desktop and on-premise computers. When used as-is in datacenter systems, this storage stack incurs unnecessary performance overhead, poorly utilizes resources, and hampers sustainability objectives. Consequently, this results in elevated costs for millions of users relying on datacenter storage. This project aims to design and develop local storage stacks specifically tailored for datacenters to enhance performance, optimize resource utilization, and contribute positively to sustainability goals.<br/><br/>The key technical approach is to ingrain datacenter-awareness into the local storage stack ? in particular, the fact that datacenter systems are designed with inherent redundancy to tolerate failures. This project takes a broad view and identifies four fundamental pillars of storage stacks: performance, crash safety, efficiency, and data integrity. In four synergistic research thrusts, we will redesign and optimize the mechanisms underlying the above pillars by exploiting the inherent redundancy.

To that goal, the project explores fundamental aspects of electrocatalysis that can be deployed in electrochemical reactors (i.e., electrolyzers) to convert the waste product carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, into valuable ethylene, a precursor for plastics production.  Beyond CO2 emissions reduction, the electrochemical approach opens the door to using electricity from wind or solar power ? thus helping to close the carbon cycle. Specifically, the project focuses on improving electrolyzer performance through better understanding of the complex chemistry occurring at the interface between the electrocatalyst and a liquid or polymer electrolyte containing mobile solvent molecules and ions.  The project will additionally enhance science and engineering education through demonstrations of solvent and ion effects in chemistry via the Horizons program and hands-on research experiences in both experiment and computational modeling through a yearly 2-day workshop for high-school students on sustainable chemical production at Clarkson University.<br/> <br/>The structure and composition of the electrode/electrolyte interface are known to dictate the activity, selectivity, and mechanism of electrocatalytic reactions. The overarching goals of this work are to i) understand quantitatively the chemical and physical interactions that drive near-surface spectator ion and solvent effects in electrocatalysis, ii) refine and benchmark a computationally tractable density functional theory (DFT) based approach to predict these effects, and iii) advance a novel electrochemical technique, developed by the investigator, to tune the electrode/electrolyte interface for enhanced electrocatalysis. To achieve these goals, the project combines DFT modeling with experiments on both well-defined, single-crystal electrodes, and on industrially relevant nanoparticle catalysts, to quantify the cation surface concentration and the effects of solvent-cation-adsorbate/surface interactions during CO2 electroreduction. With this understanding, the investigators will use a technique ? recently developed in their laboratory - to selectively ?decorate? the surface of industrially-relevant electrocatalysts with organic molecules allowing  predictive tailoring of the behavior of solvent and ions at this interface. This approach will not only yield fundamental insight into cation, pH, and solvent effects in electrocatalysis, but also generate a computationally tractable approach to accurately predict these effects. Together, those efforts will identify electrocatalyst-electrolyte combinations and organic modifiers which yield improved CO2 electroreduction performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their importance, the structure and operation of the regions which supply magma to the surface remain poorly understood. It is currently uncertain, for example, whether magma is distributed across ?mush zones? spanning the entire crust or stored in distinct ?magma chambers?. This project will re-evaluate magma storage depths and the origin of chemical variability in volcanic systems in the Cascades using an approach that makes use of small pockets of magma trapped within erupted crystals, termed melt inclusions. Crucially, the CO2 contents of small bubbles within these melt inclusions will be measured directly, in addition to the surrounding melt. This project will contribute to the scientific understanding of volcanism along the Cascade arc, which presents a significant hazard to society. It will also foster close collaborations and a multi-tiered, peer-to-peer mentoring structure between two early career PIs, two graduate students, and multiple undergraduate students. The grant will also support a mentoring program for scientists and a virtual forum for academics to share their stories about adapting to fieldwork, conferences, and workshops.<br/><br/>The volatile contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions provide important constraints on the depths at which mafic magmas erupting in the Cascades were stored and staged prior to eruption. However, the vast majority (97%, N=410) of previously published olivine-hosted melt inclusion data from the Cascades did not measure CO2 in vapor bubble(s). Preliminary Raman analyses of N=339 Cascade vapor bubbles indicates that without these measurements, storage depths have been underestimated by factors of 2-5X. Measuring melt inclusion volatile contents while accounting for CO2 and carbonate in the vapor bubble (using in situ heating experiments) will better constrain magma storage depths in different regions of the Cascades and provide insights into any variations in storage depth along strike (perhaps due to melt H2O contents, crustal stress state, or magma flux rate). While whole-rock trace element analyses are commonly used to assess magmatic processes in both the crust and mantle, whole-rock samples are generally an amalgamation of materials assembled and modified over a great range of unknown depths. Trace element measurements from melt inclusions with known entrapment depths will better constrain assimilation and mixing processes affecting liquid compositions and can reveal where in the crust these processes occur. He isotope data from aliquots of olivine from the same samples will further constrain the extent to which crustal materials have contributed to the most mafic components. Together, these data will provide unique insights into the origins of enriched signatured of continental arc magmas. This study will also assess mantle melting conditions, the processes causing mafic magmas to stall in the crust, and other topics relevant for melt inclusion studies worldwide (e.g., identifying processes forming carbonate in vapor bubbles and testing bubble growth models). Graduate and undergraduate students will acquire skills in a wide variety of hands-on geochemical techniques, data interpretation, coding, and software development. Students will build networks by travelling to different laboratories, interacting with collaborators at academic and government institutions, and presenting their findings at professional conferences. The grant will also support the development and improvement of open-source software tools, helping the volcanological community move to data processing and modelling workflows which are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The PIs will also co-ordinate a virtual forum with panelists and a Q&A to share the voices and experiences of scientists with a broader audience, with a focus on laboratory and field work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It presents significant challenges to the current distributed high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures since larger-scale training incurs more expensive collective communication costs for passing more significant gradient messages among nodes. A more powerful hardware platform may not necessarily help overcome this performance bottleneck, as optimized middleware supports are demanded to unleash the platform's computing capacity fully. This project aims to close the gap between the training scale and the infrastructure's capability by providing gradient-specific lossy compression techniques and an optimized GPU-aware compressor-assisted collective communication framework to reduce the gradient message sizes and improve communication performance systematically. The deliverables can help the end-users to get significantly faster training speed with preserved training accuracy. The success of this research can promote progress in both traditional AI research, such as computer vision and natural language processing, and emerging AI for Science research for domain sciences, including cosmology, X-ray imaging, and drug discovery. This project also contributes to educational and engagement activities by leveraging the research outcome to develop new curriculums and teaching tools for mentoring college students and training K-12 students in HPC and AI areas.<br/><br/>Using current collective communication libraries for large-scale distributed deep learning can yield significant communication overhead since the gradient messages are large. Applying lossy compression techniques to gradient messages could potentially reduce the communication overhead. However, several important open research questions should be investigated to ensure the performance gain: 1) Are the current lossy compressors efficient enough for gradient data? 2) How can lossy compressors efficiently integrate into a GPU-aware collective communication framework? 3) How could the GPU resources be efficiently shared among different tasks? This project addresses these questions and delivers a novel compressor-assisted GPU-aware collective communication framework for large-scale deep learning. Specifically, the team 1) investigates the efficiency of using error-bounded scientific data lossy compressors to compress gradient data and develops a new gradient compressor by leveraging the advantages of different existing compressors to achieve a better compression ratio and training accuracy; 2) designs the new compressor's GPU implementation and integrates it into the GPU-aware MPI, then optimizes the workflow to ultimately hide the gradient compressor's cost in the communication cost; 3) profiles the GPU resource utilization of both the deep learning training and the compressor-assist collective communications, and designs a new communication framework to enable task scheduling of training, compression, and collectives' computations (e.g., reduction) on the same GPU to achieve optimal resource sharing for the end-to-end deep learning training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central objective is to overcome the current dichotomy within polymer science wherein recyclable and reprocessable materials often lack stability, while more robust ones lead to negative consequences because of their long-term environmental persistence. Through innovative design and precise molecular manipulation, this project aims to develop polymers that offer both long-term usability and innate reparability while maintaining their robust nature and resistance to solvents and high temperatures. The research will explore the critical molecular parameters of an underutilized chemical moiety that will govern polymer lifecycle?from synthesis to degradation?balancing processability with performance. The success of this project will lead to materials that require less frequent replacement, thereby reducing waste and promoting sustainability. Critical components of this project involve educational and outreach activities directed toward local students of all levels, as well as training and professional development of graduate and undergraduate students in emerging areas of chemistry and polymer science.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The research focuses on four specific aims that collectively seek to expand the capabilities of covalent adaptable materials (CANs). Aim 1 investigates using pendent squarate esters as a novel dynamic exchange mechanism for CANs to improve the diversity of catalyst-free exchange chemistries for vitrimer materials. Aim 2 will explore the influence of pendent group squaramides on supramolecular polymer networks, aiming to understand how squaramides contribute to network properties and responsive behavior. The work in Aim 3 will combine squaramide and vinylogous urethane exchange to generate materials that are both dynamic-covalent and supramolecular, aiming to illustrate the enhanced properties that can be attained through straightforward methods. Aim 4 seeks to develop a new dynamic exchange approach through step-growth polycondensation, aiming to introduce unique exchange chemistry for CANs. The research employs a comprehensive set of molecular manipulations designed to elucidate fundamental structure-property relationships. The modularity of the approach provides a viable platform for understanding the roles of chain structure, topology, and functionality in the dynamic behavior of associatively crosslinked polymers. The scientific broader impacts of this research contribute to sustainability by designing polymers with longer life spans and recyclability. The work extends the benefits of dynamic networks to new exchange mechanisms, offering an alternative route to sustainable materials. The educational goals include this project serving as a training ground for the next generation of scientists. Students will acquire expertise in various synthetic and materials characterization methods, gaining a balanced understanding of both contemporary and foundational aspects of polymer science. A multi-pronged outreach program aims to foster excitement and broaden participation in science. The program includes research experiences with a focus on underrepresented minorities. By integrating scientific research with educational and outreach activities, the project aims to make a significant contribution to the field of polymer science while also addressing broader societal needs.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It turns out that many fundamental problems in number theory and geometry can also be understood in terms of the long-time behavior of certain dynamical systems of algebraic origin. Furthermore, the algebraic nature of these systems makes it possible to employ tools from a wide array of mathematical disciplines for their investigation. This project aims to develop new methods in the theory of algebraic dynamical systems with the goal of resolving central questions in the fields of Diophantine approximation and surface geometry.

Piercing numbers is an area in discrete mathematics that seeks the minimum number of elements needed to intersect all the sets in a given family of sets. This minimal set of elements is called a piercing set of the family. Many practical problems can be formulated as questions about piercing sets, where the family of sets may arise in various contexts (e.g., subscribers in a social network, geographical areas, biological cells). An example from cellular communication is as follows: given that the range of a cell tower is 200 feet, what is the minimum number of towers a company has to place, and where should those towers be placed, so that every household has service? Here, the family of sets is the family of disks of radius 200 feet centered at every household, and cell towers are to be placed at every point of a piercing set. Fair division and mass partition are areas in economics and discrete mathematics where one aims to find optimal ways to divide a set of goods equitably among agents with subjective preferences. These methods can be used to divide an estate, a jewelry collection, or a piece of land among heirs, or to split up the assets of a business when a partnership is being dissolved. As is apparent in all the above examples, the questions studied as part of this project are natural, intuitive, and easy to formulate. However, they are often notoriously difficult to answer and require sophisticated tools from different areas of mathematics. This project aims to develop such tools from an area of mathematics called topology. The educational component of this project includes delivering summer schools on ?Topological Methods in Combinatorics? to undergraduate and graduate students, writing a textbook on the subject, and mentoring students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the development of a topological framework based on the KKM theorem and its extensions to address these problems. This topological framework can be described as follows: the configuration space of all possible solutions to the problem (that is, all possible piercing sets/mass partitions/partition of goods) is modeled by a polytope P; if no ""good"" solution is found among the set of all possible solutions P, then one obtains a KKM cover of P; the conclusion of the topological theorem, namely that a large enough collection of the sets in this KKM cover intersects, is then translated to a contradiction to the given properties of the family of sets/mass/goods in question. The main objectives of this project include two primary aspects: first, the discovery of new KKM-type theorems that can be effectively employed within this topological framework, and second, the exploration of innovative ways to leverage this topological method in resolving discrete math problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This history of deformation has significant effects on the performance of metals. Current theories to predict performance are highly complex, relying either on intricate approaches or tracking of many descriptors that have no memory path. These prior approaches are impractical for industrial applications. This award supports fundamental research to change this paradigm by developing a new formulation for predicting metallic alloy performance using fractional-order differential equations. In this new formulation, the history of the material is intimately intertwined with the underlying structure of the equations describing the material evolution process. The simplified mathematical description makes it attractive for widespread adoption. This paradigm shift in alloy modeling will improve safety by decreasing uncertainty in life predictions and sustainability as components can stay in service longer with confidence. Importantly, this award also includes outreach activities designed to encourage the participation of neuro-divergent students - students on the autistic spectrum - in STEM. This will be accomplished through involvement in autism-focused schools and education of college faculty to build awareness and greater acceptance for autistic students.<br/><br/>Accurate performance (mechanical response and lifetime) predicting capabilities will only be achieved by accounting for hereditary effects. Nonetheless, current models using, e.g., bounding surface theory or a large numbers of internal state variables (ISVs), with first-order ordinary differential equations, fall short in predicting history (hereditary) effects in metals and alloys. The reason is twofold: 1) there is a lack of understanding of the mechanism responsible for hereditary effects, and 2) the mathematical framework used so far for ISV theory employs first-order ordinary differential equations that are point functions and have, therefore, no memory path. This synergistic experimental and modeling approach will fill this knowledge gap by determining at which length scale hereditary deformation manifests and developing a fractional-calculus crystal-plasticity formulation with a material-informed order parameter depending on an activation volume. This fractional calculus formulation naturally incorporates hereditary effects into the structure of the evolution equations rather than directly through ISVs. The fractional-order crystal-plasticity modeling will be combined with state-of-the-art in situ experiments, i.e., high-temperature transmission electron microscopy and high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy, to unify the mathematics and the physics of plastic deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New Gromov--Witten invariants defined over general fields have the potential to satisfy wall-crossing formulas, surgery formulas, and WDVV equations. For this, the project studies notions of spin over general fields. The Weil conjectures connect the number of solutions to equations over finite fields to the topology of their complex points: The zeta function of a variety over a finite field is simultaneously a generating function for the number of solutions to its defining equations and a product of characteristic polynomials of endomorphisms of cohomology groups. The ranks of these cohomology groups are the Betti numbers of the associated complex manifold.

Sea ice is composed of many individual pieces and this project will study how these ice pieces break and deform. The researchers aim to create a new sea ice model to accurately model the behavior of ice pieces and use it to explain observations. This project will not only enhance our scientific knowledge but also bring real-world data analysis and modeling techniques into classrooms, train new scientists, and provide valuable opportunities for students in oceanography by organizing educational summer programs. The project's outcomes will be shared with the broader scientific community to help them learn more about sea ice and the Earth?s climate.<br/><br/>This project addresses the critical need to enhance our understanding and modeling of sea ice processes, which play a significant role in shaping our climate. Existing climate models, with their coarse resolution, oversimplify sea ice dynamics. However, when examined at smaller scales, sea ice reveals itself as a complex system of interacting ice pieces with varying sizes, thicknesses, and shapes. The primary objectives of this project are to refine the representation of small-scale sea ice processes and establish clear connections to large-scale sea ice dynamics. The study focuses on modeling the deformation and fractures of sea ice pieces through a synergistic combination of data analysis, advanced numerical modeling, and theory development. The research's innovative aspect lies in the creation of a fundamentally new sea ice model that explicitly captures the life cycle of individual sea ice pieces. Validation of the model will utilize satellite sea ice observations. This model will be used to explore how statistical characteristics of the sizes and thickness of ice pieces are influenced by their collision and deformation physics. This approach aims to discern the impact of small-scale processes, like collisions and fractures, on larger sea ice characteristics that are crucial for improving sea ice representation in climate models. This model will be publicly accessible to benefit the broader polar oceanography community. Beyond scientific advancements, the project has a significant educational component. It intends to integrate scientific data analysis and modeling techniques into graduate and undergraduate classrooms, offering a comprehensive graduate-level course on sea ice dynamics.

Uncertainty in this prediction arises, however, from difficulty observing the thickness and mechanical strength of sea ice over large parts of the Arctic Ocean using just satellite and aircraft technology. One approach to addressing this difficulty is through seismology - the study of ground vibrations - along the coastline of the Arctic Ocean. The main scientific activity of this project will be to observe special ground vibrations that are generated by or otherwise influenced by sea ice.  One such signal is called ?microseism?, and is a constant ?thrumming? of the ground caused by waves in the ocean both near and far from the coastline. The project will use existing, virtually continuous seismic data from various stations along the northern coasts of Alaska, Canada and Greenland to detect how this microseism changes with season and from year to year.  The scientific outcome to be achieved is the creation of a continuous time history of how sea-ice thickness and strength have evolved over the past several decades.  In addition to the scientific goals of the research project, broader impact activity will be focused in two areas. First, the project will interface with artists in the Chicago area to develop ways in which musical expressions can be developed to convey how climate change is affecting Arctic sea-ice conditions. This science and art interaction will build on previous musical compositions that involved interpretation of seismic data coming from icebergs in Antarctica. Second, the project will seek to advance the new Climate Systems Engineering initiative of the University of Chicago by advocating for and facilitating community dialogue about the pros and cons of glacial geoengineering as a way to mitigate the effects of climate change.<br/><br/>We propose to investigate whether microseism spectral power density observations can be used to constrain sea-ice properties such as concentration, thickness, and ?strength? (the ability to attenuate flexural gravity waves generated by sea swell) in the North American sector of the Arctic Ocean (also known as the ?last ice area? where the transpolar drift impinges on the North American continent and Greenland). Data to be used are from coastal seismometer stations located in Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and Greenland. Sea-ice data will be obtained from the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. The microseism power in the 0.1-3 s period band (as in Tsai and McNamara, 2011), and possibly other frequency bands, will be related to a proxy for sea-ice strength (involving sea-ice concentration and the tendency for sea ice to absorb wind stress as indicated by sea-ice drift and surface wind data) and compare with remote sensing observations. The goal of this study is to obtain the highest possible resolution of sea-ice data empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) from the simplest possible EOFs of the microseism data. This involves seeking data-inversion algorithms that can optimize ?resolving power? by minimizing ?spread? in the linear operator that connects the EOFs of microseism with sea ice. The algorithms will then be categorized by their ability to resolve aspects of sea-ice data that go beyond the simple sea-ice concentration data that is otherwise routine and easy to be constrained with satellite data. Depending on the outcome of this assessment, seismic microseism observation can potentially provide complementary information to improve sea-ice data and thus facilitate better climate-model predictions. With regard to broader impact activity, the project will provide a local artist consortium in Chicago with short segments of seismic data portraying tremor and other signals generated by sea ice. These data will be sped up to allow their frequencies to be audible, and will serve to inspire musical compositions either directly or indirectly (e.g., where musical instruments are used to mimic the seismic data).

An intellectual challenge in studying word problem solving is separating out and modeling the different cognitive skills that word problems draw on, such as mathematical reasoning, verbal reasoning, linguistic knowledge, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. All of these can contribute to the difficulty that children face when solving word problems but it has traditionally been difficult to identify the role that language plays since human language is messy and complicated. With the advent of Large Language Models, of which the most well-known recent example is ChatGPT, it is now far easier to model and systematically probe a wide variety of language behavior. This CAREER project will use Large Language Models and computational techniques to study math word problem solving in elementary school students (Grades 3-5). The project will lead to the creation of a novel data set of word problems, new insights into both word problem solving and language models, and a system that allows for the generation of custom word problems for use in classrooms. The project has the potential to lead to the eventual development of techniques that will help children who struggle with word problem solving. The investigator?s teaching mission focuses largely on teaching students and the public about the increasingly important and rapidly changing landscape of language technology. He will teach courses focused on language technology, ethical issues surrounding language models, and participate in public panels for disseminating this information more widely.<br/><br/>To enable studying the capacities required for solving word problems in higher granularity than was possible before the existence of Large Language Models, this project will create a novel bank of word problems that vary along a variety of linguistic dimensions (e.g., syntactic and lexical complexity). Then, the project team will use modern causal intervention techniques on computational language models to partition out the sources of difficulty in these problems. The second phase of the project is to collect human data from kids in Grades 3-5, modeling individual variation and demographic variation along mathematical, verbal, and linguistic dimensions. The third phase is to develop language-model-based system for generating word problems that vary in difficulty along several possible dimensions. The computational modeling work has the potential to answer longstanding questions about how linguistic variables can increase or ameliorate word problem solving difficulty. On the computational side, there is the potential for major improvements in language model interpretability, which is itself a major goal in computational language processing since these models are, in effect, black boxes and the ways they implement abstract behaviors remain mysterious. This CAREER project is supported by the EDU Core Research (ECR) program. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that advances fundamental knowledge in the field on STEM learning, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To realize operational quantum advantage for computing, and to improve precision for sensing, timekeeping, and fundamental physics measurements, the number of trapped ions in these systems must be scaled up. Yet, this would require laboratories full of sensitive, complex equipment, limiting their portability, scalability, and accessibility to broader communities. The PI proposes a transformational approach that converges trapped ion quantum research with integrated photonics research to solve these problems and demonstrate their application to quantum and fundamental physics problems. This research will transform the stability of these systems and advance the state-of-the-art performance, resulting in trapped ion physics experiments that are more reliable and accessible, and allow these technologies to propagate to new fields of research and applications. This convergence research will be augmented with development of multiple hardware, integration, and software open-source tools to enable customized trapped ion physics experiments, so they are accessible to broader audiences and applications. The PI is also developing interactive educational physics tutorials which will incorporate this research into the classroom to advance the broader understanding of quantum physics and technologies.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new trapped ion integrated platform co-designed with integrated photonics which will have versatile applications for quantum computing, quantum sensing, trapped ion optical clocks and fundamental physics measurements. To achieve high fidelity qubit operations, the project will investigate new nanofabrication techniques, rapid packaging, and co-design of ion traps with new integrated photonics to utilize atomic transitions more resilient to errors. To scale the platform, the project will work on miniaturizing not just the optical delivery with photonic grating couplers but also the optical stabilization and control through monolithic integration of advanced photonics within the trapped ion processor itself. For trapped ion optical clocks, eliminating phase instability between the laser reference and the trapped ion though monolithic integration would enable portable operation resilient to vibration. This resilience also improves the reliability of trapped ion systems, removing operational overhead and complexity, thus making them easier to scale and more accessible to applications outside the laboratory. To foster broader adoption of these technologies the project will develop multiple open-source tools, including process design kits, ion trap surface simulation, and modular optical layout libraries. Altogether, the development of a new integrated trapped ion platform co-designed with integrated photonics will improve their performance, portability, and scalability with transformative impacts on quantum computing, sensing, timekeeping, and measurements of fundamental physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sociotechnical thinking in engineering emphasizes that technical solutions are embedded in social contexts, and understanding the interaction between engineering solutions and sociotechnical factors is vital to designing effective solutions. To help engineers engage in sociotechnical thinking, we need to understand how their understanding and reasoning about sociotechnical factors evolves. While sociotechnical thinking is a critical engineering competence, the progression from novice to expert is not well understood. This project will combine cognitive science with sociotechnical design theories to chart the development of sociotechnical thinking in engineering. We will use scenario-based design tasks to examine the ways engineers think and reason sociotechnical factors and focus specifically on the ways this reasoning evolves as engineers gain experience in education and practice. We will also use interviews to investigate experiences that enable engineers to think and reason more deeply about sociotechnical factors. The outcome of this research will be a model of sociotechnical development that characterizes the relevant dimensions of sociotechnical thinking (e.g., ethical implications, stakeholder engagement, environmental considerations, social/cultural impact) and the different ways engineers reason about those dimensions as they gain experience. This research will offer insight into how engineers develop new outlooks, perspectives, and ways of thinking and reasoning. By collecting data from students and professionals with different levels of experience, the model can provide a map for engineering educators to scaffold learning in developmentally appropriate ways across education and practice, resulting in an engineering workforce that can solve complex problems more effectively with innovative solutions. <br/><br/>This project will use qualitative methodologies across two sequential research phases. In Phase 1 we will create a developmental model of sociotechnical thinking using data collected from engineering students and professionals with varying levels of experience. We will collect qualitative data through scenario-based design activities that elicit sociotechnical considerations and retrospective focus groups that allow for follow-up and deeper exploration. We will analyze the data using a combination of theories of sociotechnical thinking in engineering and cognitive development, iteratively applying deductive and inductive coding. The resulting model will describe two key aspects of sociotechnical thinking in engineering: 1) the relevant dimensions along which development occurs and 2) the qualitatively different ways engineers think and reason about those dimensions. Cross-sectional sampling will enable investigation of the progression in sociotechnical thinking according to engineering experience. Phase 2 will use recursive data collection through interviews to explore themes in formational experiences in sociotechnical thinking. Cognitive development is often punctuated by moments of dissonance and resolution, and interviews will focus on formative experiences in sociotechnical thinking. We will stratify our participants according to their developmental categories and recruit participants from Phase 1 to explore engineering experiences that promoted growth or change in sociotechnical thinking. To help engineers effectively engage in sociotechnical thinking, educators must also understand how sociotechnical thinking changes and varies across engineers with different levels of education and experience. Focusing on developmental aspects of a critical engineering skill can inform engineering educators in terms of curriculum design and professional development. The results of this work will inform engineering education and practice in ways that can promote more thoughtful engineering practices and better, more appropriate engineering solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The forces that determine the time-evolution of these systems are complex, making their analysis subtle and technical.  Two fundamental questions of interest are the qualitative behavior of these systems, e.g., whether solutions have large fluctuations, and their long-time behavior, e.g., by quantifying the speed with which an invasive species overruns a new environment.  These questions are interdependent, with the latter relying on an understanding of the former.  Our ability to understand the long-time behavior of PDE, including identifying the key quantities on which each long-time outcome depends, allows us to predict the behavior of real-world systems in a way that cannot be captured purely by numerical simulation, which, by necessity, is restricted to finite time scales.  This project will develop novel methods for these goals.  Graduate and undergraduate research will be integrated into the project, training the next generation of applied mathematicians and scientists. The project also involves a summer boot camp for entering applied mathematics PhD students transitioning from adjacent, but nonmathematical, fields that shore up their mathematical reasoning (logical thinking) and technical writing skills.  Their training is impactful because these students have diverse interests (mathematical biology, machine learning, data science, PDE and numerical analysis, etc.) and go on to careers in industry, academia, and national labs.<br/><br/>This project focuses on advances in reaction-diffusion equations and collisional kinetic equations.  In the former, the project will develop a novel ""Stein's method"" approach to PDE that is based on the observation that monotonic steady states of a given PDE satisfy first order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODE) and that, to show convergence of a generic solution of the PDE to such a steady state, it is enough to show that the generic solution converges to a solution of the ODE.  The research will leverage new functional inequalities and ideas in the calculus of variations.  In the latter, the project will import techniques from parabolic theory and stochastic analysis to characterize when blow-up occurs in generic domains (both with and without boundaries).  This requires the precise and quantitative understanding of the regularity of solutions near the boundary in physical space and the decay of solutions at ""large"" velocities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research addresses one of the main challenges facing neuromorphic computing today -- How to make bio-plausible spiking neural networks (SNNs) scalable and efficient for large-scale machine learning tasks while persevering the benefits of sparse, event-driven computation and learning? Currently, SNNs remain very similar to non-spiking networks with the temporal aspect remaining largely unexploited. The project is driven by the motivation that the current gap in SNN efficiency metrics (recognition accuracy, hardware power, energy and area efficiency) will be bridged by a transformative rethinking of spike information encoding in the temporal domain along with exploring nanoelectronic devices amenable for such alternate spike encoding schemes that leverage its inherent stochastic physics for brain-like probabilistic inference. Combining these two perspectives, stochastic biomimetic hardware, encoding information in the temporal domain, has the potential of enabling a new generation of brain-inspired computing platforms that leverages the associated advantages of two complementary insights from computational neuroscience -- how information is encoded in the brain and how computing occurs in the brain. The cross-layer nature of the project ranging from device design, circuit, system and algorithm explorations will serve as an ideal platform to enable interdisciplinary training and education of graduate and undergraduate students including women and underrepresented minority communities.<br/><br/>The research involves a transformative research agenda, at the intersection of hardware and software, that develops a cross-layer design effort from devices to algorithms and underlying learning methodologies. The project spans cross-cutting explorations across the following thrust areas: (i) Thrust 1 investigates spin device physics and proposes device-circuit primitives suitable for temporal information encoding and learning in stochastic neuromorphic computing platforms. (ii) Thrust 2 considers system development that inherently exploits the temporal encoding of information in stochastic magnetic devices. (iii) Hardware-algorithm co-design resulting from Thrusts 1 and 2 will culminate in Thrust 3 that will consider large-scale system level simulations and performance evaluation across a benchmark application suite. Such an end-to-end framework can enable the fusion of appropriate neuromorphic computing paradigms with the intrinsic operation of the underlying hardware to improve its performance (classification accuracy) and efficiency for complex machine learning tasks. Successful completion of the project offers the basis for a significant leap in the quest to implement machine intelligence with brain-scale efficiency by pursuing a multi-disciplinary perspective spanning devices, circuits, systems, machine learning and computational neuroscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research objectives are: (i) quantification of the effects of raw ingredients on feedstock properties through an experimentally driven campaign, (ii) understanding of process physics with essential nonlinearities through a data-driven hierarchical modeling framework, and (iii) development of optimal control algorithms for coupled materials-manufacturing ecosystem. In the process, the following fundamental questions will be answered: (i) How to combine the knowledge of raw ingredients and their proportions to predict the rheological and physical properties of feedstock? (ii) How do the nonlinear interactions between feedstock properties and manufacturing dynamics impact the composite properties? (iii) How to formulate reduced order process models with acceptable computation requirements as well as enough physical insights? (iv) How to systematically combine knowledge of rheology and process physics and multi-modal data-stream to create an automation framework that ultimately enhances the feedstock quality in the material processing, and robustness of manufacturing environment? While the effectiveness of such a framework will be evaluated by using a laboratory-scale extrusion-based additive manufacturing system, it is anticipated that the framework can be broadly applied to any manufacturing systems as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biological macromolecules frequently transition across multiple conformational structures, and the nature and prevalence of these structures is of great significance to both their intrinsic biological functions, and their potential applications as drug targets, biomarkers, and building blocks in nanostructures. With a focus on RNA and DNA, the Widom Lab is establishing methods based on high-resolution laser spectroscopy that extract distinct signatures from macromolecules with different structures, and is expanding the toolbox of well-characterized molecular probes that can be used for such measurements. In addition, Dr. Widom is partnering with the UO undergraduate Chemistry Club to engage in outreach to middle- and high-school students in rural Oregon communities through remote, interactive chemistry activities, site visits to UO by rural students, and collaboration with the chemistry program at Eastern Oregon University.<br/><br/>Most existing spectroscopic techniques are sensitive to either the local (Angstrom length-scale) or global (nanometer length-scale) structure of the system being measured. To overcome this limitation, Dr. Widom?s research group is developing a method based on measurement of fluorescence spectra on an ultrafast timescale, utilizing excited-state energy transfer between two probes to separate signals from tightly and loosely folded conformational subpopulations. Global fitting of the resulting time-resolved emission spectra connects the local environments of the two probes to the global conformations of the macromolecule within which they reside. Structured DNA and RNA oligomers with at least two well-defined global conformations will be used as model systems, followed by expansion of the technique to study the binding of small molecules to RNA. The Widom Lab will also investigate the suitability of different fluorescent probes for applications involving nucleic acids, analyzing their photophysical properties and their impacts on RNA structure.  If successful, this project has the potential to provide new tools for the analysis of structural heterogeneity in complex chemical, biological and material systems and thus have far-reaching scientific broader impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pedestrian infrastructure plays a crucial role in influencing well-being metrics and can either encourage or discourage walking as a mode of transportation, even in areas with safe walkways. By employing innovative human sensing techniques, this project will establish a comprehensive pedestrian data collection framework. Through collaboration with practitioners and road users in focus groups, alternative infrastructure designs will be developed and evaluated using immersive virtual environments. This research bridges the gap between real-world data, infrastructure design, and behavioral aspects of walking adoption. This project has the potential to drive positive changes in urban planning, design, and public policy through data-driven insights. The resulting naturalistic dataset can benefit research in various disciplines such as behavioral science, psychology, and computer science. This project will bring opportunities for graduate and undergraduate researchers as well as Ph.D. students from all walks of life to learn, grow, become trained in an academic environment, and contribute to the science of human-centered infrastructure design.<br/><br/>Current pedestrian research predominantly concentrates on safety, leaving a substantial gap in well-being-related data, especially in real-world settings. Well-being metrics while including physical aspects, encompass different parameters such as perceived stress, valence, and arousal and emotion metrics, creativity, social interactions, and cognitive abilities among other factors. The first component of this study introduces a novel naturalistic framework to comprehensively monitor and collect data on various aspects of pedestrian well-being. This framework intelligently integrates data from mobile sensing devices, such as smartwatches, with in-the-wild experience sampling techniques through a specifically designed app. In the second component, this framework is applied in a suburban area to create a first-of-its-kind, longitudinal, and naturalistic dataset, addressing the scarcity of pedestrian well-being data. This component will yield quantitative and qualitative models connecting infrastructural elements with real-world pedestrian well-being metrics, employing observational studies and computer vision techniques. The project will develop heatmaps highlighting regions associated with different well-being metrics that will be shared with broader research communities.

The objective of this CAREER project is to develop a theory of fine-grained complexity for approximation algorithms for a few fundamental problems.

The goal is to develop a new framework that provides a clearer picture of the possible complexity-approximation quality tradeoff frontier for problems in P and to understand where algorithm performance is either achievable or ruled out by the Strong Time Exponential Hypothesis (SETH).

In the shallow water of the surf zone the time-averaged wave-driven forcing raises water levels near the shoreline and, in the case of obliquely incident waves, drives alongshore currents. The resulting circulation patterns include a rich field of eddies and vortices. Surfzone eddies have been hypothesized to be generated by instabilities of sheared alongshore currents, by wave-group modulations of the sea surface, by the ends of breaking waves, and by currents interacting with complex bathymetry. This project will address these hypotheses with a unique suite of high spatial resolution estimates of currents from remote sensing and in situ sensors obtained during prior field studies that include a wide range of wave conditions and bathymetries.<br/><br/>Existing extensive field observations of surfzone waves, circulation patterns, and underlying bathymetry will be used to test hypotheses about surfzone vorticity that were derived from numerical studies. These hypotheses include: (1) on an alongshore variable seafloor, the dominant spatial scales of surfzone vorticity depend on spatial scales of the underlying bathymetry, and these large-scale eddies are tied to the seafloor inhomogeneities; (2) small spatial-scale vorticity also depends on the vorticity injected into the water column at the ends of breaking waves, which increases with the directional spread of the wave field; (3) during energetic conditions, the momentum of alongshore currents can overcome forces (such as bathymetry-induced pressure gradients) that cause complex circulation patterns, resulting in alongshore-uniform flow with significantly reduced large-scale vorticity. Although the data used here are from a specific field site, the wide range of wave and bathymetric conditions observed over a decade allows development of a surfzone vorticity climatology that will be applicable at many locations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A focus on creating collaborative coding experiences for youth is important because collaborative classroom interactions promote engaged thinking and learning. However, understanding of how to support effective collaboration structures in CS classrooms is limited by two factors. First, existing CS curricula tend to emphasize individual assignments and participation structures, while often actively discouraging collaboration and learning from peers. Second, classroom technologies such as iPads and Chromebooks are inherently single-user devices, making productive collaboration challenging in practice.<br/><br/>The project brings together teams of K-12 educators, computer scientists, learning scientists, and undergraduate students to develop technology and curriculum. The project will expand a novel learning platform called TunePad Playbooks that the team has been developing through prior support from the NSF. TunePad is a free, online platform that supports creative musical expression with Python programming. District teachers and university researchers will collaborate on curriculum design in summer workshops. The project team will also provide ongoing professional development support during the school year. The technology and the curriculum will be deployed in 5th through 8th grade classrooms across District 65 to include 11 schools and over 1,000 students a year. Additionally, the project team will recruit around 45 undergraduate volunteers each year who will work in classrooms with 20 CS teachers. Curriculum and technology produced through this work will be made publicly available for broad-scale adoption. To understand student collaboration and learning, the team will conduct mixed methods research with the following data and measures: pre- and post-surveys assessing students? computing confidence, interest, utility and support; classroom observations; interviews with students and teachers; examples of student work; video of showcase performances; and assessments of student understanding of core CS concepts and practices.

Hybridization is also involved in economically important processes such as the domestication of crop plants and the evolution of weedy species. Biologists have made substantial progress describing hybridization in many organisms and investigating its significance for evolutionary adaptation and the origin of new species. However, the reasons behind why some organisms hybridize often but others do not remain obscure. Understanding these reasons requires an appropriate research organism that has engaged in hybridization in different environments both in ancient and modern times. This study will use the flowering plant genus Heuchera, commonly known as alumroot or coral bells. Researchers will study the environmental context of hybridization in Heuchera across North America and through its recent geological history. The relationship between hybridizing species and their climatic environment will be assessed using genetic data for all species, ecological modeling, and volatile chemical profiling of plants and their pollinators. These data and models will be implemented into a teaching plan that introduces data science training into classes at Mississippi State University. Students will gain hands-on experience through course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). This project will benefit two established courses, and two new courses will be developed. Summer research experiences will further enable students to learn field, lab, and computational skills. Additionally, a workshop for high school teachers will result in development of data science curricula for high school students. The researchers will also outreach to the scientific community through a Data Wrangling workshop series aimed at early-career plant scientists. Finally, the researchers will launch a website focusing on publicly accessible scientific information for these economically important landscaping plants.<br/><br/>The overall theory that this project seeks to test is that hybridization frequency is related to change through time both of organisms and of the environments they live in, both of which control the flow of genetic information. The data and models produced in this study will be used to test three specific hypotheses: hybridization frequency is environmentally driven by (1) the changing seasonal climates of today and (2) areas that experienced substantial past climate change, and biologically driven by (3) pollination by a broad variety of insects rather than a narrow target insect.

Rough patches on fault surfaces can collide and lock, preventing any further movement on a fault. Earthquakes begin when these rough patches break, and earthquake characteristics are controlled by frictional processes at the fault surface that evolve as the earthquake occurs. This project will advance our understanding of the physics of earthquakes by exploring two mechanisms that may regulate the friction of faults during earthquakes. The first occurs when heating leads to increased pressure in fluids, which can promote continued slip in earthquakes through lubrication, and the second is hardening due to producing more space for the lubricating fluids, which can impede earthquakes. To better understand these processes, the PI will conduct experiments at earthquake like conditions using a one-of-a-kind deformation apparatus at Brown University. The PI will test the roles of natural fault roughness and wear processes on the two competing processes. The results from this work will advance our understanding of earthquake physics and will inform the development and modification of new and existing earthquake rupture models. These models play a vital role in mitigating earthquake hazard and risk worldwide by improving the understanding of earthquake processes. This project will also enable the PI?s continued participation in DEEPS CORES, a program that develops and implements STEM curriculum for local Providence public schools. DEEPS CORES aims to expand participation in STEM fields from under-represented groups and to improve science literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>Experimental validation of physics-based constitutive equations that describe the frictional behavior of geologic materials during seismic slip is a critical step in advancing physics-based dynamic rupture models for earthquakes. This work will use the newly modified Tullis Rotary Shear Apparatus at Brown University to conduct several suites of dynamic rock friction experiments investigating two mechanisms that may regulate the frictional behavior of faults during earthquakes: thermal pore-fluid pressurization weakening (TPW) and dilatancy hardening (DH). TPW occurs as frictionally heated pore fluids thermally expand faster than the fault pores. In poorly drained conditions during seismic slip, this leads to increases in the pore pressure that decrease the shear stress acting on the fault thereby weakening the fault. DH has the opposite effect in which shearing causes the formation of new microcracks increases total pore volume, thereby reducing pore fluid pressure and strengthening faults. TPW will only be significant during earthquakes if DH is minimal. To elucidate to roles of wear and fault roughness on dynamic friction and explore the balance between TPW and DH, the PI is conducting experiments at slip rates up to 1 m/s, elevated confining pressures (45-60 MPa), and elevated pore pressures (25-40 MPa) on samples with both variable permeability and sliding surface roughness mimicking the range of fault roughness measured on faults in nature. Mechanical data will be combined with microstructural analysis and micromechanical modelling to guide the analysis and interpretation of results. These experiments will be the first with independently controlled and elevated pore pressure, confining pressure, and normal stress at slip rates of 1 m/s. It will establish conditions under which wear processes, enhanced by natural fault roughness, allow TPW to develop in samples with varying permeabilities and will also establish the extent to which DH counteracts TPW on rough surfaces at high displacements.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Earth Sciences, Geophysics Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work integrates multiple datasets of archaeological plant remains, addressing a critical gap in the current knowledge regarding how land-use practices reflect socio-political mechanisms on the colonial frontier. Dendroanthracological (tree-ring) techniques are used to study archaeological wood charcoal, enabling the identification of specific woodland management and wood-use practices. By focusing on legacy collections, the study not only synthesizes regional paleoethnobotanical investigation and land-use reconstructions but also uses previously collected datasets to maximize preservation of archaeological sites.

It is also difficult to record neuronal activities for a long time in neural organoids. To address those challenges, in this project, a new approach will be developed to derive neural organoids that better mimic brain structures. Those improved organoids will be assembled to represent interactions between various brain regions. The second objective of this project is to incorporate tissue-like, ultra-flexible mesh electrodes into those organoids. Those mesh electrodes are known to have minimal impacts on cells and can safely monitor the electrical activities of neurons chronically. The last objective is to investigate if applying electrical stimulations to neural organoids can accelerate their maturation, which usually takes several months. Together, this project will lead to improved neural organoid models and new knowledge in human brain development. The project will also support several educational and outreach activities, including new course development, undergraduate research projects, and paid internship programs.  Highly motivated regional high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from diverse backgrounds will have opportunities to engage in stem cell research, which will facilitate the recruitment and retention of students in this exciting field.<br/><br/>Neural organoids provide a promising platform for studying brain development and diseases. However, current neural organoids are still limited by the lack of proper regionalization and electrical stimulation for functional maturation and means of chronic monitoring for developmental studies. This project aims to transcend these key limitations by developing an engineered neural organoid system that is properly regionalized and innervated with a tissue-like mesh system capable of chronic monitoring and stimulation for improved studies of circuitry development in the neocortex. The overall research goal will be accomplished through three main objectives: (1) Regionalized neural organoid that enables the thalamus-subpallium-cortex projections will be assembled by stacking - sliced thalamic organoids and sliced telencephalic organoids with dorsoventrally patterned cortex and subpallium. (2) The sliced organoids will be innervated with tissue-like, ultra-flexible mesh electrodes for forming an Engineered Assembly of Sliced Organoids (EASOs) capable of real-time feedbacking the chronic developmental state.

The linear model either focuses on increasing food production (farm) or the end consumer (fork). The middle segment of the linear food system model (food processing) has limited accessibility to underserved communities. Understanding the middle segment (food processing) is important to address food and nutrition security for the sustainable transformation of food systems. This project aims to develop a circular FEAST framework through research to revive an ancient culturally appropriate Osage food via sustainable food processing to address hidden hunger at the Osage Nation. Understanding the micronutrient profiles from soil -> water -> plants -> food -> people can advance scientific insights and the interconnections of micronutrients in the food ecosystem. This fundamental understanding connecting qualitative and quantitative data will help design strategies to prevent hidden hunger in the study region: Osage (Wah-Zha-Zhe) Nation, Pawhuska, Oklahoma. <br/><br/>The FEAST Project aims to investigate sustainable food process engineering strategies to address hidden hunger and support food sovereignty in the Osage Nation via three Research Milestones (M) and three Educational Goals (EG). (M 1) To understand the specific interactions in the soil-water-plant-food-people connecting micronutrient deficiencies in the food system, and how this understanding can inform targeted interventions for the Osage Nation to address micronutrient deficiencies effectively. (M2) To address if sustainable food process engineering can be leveraged to enhance the nutrition, accessibility, and availability of a traditional food [elderberry] at the Osage Nation, by adopting a 10 step FPE (Food Process Engineering) protocol and connecting ancient food knowledge with new technology to enhance the economic development. (M 3) Co-creating a FEAST framework with layer-by-layer integration connecting circular food systems and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the Osage Nation to build resilient food and nutrition security systems. The FEAST framework can be scaled to other Tribal Nations to support food sovereignty. The project's Educational Goals (EG) seek to increase awareness about hidden hunger, sustainable food processing, and SDGs. EG1: Engaging students with real-life problems from the FEAST project into two courses for teamwork: Food Process Engineering and Zero Hunger Challenge. EG2: Designing an Osage specific Cultural Competence for Engaged Research module with inputs from an Advisory Board to interact with the Osage members. EG3: Developing a digital storybook app in Osage (Wah-Zha-Zhe) language and English. The project team will partner with the Osage Nation- Harvest Land to conduct a pair of two-day FEAST-SDG workshops, including hands-on training on sustainable food processing to revive an Osage food (from M2 & M3) and connecting to SDGs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fishponds were essential for community food production and held special cultural significance. Land use was managed through a traditional approach called the Ahupua?a system. Each ahupua?a was self-sufficient for the community it served and stretched from the reefs of the shoreline (makai) to the mountain ridges above (mauka). Native Hawaiians began revival of their cultural heritage over the last 50 years, including restoration of ancient fishponds and methods used to cultivate food. Decline of plantation agriculture in Hawaii over has reduced agricultural education in schools. This project aims to investigate how to integrate sustainable aquaculture practices embraced by Native Hawaiians for centuries with emerging agricultural technologies (AgTech) focused on using sensors, measurement of relevant parameters, and data science literacy. The project immerses high school students in Hawaii to the traditional knowledge and heritage of fishponds and aquaculture alongside hands-on science investigations using emerging technologies to improve agricultural practices. Students use smart farming technologies and sensors to collect data and employ data science to understand and make decisions about the best ways to grow limu (seaweed).  Students gain new skills in data science and agricultural technologies in general, as well as connect with knowledge holders in their community to gain a deeper appreciation for their Hawaiian heritage, culture and knowledge. <br/><br/>The Institute for Future Intelligence (IFI) and the Pacific International Center for High Technology Research (PICHTR) collaborate to research and develop an integrated STEM curriculum focused on AgTech that will connect traditional and modern practices in aquaculture to promote culturally responsive STEM education. The efficiency and sustainability of aquaculture production can be further improved with innovative AgTech, while modern agricultural/aquacultural practices would be enhanced by the traditional Hawaiian approaches to growing food in a community that connects the mountain to the shore. The project will be piloted at Castle High School in the Windward district of Oahu. Teacher professional development workshops will be offered to STEM teachers across Hawaii. The research project takes a mixed methods approach to investigate three driving inquiries: (1) In what ways and to what extent can the project enhance student learning of AgTech, data science and AI concepts and practices through innovative use of Integrated STEM curriculum design? (2) In what ways and to what extent can the project increase students? interest in modern smart agriculture practices and develop partnerships for career and workforce preparation when meaningful connections to place-based and traditional knowledge are integrated into the curriculum? (3) In what ways and to what extent can the project improve equitable STEM education, interest in careers in agriculture and aquaculture, and workforce preparation when modern data science and AgTech approaches are used in the curriculum? This project strives towards four outcomes: (1) students learn to use emerging AgTech and data science practices, (2) students learn STEM within the context of the historically significant aquaculture in Hawaiian society, (3) students conduct scientific research in aquaculture, and (4) students are prepared to enter the STEM workforce with knowledge of current AgTech practices or continue their education in the related fields at colleges. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New set-based dynamic modeling and control frameworks will be developed to account for the complex and uncertain behaviors of thermal management systems to make them trustworthy and reliable in safety-critical applications. To support the electrification of power systems, thermal management systems have become highly-integrated safety-critical elements of these complex energy systems. However, the lack of modeling and control techniques capable of safely maximizing the capability of thermal management systems makes them a bottleneck and liability within the overall system. This project will solve this challenge and achieve trustworthy thermal management systems operations via set-based techniques to capture uncertainty and bound worst-case behaviors, systematic allocation of risk to account for structured and unstructured sources of uncertainty, and verification of interpretable and analyzable closed-loop controllers under all possible system operations. The modeling, control, analysis, and verification techniques in this project are cross-cutting and applicable to other safety-critical dynamic systems with nonlinear and hybrid dynamics. Through close integration of research and education, this project will train multi-disciplined engineers in the intersection of thermal energy management, dynamic systems modeling, and advanced control to meet the increasingly critical workforce demand for thermal controls engineers. This will be achieved through hands-on project-based learning at the undergraduate and graduate levels and undergraduate research opportunities designed to provide multi-disciplinary engineering education and broaden participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to the design and analysis of scalable, high-performance, and provably safe controllers for complex energy management systems. It will achieve this goal by developing set-based modeling and control techniques for thermal management systems, which provide the potentially transformative paradigm needed to make these systems trustworthy. This research will create frameworks for set-based modeling and control with rigorous formulations and guarantees to achieve trustworthy thermal management systems operation, integrate systematic risk management in closed-loop decision making to balance performance and safety in highly uncertain operational environments, and extract interpretable and analyzable control laws from optimization-based control formulations for dependable real-time system operation. The novel hybrid zonotope set representation provides the enabling and unifying capability to represent and bound the hybrid and nonlinear dynamics associated with thermal management systems and the control laws designed to optimize their operation. This research will be evaluated through application to thermal management systems modeling and control for high-performance aircraft in a hardware-in-the-loop implementation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include fraud detection using online financial transaction data, optimizing marketing strategies based on analysis of real time data, etc. A new type of database system called Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) is built to perform these analytical queries over online transactional databases with low response time, but they require increasing computation resources and may still have prolonged query response time as the data continue to grow rapidly. Approximate Query Processing (AQP) techniques can significantly reduce query response time by performing random sampling in the query processing pipelines, but they are only designed for static databases that cannot be updated online. This project seeks to support scalable real-time data analytics on large and rapidly growing databases, by enabling speedy and reliable AQP capabilities in HTAP systems. The project will result in an open-source system that supports approximate real-time data analytics, and thus can potentially enable the aforementioned real-time data analytics applications. Furthermore, this project will also support the development of new educational materials on modern data management systems, include HTAP and AQP systems, as well as research training of undergraduate and graduate students, to improve the readiness of the STEM workforce. In addition, it will also support development of educational materials in data management for K-12 outreach programs and improve the public awareness of database technologies.<br/><br/>Existing HTAP systems perform exact query processing, which incurs at least linear computation cost to input size, and are no longer a viable solution as the rapid growth of data has outpaced limited increase in processor speed and storage bandwidth. Approximate Query Processing (AQP) is a fast alternative that may achieve sublinear time cost if the application can tolerate approximation, but the existing techniques suffer from several drawbacks including high data scan cost, inability to perform correct and efficient transactional updates, as well as inaccurate estimation and unreliable error diagnosis results. This project aims to resolve these drawbacks through a co-design of AQP and HTAP system components including data storage and indexing layer, transaction concurrency control protocols and approximate query processing algorithms. Specifically, this project will result in three main scientific contributions:  (1) It will develop a thread-safe, high-performance, and succinct sampling index design for HTAP storage. It will provide the necessary thread-safe atomic update and fast sampling capabilities for enabling speedy and reliable AQP in HTAP systems. (2) It will design new protocols to enforce snapshot isolation and serializability for database transactions with mixed updates and approximate queries. (3) It will also investigate a new sampling strategy leveraging the fast-sampling capabilities to minimize approximate query latency given a user-specified confidence bound target, and a background diagnosis service for reliably diagnosing estimation failures where the true answer does not fall into the estimated confidence interval with the user-specified confidence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, many interventions aimed at improving people?s functioning and/or quality of life, ranging from psychological therapy to military training, attempt to improve this ability. However, our understanding of the effects of stress on inhibitory control is relatively limited. This project characterizes how stressful situations influence the cognitive mechanisms and processes underlying inhibitory control. The results of this project thus have the potential to identify mechanisms that could be targeted by relevant interventions to improve their effectiveness. In addition, the data collected in this project will be used to develop a publicly available novel course, as well as workshops, to disseminate both the knowledge of the project?s results and the technical skills needed to use the project?s methods. The dissemination of these results and technical skills is likely to contribute to long-term societal benefits, such as improved mental health and productivity. <br/><br/>Although a number of studies have examined the effects of stress on inhibitory control, current theory and important findings from each area?s primary literature have not been considered in the work combining the two. As a result, conflicting results abound in work on stress and inhibitory control, and some findings are difficult to reconcile with current theories of inhibition under stress. Using experimentally manipulated acute stress, computational cognitive modeling, and both standard and mouse-tracking cognitive tasks, the studies in this project develops a new theory of how stress influences inhibitory control. Analytic methods include not only standard behavioral analysis, but also salivary hormone assays, cognitive model parameter estimation, and analysis of nuanced mouse-tracking dynamics unfolding over time. The goal is to advance our understanding of how contextual factors, such as stress, influence inhibitory control, which contributes to both basic science and may guide the development of interventions to improve inhibitory control. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Perception, Action and Cognition and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major problem is that all of these ancient rocks have experienced at least one episode of alteration, deformation and/or metamorphism. So no pristine rocks (protoliths) exist. However, many studies have used whole rock geochemistry and isotope tracers, and more recently the isotope signatures of accessory phases as important anchor points for models of how the crust has evolved and grown over time.  Various theories and processes have been proposed for the formation of Earth's earliest stable crust. The debate over interpreting these data revolves around a core inquiry: whether the deformation and metamorphism of crustal rocks alters certain geochemical markers commonly used in reconstructing crustal history. The primary goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that certain elements and isotopes in deformed (ancient) rocks accurately reflect the original geochemical signatures of their protolith. This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating if the isotope signatures of whole rock and accessory minerals remain unchanged with increasing strain, and hence faithfully record the original protolithic (isotope) composition, or if deformation leads to the disturbance of isotope systems on a mineral and/or whole rock scale. Three different sequences of rocks, varying in degrees of deformation, will be studied to understand the extent to which deformation may alter their geochemical signatures on a whole rock, and (sub)-mineral-scale. These sequences range from initially undeformed (protolith) rocks to highly deformed ones, which closely resemble the world's oldest rocks. The findings of this study will help researchers use and interpret geochemical, particularly isotopic, data from deformed ancient rocks. This research will support student training, international collaboration, and continued development of analytical facilities at the Peter Hooper GeoAnalytical Lab and the Radiogenic Isotope & Geochronology Lab at Washington State University. Two PhD students (one female), as well as undergraduate students will be trained in field work and cross-disciplinary research spanning from mineralogy to structural geology to geochemistry.<br/><br/>Isotope signatures in whole rock samples and in some accessory minerals, such as zircon, apatite, allanite, and titanite, are frequently used to reconstruct the formation and evolution of the Earth?s crust. However, virtually all Archean and Proterozoic rocks have experienced one or more episodes of deformation and metamorphism following their emplacement, and it is unclear to what degree these rocks retain their original (i.e., protolithic) isotope ratios after experiencing these tectono-thermal events. This research combines a geochemical and structural approach to understand to what degree granitic rocks can be deformed without changing their protolithic geochemical fingerprint at a whole rock- and (sub-)mineral-scale. This project will focus on testing a primary hypothesis: that whole rocks and accessory minerals in variably deformed granitic rocks faithfully retain their original geochemical isotope signatures and hence can be used to reconstruct long-term crustal processes, such as the formation of Earth?s earliest stable crust.  The following key questions will be investigated: 1) what accessory minerals are involved in deformation-induced mineral reactions? 2) does deformation lead to open-system processes, and if so, how does this vary with degree of deformation? and 3) to what extent do Lu-Hf, Sm-Nd, and Rb-Sr isotope systematics in accessory minerals of variably deformed rocks faithfully preserve their initial isotope compositions? Three different field localities in which the same granitic bodies are exposed across strain gradients, spanning from undeformed to highly deformed will be studied. Via comparison of isotope data of the above systems on an accessory mineral- and whole rock-scale between deformed granitic rocks and their protoliths can be tested if deformed rocks retain their original isotope signatures on different scales (mineral vs. whole rock) or if the above isotope systems become disturbed upon deformation and hence cannot be trusted to reflect the protolithic composition. High-spatial resolution in-situ isotope and elemental analyses via EPMA and LA-(MC)-ICP-MS will be conducted on all major and accessory phases in order to gain an in-depth understanding of how minerals geochemically communicate with each other during deformation and if and to what degree trace elements are mobilized and redistributed on different scales. The results of this study will offer key understandings into how geochemical and particularly isotopic information from deformed and metamorphosed rocks can be interpreted and applied to reconstruct large-scale crustal processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advancements in the human-technology frontier demand the readiness of next-generation scientists who can further develop and test such technologies. Yet, regions of our nation are experiencing a significant shortage of qualified job candidates. This ITEST design and development project tackles the challenge of workforce development in the state of Alabama, by creating a physiological computing curriculum for upper elementary school children enrolled in afterschool settings. Participating children will measure their own physiological data (such as muscle energy) and design computer programs that react to their data in real time. Through the curriculum and extracurricular activities, the project also exposes participating children and their families to emerging computing careers. By focusing on how participation impacts children?s career aspirations and confidence for learning STEM, the project has the potential to inform current understanding of the barriers, challenges, and successes young learners experience during physiological computing and how their conceptual understanding of foundational computer science concepts evolves. <br/><br/>Anticipating that future generations of engineers and scientists will need skills related to creating computer applications and programs associated with human movements and emotions via electrical activity, this three-year project will develop and iteratively implement a standards-aligned, physiological computing curriculum with a disciplinary literacy approach that encourages career exploration and critical thinking. The project uses design-based implementation research to examine its hypothesis that participation in the physiological computing environment and related career enrichment activities will enhance elementary students? conceptual understanding of computer science, self-efficacy for learning STEM, and STEM career aspirations. The project aims to enroll over 100 elementary students and prepare 20 (in-service and pre-service) teachers through professional development to enhance teachers? technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge to lead the lessons. Data sources include teacher focus groups, student surveys and interviews, students? conceptual drawings and design blueprints, and eye gaze and scan paths during on-screen problem-solving tasks.

When high-demand electronics are not available in the marketplace, they become prime targets for counterfeiters. Aside from billions of dollars lost from intellectual property (IP) infringement, counterfeit electronics are often of substandard quality, thereby creating risks for systems and infrastructure in critical sectors such as healthcare, food and agriculture, communications, transportation, energy, manufacturing, emergency services, defense, and more. Recent legislation, such as the CHIPS Act, stresses the need for procedures to combat counterfeiting, but key stakeholders have resisted adoption of the requisite technologies for years. Counterfeit detection and avoidance can be accomplished by physical inspection, electrical tests, or design-for-anti-counterfeit (DfAC). The former two have been the mainstay, but are less reliable, more expensive, and lack automation. Although DfAC primitives can only be included in brand new electronics, they are more promising with respect to accuracy, authentication cost, and scalability. Further, centralized and decentralized ledger technologies, including blockchains, are advancing to support DfAC primitive verification and for immutable traceability and provenance of electronics. This project aims to address the major barriers for DfAC primitive integration into microchips and systems. Counterfeit attestation modules (CAMOs for short) will be developed to efficiently collect DfAC outputs from all the microchips on a printed circuit board (PCB), verify that the PCB itself has not been tampered, and protect communication of results to a digital ledger for en masse authentication. In addition, lightweight DfAC primitives that can be conveniently incorporated into common microchip modules will also be explored.  Scalable, convenient, and inexpensive detection of counterfeit electronics from this project shall result in savings for commercial and defense industries that will be passed on to consumers and taxpayers.<br/><br/>The above goals will be achieved through four tasks. First, a novel circuit called Resonant Frequency Lock-On (Res-FLO) will be explored for self-contained authentication of PCBs. Res-FLO captures unique, process variation dependent signatures from PCB power distribution networks to detect cloned and tampered PCBs. Next, to support chip authentication and provide security in CAMO communication protocols, lightweight DfAC primitives will be investigated for detecting the two most prevalent counterfeit chip types ? recycled and cloned. The former will be detected by measuring degradation in analog and digital low dropout regulators (LDOs) while the latter can be achieved by adopting physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Third, inexpensive protocols that provide confidentiality and integrity for communications within the PCB and to a ledger/blockchain will be composed from elements of the first two tasks. Namely, CAMO will exploit the large input/output space, machine learning (ML) attack resistance, and multiple measurements of strong PUFs to increase the security and confidence of authentic/counterfeit classification without the need for expensive cryptographic and error correction schemes. Finally, the CAMO primitives and protocols will be taped out for proof-of-concept and to capture overheads, impacts of aging and noise, resistance to attacks, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undergraduate students in math and statistics crave real-world experience. Applying techniques, from coursework to challenging problems in collaboration with researchers from other fields, provides students with confidence and a deeper understanding of mathematical and statistical concepts. Paired with a professional development plan, DRUMS will produce a diverse cadre of undergraduate researchers with technical and soft skills well-prepared to pursue graduate programs in STEM fields. This program enhances vertical integration by embedding each team with a graduate student mentor and training inclusive and effective mentors. The work will be disseminated via the DRUMS website, journal publications, and conference presentations.<br/><br/>The research problems focus on the interface of math and statistics, solving real-world problems using methods from uncertainty quantification, and the systematic study of mathematical modeling using statistical data analysis to refine models and quantify uncertainties. The pairing of math and statistics is natural, as math forms the foundation of statistics, and statistics is increasingly being used to refine mathematical models. Also, there is a substantial overlap in undergraduate coursework in these fields. Hence, the barriers to collaboration are low, and exposing students to research across these fields will give students a broad perspective on careers in data science. Participating students will work in teams, each with a faculty and a graduate student mentor, engaging in a 1ten-week research program. Teams will be encouraged to submit their work for publication and present it at a professional conference.

Boiling heat transfer plays a pivotal role in various industries such as aviation, space exploration, electric vehicles, and industrial heat. Despite its significance, fundamental questions persist regarding boiling heat transfer, including an understanding of unique flow patterns, temperature distributions, bubble sizes, and trajectories. These challenges arise from difficulties in modeling and visualizing temperatures. Understanding temperature distributions and driving processes is crucial for the development of next-generation thermal management systems. The outcomes of this project are expected to be pertinent to industrial applications by establishing knowledge and metrology for complex heat transfer systems. One specific area of interest is enhancing the energy efficiency of heat exchangers. Cooling for data centers (that use heat exchangers) accounts for approximately 1% of all electricity produced in the US, resulting in a cost of $34 billion and 137 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Therefore, exploring new opportunities in advanced temperature-metrology and analysis for heat exchanger performance improvements will have a tremendous impact on energy resources. Additionally, the project contributes to education through three tasks: (1) creating educational videos and exercises for machine learning modeling; (2) developing structured learning activities for K-12 and undergraduate students; and (3) collaborating with Intel Corporation to inspire students in non-academic research settings.<br/><br/>Understanding temperature changes in boiling fluids over finned surfaces is currently limited. There is a lack of understanding regarding the spatiotemporal variation of temperature field in boiling fluids over finned surface, which represent a complex fundamental mode of heat transfer. The research proposes a novel temperature visualization method that integrates laser-based diagnostic tools and advanced deep learning methods to enable the measurement in boiling fluids in complex geometries. The project hypothesizes that advances in deep learning can reconstruct temperature fields in fluids from sparse measurements and correct visualization artifacts, enabling the visualization of spatiotemporal temperature variations in boiling fluids. If successful, the proposed research can significantly advance the fundamental understanding of the following thermal transport phenomena: (1) The impact of flow-structure interaction on the temperature field, thermal boundary layer, and superheated liquid layer development, (2) The mixing behavior of the thermal boundary layer during vapor evaporation, bubble departure from the surface, and rewetting of the dry spot after microlayer evaporation, and  (3) The distribution of local heat transfer coefficients on finned surfaces at different phases of the boiling process. The improved understanding will contribute to the design of more effective finned heat exchangers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The past two decades have seen the development of many individual streaming algorithms that meet specific measurement requirements, such as determining item frequencies and identifying heavy hitters, super spreaders, anomalies, large deviations, persistent patterns, etc. However, new algorithms must be continuously designed to meet new demands from modern data streaming applications. This project charts a different course with a holistic, systematic approach that explores the design principles of fundamental streaming algorithms (e.g., Bloom Filters) and establishes several common frameworks that can be used to develop a new and highly flexible, future-proof family of streaming algorithms.<br/><br/>This project seeks to design a one-size-fits-all family of streaming algorithms that can be easily reconfigured for different measurement tasks or multiple combined tasks. For example, the proposed streaming algorithms will be able to identify malicious intrusions and anomalies in enterprise networks, and at the same time rank the popularity of online content (e.g., social media posts, product pages) to provide guidance for business decisions. Real-world data streaming applications in large data centers must deal with heterogeneous, and often limited, resource availability. The algorithms explored in this work are designed to be lightweight. In a security context, they might be used to monitor and secure a network without interfering with other applications. Further, users / applications will also have options for multi-dimensional tradeoffs among performance, overhead, resource usage, and accuracy.

By integrating single cell genomics and microscopic observations, this project will lead to the discovery of new species and taxonomic revision of five major blastoclad lineages, including Coelomomyces, a genus that has long been studied as a potential biocontrol agent of disease-vectoring mosquitoes. A better understanding of the biodiversity and genetics of the group and their ecological interactions can help in global preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks and development of possible biocontrol agents.

Genome sequencing of 30 taxa will be used to evaluate blastoclad diversity in a phylogenetic context. Several of the blastoclad genera are greatly in need of taxonomic revision. The project will focus on these genera, using a combined approach of morphology, DNA sequencing, and host range to determine appropriate species boundaries and describe new taxa. A final goal is to use environmental DNA approaches, such as metagenomics and metabarcoding to determine the extent of cryptic diversity of blastoclads, i.e., how many species are yet to be sampled, and to identify habitats that are particularly rich in blastoclad biodiversity.

Harnessing magnons presents an intriguing avenue for creating synthetic matter not found in nature and developing next-generation quantum devices with unprecedented functionalities. While the properties of electrons have been intensively studied, the investigation of magnons and their collective behavior in solids remains extremely limited. A promising and tunable platform to explore this direction is graphene - a sheet of carbon atoms - placed in a strong magnetic field, where magnons can be efficiently launched and detected. The primary goal of this project is to explore the possible quantum phenomena that can be engineered by using magnons as building blocks and to investigate the feasibility of utilizing magnons to probe the magnetic properties of atomically thin materials. The success of this project promises to advance the frontier of fundamental quantum science and enable innovative pathways to future quantum technologies such as ultra-low-power information devices. This project also connects materials education with the growing societal demand for quantum technology through research-informed education and outreach programs for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The exploration of correlated and topological states of charge-neutral bosons presents a compelling avenue for advancing our understanding of emergent phases of matter not found in nature and unlocking new opportunities in quantum technology. Magnons, also known as spin waves, in the quantum Hall ferromagnetic state of monolayer graphene, have recently emerged as a versatile solid-state platform for designing and probing emergent phases of bosons, owing to their extraordinary tunability, long lifetime, all-electrical generation and detection scheme and their remarkable sensitivity to the magnetic environment. However, our knowledge about the interaction between magnons and their coupling to the surrounding environments remains extremely limited. The project aims to experimentally address these key questions to facilitate future theoretical analysis and experimental development of emergent phases of magnons and a magnon-enabled spin probe. This investigation is made possible by leveraging recent advances in van der Waals assembly and moir quantum matter, along with a creative combination of quantum electronic transport and scanning probe microscopy techniques to extract transport and thermodynamics properties of magnons in ultra-high-quality graphene heterostructures. Ultimately, this project provides a new pathway for the design, construction, characterization, and manipulation of correlated and topological phases of bosons in solids and establishes a new, generic, and effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in two-dimensional materials. In addition, this project has a broader impact through research and training opportunities in quantum science for undergraduates, graduate students, and high school teachers, and a new course on two-dimensional quantum materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This spectacular feature results from the natural occurring emissions, and their intensity depends on precipitating electrons at high latitudes, which in turn can influence energy deposition. Deposited energy can be propagated away in the form of gravity waves and can affect other latitudinal regions. Energetic particle precipitation associated with different aurora, and in particular pulsating aurora, can cause enhancements in the upper regions of the ionosphere, which absorbs high-frequency radio wave propagation. This impacts communication systems that are important for transpolar flights requiring continuous communication links to be open to the ground.  The focus of this investigation is specifically to understand pulsating aurora, which is one of the most observed auroral types.  Despite its ubiquitous occurrence, the electrodynamics of pulsating aurora have not been investigated in detail as other kinds of aurora. This investigation intends to address fundamental problems associated with the electrodynamics of a time changing system, driven by the on-and-off modulations occurring during pulsating auroral events. Educational efforts include a space science summer research experience for middle school students and establishment of a NASA Rocksat-X program for undergraduate students at Clemson University. The activities will promote collaboration between academic (Clemson University) and non-academic, non-profit organization (Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute) and community partner (Littlejohn Community Center).  <br/><br/>Enhanced electron precipitation during auroral events modifies ionospheric conductivity, and thus investigation of pulsating aurora offers an excellent opportunity to expand knowledge about electrodynamics of the high latitude regions. Two scientific questions that will be addressed as a part of this effort are (a) What is the electric field, current, and conductivity structure of pulsating aurora?  and (b) How do temporal changes in the average energy and energy flux of the pulsating aurora precipitation affect the conductivity? To address the first objective, the methodology will utilize Poker Flat incoherent scatter radar data and perform modeling investigations of pulsating aurora electrodynamics using the 3-D Geospace Environment Model of Ion-Neutral Interactions (GEMINI) ionosphere model. The GEMINI modeling simulations will be conducted on idealized pulsating aurora and actual events in which all-sky imager and PFISR data will be used to drive the model. To achieve the second goal, utilization of the Poker Flat DPS-4D Digisonde, all-sky imager observations, and deployment of high frequency (HF) radio receivers and transmitters at Poker Flat Research Range are suggested. Additionally, a new technique will be developed that will leverage HF radio wave observations at high temporal resolution to capture fast ionospheric and associated electrodynamical changes occurring during the pulsating aurora.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Aeronomy program, in the AGS Division of the GEO directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at the NSF.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogels are soft and hydrated materials similar to our body tissues. This similarity makes them useful for creating soft machines that better interact with human bodies. Applications of soft machines include medical implants, wearable devices, and biomimetic robots. Unlike conventional machines that are assembled by rigid parts like nuts and bolts, soft machines are assembled through deformable adhesion. Although some existing studies have realized hydrogel adhesion that can reliably survive larger deformation, it is difficult to reversibly switch the adhesion on and off so that the soft machine can be repaired or reconfigured by part exchange, which is a common practice in conventional machines. This project will investigate novel adhesion mechanisms that enable the reversible assembly of soft machines. The success of the project will revolutionize the design of soft machines, which in turn will impact the development of many relevant applications. Moreover, the project will create training materials to help graduate students turn cutting-edge research findings into short, easy-to-understand videos.

This CAREER project aims to create a unified framework along with various tools and techniques to design optimal approximation algorithms for a broad range of NP-hard clustering problems. Despite significant progress in developing efficient approximations for computationally hard clustering problems, the analysis of the large-scale and complex datasets remains challenging resulting in suboptimal accuracy and limiting practical applications in science and engineering. The algorithmic development and analysis are expected to have a direct impact on the fields of data science and bioinformatics.

The first thrust focuses on addressing clustering challenges in strings with special emphasis on centroid-based clustering problems such as k-median and k-center. This study will encompass various metric spaces including edit distance, Ulam, and Kendall tau. The objective is to formulate methodologies that transcend the limitations set by the triangle inequality, yielding polynomial-time algorithms with approximations arbitrarily close to one. The second thrust focuses on issues related to hierarchical clustering. Here the objective is to evaluate how well the techniques and frameworks originally devised for addressing string clustering problems can be adapted for aggregating hierarchical clusters. Additionally, the project will develop new methods for constructing hierarchical clusters specifically tailored to address challenges related to large datasets. The new tools and combinatorial methods developed in this project are expected to enhance algorithms for clustering problems and should find applicability in various other domains including communication complexity, streaming algorithms, and distributed systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As data generation and processing needs grow exponentially across everyday devices like smartphones to complex systems like datacenters and supercomputers, there is a need to harness the full potential of new hardware technologies. This project focuses on Compute Express Link (CXL), a cutting-edge interconnect technology that promises to revolutionize how memory, storage, and computing devices interact within and across computers. CXL is poised to revolutionize the integration of memory and storage with near-data compute capabilities. Despite its potential, current operating systems (OS), including widely-used platforms like Linux, are not fully equipped to leverage CXL's capabilities, leading to underutilized hardware and other inefficiencies. This CAREER project endeavors to redesign the Linux kernel to optimize its compatibility with CXL technology. The overarching goal is to develop a new load-store I/O stack that can effectively manage CXL-enabled memory, storage, and compute devices. This initiative will result in enhanced performance, resource efficiency, and simplified programming requirements. The project involves a holistic approach, integrating co-design efforts across the OS, runtime environments, applications, and CXL devices. <br/><br/>The outcomes of this research are expected to lead to significant advancements in computing, including improved memory and storage utilization, novel OS and runtime-level techniques for efficient data management, and the development of new programming models tailored for CXL-based devices. By open-sourcing all developed software, the project also promises to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fields of system design and computer architecture. The project also incorporates extensive education plans to train the next-generation of computer scientists, providing students with up-to-date, research-driven learning and industry collaboration opportunities. Ultimately, this research will pave the way for more efficient, cost-effective, and high-performing computing solutions, benefiting a wide range of data-intensive applications and services, such as data-analytics, caching, key-value stores, and machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This elementary reaction between palladium and organohalides is a key step in cross-coupling reactions. Cross-coupling reactions are a mainstay of organic synthesis. However, controlling the selectivity of cross-couplings can be problematic when organic molecules contain multiple halogens. This work will enable understanding of how conditions influence the exact pathway by which palladium reacts, and this new understanding will have implications for controlling the reaction site when multiple carbon-halogen bonds are present on a molecule. In turn, this work will facilitate development of more efficient and selective methods for organic synthesis. As part of this project, an educational program will also be developed that focuses on facilitating visualization of organic reaction mechanisms in 3D space while also providing students with practical training in molecular modeling using computational tools.<br/><br/>Sharon Neufeldt and her research team at the Montana State University are studying the mechanism of oxidative addition of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides to molecular Pd(0) species. At least two pathways are known to be relevant, and a central hypothesis of this work is that the dominant mechanism can be predicted based on palladium coordination number, ligand sterics and electronics, the structure of the organic electrophile, and other factors such as solvent polarity. Understanding these factors is expected to enable control of the mechanism, and the ability to predispose Pd toward one mechanism over the other can have broad implications for controlling chemo- and site-selectivity of cross-coupling reactions. The overall objective is divided into the following specific aims: (1) to develop a model for the influence of coordination number, substrate, ligand class, and solvent on the mechanism of oxidative addition; (2) to investigate the influence of nucleophilic coupling partner on oxidative addition; and (3) to develop new palladium(0) sources. This work will be accomplished through experimental and computational techniques including carbon kinetic isotope effect studies, reaction rate and selectivity studies, organometallic synthesis, and density functional theory calculations. This work is anticipated to improve understanding of how oxidative addition takes place in such Pd(0)/ArX systems. It will also provide a starting point for rationally engineering selectivity in cross-coupling reactions, thereby streamlining reaction optimization and improving synthesis design principles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The distribution of such variable traits within a species can shift over time. For example, behavioral traits can change quickly in response to environmental change or species interactions. The dynamic shift of trait distribution within a species can modify the interaction patterns among species and ultimately affect the stability of ecosystems. However, the prevalence and significance of such effects have not been evaluated systematically. This research project aims to fill in the gap by integrating theoretical and empirical approaches. A mathematical framework will be developed to classify different types of interaction modification and identify conditions that would destabilize ecosystems. Additionally, a comprehensive survey of empirical studies will be conducted to assess the level of evidence for the various types of interaction modification identified above and provide criteria for evaluating past and future case studies. This project will train young researchers in the interdisciplinary area between mathematics and ecology to address important environmental and ecological problems facing the next generation. In addition, educational kits and programs will be designed to promote teaching of important ecological concepts and engage underrepresented groups in K-12 schools.<br/> <br/>Intraspecific trait variation has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in determining ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Although some work has examined how the variation of heritable traits affects eco-evolutionary dynamics, non-heritable variation caused by phenotypic plasticity, developmental differences, or species interactions has received less consideration. Ecosystems have traditionally been studied as dynamical systems with fixed interaction strengths, but these interaction strengths will no longer be constant if the trait distributions can shift within short timescales. Such ?trait-shift induced interaction modification? (TSIIM) can lead to higher-order interactions among species, causing species extinction or coexistence that are otherwise unexpected. This project will develop a theoretical framework for studying TSIIM by generalizing traditional dynamical systems to incorporate intraspecific trait variation and categorizing these systems into different network motifs. The effect on large ecosystems will be studied using a disordered systems approach augmented by the new motifs. Meta-analysis of these motifs using empirical studies will provide insight on the mechanisms by which higher-order interactions arise from TSIIM, prompting experimental searches for such phenomena and their consequences.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program at the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Population and Community Ecology Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology at the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These strained ring molecules are among the most common motifs found in medicinally active compounds. Yet, there are few methods of making them ? and these methods typically require the use of unstable reagents that are difficult to scale. This project seeks to generate cyclopropanes with new catalytic approaches that employ safe, cheap starting materials and provide synthetic entry into substitution patterns that were previously inaccessible. These studies will also focus on developing efficient, scalable, and environmentally benign technologies that can be generally applied to the synthesis of different classes of molecules that can benefit society. The program also provides training for a diverse and dynamic team of graduate and undergraduate students, who are also passionate about outreach, recruitment, and inspiring future scientists. Among the mechanisms for inspiring the public are timely social media tutorials on current events with relevant chemistry to society.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Nagib and his research team will investigate new catalytic strategies to synthesize cyclopropanes, valuable motifs in bioactive small molecules. Cyclopropanes are most commonly synthesized via a (2+1) reaction of an alkene and a highly reactive carbene intermediate. Current approaches to generating carbenes require the use of reagents that are often unstable and specialized precursors, presenting significant barriers to their further application. This proposal aims to develop new catalytic strategies to access carbenes from more simple, safe, and abundant precursors using sustainable reagents. These efforts include the polarity reversal of electrophilic metallocarbenes, single-electron transfer events to radical intermediates, and developing more robust conditions amenable to applications such as biocatalysis and high-throughput experimentation. These processes can eventually be scaled-up more easily to allow better and cheaper access to new molecules with broad implications for medicinal, materials and agro-chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The organizers take pride in the camaraderie and welcoming atmosphere they strive to create, and many in the community deeply value and appreciate these events. <br/> <br/>A trisection splits a 4-dimensional space into three simple pieces.  Since their introduction roughly a decade ago, trisections have proven to be a successful new tool with which to study smooth 4-manifolds, with numerous articles written in the interim to develop the foundations for trisection theory. An important strength of the theory of trisections is the way it interfaces with a variety of other topics in low-dimensional topology.  This interface provides an opportunity to explore many classical areas of 4-manifold topology through a new lens. Such areas include, for example, the study of knotted surfaces in 4-space, diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, exotic smooth structures, group actions and (branched) covering spaces, and symplectic structures.  The main goal of these workshops is to bring together researchers from multiple areas to propose and to work on open problems, with a particular focus on the inclusion of early career researchers.  The workshops are preceded by a series of introductory virtual pre-workshop talks, which serve to bring new researchers up to speed, to facilitate the work to be done in groups, and to incorporate a broader, worldwide audience.

In addition to research experience, students will practice writing and presenting mathematical work, learn to use software tools for both mathematics research and publication, receive guidance on how to apply to graduate school, and encounter a broad range of mathematical topics through a seminar series.   Students will be drawn primarily from non-PhD granting institutions and recruitment will emphasize under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences, including women and minorities. A major goal is to contribute to the development of human resources in mathematics and mathematically intensive areas by increasing the likelihood that these students go on to graduate study and/or a career in these fields.<br/><br/>Undergraduate research projects will primarily be in aspects of the analysis of fractals and disordered spaces (fractal differential equations, spectral decimation methods), stochastic analysis (ergodic properties of random differential and difference equations, Lyapunov exponents), geometric analysis (geometric properties of random walks on the discrete Heisenberg group and Schreier graphs associated to self-similar groups, functional inequalities, geometry of non-Euclidean structures in Laplacian coordinates).  Most projects will involve detailed study of important examples that can be initiated with minimal prerequisites but for which the results are expected to illuminate some larger part of the theory. The projects have substantial connections to other areas of science; for example, the stochastics projects are related to problems in mathematical physics, Laplacian eigencoordinates and their variants are widely used in machine learning, and fractals and disordered media can be used to model physical structures studied in areas from geology (distribution of oil or water in porous rock) to computer science and neurobiology (structure of neural networks).

Bridge cables, muscles, flexible body armor, and aerospace composites are all fiber bundles of some form. Understanding the failure properties of these bundles is crucial but challenging. The lower the desired failure probability (higher reliability), the harder it is to accurately predict. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to increase our understanding of the mechanisms leading to bundle failure. It uses a new computer modeling method to combine experimental data and theory. This will provide insight into how fiber bundles behave, allowing for better estimation of bundle failure probabilities. Knowing the probability of failure allows for better decision making and potentially decreased costs for structures made from fiber bundles, including cables and composites. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. The project will also provide research and outreach opportunities for pre-college minority students, to inspire them to attend college and consider a future in STEM, broadening participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impacting engineering education.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to understand how interactions between fibers determine the bundle?s stress-strain response through deformation to fracture, and the key driving mechanics leading to bundle failure. Bundle failure is caused by instability leading to collapse, and understanding the onset of instability and the lower tail of the failure distribution is critical to ensuring ultra-high reliability. The novelty of this project is the combination of modeling (mechanistic, probabilistic, and stochastic) with experiments in a data-based Monte-Carlo simulation, which will be extensively validated against experimental data. This simulation will numerically determine full bundle stress strain behavior. Further, the new ability to numerically predict distributions of bundle load-strain characteristics for generic, non-linear fibers, will result in improved understanding of the fundamental mechanics of fiber load sharing. Student involvement is key to the success of this project, which involves careful fiber material testing, theoretical concepts, and statistical modeling. This research is ideal for students with a blend of tractable experiments, theory and coding. Their new knowledge and abilities will be cemented through inclusion in outreach activities and presenting at professional conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this reason, the eventual departure of children from the family home, known as the transition into an empty nest, can be difficult for couples as they learn how to step back from roles as parental caregivers and adapt to daily life as ""just"" relationship partners. Indeed, the divorce rate among couples who have recently transitioned into an empty nest may be higher today than ever. Moreover, even couples who remain together after their children's departure from the home frequently recall this transition as a challenging time that strained their emotional connection with one another. Because couples' relationship quality during mid-life can have lasting effects on their happiness, health, and well-being in later life, a better understanding of couples' ability to maintain a strong and healthy relationship during this normative transition is needed.<br/><br/>This project investigates how and why couples? relationship appraisals and day-to-day interactions change across the empty nest transition period through a longitudinal, multi-method study examining couples whose last or only child is departing the home (i.e., couples completing their transition into an empty nest) and couples whose first child is departing the home (i.e., couples just beginning the launching phase). Couples will be assessed via questionnaires and daily surveys administered both before and after their children leave the family home, for a total of five waves of data collection over a three-year period. Building on the idea that relational transitions are pivotal periods that can instigate either relationship growth or decay, this project offers new perspectives on which couples may thrive and which couples may struggle during the empty nest transition. It is proposed that although the transition into an empty nest should provide couples with more opportunities to engage in shared activities and rekindle their relationship, this period may also be characterized by sudden increases in feelings of uncertainty and ambivalence that can hinder positive interactions and increase daily conflict between partners. The extent to which couples experience the benefits versus the costs of this transition may depend on several individual, relational, and contextual factors, such as parents' experience of role loss or identity disruption during this time, the nature of the parent-child relationship, the cultural values held within the family, and the stressful life circumstances (e.g., financial hardships, caring for elderly parents) couples are facing at the time.  By identifying the conditions that foster a more successful rather than strained transition, this work not only enhances understanding of why transitional periods may be challenging for couples, but also can shed light on improving adults' quality of life as they grow older.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(2) Gut biomechanics: it has multiple muscle layers that stretch and contract synchronously to produce a diverse gut motility pattern for digestion and nutrition absorption. The complex interplay between the gut?s biochemistry and biomechanics constitutes the fundamental physiology of the gastrointestinal system. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to diverse neurological, immune, and bowel disorders. However, studying the complicated physiological inter-regulation in such a series of soft, stretchy, long, and twisting organs with a variety of motility patterns has been a long-standing challenge due to the mechanical mismatch between the biological tissue and conventional electronic components. This project seeks to fill this critical technology gap by developing a soft multisensory bioelectronic device that provides robust and intimate tissue coupling while maintaining its biochemical and biomechanical sensing function during continuous gut motion. The outcomes will be new biodata to spur our fundamental understanding of gut physiology, the interplay between serotonin dynamics and gut motility, as well as new bioelectric tools to diagnose and treat digestive and neurological disorders. This project aims to broaden the participation of young people in engineering. This will be achieved through a comprehensive education plan with a variety of engaging activities, including K-12 student and teacher summer programs on electronics and robotics, undergraduate research programs and design-focused courses, and science and art festival demonstrations.<br/>This CAREER proposal aims to integrate unconventional electronic materials and device design, innovative microfabrication methods, wireless hardware, and computational methods, to develop a new type of high-performance multisensory soft bioelectronics capable of simultaneously monitoring gut biochemical release and physical motion with minimized perturbation to the biological system. The proposed multisensory bioelectronic device, with the goal of decoding the gut serotonin and motility interplay, will integrate: (1) A new soft biosensor array for high-resolution gut serotonin detection and mapping, (2) A new soft physical sensor array for high-performance gut motility monitoring, and (3) An implantable wireless integrated circuit for data recording and transmission in freely moving animals and computational methods for the newly produced biodata analysis. With multimodal sensing and mechanical softness, the resulting bioelectronic device will provide robust and intimate tissue coupling while maintaining its high-performance biochemical and biomechanical sensing function during continuous gut motion at its natural state.  In the long term, the new bioelectronic tool described here will not only generate new knowledge in electrical materials and biosensing but also provide new insights into studying gut physiology and microbiota?gut?brain communication, potentially leading to new tools to diagnose and treat various neurological and digestive diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum complexity theory plays a crucial role in guiding the advancement of quantum computing. Nowadays, the study of quantum computing and quantum physics leads to many new computational tasks for dealing with quantum information. The theoretical framework in standard complexity theory might be insufficient to guide the investigation of these new problems. This award will provide a novel theoretical framework to steer the development of fast quantum algorithms for various new problems in quantum physics and computer science, and construct more secure quantum cryptography. Beyond technology, the award will support the (i) development of new quantum computing courses for science and engineering students that will be shared with  nearby Hispanic-serving institutions in Houston, (ii) mentoring of students from underrepresented groups through the Research Emerging Scholars Program and the Quantum Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program, and (iii) institution of a Hybrid Quantum Computing Seminar to deepen the engagement with internal and external stakeholders in the quantum computing community.<br/><br/>Quantum computing introduces many well-motivated computational tasks that ask to identify specific properties of input quantum states. For example, state tomography asks to learn the classical description of the input quantum states, and the security of quantum cryptography relies on the hardness of extracting information from quantum messages. However, the standard complexity theory for problems with classical inputs and outputs is inadequate for identifying the computational complexity of these new computational tasks. Therefore, this award seeks to advance the following three thrusts: (i) develop the complexity theory for problems that ask to identify specific properties of input quantum states, (ii) identify the security of quantum cryptographic primitives through the new complexity theory, and (iii) use the framework to characterize the computational hardness of variants of problems with quantum inputs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DPCs are a cytotoxic form of DNA damage that potently block replication and transcription. Despite their biological significance, DPCs are often overshadowed by other forms of damage, such as DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The development of these molecules could be useful for studying DPC formation in the test tube, in cells and possibly even organisms. Selective DPC formation would enable scientists to study how such cytotoxic lesions are repaired and determine the consequences of their formation on processes involved in genetic expression. These molecules could be especially useful in the complex environment of cells, where the formation of mixtures makes it particularly difficult to elucidate the consequences of individual chemical products. This project will provide students with broad training in several research areas, including synthetic organic chemistry, biochemistry, and cell biology. The students that obtain training while contributing to this project, will include those from groups that have historically been underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>Under this award, the Greenberg laboratory will focus synthetic efforts on bis-electrophiles that take advantage of the high reactivity of nitrogen mustards to rapidly alkylate DNA. However, one of the highly reactive chloroethyl groups will be replaced with a more selective electrophile that is designed to preferentially react with the side-chain amino group of lysines. In this way, the formation of monoalkylation products that account for the majority of nitrogen mustard reactivity will be disfavored. Furthermore, the selectivity of the electrophile to form DPCs over ICLs will be determined. Selective DPC formation will be tested in nucleosome core particles, as well as in cells. Preferential DPC formation compared to ICLs will be probed using various cell lines that are deficient in repair of one lesion family. For instance, it is hypothesized that cells lacking SPRTN, a protease that initiates DPC repair, will be hypersensitive to the molecules. Selective DPC formation in cells that lack SPRTN would enable the exploration of alternative DPC repair systems. Studies with these bis-electrophiles may provide the foundation for the discovery of therapeutic agents that act by forming DPCs in targeted cellular loci.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This corresponds to losing less than one second in the entire age of the universe. Such accuracy not only enables incredible timing precision, but also facilitates the study of phenomena that may affect the passage of time such as gravity, dark matter, and the variation of fundamental constants. Research on future generations of optical atomic clocks is focused on further improving accuracy and/or allowing a comparable accuracy to be achieved in deployed systems operating in real-world environments. This work will draw from the toolbox of quantum information science to improve the resource efficiency of optical clocks by using on-the-fly measures such as those found in quantum error correction and by using programmable entanglement generation. This research will provide undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on experience in precision metrology and atomic quantum science. This experience, along with curricular innovations and outreach to the broader community, will help promote the growth and diversity of the American quantum workforce.<br/><br/>The operating principle of optical clocks involves comparing a sub-Hz-linewidth laser oscillator to an ultra-narrow atomic transition to correct its frequency fluctuation and drift. The main limitations on clock performance stem from (1) the baseline stability of the laser oscillator, and (2) the atomic resources needed to correct laser frequency fluctuations whose accuracy is hampered by the projective nature of quantum measurements. This work seeks to address both issues by enabling independent operation of two atomic array optical clocks within the same apparatus and by using an optical cavity to engineer spin squeezing that mitigates projection noise. Specifically, by levering the rich atomic structure of ytterbium-171, one clock subsystem will be used for real-time correction of the laser phase during the interrogation of the other clock subsystem via ?mid-circuit? operations, enabling nearly a 10-times extension beyond the laser coherence time. This work merges the capabilities of neutral-atom quantum computers, optical atomic clocks, and quantum networking devices into one system. It will thus lead to advances of broad societal impact such as fault-tolerant quantum processors as well as quantum networks of optical atomic clocks that can provide quantum-secured timekeeping and the ability to search for new physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, metamaterial systems have been able to deliver unique properties that can largely surpass traditional materials, but these properties are limited to very narrow ranges of operating frequencies and functionalities, which in turns limit their practical application. The nonlocal approach will help overcome substantial obstacles on the way to transition elastic metamaterial technology towards real world applications.  From a broader perspective, the theoretical and computational design tools developed in this project can have far-reaching impacts in other fields and applications such as the design of civil infrastructures resilient against extreme events, acoustic insulation for noise control in buildings and transportation systems, and advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials for electronic devices, telecommunications, and defense systems. <br/><br/>The concept hinges on an intentionally nonlocal and hierarchical design that, by exploiting nonlocal interactions across spatial scales, will enable materials with exceptionally broadband dynamic performance, tunable effective properties, and programmable dynamics. The integration of nonlocality within a hierarchical design framework leads to the concept of multiscale nonlocality that will serve as a foundational theoretical principle to engineer complex material behavior across scales and to achieve a level of control on effective material properties not achievable by operating at a single scale. This project will also introduce the distinctive concept of delocalized action as a means to achieve efficient material tuning and reconfiguration. While delocalization is a natural consequence of nonlocality, its use to control material properties is largely unexplored and opens an extremely flexible and customizable design space where the material is designed in a distributed sense, hence paving the way towards materials exhibiting extreme structural efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They carry important information and can interact with piezoelectric substrates, which together lead to a wide range of applications including filtering, analog signal processing, and quantum acoustic devices. However, most of the SAW devices have fixed configurations and limited tunability, and their properties cannot be manipulated in real-time. Such a drawback limits the ability of current electronic devices that use SAW as a fundamental platform. It represents a major barrier to achieving smart and intelligent control of SAWs, which is a pursuit in the information era. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) proposal aims to overcome this technological gap by developing and optimizing tunable SAW components that go beyond passive, single-functionality devices. Specifically, it allows for convenient and reconfigurable tuning of SAWs by supplying a small gate voltage. This research will enhance the fundamental understanding of SAWs propagating on piezoelectric substrates and realize monolithic smart SAW kernels that can be applied in various scenarios to ultimately enable intelligent integrated devices for sensing, communication, and biomedical applications. The program will also help mitigate barriers to high-quality STEM education through the partnership with local community colleges. It will advance the education and research experience of students at all levels to cultivate and retain them in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to develop novel integrated SAW devices with expanded functionality and tunability by harnessing the electro-acoustic effects. To achieve this, theoretical and numerical models will be established to quantify the piezoelectric and electromechanical couplings from a microscopic wave-matter interaction perspective. New tuning mechanisms with gate-tunable features will be identified based on both linear and nonlinear effects arising from SAW propagation. The material, configuration, and fabrication process associated with these tuning approaches will be systematically tested and optimized with the goal of reducing the voltage requirement and response time. Experimental measurements will be performed to demonstrate tunable SAW propagation with improved performance, capacity, and bandwidth. The developed tunable SAW component will serve as a smart kernel, which will be coupled with control circuits as well as other supporting hardware to realize intelligent and multi-functional integrated on-chip devices. The applicability of the proposed approach will be validated in a number of scenarios such as reconfigurable filtering, multi-functional sensing, and programmable SAW-based particle manipulation. The research will contribute to the development of next-generation smart SAW devices by providing a powerful approach that promotes a fundamental understanding of electrically induced elasticity modulation as well as gate-tunable components that can be integrated into diverse systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous research in the region has focused mainly on larger sites with monumental architecture, but the recent application of airborne laser scanning now allows for the study of the smallest sites that represent the earliest agricultural settlements in the region. This archaeological investigation focuses on understanding not only the strategies used to establish these earliest settlements, but to understand how they changed over time before they were ultimately abandoned. The archaeological perspective thus allows for a full accounting of how small-scale communities form, evolve, and dissolve over multiple centuries. A top priority for this project is also to educate undergraduate students from a Hispanic and minority serving institution in scientific research methodologies. Student project assistants benefit tremendously from the high-impact practices of fieldwork and professional collaboration. Additionally, the project collects data on smaller archaeological sites and features to help protect them against ongoing demographic and environmental changes in the region. Another key focus of the project is to work with students to bridge the divide between academia and a broader audience interested in understanding the origins of modern society through the use of public-facing media.<br/><br/>Recent advances in airborne laser scanning technology now allow for the identification of the smallest-scale earliest settlements in the region that were not covered by constructions from later archaeological periods. Understanding how the region was first settled by farmers can provide critical insights into the origins of social complexity because the region lacks any natural surface water resources that could be expected to sustain a year-round presence. The project is well placed to make significant advances toward understanding how people adapted to challenging environments that likely required new forms of social organization. What sorts of environmental and social strategies did the earliest agricultural settlers use to gain a permanent foothold in the region? What factors led to the eventual abandonment of these earliest settlements 500 years later?

More than 2.8 million drug-resistant infections occur each year in the US, with more than 35,000 deaths despite widespread availability of antibiotics, mostly because they are not effective against drug-resistant bacteria. The likelihood of complication or death is increased for patients with weakened immune systems. The bacteria form complex structures called biofilms that protect themselves from antibiotic treatment. These biofilms are developed through a bacteria cell communication strategy called quorum sensing. This project seeks to study how quorum sensing can be tracked by an inexpensive, rapid, and flexible sensor that provides information on how quickly bacteria are growing and how fast biofilms are being developed. The sensor developed and used in this study is unique because of its flexibility and ability to measure electrical and chemical activity related to bacteria growth. The long-term research goal of this project is to make possible the fast (less than 5 minutes) determination of infection so that the correct antibiotics and dosage can be delivered at the most opportune time. Importantly, this sensing approach can also be used in other applications, like water filtering and agriculture. The educational goal of this project is to support research and graduate education for underrepresented students, especially veterans and non-traditional students. These students often face unique obstacles to participating in traditional undergraduate research experiences, such as work, family, or military commitments. This project will address these challenges through a combination of coursework, research, and workshop experiences designed to expose and engage students in new ideas and job opportunities.<br/><br/>The primary motivation for this project is the development of a strategy to quickly measure bacterial infections in chronic, non-healing wounds for the inhibition of antibiotic resistance/tolerance, which is both an important societal problem and of fundamental scientific interest. More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur each year in the US, with more than 35,000 deaths despite widespread availability of antibiotics in large part because they are ineffective against resistant strains and biofilms, especially but not only in immune compromised patients. The research objective of this project is to leverage concentration-dependent quorum sensing (QS) molecules to quantify key transitions in biofilm formation that relate to the progression of virulence in bacterial pathogens. This project focuses on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation and virulence, as a model system for other bacterial pathogens commonly found in chronic wounds. This project uses a nonwoven nanofiber composite electrode design in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and voltammetric experiments to quantify virulence progression via pyocyanin and 3OC12HSL (QS molecules used to mediate virulence) detection and quantification. The following scientific contributions will result from this work: 1) A directly quantifiable relationship between bacterial concentration (P. aeruginosa), QS molecule concentration (Pyocyanin and AHLs - 3OC12HSL), and stage of biofilm development; 2) Enablement of a flexible, tunable voltametric sensor that offers highly sensitive and specific electrochemical detection of redox species while being easily incorporated into wearable fabrics or wound dressings given its bio-textile design; and 3) The functionalization of nanofiber composite aptasensors, enabling generation of quantifiable electrochemical signals to greatly reduce the Limit of Detection (LOD) and improve specificity. This work addresses the critical challenge of quantifying species-specific signaling molecules associated with progression of bacterial load (bioburden). The long-term importance of this work is increased understanding of more effective treatment timing, while reducing the risk for development of drug resistance. Understanding the precise moments in which a bacterial pathogen may be advancing in virulence is important for any organism that may be infected by these bacteria, including plants, animals, and humans.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biosensing Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adapting to these issues, especially under a changing climate and increasingly extreme weather conditions, necessitates a shift in farming practices. A large amount of related data is being collected at different resolutions in time and space. These data range across properties and condition of soils, climate data, crop management data, crop health, different types of stresses and stressors, and water availability and consumption. More and more food production management decisions are now delegated to machine learning models and accompanying sensor networks that provide and generate diverse data across various scales. But these models and methods alone fall short in comprehensively addressing the wide range of scales, environmental variables, and local/regional variations necessary for climate-resilient adaptation and sustainable intensification of crop production systems. There is a need to integrate scientific and engineering expertise, assess a range of crop management scenarios, and develop resilience metrics to prolong the viability of non-renewable and finite water resources. This project will build research capacity for developing and refining modeling capabilities across scales, ranging from specific points to regions and from one day to a century. This information is crucial to steer adaptation strategies and assess their effects on both food production and water sustainability in the context of climate change. The project team will address this challenge by linking on- ground and remotely sensed data with a new modeling framework that is capable of generating multiple scenarios for crop production under different future climate scenarios to ensure the best set of strategies for sustainability and resilience of water resources.  The project will use field trials, novel analytics, and links between people, farms, and natural systems to help change how field crops are grown for the better. The goal is to create an all-in-one system that can better sustain water resources and manage nutrients and soils.                                            <br/><br/>The project approach is based on a strategic 5-year plan for achieving the PI?s overall career goal of integrating her research and teaching through systematic investigations of food production systems with environmental concerns by studying the connections between spatial-temporal scales and physical conditions that have impeded understanding and effective application of climate smart water management practices for crop production. This effort will require a fusion of multiscale, heterogeneous, multi-sourced, time-varying data including data from sub-surface sensors, surface data, weather forecasts, crop growth, and soil nutrients, etc.; understanding of the climate-water-crop production loop; and resilience metrics. The strategy will be pursued through the following integrated objectives (1) conduct machine learning-informed multiscale modeling of crop production systems? spatio-temporally varying responses of crop growth and hydrology; (2) investigate climate (change and extreme events) and crop management scenarios (irrigation, nutrient use, crop choice, land transition) and their impact on food production; and (3) quantify resilience metrics for the sustainability of crop production systems to guide prioritization of management measures under future climate. The education goal of this project is to engage and equip students with agroecosystem-inspired fundamental training through integration with the existing curriculum of undergraduate and graduate teaching and learning, thus strengthening their readiness to join a STEM- related workforce in data science, natural resource management, and environmental decision support and consulting. The research activities designed for the project will engage an early career faculty member and students in advancing through their careers and guiding students at different stages of education (graduate, undergraduate, and high and middle school) and engaging with rural communities through field days and educational outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET/ENG Environmental sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Control as the principled use of feedback loops and algorithms has been deeply embedded in many engineering systems, including aerospace, energy, transportation, healthcare, and robotic systems. This CAREER project will tackle fundamental challenges related to the interplay between convex and nonconvex optimization for modern control systems. On the one hand, convex reformulations or relaxations have gained popularity in control, thanks to advances in interior-point algorithms. While these methods often provide rigorous stability and safety certificates, their applicability tends to be limited to individual dynamic systems or centralized settings. On the other hand, the old topic of policy search for directly optimiz  to empirical successes of reinforcement learning. This class of methods is conceptually simpler, computationally more flexible, but leads to nonconvex optimization, making it harder to derive theoretical guarantees. This project will establish theoretical and algorithmic foundations for bridging convex and nonconvex optimization for a broader class of modern control systems. The outcomes will significantly broaden the optimization and control problems in societal engineering systems, including transportation, power grids, and smart buildings, facilitating efficient and reliable solutions. The project tightly integrates comprehensive educational and outreach activities. A suite of curriculum materials for control education will be developed, lowering the barrier to understanding fundamental feedback principles. The project team will lead activities in summer training camps and collaborate with well-established programs at UCSD, contributing to knowledge dissemination to the general public and K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project consists of three synergistic thrusts, fully investigating the interplay between convex and nonconvex optimization for modern control. First, we will develop an innovative framework to reveal hidden convexity in nonconvex static and dynamic distributed control of networked systems. Our framework will advance closed-loop convexity, sparsity invariance, and efficient formulations of linear matrix inequalities. Second, we will establish theoretical guarantees and algorithmic foundations for nonconvex policy search. Specifically, we will develop convex lifting analysis to certify global optimality in smooth nonconvex optimal control and establish algorithmic foundations for nonsmooth and nonconvex robust control with robustness and safety requirements. Lastly, we will develop scalable convex and nonconvex optimization algorithms for large-scale systems by leveraging nonsmooth eigenvalue optimization, decomposition, and acceleration schemes.

For example, how do adults adapt their expectations when speaking with a child rather than with another adult or when speaking with other adults with different accents?

To date, many questions regarding the evolution of bipedalism remain unanswered. This CAREER project investigates the evolution of human bipedal walking and running by analyzing fossil footprints through the combined application of field, experimental and computational methods. Training and hands-on experience in paleoanthropological methods are provided to students at different education levels. A new course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), combined with individually mentored research experiences, provide students with opportunities to directly contribute to the laboratory analyses that are essential to the project. Outreach activities engage community members who live in the immediate vicinity of fossil footprint sites, through an ongoing partnership and the development of a community-led cultural heritage museum. <br/><br/>At the beginning of the Quaternary Period three fossil hominin species ? Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Paranthropus boisei were thought to have inhabited the same landscapes. The current consensus is that their cohabitation was enabled by different sets of adaptations, and that Homo erectus was the only one (and the first human ancestor) to use a modern human-like pattern of walking and running. However, the fossil data that can speak to this are limited and the interpretations inconclusive. The field excavations in this project significantly increase the volume of data available to test long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of human bipedalism. Through laboratory experiments, new analytical methods are developed to relate footprint morphology to foot morphology and biomechanics, allowing for detailed understandings of fossil human locomotion. The project also advances methods for finding, excavating, and analyzing fossil footprints, opening new avenues for these data to address major questions in human evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, the release of excess N (nitrate) from agricultural runoffs and wastewater treatment plants has also led to widespread groundwater pollution and nutrient enrichment in surface water systems, a process commonly referred to as eutrophication. In nitrogen-limited surface water systems including lakes, rivers, and estuaries, eutrophication has been shown to cause a decrease in water quality, oxygen depletion, a loss of aquatic biota, and the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to explore the utilization of electrochemical refining to recover nitrate from wastewater and convert it into valuable products such as ammonia which is a critical component of  N fertilizers. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator proposes to combine and integrate chemical separations (membranes), electrocatalysis (nitrate reduction reactions), process modeling, technoeconomic analysis (TEA), and life cycle assessment (LCA) to design, develop, and optimize reaction and separation systems that can capture, concentrate, and convert nitrate from wastewater sources to high purity ammonia. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge and technology to advance the mitigation of nitrate pollution and enable a circular nitrogen economy. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student at Stanford University. <br/><br/>The management of the global nitrogen cycle has been identified as one of the 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering by the US National Academy of Engineering. Electrochemical refining has emerged as a promising technology to  advance a circular nitrogen economy as it can be utilized to tune the oxidation states, transport, and conversion of nitrogen pollutants from wastewater to valuable products at potentially lower cost with reduced chemical inputs and emissions than existing commercial technologies. This CAREER project will investigate the electrochemical reduction of nitrate from wastewater to produce ammonia, a critical component of nitrogen fertilizers. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to design, synthesize, evaluate, and optimize a new family of homogenous molecular catalysts [M(DIM) catalysts, where M is a transition metal (Co, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni) at the center of a dimethyl ligand (DIM)] that could enable the rapid, selective, inexpensive, and energy-efficient electrochemical nitrate reduction to high-purity ammonia. The specific objectives of the research are to 1) design and synthesize molecular M(DIM) catalysts and elucidate their mechanisms of nitrate reduction in various wastewater matrices; 2) design and engineer extraction systems to separate the catalysts and their reaction products (ammonia) from treated wastewater; and 3) design, develop, and optimize electrically driven reactive and  separation systems that could be integrated into wastewater treatment plants to recover and convert nitrate to high-purity ammonia. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to advance the design and development of more efficient and cost-effective wastewater treatment processes and systems to recover and convert nitrate to valuable products. To implement the educational and outreach activities of this CAREER project, the PI proposes to leverage existing programs and resources at Stanford University to design and launch an annual Bay Area Electrochemistry (BAE) Bootcamp to train early-stage graduate students on electrochemical methods and circular water treatment applications. In addition, the PI proposes to 1) develop and implement an REU program augmented with seminars on societal equity to recruit and retain undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and 2) design and organize water-related science fair projects to engage and mentor high school students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most studies pursue only one aspect at a time, focusing on either diversity or unity, this project moves beyond a single-edged approach to study the diversity-unity paradox in a systematic, integrative manner. By introducing the concept of ?unified diversity? to capture an organization?s capacity to elicit diverse viewpoints and perspectives while simultaneously sustaining its oneness, this project aims to clarify the construct space of unified diversity, develop an integrative research model, and identify possible management practices for enhancing unified diversity. By doing so, this project sheds light on how to harmonize diversity and unity in organizations. The outcomes of this research hold significant promise for guiding individuals, organizations, and broader societal entities in harnessing unified diversity to enhance learning and performance.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to investigate how organizations can leverage ?unified diversity? to enhance learning and performance through human resource management. The project is structured in three key phases. The first phase involves conducting qualitative interviews and surveys to establish a clear conceptualization of unified diversity. In the second phase, the project employs computational modeling and quantitative surveys to examine the antecedents and outcomes of unified diversity, seeking to clarify organizational dynamics that lead to and result from unified diversity. The third phase integrates qualitative interviews, computational modeling, and quantitative survey studies to pinpoint effective management practices and organizational designs that promote unified diversity. By adopting a mixed-methods approach, this project enriches current knowledge about the nature of the diversity-unity paradox and the micro-foundations of unified diversity, which is essential for advancing organizational learning and maintaining a competitive edge in the contemporary business landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The transformation and exchange of materials at these interfaces depend on extreme hydrological disturbances such as flooding, sea level rise, and seiches. As the intensity of extreme hydrological events increases with a warming climate, there is a need to know the rate at which these processes take place along coastal interfaces. However, scientists often rely on direct discrete measurements using soil cores and sensors to estimate these rates, which are incapable of capturing spatial changes, making it hard to use models to predict how these areas will be affected by changes in climate. Hence, better ways to measure these processes are needed, and more scientists from different disciplines need to work together to leverage their different approaches. This project will advance the use of geophysical imaging techniques, including natural electrical potential, induced polarization, and electrical conductivity, to better understand changes in soil conditions along coastal interfaces. This project will also mentor environmental science and ecology students on how to use these geophysical methods to expand the spatial resolution of environmental measurements. <br/><br/>The proposed research in this project will [1] assess the relationship between the distribution of natural electric potential and redox potential and how both change with different soil moisture and organic matter contents, [2] investigate how organic matter and soil moisture contents affect the migration and storage of electric current, and [3] assess how changes in permeability affect the storage of electrical charges within soils along coastal interfaces. This study will involve using geophysical data from laboratory experiments and automated long-term, repeated field measurements on soils at both the Chesapeake Bay and Lake Erie regions. These robust datasets will be combined with direct measurements of soil redox potential, moisture content, matric potential, salinity, and soil respiration to study how processes along coastal soils change spatially. The multidisciplinary approach of integrating geophysics with ecological studies developed in this research will be used to train upper-level undergraduate and graduate students. A case-study approach will also be used to include geophysics in the environmental science and ecology curriculum at the University of Toledo and made publicly available. This would equip future environmental scientists to use and think of methods beyond geophysics for scaling laboratory and direct measurements typically used in environmental investigations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though these technologies were once science fiction, they are now becoming both affordable and widely available, lending themselves to use in everything from entertainment to medical practice. However, current VR technologies are sometimes not well-matched to people's physical and perceptual characteristics; these mismatches can make VR experiences worse, even to the point of being unusable for some people. This project seeks to advance VR research by combining insights from computer science, neuroscience, and ophthalmology to improve the coupling between VR systems and people's perceptual abilities and physical features. Blending these different perspectives will make it possible to find new and innovative ways to improve VR technologies while better understanding human vision. <br/><br/>This project adopts a comprehensive perspective on the relationship between humans and VR technology. Fundamentally, the imagery presented in VR undergoes a series of distinct transformations including rendering, classical optics, physiological optics, sensation, perception, cognition, and resulting actions. Understanding the nuanced contributions of each stage necessitates embracing methods not traditionally associated with VR research, such as integrating ophthalmic eye models, neuroimaging techniques, computer numerical control systems, and others. For instance, leveraging ophthalmic models allows for the creation of virtual scenes customized to individuals' unique eye structure, enabling enhanced spatial fidelity. Additionally, employing neuroimaging in conjunction with spatial judgment tasks will aid in identifying neural distinctions between perceptions of real and virtual scenes. By employing these methods, this project aims to not only advance the development of high-fidelity virtual environments but also unveil novel approaches to studying human spatial vision. The project team will also develop new interdisciplinary course materials for university students and workshops for middle and high school students that seek to attract a wide variety of students to learn about VR, perception, and their intersection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current approaches to meet such a diverse scope of functions rely on exploratively blending assorted polymers with large quantities of tackifiers, plasticizers and other additives as needed. This mixing-based approach toward property control is ineffective and imprecise. Furthermore, loose additives are prone to leaching and migration, which leads to property variation over time along with inevitable surface contamination, thus prohibiting their use in sensitive applications such as art restoration, biomedical devices, and microelectronics. The proposed adhesion-by-architecture platform will empower the design of additive-free adhesives with tailored property combinations that can be switched on demand. The platform is based on brush-like polymer networks with dynamic molecular linkers, which provide various pathways for molecular-scaffold reconfiguration without losing material integrity. The abundance of structural parameters in molecular brush networks allows for the programmable variation of distinct physical characteristics independent of chemical composition and one another. Developing structurally programmable adhesives with actively modulated performance will offer a breakthrough in soft matter engineering, yielding active adhesives with exceptional property combinations and switching on-demand capability. The design of advanced materials will provide ample opportunities for interdisciplinary training of graduate students with diverse backgrounds through integration of precision chemistry, soft-matter physics, and emerging technologies.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Adhesive performance results from an interplay of bulk and interfacial deformation mechanisms, both viscoelastic in nature. Understanding how molecular brush architecture controls this interplay represents the intellectual focus of this proposal. The proposed research will address the following fundamental problems. The first is the hierarchical relationship between adhesion and molecular network architecture, spanning different length and time scales. Understanding how an individual element of the brush structure contributes to the viscoelastic response is a crucial milestone towards programmable control of the performance of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs). The second is the inherent reliance of adhesion on chemical composition and the interdependence of distinct adhesive characteristics such as tack, stretch, and work of adhesion. The design-by-architecture approach will allow breaking these conventional rules to allow for the variation of physical characteristics independent of chemistry and one another. The third is the current inability to switch the adhesion strength of pressure-sensitive adhesive materials on demand without perturbing the integrity and shape of a device. This challenge will be addressed by strategically incorporating dormant functionalities that can be activated by an external stimulus to trigger internal rearrangement of the network topology.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The large number of such documents makes it very hard for people to read and absorb them all, a phenomenon known as ?information overload"". Applying computer algorithms that can automatically extract events is a promising solution because they can transform large amounts of text into smaller summaries in the form of structured event knowledge graphs that reveal the relationships between the people, places, and times in the events. Current deep learning-based event extraction techniques mainly focus on extracting event knowledge at the level of individual sentences and are unable to extract a knowledge graph spanning multiple sentences with sufficient accuracy or efficiency. For example, existing techniques would struggle with events described in a long document having multiple sections. Moreover, these extraction techniques do not capture accurate information regarding real-life events because they typically include nuanced attributes such as causes and effects. The research goal of this CAREER award is to build information extraction (IE) methods with natural language processing methods, using the latest deep learning-based techniques, to construct an event knowledge graph for storing knowledge and improving the ability of people to track rapidly evolving event information. In the short term, the project will improve the quality and comprehensiveness of event knowledge graphs. In the long run, the project will entirely transform people's experiences and habits in acquiring event knowledge from various sources. The system to be developed through this award will better support numerous event-oriented tasks that people need to perform, such as future event prediction, event factuality verification, and risk event prevention, all of which have profound impacts on society. Moreover, our work would make fundamental contributions to a wide range of interdisciplinary applications such as statutory reasoning based on legal documents, prediction of disease outbreaks, and biomedical document understanding, all of which currently rely on extremely slow and high-cost methods.<br/><br/>The general technical goal of this project is to address the knowledge gap of event extraction from long and complex documents (as compared to the traditional sentence-level extraction) and to do so in an efficient manner. The general goal is divided into three sub-research goals. First, to extract the entirety of event attributes, which is not possible for current models trained on a dataset with a predefined schema, the project introduces a new question-answer generation paradigm that enables a novel representation of events from clusters of documents discussing the same events. The project will leverage document hierarchy information for extracting events, which enforces the validity and broad coverage of event information. Motivated by the fact that current event knowledge construction is inefficient and is impaired by pairwise event-event relation predictions, the second research goal is to develop novel techniques enabling the construction of the event knowledge graph. For this purpose, the investigators propose interleaving targeted retrieval and joint modeling of event arguments and entity-entity relations. This not only enables efficient updating of graphs, but also ensures its global consistency. Finally, the third goal is to adapt to individual information-seeking needs, which is not considered by current methods. The project will study schema induction strategies and schema matching algorithms for adapting the event knowledge graph to user preferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists are using these tools to connect genes to phenotypes, generate novel phenotypic variation, and for diverse crop improvement applications. This project expands the possibilities for editing in crop plants to include a method for editing gene expression, so called ?epigenetic editing?. Epigenetics is a broad term used to describe mechanisms that change gene expression without directly changing the DNA. Epigenetic variability can have profound impacts on an organism?s phenotype, and many important agronomic traits are influenced by gene expression. Broader impacts of the project include the wide dissemination of the method for the improvement of crop plants and other species, plus the training of students via integration with a long running and successful undergraduate internship program. Epigenetic crop improvement strategies will complement existing biotechnology and breeding strategies and may offer opportunities to help maintain crop yields in the face of climate change. This project will directly train the next generation of scientists to use these tools through an effective Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. All resources generated in this project will be made available for use.<br/><br/>This project will expand the possibilities for editing in crop plants to include epigenetic editing. It was recently demonstrated that it is possible to affect gene expression through targeted DNA methylation at MeSWEET10a in the important crop, cassava. MeSWEET10a is not normally expressed in leaf tissue but is ectopically induced by a bacterial pathogen using a transcription activator-like (TAL) effector. De novo methylation of the MeSWEET10a promoter blocked TAL binding and led to decreased disease symptoms. Despite these encouraging results, epigenetic editing is still an immature technology. The goal of this project is to fill specific knowledge gaps related to establishment, maintenance, and inheritance of epigenetic edits and in so doing, lower the entry point for other researchers to adopt this powerful technology. Specifically, aim 1 of this proposal is to develop and distribute epigenetic editing tools in other crop species. The work will leverage and adapt the technologies known to work in cassava to accomplish similar disease outcomes in rice and tomato. Aim 2 will expand on the applications of epigenetic editing in crops. This includes the ability to target multiple loci simultaneously, ?fine tune? gene expression and tissue specific editing. Aim 3 is dedicated to characterizing stability and heritability of de novo epialleles. If successful, other research projects and applications in biotechnology will benefit. This work will also provide additional jumping off points for fundamental work on epigenetics in non-model plant systems. Further, an ability to directly edit the epigenome will empower the larger field of epigenetics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its global market is projected to reach 22 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. With the rising popularity of 360-degree videos, network operators and service providers are increasingly keen on gaining insights into users? Quality of Experience (QoE) perception. However, the conventional QoE models designed for 2D videos fall short of capturing users? unique subjective feelings in viewing this new type of video. To bridge this gap, the project focuses on constructing human-centered models that utilize ?human factors? via a variety of virtual reality (VR) onboard sensors. Leveraging multi-modal sensory readings, the researchers will tap into a direct representation of users? perceptual experiences. This approach captures subjective feelings often missed by the objective system parameters commonly used in existing QoE models. The success of this project will provide an in-depth understanding of users? nuanced perceptual experience while engaging with 360-degree videos. It will create opportunities for stakeholders to implement user-specific network resource optimization and video streaming strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction on an individual basis. The research outcomes will significantly contribute to the human-centered sensing and networking research communities and benefit numerous VR applications beyond 360-degree videos.<br/><br/>This project involves three closely related research thrusts. The first thrust investigates how to extract salient features from multi-modal sensory readings for effective QoE assessment. To combat bias arising from datasets with unevenly distributed labels, novel approaches will be developed to augment underrepresented data by exploring useful information across sensing modalities. The second thrust seeks to optimize system resource utilization for QoE assessment. Multiple personalized models will share common neural network layers at edge servers for resource-efficient model hosting. Adaptive sampling will be applied at VR terminals during sensory data acquisition to maintain data utility. The third thrust focuses on devising data privacy protection mechanisms without sacrificing QoE assessment accuracy. Under the differential privacy framework, the approach features formal quantification of data correlation of multi-modality sensory data, which has been largely overlooked by prior work. The proposed research is inter-disciplinary, which spans data-driven modeling, sensing, and privacy-preserving computing. The proposed mechanisms and designs will be thoroughly evaluated via a combination of measurement campaigns, simulations, and experimental studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Challenges limiting CR effectiveness include i) code learning difficulties with limited time and code context, ii) misunderstandings among the participants over confusing suggestions,  and iii) interpersonal conflicts due to disrespectful feedback. In the short term, these challenges increase required efforts, delay the outcomes, increase the likelihood of rejections, and frustrate the participants.

Semiconductor devices, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), liquid crystals, and ferromagnetic materials have conventionally served as tools for RF tuning. However, these technologies are constrained by limited tuning ranges and low power handling capabilities. To overcome these limitations, cold plasma presents a promising solution. Manipulating internal parameters, such as electron density, gas type, and pressure, offers extensive tunability over plasma electromagnetic properties. Cold plasmas have already provided significant advantages across various societally relevant applications, such as plasma medicine, food preservation, water treatment, plasma fertilizer, electric propulsion systems, sterilization, and semiconductor fabrication. This research explores fundamental physics and demonstrates techniques for establishing stable microplasmas with exceptional electromagnetic properties for versatile RF electronics. To realize this vision, (1) theoretical and modeling frameworks for high-frequency microplasmas will be developed, (2) a closed-loop microplasma monitoring and control system will be investigated, and (3) stable microplasmas with unprecedented electromagnetic features will be realized. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved, a unique educational plasma lab will be established, and a circuit-based electromagnetic-plasma simulator will be developed. In addition, various synergistic outreach activities will be conducted, including Toledo Excel summer camps for underrepresented students. By combining innovative research, educational initiatives, and outreach efforts, this endeavor aspires to advance the landscape of reconfigurable RF electronics, paving the way for emerging multi-objective and multi-frequency systems.<br/><br/>Plasmas represent rapidly reconfigurable media that can be controlled on nanosecond timescales. The interaction between microplasmas and electromagnetic waves introduces a new field of significant applications that can be categorized as ""Gaseous Microelectronics."" This study aims to push the boundaries of plasma science by exploring widely tunable microplasmas capable of unconventional interactions with electromagnetic waves. This exceptional behavior will be achieved through fundamental understanding and precise control of microplasma kinetics. While some efforts have been made in plasma-based RF electronics, this research field has not yet been comprehensively explored, specifically for microplasmas with extreme electromagnetic features?a knowledge gap this project aims to address. To pursue this overarching objective, a novel closed-loop control system, including innovative diagnostic techniques, will be developed to accurately manipulate microplasmas. With all theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigations involved, the goal is to realize (i) high-Q microplasma varactors with extraordinary tunability, (ii) natural epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) microplasmas, and (iii) low-loss negative index materials (NIMs). Rapidly and widely tunable, low-loss, and high-power materials for high-frequency tuning do not currently exist, but this research can change this paradigm. By leveraging these unique materials, more efficient utilization of the electromagnetic spectrum can be achieved, effectively meeting the escalating demand for wireless services.

A hallmark of such collectives is coordination among individuals, which is critical to processes as diverse as pathogen clearance by populations of immune cells, coordinated development of a tissue, and swift but accurate decision-making by animal groups. However, coordination is not the only behavior collectives exhibit. They can also, at times, be dominated by disorder and systemic dysfunction. Examples include the hyperactive immune responses behind autoimmunity and uncontrolled misinformation cascades in animal groups. The goal of this project is to answer a question that has eluded scientists for decades: how and why do biological collectives coordinate seamlessly in some situations, yet exhibit catastrophic dysfunction in others? The project will answer this question by combining elegant experiments with mathematical and computational models that seek to identify the factors contributing to this variation. This project will contribute to the empirical and theoretical foundations for solving diverse problems ranging from the control of distributed robots and sensor networks to health interventions aimed at promoting wound healing or disrupting collective behaviors of pathogens. Knowledge of the mechanisms behind collective dysfunction may also provide insights into topics as diverse as the conservation of animal migrations, management of population and ecosystem dynamics, and the neural mechanisms that underlie functional and dysfunctional social behavior. Education and broader impact activities will focus on strengthening mathematical and AI literacy among life science students at undergraduate and graduate levels and sharing scientific knowledge beyond academia by engaging with natural history educators, science curriculum developers, and teachers.<br/><br/>This project seeks to reveal core scientific principles that govern why biological collectives function effectively under some circumstances, yet exhibit catastrophic dysfunction under others. The project will involve a strong feedback between theory development and experimentation with schooling fish ? an iconic model of biological collectives. Using novel closed-loop experimental systems and AI-driven computer vision tools, the project will study how collectives solve ecologically-relevant tasks (e.g., predator evasion, decision-making, foraging) within precisely-controlled laboratory environments. The project seeks to achieve three aims. Aim 1 focuses on how individuals cope with conflicting demands that arise when making decisions within a group. Aim 2 focuses on a critical issue that arises when individuals learn from one another: how to cope with misinformation. Aim 3 focuses on a widely-documented phenomenon known as behavioral lock-in, wherein individuals in a group over-rely on information from others to the point of becoming unresponsive to the environment. The project will advance scientific knowledge by (i) identifying general mechanisms of function and dysfunction in biological collectives, (ii) discovering mechanistic links between individual phenotype, collective phenotype, and fitness-relevant outcomes, (iii) generating quantitative hypotheses about the neural basis of collective behavior, and (iv) developing general theoretical models of collective behavior that are strongly rooted in data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One approach to reduce the incidence of bugs in software is known as formal verification, in which a developer constructs a mathematical proof that the software follows an intended specification.  Yet existing tools for formal verification cannot be applied to establish the security and privacy of many applications. The reason is that these applications combine three challenging features and requirements: (1) concurrency, in which multiple computer systems interact at once, (2) fault-tolerance, meaning that systems must handle failures and crashes, and (3) randomization, in which programs generate and use random data to achieve security properties. Existing tools for formal verification only support a subset of these features.  The project's novelty is a new approach to formal verification of systems that combines all three of these features, thereby enabling the verification of security and privacy properties of important applications.  The project's impacts are in improving the reliability and correctness of secure software systems.  In addition, the primary investigator is developing new teaching materials on verification of security and privacy properties of randomized systems.<br/><br/>The technical approach is based on a new method for reasoning about randomized systems called asynchronous couplings. This method allows one to prove that two randomized programs behave in equivalent ways, even when the two programs generate random samples at different times and locations.

The project will examine the 'Tragedy of the Commons (ToC)'? a situation where AVs, while smart on their own, might cause significant traffic oscillation and disorder when they all use the same logic. The research will also examine human-like 'Emergent Cooperative Behavior (ECB)' in complex traffic situations, aiming to incorporate such cooperative driving behaviors into AV control systems and hoping to achieve efficient operation in multi-agent systems. This project could lead to cutting-edge advancements in collaborative control and management in various traffic environments with AVs, which is crucial as they become more common on our streets. Moreover, insights gained from understanding the 'Tragedy of the Commons' and 'Emergent Cooperative Behavior' in AVs could apply to a broader range of multi-agent systems, potentially influencing fields as varied as financial market algorithms or robotics. The collaboration between the U.S. and India in this endeavor not only paves the way for improved global road performance but also sets new international benchmarks. <br/><br/>The primary technical objective of this research is to transition the control and interaction patterns of AVs from the ToC to ECB in diverse traffic environments. The hypothesis that AV control exhibits the ToC such that a stream of AVs may have inferior performance (e.g., causing traffic breakdown) even when an individual AV performs superior (e.g., with less instability) will first be tested. The counterpart of the hypothesis is that human-driven vehicle (HV) behavior manifests the ECB such that while an individual HV may not perform as well, a stream of HVs may maintain reasonable performance even in adverse conditions. This hypothesis will be tested by investigating the Markovian and uniformity properties of AVs and HVs. The Markovian property indicates that the vehicle action is determined by the current traffic state independent of its previous experience, while uniformity implies that vehicles follow a similar behavior rule regardless of the traffic environment. The conjecture that AVs have these properties while HVs do not will be evaluated using field data. How these properties would lead to TOC for AVs yet ECB for HVs with the be examined using analytical modeling and simulation. The finding of these fundamental properties will be used to construct a meta-learning-based AV control approach applicable to both US and Indian intersections, with the intention of reversing the ToC phenomenon for existing AVs and cultivating new AV control using an ECB system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The enormous variety of traits that different plants have evolved to cope with stress then becomes available to protect the food supply. The discovery of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and its application to biology have made such trait-replacement approaches possible by replacing one piece of DNA (the genetic material that encodes traits) with another at a precise location in a plant?s DNA. However, the replacement activity, which relies on the plant?s own proteins, is highly inefficient in plants, making its use impractical. The project embarks on a search to test many possible ways to change crop DNA in order to make the replacement function of CRISPR more efficient. In this project, a plant and animal researcher join forces to conduct the type of searches ? called screens ? that were done in human cells and now in plant cells. These screens are done in preparations of millions of free cells that activate many genes to test for one that makes replacement more efficient. The goal of the project is to develop a method to make the most productive crops amenable to receiving new genes that make them more stress-tolerant.<br/><br/>The ability to transfer traits from one plant to another using CRISPR-mediated homology directed repair (HDR) would offer a powerful approach to develop new varieties that could tolerate climate change. However, HDR, which involves the activity of endogenous genes, is highly inefficient in plants, limiting its use. The project adapts HDR-enhancement screens performed in animals to plants, screening for endogenous genes that improve HDR efficiency. The screen involves a genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) component in a suspension of free plant cells (protoplasts), in this case from Zea mays. The CRISPRa components are tittered to activate one gene per cell. The cells come from a line that carries a constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP). A rare ?hit? ? a gene whose activation improves HDR ? will replace the GFP with a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) sequence. The CFP-positive cells are separated via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and the genes that mediated the HDR events are identified by amplifying the guide RNA cassette by the Polymerase Chain Reaction and sequencing. These hits are then verified by independent tests and, if they pass secondary screening, are tethered to a CRISPR associated protein 9 enzyme for testing in planta.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During exercise, injury, and repair, bone tissue at nanometer length scales is exposed to constantly changing loads. However, the current framework for understanding fracture is largely based on static and macroscale assessments of bone health. The ability to quantitatively assess and mitigate fracture risk and prescribe treatment requires a fundamental understanding of time-dependent properties of bone tissue at nanometer length scales. This research will work to resolve in real time how the nanoscale constituents of human bones rearrange and deform, when subjected to dynamic loads that mimic physiological conditions ranging from walking to trauma. The project will investigate how this adaptation varies in healthy and osteoporotic human tissue to understand the fundamental causes of increased fracture risk. In the future, it is hoped that this approach will help accelerate assessment of therapies with respect to tissue evolution and fracture. This work integrates educational activities in partnership with local museums and high school educators, to develop interactive modules that teach mechanics and imaging of biological systems to historically underserved and underrepresented high school students. <br/><br/>This research program will investigate the adaptation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in human bone at physiologically relevant, fast time scales. The dynamic and non-affine deformations of bone at the nanoscale will be analyzed to experimentally answer: 1) how the nanostructure of bone changes under cycling loading 2) what mechanisms dictate dynamic fracture in bone and 3) how the components of microscale tissue hierarchy contribute to damage tolerance in healthy and osteoporotic bone. To answer 1) and 2), the program will develop fatigue and dynamic fracture experiments on micron-sized bone samples in scanning electron and synchrotron X-ray microscopes with 30 nm and 20 ms spatio-temporal resolution. The small experimental length scales will uniquely allow the use of small human bone biopsies to answer question 3). In the context of pre-existing macroscale bone mechanics, the research will inform and develop constitutive models to describe strength and toughness with respect to crack velocity in the form of an evolving dynamic cohesive zone. The experimental data will be hosted in an open-source repository and help advance the understanding of how the extracellular matrix adapts at timescales too fast for cells to respond and remodel, with follow-up studies to understand how this impacts cell fate. The approach will establish a generalizable framework for investigating tissue fracture across length and time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Endothelial cells and macrophages work together in many biological processes, one of which is angiogenesis, the creation of blood vessels. Angiogenesis is critical for the healing of damaged tissues as in the case of chronic wounds. Chronic wounds last on average twelve months and may lead to amputation of lower limbs or possibly even death. Human clinical trials have shown that low-frequency, low-intensity ultrasound advances chronic wound healing. However, the biological mechanisms are still not understood. The knowledge gained from understanding how ultrasound affects endothelial cells and macrophages individually and together may enhance ultrasound therapies for advanced healing and ultimately increase the quality of life for patients. This award will also promote undergraduate and high school student exposure and training in tissue engineering, particularly for underrepresented students and women in engineering through hands-on laboratory experiences. Formal course offerings in tissue engineering will also be developed for both engineering and non-engineering majors with a focus on minoritized students and women in engineering. <br/><br/>The research goal is to evaluate the promotion of angiogenesis as a possible biological mechanism of therapeutic ultrasound. This will be achieved through two objectives: (1) characterize uni- and bi-directional effects of low-frequency, low-intensity ultrasound on macrophage and endothelial cell pro-angiogenic factors via macrophage and endothelial direct co-culture, indirect co-culture (transwell), and individually (endothelial alone and macrophage alone) and (2) analyze gene expression changes using bulk RNAseq and global bioinformation methods. These objectives will be conducted in vitro using 3D collagen scaffolds to more closely mimic physiological conditions. Understanding the effects of therapeutic ultrasound on angiogenesis will provide insight to the possible biological mechanisms of ultrasound. Preliminary data and published literature strongly suggest that stimulation of angiogenesis may be the mechanism through which ultrasound mediates healing. If this is confirmed by the data collected, this may indicate that ultrasound could be an effective therapy to recover functional endothelial behavior where pathological angiogenesis is a hallmark of diseases including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases. These data would provide insights into novel therapeutic applications of ultrasound.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are cells from healthy adult patients that are ?rewired? so that they can form any type of cell found in the body. Currently, heart muscle grown from iPSC in the laboratory is more similar to heart muscle in a fetus than an adult. This means that lab grown muscle does not accurately predict the way drugs will affect patients. This is a major obstacle to developing drugs to treat heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Shortly after birth, babies? hearts must pump with stronger force because their blood pressure increases. At the same time, their hearts? energy source shifts from sugar to fat. Previous research suggests that individually mimicking these changes in mechanical resistance to pumping, or changing the energy source from sugar to fat, can enhance lab-grown heart muscle. This research project will support combining those changes, with the goal of producing muscle that more accurately predicts the way drugs will affect patients. In addition, planned collaborations between the scientists performing this work and local high school teachers will expose students who are underrepresented in the STEM pipeline to science and engineering. <br/><br/>In the perinatal and postnatal stages of heart development, mechanical forces on the heart (preload and afterload) increase. Concurrently, ATP-sourcing switches from glucose to fatty acids. This research hypothesizes that mechanical loading and ATP-sourcing act in a synergistic manner to elicit electrical maturation of cardiomyocytes derived from iPSC by regulating Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) signaling. To address this hypothesis, the PI will leverage a high-throughput, iPSC-derived micro-heart muscle array technology. Biophysical cues applied to the micro-tissues will be controlled using linear actuators to stretch tissue (preload) and magneto-rheoelastomeric substrates to control the rigidity of the substrate tissues work against (afterload). Overall changes in micro-tissue electrophysiology will be determined using voltage sensitive dye, genetic calcium indicator (GCaMP6f), high-speed microscopy and automated video analyses. Using a combination of ion channel specific blocking drugs, immunostaining and RNAseq, these overall changes in electrophysiology will be linked to changes in expression of specific ion channels. Finally, a series of studies with PPAR-pathway modifying drugs will be performed to specifically probe the role for the PPAR-pathway in electrical maturation of iPSC-cardiomyocytes. The overarching focus of the research is to obtain deep understanding of how mechanical cues synergize with soluble, chemical cues like the metabolic substrate, to affect cellular fate and function.

Neuromorphic engineering is a promising frontier to usher in the next generation of CV systems taking advantage of sparsity in the input and network architecture, reducing the number of operations through event-based computation i.e., compute only when necessary. This project aims to develop a versatile energy-efficient bio-inspired sensing, computing, and learning framework by developing a closely-knit system, from devices and circuits with rich spatio-temporal dynamics to network architectures inspired by the visual cortex and adaptive learning algorithms for visual perception. This will be achieved primarily using compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures that process and extract a variety of critical visual features in close physical proximity to where the data is stored in memory. The proposed research will embark on a uniquely integrated approach that addresses challenges at all levels, from devices, circuits, architectures, and algorithms leading to novel CV applications, inspired by neuroscience, such as low latency dynamic object classification, tracking and adaptive visual attention. The breadth of skillsets that are required to effectively train a new cadre of workforce in neuromorphic engineering for computer vision makes curriculum design and integration with existing frameworks incredibly challenging. The proposed BioVision educational consortium will address this issue. The main objective of this consortium is to collaborate and implement a comprehensive workforce development plan that incorporates evidence-based best practices to help train a new generation of engineers and researchers, who are equipped to satisfy the growing needs of the computer vision industry.<br/><br/>The grand vision of this proposal is to reimagine modern computer vision (CV) pipelines that exist today and replace the components with bio-inspired sensors, processors and algorithms that can drastically improve energy efficiency, data efficiency and lower latency. To reinvent the CV pipeline, three research thrusts will be addressed simultaneously. Thrust 1 will focus on creating and building a new class of retina-inspired vision sensors, that outperforms existing cameras, such as frame-based or neuromorphic Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), in terms of features, efficiency and latency. Thrust 2 will focus on modeling, design and implementation of scalable corticomorphic networks on hardware, exhibiting non-linear neuromodulatory dynamics at multiple timescales using mixed-feedback control. Thrust 3 will focus on implementation of network architectures and algorithms inspired by neuroscience, such as reinforcement learning with stochastic rewards, event-based temporal pattern recognition. The proposed research has the potential to lead a generational shift in the fields of computer vision, neuromorphic computing, and artificial intelligence. Developing an energy-efficient event-based camera capable of versatile spatiotemporal pattern recognition and novel features inspired by the retina, along with a general purpose, programmable, event-based computer vision pipeline can have a transformative impact on our society, by impacting critical areas like healthcare, Internet of Things (IoT), military defense, edge computing and industrial automation. Enabling the use of advanced CV on personal electronics can revolutionize our lifestyle through technologies such as self-driving vehicles, always-on smart surveillance, and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) applications.

The Cascadia subduction zone is the main source for earthquakes and tsunamis  in the US Pacific Northwest. This work will map ancient tsunami deposits preserved in the geologic record and combine this data with advanced models to simulate tsunami impacts along the coast. These results will deepen understanding of how past earthquakes have behaved in this region. The specific focus will be on the last major earthquake in the region that occurred in the year 1700. This research will directly impact public safety and preparedness in the region. The insights gained will help to improve hazard maps, emergency and evacuation plans, building codes, and the design of tsunami evacuation structures. Furthermore, the project will support a collaboration with the Shoalwater Bay Tribe. This tribe has built North America's first free-standing tsunami evacuation tower, and the collaboration will help to advance community engagement and education regarding seismic risks. Through ths work, this project will serve as a vital investment in public safety and knowledge dissemination. <br/>  <br/>The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study of the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ), focusing on the seismic and tsunami activity around the year 1700 CE. To accomplish this, the team will carry out high-resolution mapping of paleotsunami deposits at two key locations along the CSZ and execute thousands of advanced tsunami inundation models. These efforts aim to test various hypotheses of what kinds of earthquake slip distributions can explain actual field observations, addressing gaps in the current understanding of tsunami deposit distribution. By employing innovative techniques such as analyzing sediment cores, microfossils, and sediment geochemistry, the results will delineate the full extent of tsunami inundation with high resolution at these new sites. This approach will help in validating or excluding different earthquake scenarios and contribute to a more precise understanding of the CSZ's seismic behavior.

Since their introduction roughly a decade ago, trisections have proven to be a successful new tool with which to study smooth 4-manifolds, with numerous articles written in the interim to develop the foundations for trisection theory. An important strength of the theory of trisections is the way it interfaces with a variety of other topics in low-dimensional topology.  This interface provides an opportunity to explore many classical areas of 4-manifold topology through a new lens. Such areas include, for example, the study of knotted surfaces in 4-space, diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, exotic smooth structures, group actions and (branched) covering spaces, and symplectic structures.  The main goal of these workshops is to bring together researchers from multiple areas to propose and to work on open problems, with a particular focus on the inclusion of early career researchers.

Originating in response to global disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain vulnerabilities, and geopolitical conflicts, the project holds significant importance. Focusing on Ukraine's digital services sector, which has faced persistent external shocks due to the ongoing conflict, this initiative is both timely and crucial. The primary objective is to establish connections between Ukrainian scientists and their counterparts in the West, mitigating the isolation caused by geopolitical tensions and fostering a collaborative research network dedicated to systemic resilience. Involving an international partnership comprising the USA, Ukraine, Poland, Estonia, and Lithuania, the project adopts an interdisciplinary approach, leveraging network science, resilience analytics, explainable AI, and digital twin technologies. Beyond enhancing Ukraine's infrastructural resilience, the project aspires to serve as a blueprint for global resilience strategies in analogous contexts.<br/>To achieve broader impact, the Dallas-Fort Worth airport will function as the initial RRUA testbed for co-development and training. The RRUA concept and methods will undergo testing in Poland, Estonia, and Lithuania's energy and communications infrastructure, culminating in their application to Ukraine's digital infrastructure. In addition to advancing research goals, this project is steadfast in its commitment to promoting inclusivity in science and engineering. It actively involves junior Ukrainian researchers, facilitating their integration into the global scientific community. Educational opportunities will be offered through digital platforms, workshops, and simulation games, aligning with EU-Ukraine events. These initiatives aim to provide a distinctive learning experience, nurturing a new generation of scientists equipped with the skills to address complex resilience challenges and aligning with the NSF's mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This NSF EAGER project award aims to advance resilience science by developing the Resilience-Recovery Under Attack (RRUA) framework, with a focus on the unique challenges faced by Ukraine's digital services sector.  The RRUA framework introduces an innovative and comprehensive approach to resilience science, targeting the complex interdependencies of interconnected infrastructural systems subjected to dynamic threats and shocks. Hence, the project represents a significant leap from traditional resilience strategies that emphasize prevention, instead integrating recovery as a core component of the resilience paradigm. <br/>	We aim to validate the hypothesis that the recovery and resilience of systems under threats and system response stages to diverse shocks can be quantified via stress-testing of interconnected networks representing their systemic functions. We aim to provide novel insights into the lifecycle of resilience under external shocks during acute and persistent shocks, and in particular quantify the key controllers of each of the resilience-response phases to inform efficient recovery interventions. By employing a multi-faceted methodology combining network science, resilience analytics, explainable AI (xAI), and digital twin technologies, the project seeks to redefine systemic recovery modeling and adaptation of interconnected infrastructure across Ukraine, benefiting from the shared knowledge of our proposed international partnership with the USA, Ukraine, Poland, Estonia, and Lithuania.  The project utilizes a three-pronged approach: refining RRUA using data-rich analyses at a US-based international airport, testing concepts and methods in Poland, Estonia and Lithuania testbeds, including human behavior components of vulnerability, and subsequently integrating RRUA within Ukraine's cyber and energy infrastructure systems in the presence of dynamic threats and variable data. Success could revolutionize Ukraine's prospects for recovery, positioning it as a global example for resilience strategies. Our research design will collaboratively explore how to operationalize our RRUA framework across varied settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists are using these tools to connect genes to phenotypes, generate novel phenotypic variation, and for diverse crop improvement applications. This project expands the possibilities for editing in crop plants to include a method for editing gene expression, so called ?epigenetic editing?. Epigenetics is a broad term used to describe mechanisms that change gene expression without directly changing the DNA. Epigenetic variability can have profound impacts on an organism?s phenotype, and many important agronomic traits are influenced by gene expression. Broader impacts of the project include the wide dissemination of the method for the improvement of crop plants and other species, plus the training of students via integration with a long running and successful undergraduate internship program. Epigenetic crop improvement strategies will complement existing biotechnology and breeding strategies and may offer opportunities to help maintain crop yields in the face of climate change. This project will directly train the next generation of scientists to use these tools through an effective Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. All resources generated in this project will be made available for use.<br/><br/>This project will expand the possibilities for editing in crop plants to include epigenetic editing. It was recently demonstrated that it is possible to affect gene expression through targeted DNA methylation at MeSWEET10a in the important crop, cassava. MeSWEET10a is not normally expressed in leaf tissue but is ectopically induced by a bacterial pathogen using a transcription activator-like (TAL) effector. De novo methylation of the MeSWEET10a promoter blocked TAL binding and led to decreased disease symptoms. Despite these encouraging results, epigenetic editing is still an immature technology. The goal of this project is to fill specific knowledge gaps related to establishment, maintenance, and inheritance of epigenetic edits and in so doing, lower the entry point for other researchers to adopt this powerful technology. Specifically, aim 1 of this proposal is to develop and distribute epigenetic editing tools in other crop species. The work will leverage and adapt the technologies known to work in cassava to accomplish similar disease outcomes in rice and tomato. Aim 2 will expand on the applications of epigenetic editing in crops. This includes the ability to target multiple loci simultaneously, ?fine tune? gene expression and tissue specific editing. Aim 3 is dedicated to characterizing stability and heritability of de novo epialleles. If successful, other research projects and applications in biotechnology will benefit. This work will also provide additional jumping off points for fundamental work on epigenetics in non-model plant systems. Further, an ability to directly edit the epigenome will empower the larger field of epigenetics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these infections are triggered by virulence proteins secreted from bacteria in lipid-containing particles, called extracellular vesicles. Human waste (feces) is an important source of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs)   in the environment. However, little is known about the fate of BEVs when they enter wastewater treatment and disposal systems. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to investigate the fate and health impacts of BEVs in wastewater systems. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to combine and integrate the extraction and separation of BEVs from wastewater samples with advanced proteogenomic analyses to identify and quantify BEV proteins in wastewater. The PI will then utilize this new approach to investigate the generation, fate, and persistence of BEVs in wastewater and wastewater treatment systems. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge on the fate of BEVs in the environment and their potential impacts on public health. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student and one undergraduate student at the University at Buffalo.<br/><br/>Bacteria release extracellular vehicles as a universal pathway to export their cellular contents (i.e., proteins, nucleotides, lipids, and metabolites) with enriched concentrations into the surrounding environment. Previous studies have shown that certain bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) introduced through a respiratory or oral route can lead to inflammatory reactions in vivo and in vitro. Those disease-causing functions and interactions with host cells are primarily attributed to virulence proteins released by BEVs. High concentrations of BEVs and EV-producing bacteria are shed in human waste (feces) and are likely to enter wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal systems. However, limited fundamental knowledge is available about the virulence proteins carried by bacterial EVs in wastewater due to the challenges of protein analysis in complex wastewater and environmental matrices. This CAREER project will investigate the persistence and production of BEVs in wastewater and assess their potential risks to human health with the goal of improving disinfection strategies to deactivate BEVs and advancing the discovery of health-relevant biomarkers from wastewater. The specific objectives of the research are to (1) develop and apply a novel integrated separation and proteogenomic approach to characterize BEV proteins and their biological functions in municipal wastewater; (2) measure the kinetics of BEV production, partitioning, and decay in wastewater; and (3) assess the disease-causing potentials of BEVs after treatment by commonly used disinfection methods including chlorination and germicidal UV. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new data and fundamental knowledge to advance the detection, discovery, and monitoring of virulence proteins released by BEVs in wastewater and environmental media. To implement the educational and outreach activities of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will leverage existing programs and resources at the University at Buffalo (UB) to (1) develop and display interactive activities simulating wastewater microbiome discovery for the general public at the Buffalo Museum of Science and (2) design LEGO platforms to broaden the engagement of K-12 students in learning about omics technologies and their utilization in environmental monitoring and disease surveillance. In addition, the PI  plans to leverage the research findings to design and incorporate lessons in omics tools and analyses into the Environmental Engineering Curriculum at UB.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This perspective contrasts with recent scholarship suggesting that urbanism results from a complex interplay of top-down and bottom-up processes. To address this imbalance, this project investigates how the actions of non-elite individuals aggregate to shape cities through activities like private economic enterprise. Such findings are broadly relevant to resolving open questions about how cities are formed, sustained, and eventually fail. Within the described framework, the team investigates an early walled city. The research has the potential to reveal temporal or geographical variability among urbanisms in the heartland of cities by providing a holistic view. The initiative integrates researchers from various national and international universities with resident specialists and students from the site's region. The collaboration affords early career scholars with the datasets needed for doctoral research and professional advancement. Furthermore, the team empowers heritage professionals and students in the region by providing training in the latest digital and scientific methods in archaeology, thereby improving scientific infrastructure and increasing capacity for future research. Project data is shared online through Open Context and archived through the University of Central Florida Library.<br/><br/>To evaluate the role that everyday people played in the development of ancient cities, the researchers rigorously evaluate patterns of wealth, health, and diet in the archaeological record. Intensive surveys and excavations of residential districts investigate economic patterning and social stratification. Targeted studies  clarify the presence or absence of large-scale, centralized storage and production, towards understanding the extent to which elites intervened in the organization of labor and wealth production. The initiative complements field research with additional scientific studies (bioarchaeological, stable isotope, and compositional analyses) to assess how people of all socio-economic levels expressed decision-making through commercial and consumer activities. Laboratory studies transform the detritus of everyday life?pottery, bone, carbonized plant remains, and small artifacts?into datasets capable of answering the project?s research questions about social differences and economic organization.

The global market for immersive video is projected to reach 22 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. With the rising popularity of 360-degree videos, network operators and service providers are increasingly keen on gaining insights into users? Quality of Experience (QoE) perception. However, the conventional QoE models designed for two dimensional videos fall short of capturing users? unique subjective feelings in viewing this new type of video. To bridge this gap, the project focuses on constructing human-centered models that utilize ?human factors? via a variety of virtual reality (VR) onboard sensors. Leveraging multi-modal sensory readings, the researchers will tap into a direct representation of users? perceptual experiences. This approach captures subjective feelings often missed by the objective system parameters commonly used in existing QoE models. The success of this project will provide an in-depth understanding of users? nuanced perceptual experience while engaging with 360-degree videos. It will create opportunities for stakeholders to implement user-specific network resource optimization and video streaming strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction on an individual basis. The research outcomes will significantly contribute to the human-centered sensing and networking research communities and benefit numerous VR applications beyond 360-degree videos.<br/><br/>This project involves three closely related research thrusts. The first thrust investigates how to extract salient features from multi-modal sensory readings for effective QoE assessment. To combat bias arising from datasets with unevenly distributed labels, novel approaches will be developed to augment underrepresented data by exploring useful information across sensing modalities. The second thrust seeks to optimize system resource utilization for QoE assessment. Multiple personalized models will share common neural network layers at edge servers for resource-efficient model hosting. Adaptive sampling will be applied at VR terminals during sensory data acquisition to maintain data utility. The third thrust focuses on devising data privacy protection mechanisms without sacrificing QoE assessment accuracy. Under the differential privacy framework, the approach features formal quantification of data correlation of multi-modality sensory data, which has been largely overlooked by prior work. The proposed research is inter-disciplinary, which spans data-driven modeling, sensing, and privacy-preserving computing. The proposed mechanisms and designs will be thoroughly evaluated via a combination of measurement campaigns, simulations, and experimental studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results from this research will benefit the US health and society, impacting the fields of acoustic sensing, disease diagnosis, and cellular biology.<br/><br/>The project will investigate fundamental research questions related to how biological cells with different mechanical properties (stiffness, density, compressibility and viscosity) interact with acoustic waves propagating along a substrate, how perturbations caused by the cell and by changes in its properties can break the dynamic equilibrium associated with exceptional points, and how the corresponding frequency splitting mechanism can quantify changes in the cell properties and thus form the basis for a novel acoustic biosensing technique. The project objectives will be accomplished through two research tasks: (1) investigation of cell-wave interaction and fundamental studies on exceptional point generation in acoustic substrates; and (2) experimental investigations, and proof-of-concept of exceptional point-based acoustic biosensing. This project will lead to advances in the understanding of the interaction between surface acoustic waves and a cell. The study of exceptional points generation in surface acoustic waves substrates with a cavity is a novel aspect of the work, which will explore the interaction of multiple wave modes with cavity-cell resonances, their coupling and hybridization. Analytical, numerical, and experimental studies will explore the sensitivity of exceptional points sensing of the cell?s physical properties, which will open new pathways for sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumer products and biological structures within the cell both rely on the formation of liquid droplets within another liquid media, known as 'liquid-liquid phase separation'. In biology, this leads to compartments that can organize the interior of the cell. In industry, a similar effect is used to control the 'feel' or texture of personal care or food products. The physical reason for these phase separation phenomena is complicated but is often attributed to several types of large molecules that interact with electrostatic charge. Many of these systems include particles such as folded proteins, which contain nanometer-scale charged patches that interact with long-chain, flexible molecules.<br/> <br/>The PI's group will investigate how the surface of these charged particles affects liquid-liquid phase separation. This will consist of understanding the 'stickiness' between positively-charged molecular chains called polycations, and negatively-charged molecules that form nanoscale structures similar to those found in soap, called surfactant micelles. The polycations and surfactant micelles stick together in a dynamic, gel-like material known as a complex coacervate. This sticking will be highly dependent on the patchiness of the micelles, and the presence of molecules that get in the way of the charged interactions. The PI's group will establish how different patches, and molecular components will affect the propensity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. This work will show how complicated biological systems, such as patchy proteins, can form similar structures in the cell. This work will also inform the design of consumer products, such as shampoo, cosmetics, and perfumes, and will guide engineers in navigating a complicated design space as they seek to use greener and healthier formulations.<br/> <br/>The integrated education and outreach component of this project supports broader outreach to graduate and undergraduate research training and mentorship. Outreach efforts consist of using interactive computer simulation as the centerpiece of a PI-designed activity within the St. Elmo Brady STEM Academy at the University of Illinois. This project will build up demonstrations needed to understand more 'advanced' aspects of existing efforts, by developing modules that introduce the concepts of (macro)molecules and their corresponding materials. The overall activity will introduce the lifecycle of plastics and sustainability to elementary-age students. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will use simulation and polymer field theory to study how molecular interactions and charge patchiness affect phase separation in polyelectrolyte/particle solutions. A wide variety of materials systems, from consumer products to phase-separated regions in the cell, rely on charge-driven phase separation. This process of 'coacervation' can be driven by the attraction between oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes and particle species such as surfactant micelles or proteins. Taking cues from biology, the PI will establish how charged interactions and patchiness control phase behavior in PE-particle coacervates. <br/> <br/>In this work, the PI will systematically study the relationship between molecular structure, particle configuration, and non-uniform charge patterning. This investigation will build on an established hybrid field theory model, with parameters informed by particle-based simulations to understand the strong, polyelectrolyte-mediated electrostatics between nearby charged particles. This model will be used to first probe the effect of steric repulsion and hydrophobic interactions on surfactant-polyelectrolyte coacervates, and then charged patterns will be introduced onto particles to represent catchy particles or proteins.<br/> <br/>This project will establish the theoretical and computational basis for understanding coacervates formed between polyelectrolytes and a variety of particles that are not flexible polymers, yielding new insights into the role of charged patterning and surface interactions on bulk phase behavior. This will have impact on materials important for a wide range of consumer applications and biological systems.<br/> <br/>Outreach and education are also an integral part of this research project, which will support the interdisciplinary training of at least one graduate and one undergraduate researchers. The PI's group will develop outreach activities, further integrating computation into existing, successful programs such as the St. Elmo Brady STEM Academy. The goal will be to design interactive computational activities to increase student engagement with difficult and abstract concepts in plastic life cycles and recycling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fossils provide unparalleled insight into the long-term responses of species in changing environments and can be used to identify both vulnerable and resilient ecosystems. This project leverages the fossil record of Jamaica to characterize ancient biodiversity and quantify how it has been shaped by environmental changes before and after human colonization of the island. The research seeks to guide conservation strategies in an ecosystem that supports a diversity of wildlife and human populations. The project also increases access to paleontology by training students in paleontological research methods. Students will use their research experiences to develop K-12 lesson plans that meet the national educational standards in both the US and Jamaica. In collaboration with international partners, these lesson plans will be deployed in a series of STEM camps for children and their teachers. <br/><br/>This research integrates existing museum collections and novel paleontological excavations with biogeographic theory and ecological modelling to quantify biodiversity through time, measured through the lenses of taxonomic and functional richness. Three primary research questions are addressed: (1) What is the pre-human baseline biodiversity? (2) Do abiotic processes (climate) and/or biotic processes (human colonization) trigger changes in community structure and/or functional trait diversity? (3) Do introduced species restore functional diversity lost through extinction? The interdisciplinary approach of this research will provide critical information on how taxonomic and functional diversity is impacted by environmental change, and is relevant to conservation, ecology, evolutionary biology, and paleontology. Furthermore, the educational component of this research seeks to build STEM research capacity and literacy by providing authentic, place-based experiences to project participants. The efficacy of these activities will be assessed through surveys that measure participant confidence and sense of belonging in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In nature, some animals have specialized physiology that allow them to ingest toxins without being harmed. Some Central and South American poison frogs can sequester neurotoxins in their diet and repurpose those toxins as a chemical defense from predation. These frogs move the alkaloids from the intestines, through the bloodstream and to the skin where toxins are stored in glands. This project investigates how these frogs cope with ingesting neurotoxins and the results may provide a more complete picture of oral drug distribution, metabolism, and new methods of toxin resistance, because many of the toxins are similar to pharmaceutical drugs used in humans. This research will provide learning experiences to all age groups in both the United States and Ecuador, where research and fieldwork on poison frogs is conducted. High school biology teachers will be involved in summer research and will incorporate their research findings into their science curriculum. This award will also provide research internships for local community college students, and a portion of this research will be conducted in an undergraduate laboratory course at Stanford University. In Ecuador, research will be communicated to the public through educational displays at the Centro Jambatu of Amphibian Research and Conservation in Quito. <br/><br/>Poison frogs acquire alkaloid-based chemical defenses from dietary arthropods, although how these lipophilic alkaloids are moved across organs without self-toxicity is unclear. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the physiological mechanisms and convergent evolution of toxin sequestration and autoresistence in poison frogs through three aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that independent evolutionary origins of chemical defense is associated with expression changes of genes whose products are involved in small molecule transport and metabolism. Alkaloid profiles and gene expression in several tissues will be quantified across poison frog species that represent independent origins of chemical defense evolution. (2) Test the hypothesis that alkaloid sequestration evolved by co-opting transporter proteins for either sequestration or excretion. Gene expression profiling across organs in toxic and non-toxic lab-reared poison frogs will be used to identify membrane transporters enriched in tissues that sequester alkaloids. Candidate carriers will be functionally tested in cell-based assays. (3) A serpin protein in poison frogs that can bind a range of alkaloids was recently discovered by the research team. The binding profile of this toxin sponge for various alkaloids will be examined. Whether this toxin sponge is necessary for alkaloid sequestration will be tested through gene knockdown studies. Together, this work will test the hypothesis that chemical defense in poison frogs evolved via multiple mechanisms, each of which occur at a distinct level of organismal organization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most studies on the impacts of stress use a biomedical perspective and focus on its negative, non-adaptive effects on health. In contrast, studies based in behavioral ecology assess how stress responses can adaptively rescue organisms from challenges. The dichotomy established by these two approaches limits our understanding of stress because stresses that originally trigger an adaptive response may in time take a cumulative toll resulting in wear-and-tear (reduced longevity) or chronic stress (inability to elicit an adaptive response). To advance knowledge about stress reactivity in general, and social reactivity in particular, this study analyzes two populations of a wild primate that have been naturally exposed to different environmental (natural periods of food restriction) and social (overcrowding) stresses. This comparison offers a powerful tool for detecting how variation in stress responses relate to individual health and fitness. The research develops outreach activities for grade-school children, builds capacity at the field laboratory, and contributes to conservation efforts. This research is the first to make unprecedented gains in understanding the adaptive and maladaptive nature of the stress response in wild primates.  <br/><br/>The study focuses on 120 wild capuchins living in two different forests to: (1) measure the variation in glucocorticoids before and after known social (e.g., aggression between neighboring groups) and ecological stressors (e.g., droughts); (2) quantify each individual?s unique stress response; (3) determine whether these responses are repeatable; (4) determine if the same individuals respond differently to different stressors and/or if the same stressor induces different responses from different individuals, and; (5) assess which if any stress responses have fitness consequences. The study uses a within-subject approach by measuring fine-scale variation in fecal stress hormones (glucocorticoids) before and after facing a known stressor. The data generated builds a baseline for stress-induced hormone levels against which the levels associated with stress-reaction can be compared.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The impacts of odor pollution have come under increasing scrutiny in recent decades. Agrochemical scent pollution has been found to disrupt bumblebee behavior, a particularly alarming finding in light of their critical role as pollinators in agricultural and natural ecosystems. These findings imply that neural processing of floral odors is impacted by odor pollution. One barrier for understanding these impacts of agrochemicals on bumblebee foraging behavior is that there are no concrete computational structures for representing and exploring odor perception, as current methods are statistical in nature. This means pollution cannot be easily measured, or quantified; which makes it challenging to develop agricultural recommendations. This project is building upon earlier work that established a quantification mechanism for complex odors (i.e. odors made up of many molecules) to establish an algorithm for representing bumblebee odor perception. The established ?Compounds with Borders? (CWB) method allows the difference between any two odors to be represented as an angular distance, and has been used to establish a ?safe zone? of odor pollution for complex odors: polluted-odors within a  20-30 degree range are generalized. Next steps include expanding CWB into a more comprehensive geometry that can accurately account for simpler odors as well.  This work will be performed at a ?primarily undergraduate institution?, incorporating valuable research experiences for the next generation of STEM professionals.<br/><br/><br/>Given the neurophysiological organization of odor processing, the relative importance of molecular-identity versus -feature of odorants is linked to stimulus complexity, with encoding of simpler odors correlating with identity and more complex odors correlating with features. ?Compounds with Borders? is particularly effective for complex blends because it quantifies the amount of sensory energy that is distributed across molecular features in an odor using a Euclidean approach where ?dimensions? in odor space represent those features. The next hurdle  is to expand the geometry of this odor-space to incorporate molecular identity. This is not logistically tractable without data that delineate what level of odor complexity  shifts the primary-processing output from ?identity? to ?feature? correlation.  This project aims to develop a more comprehensive geometry using associative odor learning paradigms combined with recording neural activity at both the input (antennae) and output (antennal lobe tracts) from primary olfactory processing. Gas Chromatography-Electroantennographic recordings will establish a species specific odor-salience across molecular identities and features. Spike-resolved multi-unit recordings from the antennal lobe tracts will assay odor information as it moves forward to integration and action centers.  Comparing the point at which odor responses shift from correlating with molecular identity to molecular feature at a neurophysiological and behavioral level will inform an expanded geometry that utilizes stimulus complexity to shape dimensional weighting. Thus, this work aims to establish a novel paradigm for vertical integration of neural encoding through behavior in olfaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent discoveries of ternary compounds with frustrated vanadium sublattices, meaning magnetic spins cannot arrange in alternating directions (think putting the spins on the corners of a triangle), have revealed multiple exotic phenomena, including superconductivity, residing within a single material. Even more intriguingly, these phenomena are found to interact and compete. Understanding the implications of these interactions is challenging because only a few material examples are known. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, Prof. Toberer and his research group employ strategies to discover new crystalline compounds that contain layers of magnetic vanadium atoms. First, active search algorithms are utilized to efficiently explore ternary vanadium chemical spaces through a combination of (i) first principles calculations of known and hypothetical compounds and (ii) bulk synthesis and structure determination. Second, the fundamental properties of new vanadium ternary compounds are determined through low temperature measurements and quantum mechanical calculations. Third, single crystals are grown of the most promising compounds for further low temperature measurements. Together, these tasks are expected to enable the next generation of quantum materials. Interwoven throughout these efforts are educational opportunities for undergraduate students and scientific engagement with the broader public.

The research begins with experimentally establishing ternary A-V-Z phase diagrams and associated novel compounds therein using bulk solid state chemistry approaches; these efforts leverage guidance from first principles calculations and physics-informed Bayesian optimization. For each new compound, the electronic structure and topology of each new compound is predicted using first principles methods for down-selection for single crystal growth using fluxes. Low temperature characterization of these single crystals reveals potential electronic instabilities arising from magnetic frustration; further characterization is facilitated through a commitment to sample sharing with the broader condensed matter community. The discovery and study of new quantum materials based on frustrated vanadium nets will ultimately enhance our understanding of the interaction between topology, charge density waves, and superconductivity. Interwoven throughout these activities are efforts to (i) build a new generation of STEM talent at the intersection of solid-state materials chemistry, condensed matter physics, and statistical decision making, (ii) broaden participation in STEM via targeted outreach, and (iii) engage the broader public in solid-state chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For decades, database systems have been built for monolithic servers, where compute, memory, and storage are tightly integrated. However, these traditional databases now struggle to meet the stringent requirements of elasticity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, especially when supporting large-scale applications in the cloud. Recently, there has been an emerging technology trend towards hardware resource disaggregation, which involves physically separating the hardware resources (such as compute, memory, and storage) into distinct resource pools to enable independent and elastic resource scaling. However, this disaggregated architecture presents fundamental challenges for traditional databases. This project will build a new database system that is specifically optimized for resource disaggregation to substantially improve performance, scalability, and elasticity. This will, in turn, significantly reduce costs for database customers and yield substantial economic benefits for society. The developed techniques will be open-sourced to enhance the research infrastructure. Research findings will be disseminated through publications at top-tier venues and will be incorporated into both graduate-level and undergraduate-level database courses at Purdue University. Furthermore, this project will foster diversity and inclusion by actively engaging groups that are traditionally underrepresented in this field, such as women, minority groups, and underprivileged students.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project investigates the profound impact of resource disaggregation (with respect to both storage and memory) on database systems. It presents a new disaggregated database system through three key thrusts. The first thrust introduces new approaches to efficiently manage database logs and perform transaction commits for storage disaggregation. The second thrust proposes new techniques to optimize database indexes and the buffer manager for memory disaggregation. The third thrust develops a new distributed database architecture for memory disaggregation and redesigns concurrency control and crash recovery. Overall, this project will drive the next wave of innovation in the field of database systems by starting a new line of research on disaggregated data(base) systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surprisingly, quantum physics predicts that the electricity- and heat- carrying capabilities of a solid at the nanometer scale do not reduce continuously with decreased cross-section. This quantum theory has been validated repeatedly in different experiments for both the electricity- and heat-carrying capabilities of electrons in different nanostructures. In comparison, there has been only one reported experimental observation of the predicted quantum behavior of the heat-carrying ability in a polycrystalline silicon nitride nanostructure. In response to a call for further experimental investigations of the quantum theory of lattice heat transport, this project is focused on experimental investigation of this quantum theory in individual single-walled carbon nanotubes with the use of a unique measurement method.

The goal of this work is to advance multiprobe measurements of the intrinsic thermal conductance of 1D nanostructures for accurate detection of the quantized phonon conductance that has been predicted for a SWCNT at a relatively high temperature up to about 10 K. This temperature range is much more conducive to producing unambiguous experimental evidence of quantized phonon conductance than the below-0.8 K temperature required for prior studies of silicon nitride nanobeams. If successful, the proposed measurements of SWCNTs will establish an experimental capability for detecting and controlling quantized phonon transport behaviors of low-dimensional systems.

Planets form in disks of gas and dust around newborn stars, but disks disappear as the stars age, limiting the opportunity for planets to form. Disks may spiral into the central star or evaporate from the inside-out via the newborn star?s photons. However, external photoevaporation from a nearby, much brighter star can destroy disks more quickly, reducing the time and materials to make planets. While this phenomenon has been observed in a few objects, this project will quantify whether such external photoevaporation is a major player in this story of planet formation. Leveraging a large dataset of young star clusters, Dr. Megan Reiter of Rice University and her research associates will measure the disks themselves, starlight impinging on them, and matter streaming away from them. In parallel, an educational program to encourage entrance and persistence in STEM fields will be implemented in two parts: an active-learning teacher training and astronomy-inspired curriculum for Houston K-12 schools, and foundational skills will be added to observational lab courses at Rice University; these interventions will preferentially help historically underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>To quantify this environmental impact on planet formation, Dr. Reiter has secured more than 100 hours of telescope time using the integral field unit spectrograph MUSE on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. The goal is to observe thousands of low-mass stars and their disks in high-mass star-forming regions of at least 1000 times the mass of the Sun ? a sample 100 times larger than existing studies. These data cleanly separate stellar emission from the bright, variable nebular background. Spectral diagnostics indicate active external photoevaporation and quantify the mass-loss rate. A scaling relationship between incident UV flux and external disk photoevaporation will be derived, useful when theorists model the demographics of planets. The methods developed and astronomy professionals supported by this work will be in high demand when 30-meter class ground-based telescopes become available.

Their exceptional electronic properties are coupled with inexpensive, low-temperature solution processing. This combination is surprising, given that defects can be introduced during film formation or through impurities. This CAREER project is motivated by the need to better understand these materials and to advance the science and technology of soft semiconductors. The key to understanding the exceptional properties of halide perovskites lies with their structural dynamics, that is, how atoms composing a material interact with one another through vibrations. Unlike conventional semiconductors, structural dynamics in halide perovskites are anharmonic, arising from long-ranged and damped nonlinear interactions in a soft lattice. This research project aims to establish fundamental concepts as to how soft semiconductors function with extreme lattice anharmonicity. The PI will investigate these materials with a combination of advanced optical and vibrational spectroscopy, coupled with computational modeling. Insights developed in this research will help to comprehend collective motions in these emerging materials and enable their customization. The educational focus of this project embraces and leverages the rise of computation for the teaching and learning of physical chemistry. Computation as a medium and approach will be incorporated into instruction, curricular and extracurricular projects, and student research. The PI will also explore the visualization and sonification of scientific data to bridge science and art, bringing this to students and the general public.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This research proposal focuses on metal halide perovskites, a relatively new class of soft semiconductors with strongly anharmonic structural dynamics in sharp contrast to conventional quasi-harmonic semiconductors. In this yet uncharted territory, we need to rethink how electronic and structural degrees of freedom couple with each other. Gaps in our understanding exist that call for basic knowledge and new concepts to fully appreciate the origin, extent, and consequence of a soft anharmonic lattice in optoelectronic materials. To bridge these gaps, the PI seeks to quantify universal lattice anharmonicity and its impact on charge carrier relaxation in halide perovskite soft semiconductors; characterize ferroelastic domain wall optoelectronics in halide perovskite soft semiconductors; and identify new two-dimensional and molecular soft semiconductors. The project features correlated spectroscopic investigations across multiple time and length scales. Terahertz frequency lattice dynamics will be probed and correlated to optical range electronic transitions as well as elastic properties in the static limit. Emphasis will be placed on distilling universal design principles from metal halide perovskites and generalizing these insights to other emerging materials.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials program and the Established Program toStimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI has developed a technique of ?cascade degradation and upcycling? (?Deg-Up?) that represents an emerging effective means to convert plastic waste into high-value chemicals and materials. In the degradation of the two most common high-volume commercial plastics made of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), temperature-gradient thermolysis (a controlled thermal breakdown of the plastic molecules) is highly effective in converting them into platform intermediate chemicals for general uses. In the upcycling of platform intermediate chemicals, PE and PP-derived products are particularly useful for subsequent conversion to produce high-value materials such as surfactants (e.g., soaps, detergents, surface modifiers, etc.). The output of high-value surfactants from low-cost plastic waste can provide significant financial incentives to address the existing fast-accumulating plastic waste. The controlled ?Deg-Up? of PE and PP, which will be the focus of this project, will offer new approaches to producing sustainable surfactants with reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions. Downstream functionalization of PE and PP-derived intermediate molecules will pave the foundation for the future development of ?waste-to-value? using other plastic waste feedstocks.  Highly integrated with the concept of ?plastic sustainability?, the educational component of the project will train students at all levels including underrepresented local K-12 and college youth, work with neighboring Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and develop sustainable plastic waste removal programs in Appalachia. <br/><br/> <br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/><br/>The vast amount of accumulated plastic waste requires a better ending point than landfills or oceans. Chemical upcycling is an attractive method to bring low-value plastic waste into high-value chemicals and materials. This project utilizes plastic waste as a chemical feedstock, much like ?crude oil? except that it requires no drilling or mining. Two high-volume plastics, including polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), will be converted to high-value surfactants. The project will (a) provide an understanding of temperature-gradient thermolysis for producing controlled degradation intermediates and (b) develop upcycling strategies to produce value-added ionic and non-ionic surfactants. Three main research tasks of the project include: 1) employment of temperature-gradient thermolysis to degrade PE and PP, 2) functionalization of the thermolysis products with ionic end groups to form amphiphilic molecules for use as surfactants, and 3) functionalization of the thermolysis products into non-ionic molecules. The proposed research will impact the fields of polymers and surfactants and enable the upcycling of plastics into high-value chemicals. The upcycling strategy removes plastic waste, elongates the lifespan of carbon in a reduced form, decreases carbon emissions, and mitigates environmental pollution. The educational impacts include training underrepresented K-12 and first-generation college students in Appalachia. The educational components share the central theme of ?polymer sustainability? and are highly integrated with research.  <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical looping combustion is one promising approach where metal oxide particles (i.e., oxygen carriers) are used to oxidize fuel without nitrogen present to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and improve efficiency of capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide. However, the longevity of the oxygen carrier particles limits the technologies widespread use. An approach is needed where the combustion process is used to oxidize fuel while controlling the structure of the particles. Control of the particle structure will extend particle longevity and reduce attrition. Metal oxide nanoparticles are synthesized in a similar aerosol process but have not been extended to reduce metal oxide particles to metal. Thus, this project seeks to identify the physical and chemical processes that will enable control of copper oxide, a common oxygen carrier, reduction. In addition, research will be introduced to community college students pretransfer to improve student goals that will reduce gaps in postgraduate engineering degrees for students that start post-secondary education at community colleges. These efforts will improve the ability to produce power while decreasing environmental impact and increase the diversity of the technical workforce.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to use self-sustaining dust flames, whose structure dictates the particle time-temperature history, to control the reduction process of CuO, a common oxygen carrier, to overcome agglomeration and attrition issues present in chemical looping combustion. This idea seeks to determine the physics that will enable reduction process to be controlled under the fast heating conditions, about 0.1-1.0 million degrees Kelvin per second, rather than the traditional isothermal conditions in chemical looping combustion. Constant volume dust flame experiments will quantify the flame structure and limiting processes of CuO-gaseous fuel flames, while providing a link between time-temperature history and product particle (i.e., Cu, Cu2O, or mixture) structure. Quasi-1D dusty flames will be used to the refine time-temperature history to control the product particle structure (e.g., particle size, grain size and orientation, etc.) such that the cause for the formation of particle morphology and size, preferred crystal faces, and grain size is determined.

Ions, charged atoms and molecules, are the way in which electricity flows through living organisms. Negatively-charged electrons and positively-charged holes flow through semiconductors in electronics such as computers and mobile phones. Materials that conduct both ions and electrons bridge these worlds. This gives them many potential applications that bring together electronics and biology. Blends of semiconducting polymers and charge-balancing electrolytes are a promising class of mixed ionic and electronic conductors. In particular, they can be biocompatible and flexible. This makes them attractive materials for wearable and implantable bioelectronics and possibly even neuromorphic computers inspired by the human brain. Ideally, a mixed conductor could be designed on-demand for a given need. However, the chemistry between polymers and ionic electrolytes is complex and many aspects are poorly understood. These fundamental limits in understanding relationships must be addressed for these materials to reach their full potential. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team that combines material characterization, modeling, and device testing to provide fundamental knowledge into these relationships. The results of this project will be used to advance the technologies in which these material systems are used. Students working in this project will develop in-demand technical, communications and critical thinking skills. All of these are essential for preparing the future STEM workforce. Outreach to the community is an integral component of the project. Annual in-person workshops will provide high school science teachers hands-on experience in making and characterizing devices such as electrochromics and transistors. Follow-through includes materials for teachers to make working devices and circuits and learning modules to accompany these materials and experiments. These learning activities will enhance STEM education by connecting fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics with the everyday lives of the students.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Electronic and ionic transport in conjugated polymers depends on a complicated web of variables, ranging from polymer structure through the extent of solvent-induced polymer swelling. This project investigates three primary variables that influence electronic and ionic transport, including electrolyte solvent chemistry, electrolyte ion chemistry, and polymer sidechain chemistry. Spectroscopic and device level measurements will be combined with quantum-chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to establish a fundamental understanding that spans from molecular level chemical interactions to device level ionic and electronic transport properties. In terms of electrolyte solvent, the project determines how the dielectric constant of the solvent and the solvent?s ability to swell the polymer impact electronic and ionic transport. In terms of electrolyte ion chemistry, the project determines how ion shape and hydrophobicity impact electronic structure and ionic and electronic transport as a function of polymer sidechain chemistry. The results of this project are essential for building a comprehensive predictive model that can be used to guide materials design and electrolyte selection for various applications of electrochemically doped conjugated polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, over 30% of 3D-printed materials are discarded immediately after printing, motivating a vision of the future where 3D-printing scraps are recycled at the point of production. This research will drive a transition from a linear economy of ?print-to-landfill? to a circular economy of ?print?recycle?reprint.? To achieve this transition, novel optical recycling technologies for on-demand regeneration of 3D-printing resins are proposed. Building on recent discoveries by the research team, this project combines reversible photochemistry and nanotechnology based light delivery mechanisms to demonstrate the optical recycling of 3D-printing resins. Optically recyclable resins have potential to transform plastics processing beyond 3D printing by providing low-energy, on-demand options to regenerate chemically active polymer resins that can be reused over numerous cycles. Establishing design rules for photoresponsive polymers will further advance large-format and high-resolution patterning for applications in semiconductors, optoelectronics, and biological scaffold materials. To broaden participation in research, the PIs will recruit and train researchers from underrepresented populations including women, first-generation and low-income (FLI) students, and underrepresented minorities (URMs). Research findings will be integrated into engineering coursework, emphasizing inquiry-based approaches that will engage students in the real-world challenge of sustainable plastics manufacturing. Finally, concepts in sustainability and additive manufacturing will be explained through educational coloring book pages and ?no jargon? research highlights. Educational content will be distributed to the broader public online and at K-8 outreach events across the San Francisco Bay Area. <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this research is to reduce plastic waste from 3D printing processes by engineering reusable resins that can be printed, ?erased,? and re-printed over numerous cycles. The objective of this proposal is to engineer robust, modular mechanisms for optical recycling into polymer resins for 3D printing. Engineered resins comprise multi-arm polyethylene glycol with photoresponsive anthracene end groups (PEG-anthracene) and UV-emitting upconversion nanocapsules. PEG-anthracene undergoes reversible photocoupling reactions in response to different wavelengths of UV light; these reactions drive polymerization and depolymerization of PEG-anthracene networks. UV-emitting upconversion nanocapsules are activated by low-energy visible light that penetrates deeper into materials than UV light; these nanocapsules will deliver UV light needed to depolymerize 3D-printed materials. Aim 1 of this research plan will quantify the influence of polymer structure on photo-polymerization and depolymerization reaction kinetics using in situ dynamic rheology measurements and a reaction-diffusion model. It is hypothesized that polymers with fewer, shorter arms will be more amenable to optical recycling due to faster depolymerization into smaller components and lower solution viscosities. Aim 2 will identify the chemical principles underlying the stability of upconversion nanomaterials. Encapsulation screening studies will determine the core solvent and surface ligand requirements for robust stabilization of UV-emitting nanocapsules. Aim 3 will establish design rules to improve the modularity of optically recyclable polymer resins. The adoption of violet-activated photocoupling reactions will enable facile integration of next-generation resins into modern 3D printers. This work will leverage complementary expertise of the PIs in polymer engineering, rheology, optical nanomaterials, and additive manufacturing. Broader impacts from this research will include the development of new polymer processing and recycling technologies, research training and mentorship at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and deployment of educational and outreach content about plastic recycling and optical technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though many remote Arctic villages rely on lakes for critical ecosystem services like drinking water reserves and agricultural irrigation, these small water supplies are insufficiently monitored and their susceptibility to changing climate and land use have been minimally investigated. This study will examine what factors, including temperature and nutrient inputs, have most influenced the biological productivity and diversity of photosynthetic organisms in Arctic lakes over multi-decadal and multi-millennial timescales. A second goal of this study is to provide formal training to the doctoral student in building international collaborations between U.S. scientists and Arctic Indigenous communities. The doctoral student will foster relationships between the United States and Greenland as a foundation for a career in collaborative research that incorporates local and Indigenous knowledge for the benefit of Northern communities. <br/><br/>In response to warming in Arctic regions that outpaces global trends by four-fold, Arctic landscapes are ?greening? and ecosystems, including those within lakes, are becoming more productive. This work examines the roles of temperature shifts and changing nitrogen cycling in driving changes in algal and cyanobacterial communities in lakes. This project employs a novel methodology to assess productivity through quantifying numerous sedimentary pigments. Pigments have many strengths as proxies, including their organism class or taxonomic specificity and their ability to reflect organisms that do not produce hard macrofossils, which are particular assets for work that aims to understand trends in cyanobacterial communities. Quantifying sedimentary pigments of different organisms can both provide insight on what drives bulk primary productivity and characterize how individual groups of primary producers might respond. This research will advance the use of this underutilized methodology, which is potentially applicable in many regions where changing lacustrine algal or cyanobacterial communities and/or eutrophication are a societal concern.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hendrix College is a liberal arts college situated in central Arkansas and primarily serves students in the rural regions of the South. Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 28 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biology, biochemistry & molecular biology, chemistry, chemical physics, computer science, mathematics, and physics. Eligible first-year students will receive four-year scholarships to attend Hendrix College and pursue the STEM disciplines. In addition to receiving scholarships, students will engage closely with faculty mentors and each other in shared coursework, participate in a peer mentoring program designed to foster a sense of belonging and engagement in the sciences, receive internship and research opportunities, converse with professional scientists, and undertake a STEM-themed community project. In partnership with the Arkansas Innovation Hub, scholarship program participants will design and execute a project that addresses student-identified community challenges. Students will leverage their scientific skill sets and connections to the rural places of the South to consider how they can contribute to the innovation economy in their communities to bolster infrastructure and other scientific needs in the region. This project seeks to advance the understanding of strategies to retain talented scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians in areas of the country that most need their skill sets. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. There are four specific aims: 1) Recruit, retain, and graduate 3 cohorts of low-income students with a baccalaureate degree in the scientific disciplines, 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of a science-based community project in helping scholars develop a professional scientific identity tied to civic engagement in a rural context, 3) Expand engagement of faculty with students from underserved backgrounds, and 4) Evaluate the effectiveness of a deep teaching professional development program emphasizing growth mindset in changing faculty mindsets and approaches about teaching and mentoring. The project seeks to expand what is known about teaching and mentoring approaches that best engage students from rural and low-income backgrounds in the scientific endeavor and determine how to retain them in their local communities following training. Prior research demonstrates that faculty are major determinants of whether students from limited economic backgrounds persist in the scientific disciplines, and those that take a growth mindset about students, positively impact persistence. Deep teaching professional development is an intensive, reflective approach that can lead to overall mindset changes, but little is known about its efficacy when combined with growth mindset training. Additionally, development of a scientific identity is critical to persistence in the scientific disciplines, but few studies have addressed how to develop an identity that is tied to civic engagement in a rural context. The project will investigate how a deep teaching professional development experience designed to enhance growth mindset in faculty affects their approaches to teaching, advising, and mentoring. It will also evaluate how having a faculty mentor trained in growth mindset in the first year of matriculation impacts feelings of belonging, self-efficacy, and resilience. Finally, it will investigate how participation in a science-based community project impacts identity, self-efficacy, civic engagement, and resilience. This project has the potential to advance understanding of how to support and retain talented trained individuals in the scientific workforce in the rural areas of the country that require innovative scientific solutions. This project will be evaluated using a mixed method approach that measures growth mindset, a sense of belonging, resilience, and civic engagement. Results of this project will be made available to diverse stakeholders at multiple levels of organization on the Hendrix campus, state-wide, and nationally. Specifically, results will be disseminated to Arkansas secondary and postsecondary educators and members of state legislature to raise important issues that impact the state. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

Error correcting codes are also theoretically fundamental objects that find unexpected connections to areas like algorithms, computational complexity, and cryptography, where the applications have no apparent need for noise-resilience. Error-correcting codes have a long and rich history.

Existing additive manufacturing (AM)-based hybrid processes for 3D metal-plastic components are beset by high cost, time intensiveness, complexity, and constraints on design flexibility. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research investigating an innovative, electrically-assisted multimaterial AM approach.

Having friends is linked to better mental and physical health, longer life, and increased economic mobility. Friendship also combats loneliness, an epidemic that has been described as a defining public health concern of our time. Indeed, about 4 in 10 Americans are lonely, and therefore at risk of living shorter, less fulling lives. This project shines a light on the psychology of friendship by deploying a new theoretical framework. This framework emphasizes that friend pairs, which have been the focus of past work, live in wider social worlds, where each friend can interact with a network of other people. As a result, the challenges of finding, making, and keeping friends are more complex than one might think, and that previous research has found. These challenges might involve both simpler and well-studied two-person components (getting friends to like us) but also lesser-studied multi-person components (getting friends to like us better than they like their other friends). <br/><br/>This program of research fills major gaps in our basic understanding of how friendship works by focusing on these vital but understudied social relationships. The project has three aims. One is to identify the various challenges that people must solve to realize friendships. A second is to better describe what these complex challenges look like. These two aims support a third aim of generating new insights into how people solve these friendship challenges. This project examines friendship challenges and their solutions in a series of cross-cultural surveys, laboratory experiments, and via cutting-edge methods such as machine learning and network analysis. A science communication component helps to disseminate scientific findings and train the next generation of psychological scientists to engage with the public.

An understanding of how cells control and rearrange genetic operations, particularly during conditions of stress, could lead to efficient engineering of living organisms for applications that require robust adaptation to different environments. Ultimately, advances in the field of synthetic gene networks will allow development of novel schemes to produce chemical compounds of interest, for example. At the molecular level, some of the most sophisticated native networks that control gene behavior involve both proteins and nucleic acids. Yet, deciphering the many ways in which associated proteins and nucleic acids work together to regulate their gene targets remains largely unknown. In this project, a team of researchers use experimental and modeling tools to explore mechanisms involved in a conserved bacterial gene regulatory network that controls metabolism under nutritional stresses. The project provides research opportunities to students from low-income underrepresented communities and contributes to piloting a cross-discipline course Engineering for Change to support STEM students. <br/><br/>Developing systems for precise control of genes in biological systems continues to be paramount for advancing the synthetic biology field. Post-transcriptional regulatory networks, involving RNA-binding proteins that regulate both mRNAs and sRNAs, remain largely understudied despite expectations that they illustrate sophisticated native schemes of robust and timely control of gene expression. In this project, an interdisciplinary team of researchers, including graduate and undergraduate students, explore new suspected regulatory mechanisms used by RNA-binding proteins within a well-conserved bacterial central global carbon metabolism network. Specifically, the team combines Next Generation Sequencing, microscopy, biomolecular characterization techniques, traditional genetic in vivo methods, and computational tools to: (i) Investigate the formation of bacterial condensates as a mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation activity, and (ii) Elucidate dynamic regulatory outcomes as a consequence of regulatory binding sites alternative usage.

To enjoy the benefit of modern multicore machines, an algorithm must fit the data and auxiliary space in memory. On modern hardware, using too much space in an algorithm limits the solvable problem size on a multicore machine and may slow down the performance in practice. Consequently, designing efficient algorithms nowadays faces very different challenges from decades ago.  This CAREER project focuses on two critical challenges in parallel algorithm design and analysis: space efficiency and communication efficiency. The project will provide efficient computational models to better meet multiobjective optimization formulations, new graph algorithms and data structures with improved theoretical guarantees, as well as open-source software for the new data structures and algorithms.  This project aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, which is crucial for promoting the accessibility of parallelism to a diverse set of problems.  The educational plan comprises redesign of algorithm courses to include memory storage considerations as well as support for a coding club and coding competition designed to make computer science more accessible, particularly to the underrepresented student population reflected in the local area. <br/><br/>This project has two major thrusts. The first thrust is to study space-efficient parallel algorithms. This project will first study a simple yet effective computational model for measuring space usage of a parallel algorithm with the objective of investigating space-efficient parallel graph algorithms and data structures using auxiliary space sublinear to the input size. The second thrust is to study algorithm design on the new processing-in-memory (PIM) system, which has recently been developed to reduce the need for expensive data transfers between CPU and memory.  The algorithmic challenge here is that the PIM system is a combination of shared memory and distributed memory, so efficient algorithms on PIM must utilize advantages of each. This project will study algorithms and data structures that are efficient on the PIM architecture. The expected outcome of this project will be algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees and good practical performance, and general lessons in designing and performance engineering efficient algorithms on modern computer architectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Acidic soils with low pH are widespread globally and common in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where food security is a challenge. Aluminum (Al) toxicity, a significant abiotic stress on acidic soils, damages root systems and enhances crop susceptibility to drought and mineral deficiencies. Previous studies have shown that genes in the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family of membrane transporters play an important role in Al tolerance in sorghum and maize while others strongly implicate epigenetic variation in DNA methylation and histone modification in Al tolerance in various plant species. This project will take a multi-omics approach to identify and explore variation in Al tolerance at both the genetic and epigenetic levels, using Al tolerance as a paradigm to connect gene regulation to abiotic stress tolerance in cereals. It is expected that this project will have significant impacts for facilitating translation of findings from maize and sorghum genetics/epigenetics and genomics research to develop more effective breeding strategies targeting adaptation to broader abiotic stress conditions. With respect to training and outreach, in addition to the training of project students and postdoctoral scientists, the project will develop a module on translational genomics focusing on Al tolerance that will be included in the long-running Cereal Genomics Workshop held at Cold Spring Harbor Lab. <br/><br/>Homologous genes in the MATE family of membrane transporters play an important role in Al tolerance in sorghum (SbMATE) and maize (ZmMATE1) by mediating release of Al detoxifying citrate into the rhizosphere. Studies have shown that Al-induced expression of SbMATE is not just localized to the root apex, which is the site of Al toxicity and tolerance, but also very specifically to the epidermal and cortical cells in the distal transition zone. This project will leverage single-cell transcriptomics technologies that will provide the spatial resolution necessary to discover novel Al tolerance genes by associating epigenetic responses with cell-specific gene expression. Candidate regulatory elements will be functionally validated using gene editing and mutant analyses and Al tolerance phenotypes will be evaluated in controlled conditions and in the field on well-characterized acidic soils. All project outcomes will be made available and broadly distributed through deposition at the appropriate long-term data repositories and stock centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This lack of quantitative understanding of the mechanical and thermal behavior also adversely impacts the application and engineering of amorphous glassy polymeric materials. This award supports research to facilitate the prediction of long-term behavior of polymer glasses, and thus facilitate the design and engineering of this important class of materials in advanced composites and other applications of importance to national interests.  In addition, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in polymer physics and mechanics, modeling, and experimental methods related to polymer glasses.  At North Carolina State University, outreach will be conducted with K-12 summer camps to promote interest in STEM through a curriculum that includes teamwork, creative problem solving, and design challenges. Outreach activites at University of Nebraska Lincoln will focus on lifelong learner adults interested in expanding their understanding of math, physics, and programing.<br/><br/>The Back Stress Expansion model will be investigated in order to develop a robust, yet computationally simplified, methodology that is able to describe and predict the long-term performance of glassy polymers as a function of thermal and mechanical history, including nonlinear or large deformations.

Remarkably, organisms in nature, such as slime molds and fungi, are able to develop decentralized, coordinated networks that optimize transport better than engineers, solve mazes, detect masses at a distance, or even memorize periodic events. This approach is pivotal in addressing dynamic environmental conditions and ensuring scalability as the swarm size expands.

The XLEAP instrument will provide researchers a unique combination of x-ray techniques including 2D and 3D elemental imaging modes, oxidation state measurements, and complementary non-x-ray microscopy. Together, these new resources will enable researchers to ask and answer entirely new questions about how plants take up, transport, and use metals and micronutrients; how plants respond to environmental stimuli like bacteria, microplastics, and climate; how metals are transformed in soil degradation processes and at the soil-root interface; and how metals and micronutrients are taken up and stored in marine plant and animal life. These research questions are critical to efforts to develop nutritious and climate resilient crops, improve agricultural practices, and reduce human impacts on the environment. XLEAP will leverage a relationship with the Cornell School of Integrative Plant Sciences to engage its future user community during construction. Furthermore, a partnership between Cornell and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) will allow four UTEP graduate students to gain hands-on training in project management and cutting-edge x-ray techniques as they perform pilot projects that help commission XLEAP's capabilities.<br/><br/>XLEAP will provide a unique combination of capabilities, including (1) both high flux and high-energy-resolution submicron modes, (2) sub-micron focused x-rays from 5-30 keV, (3) >= 1 m focused x-rays from 30-70 keV, (4) an open sample area accommodating custom in-situ plant growth chambers and rhizo-boxes as well as a cryostat, (5) CHESS-developed 3D confocal micro-x-ray fluorescence (XRF), and (6) dedicated optical microscopy integrated with x-ray microscopy workflows. The facility will also include an on-site growth chamber for controlled environments during beamtime, as well as dedicated sample preparation facilities (stereomicroscope, microtome, cryo-microtome) for room-temperature and frozen hydrated tissues. XLEAP will offer XRF imaging, tomography, and confocal modes; x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in time-resolved or spatially resolved modes; and micro- x-ray diffraction (XRD) imaging. Combinations (e.g. XRF + XRD) and rapid switches between these modes (e.g. from XRF to XAS) will be important in the design and construction of the beamline. The ability to study living plants in-situ in a customized growth chamber on the beamline will enable researchers to examine genotype-phenotype relationships in non-stressed tissues. Microfocused x-rays at energies >40 keV and cutting-edge detectors with low per-pixel dwell times will minimize radiation dose and damage to living tissue, enabling study of dynamic changes in living tissues on multiple time scales. High energies will offer high-sensitivity unambiguous measurements of high-Z elements like iodine and rare earth elements.

The expansion and improvement of the OCCTIVE library will be informed by best practices in instructional video design. The videos will be supplemented with sample teaching material and other support materials that aid faculty adoption. Faculty, who will be recruited from a wide range of disciplines and institutions, will be trained to integrate OCCTIVE into their courses through in person and virtual workshops. The efficacy of the OCCTIVE library will be measured by assessing students? comprehension of computing concepts, faculty?s adoption of materials in their classes, and peer tutor experiences.

Some of their most popular applications include data clustering, resource planning, and chip design. In theoretical computer science, several broadly-applicable algorithmic and complexity theoretic tools have originated from the study of CSPs. While traditional research on CSPs assumes that the entire input is available to the algorithm, the big data boom has necessitated studying these problems in newer models of computation that are well-suited for processing very large datasets that cannot entirely fit in the algorithm?s memory. One such well-studied model of computation is the streaming model where the input to the algorithm is provided as a stream of data, and the streaming algorithm must perform all its computations using limited memory, much smaller than the size of the stream. A particular CSP of interest is the Maximum Directed Cut (Max-DICUT) problem, which has emerged as a central problem in the study of CSPs in the streaming setting. Despite significant attention, many fundamental questions about Max-DICUT and other CSPs remain unanswered in the streaming model. This project aims to tackle some of these foundational problems and provide significant insights into the capabilities and the limitations of streaming algorithms in solving CSPs. This project also provides research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through a new course in advanced algorithms that will integrate topics from these research directions. The research and course materials produced as a result will be made accessible to a general audience.<br/><br/>In terms of research directions, most previous works focused on ?single-pass? streaming algorithms, where the algorithm is allowed only one pass through the stream and the order in which the data arrives is decided by a malicious adversary. While this works as an excellent model in theory, in practice, the algorithms often have additional ?help?. For example, they may be allowed multiple passes over the input or required to perform well only on inputs drawn from a certain distribution. They may also have access to quantum bits or a machine learning oracle that can predict the rest of the stream. In such scenarios, there may be algorithms that are exponentially more space efficient than the best single-pass algorithms. This project aims to design streaming algorithms for Max-DICUT and other CSPs in such more general settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorm downbursts, and other phenomena, virtually every region of the U.S. is at risk of extreme winds. Predictions from climate models anticipate an escalation in the occurrence and severity of these hazards, underscoring the need for cost-effective design concepts to create wind-resistant buildings. The structural integrity and long-term performance of low-rise buildings and civil infrastructure are heavily influenced by atmospheric turbulence near ground level where this infrastructure exists. Yet, a solid grasp of this flow phenomenon is lacking, limiting the ability to create risk-consistent design guidance. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support research that attempts to address this knowledge gap by advancing the fundamental understanding of turbulence in densely populated environments and the associated wind loads on structures. The project will utilize a combination of wind tunnel experiments, computer simulations, and theoretical developments in fluid dynamics. Findings from this project will enable improvements in wind-resistant design standards, bolstering national welfare and prosperity. Research activities will be complemented by an educational and outreach program leveraging recent advances in virtual and augmented reality technology to enhance teaching and accessibility to engineering education. This award will contribute to the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP).<br/><br/>The specific objective of this project is twofold: the first is to characterize turbulence and fundamental mechanisms responsible for extreme wind events in urban areas under stationary and non-stationary flow conditions; the second is to derive improved analytical formulations for flow statistics that are relevant to the precise characterization of wind-loading conditions. An extensive series of wind tunnel tests and high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of flow over idealized urban environments will form the basis for the analysis. The hypothesis is that analysis of Reynolds stress budget equations combined with modern model reduction and coherent-structures identification techniques will enable the development of conceptual formulations encoding the dependency of first and higher order flow statistics onto surface morphology and flow forcing conditions. The analytical models will be derived for integration within building design codes to improve the resilience of low-rise structures, with potential long-lasting impacts on large-scale community resilience to the changing landscape of wind hazards. The project will utilize the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research infrastructure (NHERI) Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel at the University of Florida and will archive and make publicly available the project data in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-CI.org).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ULVZs are thin patches of material that sit on the Earth?s core-mantle boundary (CMB), which is at a depth of 2891 km (1796 miles).  As their name implies, ULVZs slow passing seismic waves by as much as 50%. This makes which makes them some of the most anomalous features of the Earth?s interior.  Several ULVZs are beneath some of Earth?s largest hot spot volcanoes, such as Hawaii, Iceland, and Samoa.  Imaging of the Earth?s interior shows that hot rising materials, or mantle plumes, connect these volcanoes from ULVZs to the surface.  But the origin, lifetime, size, and composition of these ULVZs are not known, nor is their role in the formation of the mantle plumes. This project will provide greater details as to where these features exist, their formation and composition. This work analyzes two types of seismic waves sensitive to thin ULVZ layering that interact with and bounce off these ULVZ features.  The study focuses on an area beneath the western Pacific Ocean because of extensive seismic data coverage and known ULVZs in the region. The project will create a new seismic database built from public records and networks in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. This database will then enable imaging of ULVZ structures at the CMB using modern statistical capabilities.  Computer simulations of mantle flow will help interpret the formation, motion, and role in mantle processes of the ULVZs.  This project includes an annual outreach STEM event for K-8 students for the local community.  This event will include activities to teach about the mantle plumes that form Pacific Islands through hot spot volcanism.<br/><br/>Ultra-Low Velocity Zones (ULVZs) are structures with strongly reduced seismic velocities at Earth?s core-mantle boundary (CMB) which have been associated with or linked to hot-spot volcanism, Large Igneous Provinces, core-mantle interaction, downwelling subduction and Large-Low Velocity Provinces (LLVPs) and thus are a critical component of global mantle dynamics. ULVZs are typically studied using waveform analysis of ULVZ-sensitive seismic probes (e.g., SPdKS, ScP, ScS), but previous studies suffer from large uncertainties in ULVZ parameters due to modeling trade-offs and lack a geophysical inference of ULVZs through rigorous parameter estimation.  This project will develop a transformative waveform inversion approach and apply it to characterize ULVZ properties including their seismic velocities, density, size, and shape. Specifically, the project will (1) collect a new database of ULVZ-sensitive ScP and PcP waveforms utilizing publicly available seismic array data as well as new data from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the International Monitoring System (IMS) arrays, (2) advance capabilities for full waveform Bayesian inversion for ULVZ properties to quantitatively distinguish regions with and without ULVZ structures (i.e., Bayesian model selection), and to perform joint inversion of ScP and PcP waveforms, (3) quantify the waveform effects from 2-D/3-D ULVZ structures, (4) search for additional, previously unlooked-for arrivals in the ScP wavefield consistent with 3-D ULVZ structure using array processing approaches, and (5) relate observed ULVZ localities and properties to lowermost mantle flow and dynamics through 3D geodynamic models.

Plant community responses are observed repeatedly in the fossil record, and could help predict future changes by measuring traits from plant fossils. Much effort has focused on the ways that leaves respond to and record environmental conditions. However, leaves depend on long-lived organs, such as stems, to enable plant function. This study will establish a new database dedicated to plant stem traits from fossil xylem to understand plant community responses to major intervals of ancient climate change. More broadly, this project will prepare a new generation of Earth scientists for this highly interdisciplinary work and expand participation in research through training and mentoring targeted towards underrepresented groups in paleontology through the creation of a paleontology and ecosystem modeling short course. <br/><br/>This project is focused on assessing water transport in the xylem of Paleozoic and Mesozoic plants as an adaptation that influenced survivorship across two major intervals of climate change: the Late Paleozoic Ice Age of the Carboniferous-Permian (~300 million years ago [Ma]) and the hothouse climate of the Triassic-Jurassic (~200 Ma). This project will focus on three specific aims: (1) establish a unified xylem fossil functional anatomy database to facilitate (2) prediction of hydraulic traits for extinct taxa and (3) integration of fossil-observed leaf and xylem traits to predict whole-plant function using a modified ecosystem process model (Paleo-BGC). Investigators will use this approach to assess extinct plant water stress and ecosystem function through periods of extreme global climate change and test the hypothesis that coordination of leaf and stem water transport traits distinguished taxa as casualties, survivors, and thrivers during floral collapse and recovery during both global cooling and warming events. This project prioritizes training a new generation of interdisciplinary Earth scientists through training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars. Additionally, a short course for underrepresented and early career scientists focused on linking paleobotany, plant physiology, and climate change will be created.

There are both central and local physiological mechanisms that operate to regulate blood flow in working muscle tissue.  Currently, there is no mechanism whereby the balance between central and local control can be assessed and optimized.   To assess these mechanisms, both cardiac and vascular function must be measured.  The proposed technology allows the combination of both sets of measures in an algorithm and testing procedure to assess cardiovascular functionality. With this information, training or treatment plans may be optimized to address the underlying limitations in achieving maximum performance.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an algorithm to assess cardiovascular function by calculating the determinants of working tissue flow during exercise.  Critical to this algorithm is the measurement of both central (neurological) and local (metabolic) control of blood flow.  This is achieved by measuring pulse arterial responses to restrictions in blood flow, using a blood pressure cuff, and to stimulation through exercise.  The proposed method assesses local dilation, autonomic constriction, and total cardiac function.  These measurements may be used to determine how well both the heart and the blood vessels are performing.  Exercise increases the output of the heart but the blood vessels in the working muscles need to relax to allow more blood to flow.  If an athlete trains to increase heart output but does not increase the ability to relax blood vessels, then they will not optimize working tissue flow and hence performance.  Using the proposed algorithm, it may be possible to tell the athlete where they are limited and how to train to improve that limitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For plants, this is compounded by declines in pollinators, which have been documented across the world. There is concern that many flowering plant species will decline alongside their pollinators because almost 90% of flowering plants rely on animal pollination to make seeds, grow new plants, and prevent extinction. Short-term, year-to-year fluctuations in pollinators and other environmental factors (like precipitation) during a longer-term decline make the challenge of identifying a true plant decline even harder. Despite the strong dependence of plants on pollinators, pollinator declines may not immediately cause plant declines, and this can prevent us from detecting the warning signs of plant extinction. For example, plants may appear to do better immediately after a pollinator decline by reinvesting energy that would have been used to make seeds into improving their survival. This project will amplify natural variation in pollination for thousands of plants, follow their fates, and use mathematical models to understand how plants persist despite year-to-year changes in pollination and other environmental factors. This project will help scientists to understand why some plant species are more at risk from pollinator declines than other species.  <br/><br/>The project will leverage 9?11 years of field-based data on plant demography and pollinator abundance to measure and experimentally impose stochastic fluctuations in pollinator abundance. Individual-based population models (integral projection models) will be parameterized with data from a long-term, ongoing field experiment in which two species of perennial plants receive different pollination treatments: (i) increased pollination, (ii) reduced pollination, and (iii) an unmanipulated control. All plants are tagged with a unique identification number and their demographic status assessed annually. Projections of the population models will demonstrate the consequences of stochasticity in pollination services for plant population dynamics. Further analyses based on model-based population projections will reveal which demographic vital rates (survival, growth, reproduction) are responsible for changes in population dynamics when pollinator abundances fluctuate, in addition to how various components of stochasticity ? the mean, variance, and autocorrelation of pollinator abundances ? affect plant population dynamics. This project will shed new light on how species interactions shape population dynamics in a stochastic world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ML, especially deep learning that uses deep neural networks, has made remarkable breakthroughs in various research domains and disciplines including computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and math, to name a few. However, in the past decade, extensive work has shown ML models are vulnerable to privacy and security attacks. For example, email spam filters can be compromised by data poisoning attacks, where attackers confuse ML models by feeding them bogus data, allowing adversaries to send malicious emails containing malware or other security threats without being noticed. Attackers can also make repeated requests to models, looking at the results in order to reconstruct the data used to build ML models; in health domains, for instance, successful data reconstruction attacks might expose private medical details about patients. Many defense methods have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, but they face several limitations: they often aren?t effective in real-world applications with strict confidentiality requirements, or unacceptably degrade the performance of the models. Further, most defenses are aimed at particular learning methods or attack types, making it hard to deal with multiple concurrent attacks, and generalizing poorly to different types of models and data. This project?s goal is to address these limitations by designing a trustworthy learning framework based on information theory. The outcomes of the project will advance the state-of-the-art trustworthy ML and information-theoretic approaches to privacy, while contributing to the growing national need for professionals in ML and cybersecurity.<br/><br/>To do this, the team will design a practical, accurate, flexible, and generalizable information-theoretic trustworthy representation learning framework with robustness and privacy guarantees. The work will be structured around three thrusts. Thrust 1 will design novel information-theoretic representation learning methods against common privacy attacks, including membership inference, property inference, and data reconstruction attacks. Thrust 2 will design novel information-theoretic representation learning methods against common security attacks, including test-time evasion attacks, training-time poisoning attacks, and training- and test-time backdoor attacks. Thrust 3 will generalize Thrust 1 and Thrust 2 to handle diverse attack types (e.g., multiple privacy/security attacks or their combination), data types (e.g., spatial-temporal data, multimodal data), and learning types (e.g., federated learning, graph learning, self-supervised learning).

Dike ascent is often accompanied by small earthquakes and deformation of the ground surface which can be detected by ground-based, and in some cases space-based sensors. Not all dikes lead to eruptions; in some cases, they stall and the magma solidifies without erupting. To properly interpret seismic and deformation signals and provide societally-relevant eruption warnings, we must understand the physical and chemical processes that control how rapidly dikes ascend, the paths they take, and whether or not they make it to the surface. These processes include resistance and motion of the solid rock outside the dike, the flow of magma within the dike, fracture of the crust at the dike tip, and possible solidification of the magma as it cools during its journey toward the surface - all of which are interdependent. Segall, Lew, and their team will use sophisticated computational techniques together with ground deformation and earthquake data to model dike ascent in Hawaii, and to develop guidelines for using such data to forecast eruptions in Hawaii and at similar volcanoes worldwide.  This research will address one of the Grand Challenges in the National Academies ERUPT report to advance physics-based eruption forecasting. Accurate, high-fidelity models of dike propagation are key to understanding precursors to many eruptions and will ultimately facilitate forecasting at volcano observatories worldwide.<br/><br/>This project will leverage advances in computational methods that allow the numerical grid to adapt to the changing shape of the dike as it grows. These and other advances will allow them to address: the conditions (magma viscosity, background temperature gradient, reservoir pressure, volume, and compressibility) that permit a dike to reach the earth's surface; the time-dependent surface deformations and  seismicity-inducing stress perturbations that could be used in physics-based  eruption forecasting; and the factors that determine whether deep dikes are focused toward or bypass crustal reservoirs. Computed dike ascent histories and predicted surface deformation will be compared to observations of deformation and seismicity that precedes some eruptions, as well as with laboratory analog experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the study is to contribute to an understanding of how scientific evidence informs policymaking. The study focuses on meta-analysis, an increasingly authoritative form of evidence in which individual research studies are synthesized in a way that is said to facilitate scientific consensus but in doing so introduces new forms of uncertainty. For surgeons, the general conclusions of meta-analysis may be difficult to reconcile with the individual needs of patients; for policy makers, meta-analysis may back an intervention that worked at the sites where it was studied but is not compatible with the needs of their constituents; and for judges, meta-analysis may conflict with the court's adversarial process and written standards of evidence. By comparing these three cases, this research will contribute to a general understanding of how the organizational constraints, agendas, and values of these actors impacts how they interpret ambiguous evidence. The findings of this research may contribute to reforms in the way that decision makers in various domains evaluate scientific evidence in contentious debates.<br/><br/>To study these cases, the researcher will interview policy makers and surgeons, and analyze archival documents, such as court transcripts. The use of mixed methods will permit an understanding of the social and historical context in which meta-analysis becomes a useful, if fraught, form of evidence in each of these domains. The intellectual merit of this project is that it takes up a classic question in science and technology studies, how scientists and their audiences manage epistemic uncertainty, in the light of a powerful new form of evidence across three heterogenous domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, little is known with regards to how neural circuits reconcile competing signals that drive opposing behavioral responses; therefore, investigating how neural circuits integrate and/or reconcile opposing response circuits could lead to the discovery of new and exciting learning processes. To observe how neural circuits accomplish this signal integration, this project utilizes a learning assay in a nematode, previously described by the primary investigator. For this learning protocol, two stimuli that each drive an innate, opposing locomotor response (i.e., forward vs backward locomotion) are paired. This pairing does not augment the later response to a single stimulus, but rather results in a novel response outcome, a cessation of locomotion; thus, the innate responses activated by these stimuli qualitatively impact the conditioned response. This learned response stabilizes over minutes and may involve modulation from neurons that are downstream from the interneurons where signal integration likely occurs (e.g., motor neurons). This award supports collaborations between the primary investigator and two faculty partners to pursue multiple avenues of investigation. Through these collaborations, the primary investigator will gain access and expand her skill set to include state of the art genetic tools as well as advanced microscopy techniques that will allow for observing activation of single neurons either during stimulus pairing in behaving animals or following stimulus pairing in immobilized animals, targeted activation of single synapses or subset of synapses predicted to be involved, and behavioral analysis of mutant strains to investigate the possible role of the neuron-supporting glial cells in forming the learned response. This project will provide meaningful research opportunities to a number of undergraduates in the primary investigator?s laboratory and in a course-based undergraduate experience (CURE) lab course. By establishing these techniques at the primary investigator?s home institution, this project will expand the available tools for scientific enterprise. <br/><br/>This project combines modern genetic tools and imaging approaches to visualize the dynamics in neuron activity and uncover cellular mechanisms involved in neural circuit signal integration and learning in C. elegans. To identify neurons activated during and after pairing of opposing locomotor response neural circuits, fluorescence from the NeuroPAL unique neuron marker will be captured simultaneously with GcAMP (a genetically-encoded calcium indicator) fluorescence. Strains of C. elegans that express light-sensitive ion channels genetically targeted to specific neurons will be employed to activate/deactivate targeted circuits during paired signal presentation. To target a single synapse or set of synapses involved in circuit integration, this project will combine optogenetics with patterned point illumination and super resolution/FLIM confocal microscopy. Finally, using targeted mutations the potential role of glial cells in facilitating learning following this stimulus pairing will be explored. This project has the potential to reveal a new understanding for how individual neurons, circuits, and/or glia participate in integrating simultaneous opposing response signals and how this experience alters an organisms? behavior. This award affords the principal investigator supported time to learn these genetic and microscopy approaches and incorporate these skills into her laboratory?s research program and lab courses, providing undergraduates with a meaningful research experience and the opportunity to work with a female primary investigator who is an underrepresented minority in science. Faculty at the primary investigator?s home institution will benefit from the expanded local tools available from the introduction of these modern techniques. These approaches will also be disseminated to other Neuroscience faculty at undergraduate institutions through a workshop at the next Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience Conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This gives the system  flexibility to adapt to different situations and perform new tasks, and resilience since modules are interchangeable and faulty parts can be replaced via reconfiguration. Shape reconfiguration, however, remains one of the biggest algorithmic challenges in the field. Such problems have captivated the interest of the theoretical computer science community, evidenced by a growing body of work in the topic. While some practical approaches in the literature are not proven to find a reconfiguration in every scenario, efficient algorithms proposed by the theoretical community operate in non-realistic mathematical models. This project focuses on obtaining new algorithms and adapting existing ones to more realistic models, advancing the state-of-the-art in the area.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award will provide a unifying framework to categorize the different models that exist in the literature due to the different hardware constraints and approaches. Within this framework, known techniques will be adapted to new models, and new algorithms will be developed. Since reconfiguration problems are known to be computationally hard in some models, approximation algorithms will be studied. In the field of reconfiguration, approximation algorithms are relatively unexplored, thus, such results will interest the broader theoretical community. The fields of Programmable Matter and Reconfigurable Robotics are intrinsically multidisciplinary, aggregating efforts in computer science, robotics, mechanical and electrical engineering, material sciences among others.

This, in turn, is expected to increase the retention and successful graduation rates of these students. The disciplines of engineering and computer science in general, and the UCSB CoE specifically, disproportionately struggle to retain students from these communities. The Integrated Networking, Scholarship, and Peer Mentoring of Freshmen Engineers for Increased Academic Success and Graduation Rates (INSPIRE) project will create new infrastructure and institutional change to fundamentally transform how students with one or more ""effectors of opportunity"" experience the first year of engineering. INSPIRE will consist of a year-long, seminar-based curriculum that holistically inter-weaves academic and social curriculum and peer mentoring. By increasing the successful retention and graduation rates of targeted students, INSPIRE will educate and develop a new generation of diverse engineering and computer science graduates. These individuals will have the opportunity to pursue graduate degrees and/or join the workforce, where they can be role models who help hire and train future engineering and computer science talent.<br/><br/>This project will focus its educational research on assessing how the proposed holistic approach changes (if at all) students? internal narrative around success and failure, intrinsic motivation to persist in their discipline, and use of social support networks. This research will contribute new knowledge in peer mentoring and first-year retention by analyzing the differential effects of INSPIRE on retention and social identification, social capital, and social learning. A key outcome is to have a systematic approach to identifying the needs of stake-holders including faculty, undergraduate students, graduate students, and administrative support for retention to bring about institutional change. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs.

Achieving and sustaining net-zero emissions requires advanced materials and methods for long-term sequestration of anthropogenic CO2. The production of concrete materials through binder carbonation has the potential to consume approximately one billion tons of CO2 annually. The application of carbonated concrete materials can also largely reduce CO2 emissions from the production of ordinary portland cement. Despite the major technological developments related to carbonated concrete materials in recent decades, the expanded use of these eco-friendly materials in structural and non-structural applications depends on addressing the chemical, physical, and processing related barriers. This research will focus on micro-engineering the carbonation process using sustainable performance-enhancing additives that will be exploited to design a range of microstructures for the carbonated concrete materials. It will attempt to design next-generation high-performance carbon-sink concrete with superior mechanical and durability properties to satisfy or surpass performance requirements for building and infrastructure applications in different geographic regions. The educational objectives of this work will complement the research goals by advancing knowledge on climate change and the importance of sustainable construction practices in Philadelphia high schools and colleges, as well as in the professional community by developing Sustainable Infrastructure Workshops, Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Team Competitions, and Sustainable Concrete Seminars. The education plan aims to enhance the diversity of the STEM workforce through strategic targeting and recruiting of underrepresented students.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of this research is to micro-engineer the carbonation process using hybrid polymers that can perform multiple functions: (i) serve as internal CO2 sources to extend the process; (ii) regulate local pH to sustain the precipitation of carbonates; and (iii) serve as carbonate nucleation/growth sites to alter the kinetics and products of the process. The multi-functional hybrid polymers will be exploited to design a range of microstructures to link microstructure characteristics to the physical properties of carbonated materials.

Label-free microscopy stands out for its ability to investigate living systems by capitalizing on the inherent optical signatures of cells. This eliminates the need for staining agents, thereby preserving the natural state of biological specimens and enabling an authentic representation of dynamic cellular processes. However, the reach of current label-free techniques is hindered by a fundamental compromise between molecular sensitivity, specificity, and imaging depth. The objective of this CAREER proposal is to overcome these barriers through the development of innovative light sources, excitation methods, and algorithmic reconstruction techniques. This project will develop new fiber optic sources and imaging platforms tailored for intrinsic contrast extraction from deep within living tissues, mitigating perturbation and enhancing molecular contrast. Such advancements promise to enable breakthroughs across physics, biology, and biomedical engineering, with direct implications for the real-time exploration and diagnosis of diseases in their native environments. In addition, this project will leverage existing outreach programs at MIT to provide K-12 students and teachers with access to the micro-world and understanding of the working principles of imaging by developing LEGO-based microscope modules. The education and outreach program are designed to spark curiosity and deepen STEM literacy among students from diverse backgrounds, with particular emphasis on engaging groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. By connecting research with education, this project aims to not only expand the frontiers of label-free imaging but also to cultivate a more inclusive and well-rounded future scientific community.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER proposal is to establish a research program focusing on advanced label-free imaging technologies, with the potential to enhance disease diagnosis and therapeutic assessment. Current gold-standard methods for evaluating cellular metabolism and tissue changes, including histochemistry, fluorescent antibody tags, and genetically encoded imaging probes, are fundamentally limited by their necessity to physically, chemically, or genetically alter the biosystems. Label-free nonlinear microscopy circumvents these limitations by harnessing intrinsic molecular contrast within the tissue, offering real-time metabolic and structural imaging of living tissue without modifications. However, the reach of current label-free techniques is hindered by a fundamental compromise between molecular sensitivity, specificity, and imaging depth.  This project seeks to enable transformative capabilities in label-free imaging through innovations in visible-to-SWIR (short-wavelength infrared) light generation and shaping, with three directions: (1) pioneer a high-peak-power, tunable, visible-to-SWIR fiber source for deep-tissue label-free multiplex imaging; (2) leverage ultrabroadband spectral shaping solutions; (3) optimize excitation and reconstruction for high-throughput hyperspectral label-free imaging. Achieving these imaging capabilities will represent a major milestone in our long-term effort of delivering label-free imaging technologies that rival or surpass the capabilities of label-based imaging, thereby advancing our characterization and understanding of dynamic biological processes with minimal perturbation and immediate clinical translation potential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One major source of ?hidden? diversity may be the many mites, nematodes, fungi, and protist symbionts that live inside insects. Such organisms are known to have associations with insects but detecting their presence and quantifying their diversity pose major challenges. This is a potentially massive oversight toward an understanding of global species diversity: if insect-associated symbionts are also often specialized on just one or a few species of insect, this would imply the existence of millions of undescribed and uncounted species, requiring a revision of global species richness estimates. This research will lead to the development of new methods to reveal the eukaryotic symbionts living inside insects. It will also apply those methods to the most ambitious surveys of insect-symbiont diversity to date, spanning two natural insect communities in two different habitats. The research will be integrated into public events in Iowa and Ohio where participants will learn about biodiversity and participate in sampling insects to be used in the research. A major theme will be how much diversity may be hiding even in our own backyards.

As a result, there is an urgent need for the development of more stress-resilient crop plants through breeding to safeguard our future food security. A critical component of plant stress defense pathways is the epigenome which is a critical regulatory layer of various structural features that control the interpretation of the genetic information in an environmental cue-dependent manner. The architects responsible for shaping the dynamic plant epigenome are DNA-binding proteins, commonly known as transcription factors. They act as pivotal recruitment platforms for protein complexes capable of altering the structure of the epigenome. This project will use a newly developed high-throughput epigenome profiling platform to investigate the role of the master MYC-type helix-loop-helix transcription factor MYC2 in shaping the environmentally-responsive epigenome. Since MYC2 controls a major branch of the plant defense network, it is anticipated that a better understanding of its function will provide significant new insight with the potential to advance the development of resilient crops for U.S. agriculture. The newly developed platform will be made available to other researchers in the field thereby broadly impacting plant science research. Equally important to improve breeding efforts is training the next generation of scientists and introducing them to genomics-enabled research. This opportunity will be facilitated through the Epigenome Explorer course, where students can dive into the study of dynamic plant epigenomes and uncover thrilling new information. <br/><br/>Harnessing the regulatory capabilities of master transcription factors to engineer plants with enhanced stress resilience holds great promise mitigating the negative impact of the current climate crisis. Plant immune responses against herbivorous insects and fungi are controlled by the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway with MYC2 as its master regulator. Perception of the defense hormone JA directly controls the composition and consequently the functional output of the MYC2-centric JA-responsive epigenome which comprises MYC2, various transcriptional co-activators/repressors, and chromatin regulators. Despite its significant regulatory importance, the dynamic nature and the functional repertoire of this regulatory module remains poorly understood. The goal of this project will shed light on how MYC2 establishes the JA-responsive epigenome in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. By utilizing the newly developed PHILO (Plant HIgh-throughput LOw input) ChIP-seq platform, the MYC2-centric JA-responsive epigenome will be comprehensively investigated with an emphasis on JA-induced enhancer regions. CRISPR/Cas9-facilated cis-regulatory variation will also be utilized to reveal general principles of the MYC2 module during active JA signaling. Moreover, by perturbing the JA-responsive epigenome with elevated temperature, an unexplored but immensely important crosstalk between a plant immune pathway and the thermomorphogenesis pathway will be studied. Taken together, the knowledge gained on how the JA-responsive epigenome is established and how it can be manipulated will pave the way for the creation of new plant varieties to enhance plant resilience to stresses.

Having greater affective reactivity is associated with poor outcomes including worse well-being, higher risks of mental and physical health problems, and dying earlier. This project investigates whether and how experiences during childhood, such as experiencing maltreatment and stress or receiving high quality parenting, predict daily affective reactivity to stress in adulthood. This project also investigates how the use of coping strategies in adulthood, such as seeking support, exercising, or using drugs or alcohol, might change or explain the links between childhood experiences and daily affective reactivity to stress in adulthood.

Now, with participants at age 50, this project has them complete 14 daily surveys reflecting on the stressful events that occur each day and how they respond in terms of positive and negative affect, support seeking, substance use, and exercise. These data are used to test whether early experiences predict daily affective reactivity to stress by looking at measures of maltreatment, life stress, and maternal sensitivity that were collected during the participants? infancy and childhood. Two competing theoretical models of how early experiences shape adult stress reactivity are tested. The stress sensitization model proposes that adverse early experiences lead to greater reactivity to stressors in adulthood, with positive early experiences having protective effects. The stress inoculation model proposes that individuals with very high or very low early adversity will be more reactive to stress in adulthood, and individuals who experience moderate early adversity will be less reactive to stress. Detailed analyses of moderation and mediation effects determine whether tendencies to engage in support seeking, exercise, and substance use in response to stress change or explain links between early experiences and daily affective reactivity to stress. Results are shared with intervention and policy organizations to encourage application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key tool in quantum computing, known as discrete quantum walks, can be used to build quantum circuits and model a number of quantum algorithms including Grover's search. While advantages of discrete quantum walks become clear through numerical evidence, a unified, graph-theoretical framework that allows researchers to prove these advantages is missing. To bridge the gap, this project addresses the following question: how is the behavior of a discrete quantum walk determined by the combinatorial properties of the underlying graph? Answers to this question will help pinpoint graphs on which discrete quantum walks exhibit advantages, and ultimately lead to new constructions of quantum-walk-based algorithms. Broader impacts of this project include quantum-inspired transformations in AI technology, biomedical research, climate science, optimization, financial modelling, and training of a diverse workforce in quantum science and technology.<br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to prove (or disprove) certain phenomena in discrete quantum walks using graph theory and algebra. Prior work by the investigator has revealed spectral relations between the transition matrix of a discrete quantum walk and the incidence matrices of various combinatorial structures. Built upon these relations, this project will (1) offer characterizations of graphs that are ""spectrally nice"" to enable desired quantum phenomena, such as high-fidelity state transfer and uniform mixing, (2) establish connections between discrete quantum walks and continuous quantum walks, which are physically different but share transferable mathematical machinery, and (3) identify test cases for discrete-quantum-walk approaches to hard combinatorial problems, thereby assessing their effectiveness. Outcomes of this project will not only advance scientific understanding of quantum walks, but also enrich educational experience by incorporating these findings into future quantum computing courses and engaging students in mentoring activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For plants, this is compounded by declines in pollinators, which have been documented across the world. There is concern that many flowering plant species will decline alongside their pollinators because almost 90% of flowering plants rely on animal pollination to make seeds, grow new plants, and prevent extinction. Short-term, year-to-year fluctuations in pollinators and other environmental factors (like precipitation) during a longer-term decline make the challenge of identifying a true plant decline even harder. Despite the strong dependence of plants on pollinators, pollinator declines may not immediately cause plant declines, and this can prevent us from detecting the warning signs of plant extinction. For example, plants may appear to do better immediately after a pollinator decline by reinvesting energy that would have been used to make seeds into improving their survival. This project will amplify natural variation in pollination for thousands of plants, follow their fates, and use mathematical models to understand how plants persist despite year-to-year changes in pollination and other environmental factors. This project will help scientists to understand why some plant species are more at risk from pollinator declines than other species.  <br/><br/>The project will leverage 9?11 years of field-based data on plant demography and pollinator abundance to measure and experimentally impose stochastic fluctuations in pollinator abundance. Individual-based population models (integral projection models) will be parameterized with data from a long-term, ongoing field experiment in which two species of perennial plants receive different pollination treatments: (i) increased pollination, (ii) reduced pollination, and (iii) an unmanipulated control. All plants are tagged with a unique identification number and their demographic status assessed annually. Projections of the population models will demonstrate the consequences of stochasticity in pollination services for plant population dynamics. Further analyses based on model-based population projections will reveal which demographic vital rates (survival, growth, reproduction) are responsible for changes in population dynamics when pollinator abundances fluctuate, in addition to how various components of stochasticity ? the mean, variance, and autocorrelation of pollinator abundances ? affect plant population dynamics. This project will shed new light on how species interactions shape population dynamics in a stochastic world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Effective management of invasive species requires that scientists understand how they compete successfully with native species. One of the least understood behaviors of invasive plants is that a single invasive species can dominate in many different types of environments. In particular, scientists have identified a group of ?superinvaders? that, counter to what is expected for native species, can grow very fast in sunlight but also tolerate heavy shade in the forest understory. Although there is good evidence that this behavior drives their increasing abundance in both temperate and tropical forests, scientists don?t understand how this occurs: why should invasive species play by different rules than native species in the same environment? One hypothesis is that invasive species have fewer pests than native species, and this advantage allows them to persist in stressful environments. In this project, ecologists will experimentally test this idea in many different types of forests to determine how this ?superinvader? behavior emerges. Moreover, by linking how plants simultaneously respond to pests and environmental stress, scientists will better understand how species coexist to foster native biodiversity.

In recent years, these forests have been affected by an increase in fires, caused in part by warmer summers and less snow in the spring. These fires emit large amounts of smoke which can be blown by winds northward to the Arctic. Once this smoke gets to the Arctic, it can both cool the climate by reflecting sunlight, but also warm it (if the smoke is nearer the surface, or if the small smoke particles reach the ice and snow on the surface, as they can darken it and absorb more sunlight). As we expect temperatures to continue to warm everywhere on the planet, it is likely that large boreal fires will continue and even become more common. We plan to study the impact that the smoke may have on Arctic climate and sea ice using climate models. In the past, these climate models have not taken into consideration an increase in these boreal fires, and our work will help us determine if this is an important process to get right for understanding future changes in Arctic climate and sea ice. As we prepare for the next generation of climate models that help inform the United Nations? panel on climate change, our results will also help highlight the importance boreal forest fires may have for climate change in the Arctic.<br/><br/>Biomass burning from boreal forest fires can impact Arctic climate and sea ice via the atmospheric transport of aerosols, particularly black carbon, from source regions into the Arctic. While in the atmosphere, aerosols can have either a positive (warming) or negative (cooling) radiative forcing, depending on their elevation. Black carbon can also be deposited onto the sea ice or snow at the surface, where it has a positive radiative forcing because it darkens it and absorbs more sunlight. While fully coupled climate models simulate these processes, the amount of biomass burning is prescribed as a set forcing. In the most recent set of climate model runs that help inform the United Nations? panel on climate change, simulations from 2015 to 2100 used fixed projections of boreal biomass burning emissions that did not anticipate an increase in forest fires. However, in the real world we have observed a dramatic increase in boreal biomass burning over the last 10 years, in part due to warmer summers and reduced spring snow cover (which itself is driven by warmer springs), and the emissions of black carbon are already more than double what the climate models used over 2015-2100. We plan to study the impact that an increase in boreal biomass burning has on Arctic climate and sea ice by running climate model simulations that prescribe an increase in aerosol emissions based on the recent observed growth in these fires. We also plan to study the impact that wind patterns have on the transport of smoke from boreal forest fires, as it is known that certain weather patterns can promote the likelihood of forest fires. This coupled interaction between weather and fires is currently missing in climate models, and our work will help us determine how important winds, in addition to the amount, severity and seasonality of fires are in determining how much black carbon is transported into the Arctic. Our results will serve to inform stakeholders of the importance of boreal forests for Arctic climate in the coming decades. As the community prepares for the next round of climate model simulations, our results will help inform the modeling community on the importance of both increasing boreal forest fires and the interaction of fires and winds on Arctic climate and sea ice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve optimal productivity, the different parts of the plant, and the plant as a whole, must rapidly acclimate to fluctuating changes in environmental conditions (e.g., changes in light intensity, temperature, humidity, the presence of pathogens, etc.). Because in nature, or under field conditions, not all parts of the plant are simultaneously subjected to the same environmental conditions, plants evolved the ability to rapidly transmit cell-to-cell signals from one part to another, optimizing their overall photosynthetic activity, growth, and productivity. This ability is termed ?systemic signaling?. A novel live imaging method to detect rapid systemic signals within and between different parts of the same plant (i.e., cell-to-cell) and/or between different plants living in a community (i.e., plant-to-plant) was recently developed. This new method will be used to study different key regulators of rapid systemic signaling within and between different plants and characterize the molecular mechanisms that integrate them. Findings from this research will enable the development of future crop plants with enhanced resilience to global warming, preventing yield losses that are estimated at billions of dollars annually to the US economy. In addition, this research will be disseminated to the public through YouTube videos, radio programs at a local public radio station, outreach activities at the University of Missouri farm, as well as mentored research experiences for undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>Stress-induced systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation play a pivotal role in plant resilience to abiotic stress. A novel imaging method that enables the measuring of rapid whole-plant systemic signals (reactive oxygen species, redox, calcium, and electric) in living plants grown in soil was recently developed. This method was used in previous studies to identify several important regulators of rapid systemic cell-to-cell signaling in plants, as well as to discover aboveground plant-to-plant systemic signaling. However, the mode of integration and hierarchy of systemic cell-to-cell and plant-to-plant signals is currently unknown. Using the newly developed imaging method, the hierarchy, mode of integration, and tissue specificity of different rapid systemic cell-to-cell and plant-to-plant signals triggered by a local application of excess light stress or wounding will be determined. In addition, the type of information being transferred during plant-to-plant signaling in response to excess light stress or wounding, and the protein complexes at the plasma membrane that integrate systemic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and redox signaling will be identified and studied. Results obtained from this study could lead to the development of novel approaches to enhance the resilience of crops to different stresses associated with global warming, as well as to the identification of key multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane that link reactive oxygen species, redox, and calcium signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its deformation under external forces depends on the extent and speed of loading. Rapid deformation of the brain during events such as blasts and automotive crashes can cause traumatic brain injury. Understanding the mechanical behavior of the human brain under such extreme conditions is critical to developing computer models for predicting brain injury. This knowledge is also needed to design safer personal protective equipment and brain injury management and prevention strategies. Unfortunately, the current understanding of the mechanical behavior of living humans' brains is restricted to small deformations and a narrow range of loading rates that do not represent the full spectrum of injury-causing conditions. This award supports fundamental research combining high-rate mechanical testing, analytical and computational modeling, and machine learning to generate insights into how the living human brain responds to large and rapid loading.

This project will lead to new courses and involve contributions from underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to understand the high strain rate mechanics of the brain in its native biophysical environment. The first stage will focus on tissue responses under small deformations and dynamic strain rates. Wide-band Magnetic Resonance Elastography experiments will be conducted on brain tissue specimens from multiple brain regions to develop linear viscoelastic constitutive models. Multi-fidelity models will be developed to fuse the observed responses with available narrow-band in vivo brain tissue responses for predicting linear viscoelastic properties of the in vivo brain tissue in a wide range of loading frequencies.

At the ocean interface, surface waves and their resulting dynamics regulate the transfers of momentum and scalars between the atmosphere and ocean and are thus fundamental in shaping the sea states and weather patterns, exerting a direct impact on many aspects of human life. Although we know surface waves must be fully integrated into weather and climate forecast models, we do not yet fully understand the fundamental processes that couple the surface waves with turbulent flows above and below the ocean surface. A better understanding of wind stress modulations by surface waves is required to reduce uncertainties and develop accurate predictive models. This project aims at advancing the current understanding of wind stress over ocean waves using combined high-resolution imaging and numerical simulations. The outcome of this work will result in tangible broader impacts and societal benefits beyond the scientific community. It will incorporate findings into educational materials for a comprehensive three-day air-sea interaction workshop.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will integrate laboratory measurements of wind-wave interactions with a high-fidelity digital twin model of the laboratory system to develop a data-driven model for sea-surface drag. The specific objectives of the project are to (1) understand skin friction modulations induced by surface waves, (2) evaluate pressure drag through a high-fidelity digital twin model, and (3) develop a sea-state-dependent total surface drag parameterization. Laboratory measurements will provide an accurate description of surface skin friction drag but fall short when it comes to pressure forces. The digital twin model will augment the experimental setup by providing pressure forces. This integrated approach will provide unique insight into wave-induced modulations of the total wind stress (sum of tangential and pressure stresses at the air-water interface) under a range of wind-wave conditions. A data-driven sea-state-dependent surface flux parameterization will be developed by examining these modulations, leveraging recent advancements in machine learning technology. The model will be tailored for large-eddy simulations of wind over ocean wavefields in strongly forced conditions. This approach is expected to significantly advance the fundamental understanding of air-sea fluxes and lead to improved parameterizations of wind stress over the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cybersecurity education, involving complex tools and varied threat scenarios, requires a tailored, progressive learning approach to effectively cater to different skill levels. This project develops Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for cybersecurity education using large language models (LLMs) augmented with a Security Knowledge Graph (AISecKG) to improve cybersecurity education. The project aims to (1) establish interactive teaching methods and design flexible and tailored learning strategies to suit the diverse needs of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students; and (2) enhance cybersecurity education in STEM by offering self-paced learning, personalized support, and extensive cybersecurity resources, with the assistance of generative AI, making it more accessible to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This project introduces a novel, interdisciplinary approach to cybersecurity education. First, LLMs and cybersecurity knowledge graphs will be utilized to create interactive tools. These tools, such as chatbots, are designed for contextual learning and simulating cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity and AI experts will collaborate to design, validate, and tailor the cybersecurity content to cater to students at various learning stages.  Leveraging LLMs and security knowledge graphs, the content will be regularly updated to reflect the latest cybersecurity trends and advancements. The interactive educational tools will engage the students with adaptive learning experiences, thereby improving accessibility and effectiveness of cybersecurity education. The AI and education experts will collaborate and use an AI-embedded metric system to assess students' cognitive engagement and measure the outcomes of their learning. This project will be structured as follows: (a) Develop a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum focused on desired learning outcomes; (b) Develop evidence-based teaching modules within the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) learning framework for PBL cybersecurity education to emphasize student cognitive engagement in learning tasks, enhance student self-efficacy for navigating uncertain problems, and promote student learning outcomes; (c) Integrate learning and assessment modules with predictive analytics to identify the students at risk and provide appropriate and timely support for early intervention. Students' data security, privacy, and transparency will be ensured by designing ethical and explainable frameworks and responsible use of AI technologies in cybersecurity education.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collectively, those products amount to over $100B scale and produce hundreds of megatons CO2-equivalent of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The project focuses on the discovery and design of improved catalysts for these reactions, which translates to improvements in process efficiency, more favorable economics, and reduction in GHG emissions. Recently, single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have shown great promise for a number of reactions; however, conventional SAAs?which consist of one metal doped as isolated atoms into a second metal?comprise a fairly small design space, which limits our ability to tailor them for a given reaction. The project will address this limitation by employing computational and machine learning tools to theoretically screen alloy-host SAAs to identify stable and active catalysts for oxidation and alkane conversion reactions.  The most promising candidates will be synthesized, characterized, and tested experimentally, thus avoiding tedious trial-and-error catalyst design, and opening the door to widespread application of alloy-host SAAs across a broad range of chemical reactions. Educational benefits include the development of learning modules that will enhance the technical writing skills of engineering students.  <br/><br/>In this project, machine learning and density functional theory will be used to screen alloy-host SAAs to identify stable and active catalysts for oxidation and alkane conversion reactions. This will be followed by collaborative surface-science studies with well-defined materials, and finally translation of the most promising candidates to nanoparticle catalysts. Notably, alloy-host SAAs can give both facile activation of reactants and weak binding of downstream intermediates; this desirable combination of properties is not achievable by many traditional metal catalysts. Therefore, developing and applying effective design strategies for achieving both attributes, as well as stability, can aid in developing improved catalysts for a wide variety of different reactions. The learning modules that will be developed for technical writing are critical because many surveys of engineering employers have clearly shown that technical communications skills (including technical writing) are lacking in recent engineering graduates. In particular, the modules will provide multiple levels and sources of feedback on drafts of technical writing, leveraging well-established principles from research on skill improvement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its deformation under external forces depends on the extent and speed of loading. Rapid deformation of the brain during events such as blasts and automotive crashes can cause traumatic brain injury. Understanding the mechanical behavior of the human brain under such extreme conditions is critical to developing computer models for predicting brain injury. This knowledge is also needed to design safer personal protective equipment and brain injury management and prevention strategies. Unfortunately, the current understanding of the mechanical behavior of living humans' brains is restricted to small deformations and a narrow range of loading rates that do not represent the full spectrum of injury-causing conditions. This award supports fundamental research combining high-rate mechanical testing, analytical and computational modeling, and machine learning to generate insights into how the living human brain responds to large and rapid loading. Results from this research will positively impact U.S. national health and welfare and will contribute to the fields of tissue mechanics, traumatic brain injury, and machine learning. This project will lead to new courses and involve contributions from underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to understand the high strain rate mechanics of the brain in its native biophysical environment. The first stage will focus on tissue responses under small deformations and dynamic strain rates. Wide-band Magnetic Resonance Elastography experiments will be conducted on brain tissue specimens from multiple brain regions to develop linear viscoelastic constitutive models. Multi-fidelity models will be developed to fuse the observed responses with available narrow-band in vivo brain tissue responses for predicting linear viscoelastic properties of the in vivo brain tissue in a wide range of loading frequencies. The second stage will focus on tissue responses under large deformations and extreme strain rates. Quasi-static and dynamic mechanical testing will be conducted to develop visco-hyperelastic constitutive models. Physics-informed multi-fidelity models will be developed to fuse the ex vivo visco-hyperelastic responses with the in vivo linear viscoelastic responses characterized in the previous stage. This study will significantly advance our understanding of brain biomechanics by generating insights into the relationship between in vivo and ex vivo tissue mechanics and the first-ever full-field maps of the living brain?s mechanical properties applicable under extreme loading conditions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(DDT) which utilizes human-centered data to improve community resilience. The DDT will capture the evolution of a disaster and its impacts to humans, creating an approximate replica in the cyberworld through sensing, computing, and communication. Given that disasters have a disproportionate impact on older adults (across disasters in Japan and the US, nearly 75% of mortality and morbidity burdens are among those over the age of 65), this project will focus on older adults as the key population with personalized care needs in a disaster. The US-Japan team will design tools to create ?Virtual Disaster City?

As data are continuously updated, so are the models executing within the VDC ? as changes occur, new predictions and recommendations will help drive disaster management decisions.<br/><br/>Specific research tasks of this collaborative US-Japan project include: 1) stakeholder workshops to understand the older adult disaster resilience landscape; 2) integrate diverse data sources (geospatial and human-centric) into a novel data architecture, that supports enrichment and harmonization/alignment of multiresolution spatiotemporal data; 3) execute physics-driven hazard simulations developed by experts in the US/Japan team using the integrated data; and 4) simulate disaster processes and consequences in VDC with target older adult population and relevant hazards on the US West Coast and Tohoku region in Japan to explore optimality of response decisions/policies. The disaster digital twin framework and tools developed will build upon existing, tested technologies by PIs at both countries: multi-agent disaster simulation framework developed in Japan, and he CAREDEX data exchange platform for older adults in the US.<br/><br/>While the project focuses on disaster preparedness for senior populations during hazard events such as tsunamis and earthquakes, the proposed technology has the potential for widespread usage for vulnerable populations in multihazard settings.

PFAS are one of the world?s most intractable pollutants and have contaminated groundwater and drinking water sources across the US and the world.  The toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation of PFAS present a need for remediation as they cause an array of adverse impacts on human health. In the US, impending drinking water regulations and listing of PFAS as hazardous substances under Superfund are setting the enforcement foundation for aggressive cleanup of PFAS-contaminated sites. Current PFAS treatment options are non-destructive, expensive, and simply transfer the PFAS to a solid or concentrated waste stream. This project focuses on the development of a low cost, chemical-free water treatment system that directly mineralizes PFAS to safe end-products with no secondary PFAS waste generation.  It addresses customers? need to achieve environmental compliance, reduce remediation cost, accelerate site closeout, and prevent future environmental pollution and liability.<br/><br/><br/>This project is technically focused on the electrolytic destruction of PFAS. The core technology consists of a novel radial-field flow unit cell architecture with an array of these unit cells stacked into an Electrolyzer. Contaminants are destroyed as the groundwater passes through the Electrolyzer anode compartments. Key innovations of this treatment system include the scalability of the unit cells to very large area electrodes resulting in large-scale Electrolyzer stacks that handle continuous water flow, and most importantly the development of a low-cost, anode electrocatalyst that provides high voltage, single-step mineralization of PFAS, including the long chains and hard to treat short-chains, to safe end-products. The objectives of this project are: (1) Scale up the anode electrocatalyst coating process for large area 3D electrodes and make full-scale, low cost anodes; (2) Design and build an Electrolyzer Stack composed of an array of repeating, scaled-up unit cells; (3) Construct a groundwater treatment skid with the Electrolyzer Stack and perform on-site groundwater PFAS remediation treatability testing; (4) Verify the PFAS destruction efficiency and low cost of the Electrolyzer Stack water treatment system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each summer, 8 students will participate in a 9-week program focused on research and including additional professional development and outreach activities. As faculty at an institution specializing in undergraduate research, the REU mentors are experienced in transforming students from tentative beginners into confident scientists. The program particularly targets beginning students and community college students and prepares and motivates them for future careers in science through a direct, mentored research experience. A welcoming and collaborative environment provides a place for students who have been marginalized in the STEM community to thrive. The program's range of research areas provides an intellectual home for students who use experimental and computational methods to explore interdisciplinary topics across materials science, physics, and chemistry. Projects address systems and phenomena across vastly different scales, ranging from molecules to galaxies. Through engaging students in these projects and professional development, the program results in broadening educational access, developing professional interest in STEM, and increasing the competitiveness of the American workforce.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The broad goal of the College of Wooster REU program is to create an atmosphere conducive to high-quality science in a vibrant research community where students increase their confidence and sense of belonging.  Through a balance of experiment, computation, and theory, the REU site advances knowledge in the fields of condensed matter, granular matter, soft matter physics, optics, chemical physics, pattern formation, sol-gels, and astrophysics.  Research students in granular matter develop video analysis techniques to characterize the avalanche dynamics on a critical pile of beads to investigate universal scaling laws. Other students measure the thermodynamic properties of swellable organically modified silica, a ""swellable glass"" that absorbs many times its own mass in organic liquids like acetone and has applications in industrial and environmental remediation. Using recent images from the James Webb Space Telescope, astrophysics researchers investigate the evolution of clumpy galaxies.  All research projects are designed so that even novice undergraduates can make significant scientific contributions. They become practicing scientists through research, oral and poster presentations, and comprehensive written reports. After the end of the program, faculty continue mentoring student participants to prepare conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications together. As part of continual improvement of mentoring and student training, the program leaders also will develop a framework to explicitly expand students' scientific argumentation skills. These tools for developing and assessing student critical thinking skills in scientific argumentation will be useful to other programs seeking to bring effective, high-quality research mentoring to a broader, more diverse student population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To cope with the continuous evolution in data, an intelligent agent needs to incrementally acquire, perceive, accumulate, and exploit structural and temporal dynamic knowledge throughout its lifetime. This project aims to develop a generic machine learning paradigm to conduct Continual Learning on Evolving Graphs (CoLEG). The success of this project will 1) benefit critical infrastructure (such as social networks, transportation, and renewable energy) and human welfare (in the form of, for example, improvements in healthcare and epidemiology), 2) provide an ideal platform for composing the areas of graph representation learning, time series analysis, continual learning, and causal analysis, and 3) develop open-source tools for evolving graphs that can advance diverse topics such as node classification, link prediction, and temporal forecasting, improve our knowledge of the physical world, and contribute to real-world applications. This project will also 1) engage high school students in research and outreach to K-12 teachers and students, 2) broaden the participation of underrepresented groups especially female and low-income students in STEM, and 3) educate undergraduate and graduate students through the development of new course modules in data mining and machine learning.<br/><br/>To achieve the above goals, it is imperative to address two core challenges associated with evolving graphs, specifically memorization and generalization. The former aims to facilitate the model in acquiring the capacity to comprehensively retain a vast array of conceivable scenarios, encompassing a comprehensive range of existing structural and temporal dynamic conditions. The latter strives to ensure the model can generalize its knowledge and effectively adapt to unforeseen and complex circumstances. This project will develop a generic machine learning paradigm, CoLEG, to resolve the catastrophic forgetting problem by retaining essential structural information and temporal dynamics, ensure the generalization capability, and address real-world applications on evolving graphs. Specifically, 1) a new continual learning paradigm will be formulated to tackle the catastrophic forgetting issue in structural evolving graphs via graph sparsification and topology-aware embedding, 2) new algorithms will be developed to incorporate structural and temporal dynamic patterns of evolving graphs under different regimes, resolve the task-free challenge, and reveal high-order dependencies, and 3) novel solutions will be constructed to pursue pre-trained models and facilitate test-of-time adaptation to ensure the generalization over unforeseen scenarios. This project will contribute to continual learning, graph representation learning, time series analysis, and domain generalization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nature, unlike geometry class in high school, is not composed of smooth lines, planes, and spheres, but rather bumpy, wrinkled, jagged curves like DNA wrapped up in the cell, surfaces like a mountainous landscape, and volumes like the porous nature of soil in the water table. Fractional derivatives have been used to describe these geometries of nature, but no one has built such geometries from the ground up, element by element. Using textured thin magnetic films, the team will build such geometries as the basis for a new class of materials intermediate between order and disorder. These materials will control transport of information in the form of waves of magnetism, called spin waves, moving through our textured thin film slower (sub-diffusive) or faster (super-diffusive) than possible in simple geometries used up till now. Construction of this new artificial material will be the first experimental realization of a quantum fractional derivative, because spin waves follow the same equations as the wave physics of quantum mechanics, in this case the fractional Schrdinger equation, up till now a purely theoretical idea. A key facet of this work is cross-training of graduate students between theory and experiment, producing a more robust workforce that can work in multiple modalities to solve new problems not tractable otherwise. Fields in which the work force can excel with this knowledge include battery technology, based on porous, fractional materials; the spread of contaminants in soil and the water table; and vascular structures for transport in biological matter, including self-healing materials based on biological ideas.<br/> <br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Fractional derivatives describe the bumpy, wrinkled, and jagged geometries of nature, where an integer derivative leads to divergent results rendering traditional definition of a derivative inapplicable, due to a rapid increase in the tangent and curvature with decreasing ?ruler size?. Such natural geometries in the quantum context have been theoretically described with the fractional Schr?dinger equation but never experimentally studied. The team  will explore the fractional Schr?dinger equation-governed fundamental physics in multi-scale materials that consist of magnetic thin film?based, spatially modulated magnonic crystals. They will design and measure tunable sub-diffusive and super-diffusive transport in this artificial lattice as clear evidence of fractional Schr?dinger equation dynamics. The design builds on a new order-disorder lattice modulation axis, with an ordered lattice at one extreme and a disordered lattice giving rise to Anderson localization at the other. The project will provide a general basis for generating fractional partial differential equations, and lead to a deeper understanding of the present highly empirical approach to porous and other fractional media ranging from battery applications to biomimetic Murray materials to spread of contaminants in soil and the water table. The program will be carried out through tight, integral collaborations between Mingzhong Wu's experimental group at Colorado State University and Lincoln Carr's theoretical group at Colorado School of Mines. Working together as an integrated team encompassing experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics, they propose a multi-faceted approach to meet broader impact goals, centrally themed on blending experiment and theory to train our graduate and undergraduate student to become well-rounded scientists.<br/> <br/>This DMR grant supports research on fundamental understanding of quantum materials and especially exploring principles that cross-cuts many other condensed matter systems with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum materials typically exist in a crystalline environment due to the periodic arrangement of atoms. Hence, the material under question often also has a crystallographic symmetry that includes rotations, reflections, and translations of the space, meaning that the crystal structure remains the same under such operations. In the presence of these symmetries, quantum materials can host new types of physical phenomena. For example, if a quantum material has a rotational symmetry, then it is possible for certain kinds of crystal defects to accumulate quantized electric charges that are fractions of the charge of the electron. The project will incorporate methods from mathematical physics and quantum field theory to further our ability to characterize and classify the robust, quantized properties exhibited by quantum systems with crystalline symmetry.

The second component is to perform numerical calculations for models of fractional Chern insulators and quantum spin liquids, specifically using projected quantum wave functions, to understand the emergence of new crystalline symmetry-protected topological invariants and their physical properties. These include invariants obtained through partial symmetry operations and through fractional charges accumulated at lattice defects. The third component is to develop methods to experimentally probe the PI?s recently discovered crystalline topological invariants in two-dimensional quantum materials, photonic systems, and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers.

Solar cells, which absorb sunlight and generate electricity, are playing and will continue to play a strong role in reducing the demand for fossil-fuel derived energy. Solar cells constructed out of organic molecules or polymers are of interest because they are inexpensive, easy to process, lightweight and flexible. The electric power generated by today?s organic solar cells is limited because of thermodynamic constraints. There is currently intense scientific effort to overcome these constraints and to construct solar cells that yield higher power. A promising approach is to use singlet fission, a photophysical process within which the electrical current generated by light absorption is in principle doubled. Practical utilization of singlet fission requires further research. Charge generation here occurs in two steps, and while impressive success has been reached in the development of chromophores in which the first step is very efficient, in nearly all cases the second step takes too long, and electric charge, and so, energy, is lost to the process of recombination. The PI will perform quantum chemical calculations that will lead to new molecular materials in which the second step of singlet fission, charge separation, will occur ultrafast, leading to organic solar cells with higher quantum efficiencies. A significant portion of the research is in collaboration with groups that specialize in experimental research on singlet fission. The broader impacts of this work include interdisciplinary training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, outreach efforts fostering interest in chemistry and physics among members of underserved groups, and increased scientific literacy and public awareness.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on the process of singlet fission in organic solar cell materials. Research on singlet fission until recently focused on designing materials that give rapid singlet to triplet-triplet conversion. Rapid triplet-triplet generation; however, is a consequence of strong interchromophore coupling that also leads to strong triplet-triplet multiexciton binding and fast triplet recombination instead of generation of free triplets. Overcoming this impasse requires clear understanding of the relationship between bonding motifs and the generation of triplet-triplet multiexcitons with weak binding energy, that have been discovered recently in different families of intramolecular singlet fission materials. The PI will perform high order multiple reference configuration interaction-calculations within the semiempirical Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian using a diagrammatic exciton basis that will yield precise structure-property correlations with predictive capability. The goal of this research is to arrive at structural features that will give fast generation of free triplets in ultrafast times. The research contributes to fundamental knowledge that underlies solar energy and other technologies, particularly those that could be based on organic materials. Junior researchers involved in this project are gaining experience in state-of-the-art computational methods, including quantum many-body physics and chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These metasurface devices find applications across a broad spectrum of photonics. While there have been exciting advancements, metasurfaces are typically static, and their optical behavior is predetermined by the materials used and their initial design. The challenge lies in developing techniques that allow metasurfaces to have an adjustable optical response, a crucial feature for various applications. The research team is taking on this challenge by introducing a novel approach using van der Waals materials to create compact photonic devices and metasurfaces that can be tuned with electrical bias. Through a combination of computational simulations and real-world experiments, the team aims to showcase the ability to dynamically switch and tune the optical properties of these van der Waals devices and metasurfaces in the visible spectral range. This project opens up new possibilities for programmable wavefront manipulation, optical modulation, and sensing for applications both in free space and on-chip. Beyond the research, the team is committed to education and outreach. Their integrated plan involves engaging students from grades 7-12 up to the graduate level. By participating in this project, students get exposure to rapidly evolving fields such as materials science, optics, and nanotechnology, contributing to their educational journey and fostering interest in cutting-edge technologies.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>Optical metasurfaces consist of ultrathin photonic devices that feature two-dimensional arrays of sub-wavelength nanoantennas, crafted from either plasmonic materials or dielectric materials. This technology has granted unprecedented control over light, unlocking a diverse range of optical applications. Although actively tuning the response of metasurfaces is highly desirable for various applications, it remains a challenging task. This project delves into the utilization of van der Waals materials to create electrically tunable photonic devices and metasurfaces. The research team aims to showcase reversible, non-volatile, multi-state/continuous switching, and spectral tuning of light scattering, reflection, and chiral-optical absorption by adjusting the van der Waals antenna and metasurfaces in the visible spectral range. Additionally, the technology is implemented with chiral van der Waals nanostructures to create a broadband, electrically tunable circularly polarized light photodetector. The principal investigator plans to leverage their existing efforts and successful experience in educating students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, across different levels. This will be achieved through new course development and outreach programs. The outcomes of this project introduce a new class of tunable metasurfaces and photonic devices based on van der Waals materials, offering a wide range of applications, including optical modulation, photodetection, tunable color filtering and displays, and programmable and active wavefront manipulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The effects of wildfire on sediment transport are well studied, and indicate that the absence of vegetation and hydrophobic characteristics of burned soils create conditions that intensify overland flow during subsequent rain events and can mobilize large volumes of fine sediment and initiate debris flows. However, much of this understanding of post-fire hydrologic and geomorphic processes is derived from steep (>30 degrees) and forested landscapes. Post-fire processes in the lower-slope (<1?10 degrees) grassland and shrubland landscapes of the Texas Panhandle are unknown. This project will contribute important data for management of federally classified critical habitat that hosts an endangered fish species, the peppered chub. The project supports undergraduate research at three Hispanic Serving Institutions across Texas.<br/><br/>This study is crucial for understanding the magnitude and timing of post-fire sediment transport in shrublands. A major contribution of this work will be the collection of the first post-fire sediment transport measurements in low-sloping environments like the Texas Panhandle. Measurements of sediment grain size and regolith thickness will inform the degree to which sediment transport rates are limited by stress exerted by overland flow or sediment availability. This project will also constrain the importance of vegetation as an intermittent fire-mediated storage site in low-sloping environments. Finally, measurements of suspended sediment in the Canadian River and Lake Meredith will constrain the transport timescales for fine sediment from hillslopes and tributaries to reach the sediment sink of Lake Meredith.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major impediment to the insertion of polymeric glasses in applications ranging from dielectric thin films in electronics to structural composites for aerospace, automotive, and wind turbine applications is the inability to predict long-term performance. This lack of quantitative understanding of the mechanical and thermal behavior also adversely impacts the application and engineering of amorphous glassy polymeric materials. This award supports research to facilitate the prediction of long-term behavior of polymer glasses, and thus facilitate the design and engineering of this important class of materials in advanced composites and other applications of importance to national interests.  In addition, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in polymer physics and mechanics, modeling, and experimental methods related to polymer glasses.  At North Carolina State University, outreach will be conducted with K-12 summer camps to promote interest in STEM through a curriculum that includes teamwork, creative problem solving, and design challenges. Outreach activites at University of Nebraska Lincoln will focus on lifelong learner adults interested in expanding their understanding of math, physics, and programing.<br/><br/>The Back Stress Expansion model will be investigated in order to develop a robust, yet computationally simplified, methodology that is able to describe and predict the long-term performance of glassy polymers as a function of thermal and mechanical history, including nonlinear or large deformations.

The model will be tested and validated using new experimental data, including pressure dependent structural recovery, isochoric measurements in the glassy state, and non-linear viscoelastic measurements.  These experiments, which will be performed on three important engineering thermoplastics - polycarbonate, polysulfone, poly(methyl methacrylate) - will not only provide new data to validate and refine the model but will also further our understanding of the physics and mechanics of glassy polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These model systems can be extremely versatile, yet straightforward probes for comprehending the complicated mechanistic details that govern oxygen mediated reactivities in biology. Dr. Wijeratne and his team will utilize these powerful tools in shedding light on yet unknown knowledge that can lead to pathways for efficient syntheses of complex molecules, and the discovery of catalysts that can enhance the efficiency of catalysts of oxygen reduction benefiting alternative energy applications.

Outreach and educational aspects of this project will involve the orientation of Birmingham City high school students toward Regional Science Fair via a newly designed Science Club program. Proposed efforts will strive to bridge the gap of scientific literacy of youngsters in the City of Birmingham, which is one of the most income-segregated school districts in the country.   <br/><br/>Heme-containing dioxygenases play pivotal roles in human physiology, disease progression, and aging, consequently attracting substantial research interests within the past decade. However, exact mechanistic details concerning these are only faintly understood. Heme superoxide adducts are presumed to be active oxidants in heme dioxygenases, however, details pertaining to their definitive involvement in the actual enzymatic mechanism remain elusive. Synthetic model systems have long-served as powerful tools in addressing such mechanistic ambiguities, but synthetic heme superoxide adducts are often found to be sluggish oxidants. This anomaly calls for revaluation of explicit modeling of synthetic systems with direct relevance to their biological mode of action. Comprehension of mechanistic details of such model systems can also be of direct benefit for the design of superior synthetic methodologies targeting important complex organic molecules and homogeneous dioxygen reduction catalysts to be used in alternative energy applications. Proposed research will address this gap in knowledge by generating a library of synthetic heme superoxide model systems with divergent structural properties, and thorough investigation into how such structural modulations would influence their reactivity signatures. This work will vertically advance the fundamental understanding of reactivity-governing geometric, electronic, and non-covalent structural properties of mid-valent heme-oxygen intermediates, introducing a new era of heme-oxygen model chemistry.

This project focuses on a species of canopy kelp that is a foundational species along the shores of the northeast Pacific Ocean, the bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana. The research explores the role of a diverse set of microbes in association with bull kelp. Using experimental manipulations of newly isolated microbial taxa from kelp, tests of whether interactions are positive, negative, or neutral are performed.

Experiments tracing stable nitrogen isotopes and manipulations with hosts and bacterial isolates are used to investigate possible exchanges and the currencies underlying interactions. Metabolomic, proteomic, and genomic analyses are used to quantify host-microbe interactions and linkage between taxa and their functions.

This systematic problem has long prevailed primarily due to its complex nature. Academic retention, especially in demanding STEM fields like Computer Science, is influenced by many factors, including academic preparedness, socioeconomic backgrounds, mental health, and campus support systems. Additionally, students? diverse experiences and needs make a one-size-fits-all solution ineffective. Institutions need to identify at-risk students early to provide prompt support tailored to students? needs. In addition, as technology and educational methods continue to develop, it is essential to adjust retention strategies to keep up with these changes constantly. Addressing these challenges requires an innovative, data-driven, and student-centric approach. This project will use predictive modeling to identify students at risk of struggling academically. By identifying students? potential adversarial factors early, the project will evaluate prompt and personalized evidence-based interventions to support students in overcoming these challenges. The proposed interventions include small group math tutoring, wellness workshops, and peer and faculty mentorship. This comprehensive approach is expected to improve academic performance and well-being among participating students thereby increasing retention rates. The resulting design, implementation, and measured outcomes can guide future interventions to improve student retention, thus increasing diversity in STEM programs.<br/><br/>This proposed project has three specific aims. Firstly, it aims to assess the impact of evidence-based interventions on students who are at risk of struggling in key areas such as math, mental health, wellness, and self-efficacy. Machine learning algorithms will identify first-year students at risk of probation based on student-reported academic and demographic data. Interventions will be tailored to address identified risk factors, and a control group will be included for comparison purposes. The effectiveness of each intervention will be measured using quantitative surveys, course grades, and qualitative interviews and analyzed using statistical methods such as ANOVA and regression models. Secondly, using a mixed-method approach that combines quantitative and qualitative analyses, this project will refine and improve interventions and predictive models based on participant feedback on the academic program, vocational interests, and concerns about professional development. Finally, the project will evaluate these interventions' sustainability and broader impact, contributing to developing refined methods for future application. All software artifacts and findings will be open-source and available online. The PIs will present their progress and disseminate results on and off campus through presentations, workshops, and publications at relevant conferences. The success of this project is expected to lead to an expanded adoption of these interventions across other academic programs and institutions, thus improving retention and academic success in STEM fields at HSIs. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These regions harbor unique ecosystems only found in waters without oxygen, and they are important for Earth?s climate. Specifically, the production of nitrogen gas by two microbial processes, anammox and denitrification can control how productive the oceans are. Yet how much each process shapes ocean chemistry within these areas remains unknown. This project aims to study the oxygen deficient waters of the eastern tropical North Pacific ocean to better understand the mechanisms shaping marine nitrogen and carbon chemistry. Through this work, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students at three universities. The project aims to broaden participation in and understanding of ocean sciences by developing public videos about the methods used and the science behind the project. <br/> <br/>The investigators will conduct a research cruise in the eastern tropical North Pacific ocean, the largest oxygen deficient zone. They will measure many nutrients including inorganic carbon and nitrogen and natural abundance stable isotopes of nitrogen compounds. They will use these patterns to establish how the major reactions work together to control nitrogen cycling and gaseous nitrogen production. In addition, a high-resolution model of the ocean will reveal the influence of ocean mixing, set the timescales for reactions, and enable synthesis of the measurements into a global context. The work will determine how the input of oxygen through mixing controls chemistry, and it will distinguish between the processes restricted to the permanently anoxic core vs. those that tolerate (or are enhanced by) occasional oxygenation. Overall, the project will provide new information about nitrogen cycling pathways (anammox, denitrification, and nitrite oxidation) across the region and link the resulting isotopic signals to the global nitrogen budget.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will engage participants in applied analysis and partial differential equations research. While recruiting from a nationwide pool, special consideration will be given to underrepresented groups, students attending baccalaureate degree programs at colleges and universities in the Appalachian region and beyond, and, in general, institutions with limited research opportunities. Through weekly interactions, training, and mentoring, participants are expected to complete an independent research project, obtain first-hand experience with the rigors of and best practices in mathematical research, and familiarize themselves with mainstream expectations for graduate school and pursuing a career in mathematics. This program will also help strengthen STEM education and attract talent to West Virginia, thereby enhancing the region?s workforce and development. <br/><br/>Participants' research projects will focus on utilizing tools from analysis and PDEs to address practical issues arising from physics and materials science. The projects include a diverse collection of topics based on the research interests of the faculty mentors: systems of conservation and balance laws with singular solutions, asymptotics for a basic cosmological model, and the director field model with electromagnetic waves. Research in hyperbolic conservation laws will focus on solving equations with special initial conditions and employ the characteristic method and, in general, various dynamical systems ideas with geometric flavor. These methods will help us gain quantitative and qualitative insights into more general problems with many applications, such as fluid mechanics, biosciences, and cosmology. The analysis of the director field model will advance our understanding of the interaction between elastic and electromagnetic waves in liquid crystals. Research on the sticky particles model will enhance our comprehension of the formation of large-scale structures in the universe by accretion of matter; more specifically, this part of the project will involve a discrete particle evolution approach to gain insight into the long-time behavior of stellar and galactic clusters.

Current knowledge is based on relatively small numbers of case studies and anecdotes; more systematic data are needed. This project will survey research development and administration staff at a national random sample of roughly one in four not-for-profit four-year colleges and universities and use the results to develop strengths-based and deficit-based modeling of needs, capacities, and opportunities for growth, providing clear and concrete expression of their perspectives, challenges, and requirements.

Based on previous literature and The Chicago School of Professional Psychology (TCSPP) institutional research data, it is posited that undergraduates who are online, non-traditional, underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students enter their program with low levels of self-efficacy, lacking a sense of belonging in an academic setting. Historically, these students have lower college persistence and completion levels than their on-campus, traditional-aged peers. We seek to study whether a connection to near-peer graduate students with similar demographic traits and lived experiences will break their isolation and increase their sense of belonging and self-efficacy. While the demand for and pursuit of online education, along with subsequent challenges to student persistence and completion, has grown significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dearth of research specifically focused on online students and virtual mentoring. The North Star Project will provide students with directed one-on-one support from their near peers who share intersectional identities with them and have completed similar academic programs. Specifically, the project will engage students enrolled in the Master of Psychology degree as mentors to provide social support to increase Bachelor of Psychology student persistence and completion. Expected outcomes include increased student sense of belonging and self-efficacy in their degree program, resulting in increased rates of persistence, completion, and entry to graduate study.<br/><br/>Through analysis of pre/post-self-efficacy and sense of belonging measurements, mentor and mentee feedback, academic performance, and persistence data, the project will advance knowledge of how mentoring of non-traditional-aged, underrepresented online students affects their persistence, completion, and pursuit of graduate study in psychology. This research will provide new insights into methods of building a sense of belonging and self-efficacy in this growing population of underrepresented, non-traditional-aged students and the differences in the effectiveness of this intervention on campus-based versus fully online students. The research questions to be explored are: does near-peer mentoring enhance an online student?s sense of belonging and self-efficacy in a degree program? Does near-peer mentoring increase online student fall-to-fall persistence? And does a near-peer mentoring program increase degree completion and pursuit of graduate study? Previous work in this area has focused on traditional-aged students in physical sciences on residential campuses. This project has the potential to diversify psychological research, providing a shared, lived experience perspective from underrepresented and non-traditional groups to advance the field. Their increased persistence, completion, and entry into graduate study will increase diverse perspectives in psychological scientific research and other STEM fields.

These lesions refer to dilated blood vessels in the fold?s tissue and are particularly common in professions with high voice usage, such as educators, public speakers, and singers. The presence of vascular lesions and their potential rupture affect the ability of the tissue to vibrate normally, which severely disrupts speech and leads to vocal fatigue. However, the underlying mechanisms of lesion growth and fatigue resulting from this condition remain uncertain. There is thus a significant need to investigate the effects of vascular lesions on the phonation process. This project will develop predictive computational models of coupled aerodynamics, hemodynamics, and solid mechanics to account for these lesions, their progression, and the corresponding voice fatigue. The resultant framework will enable improvements in biomechanical models of the human larynx, while such models are also being considered for potential use in surgical interventions, enhancement in prevention of voice disorders, and exploring issues related to voice training. Along with the development and dissemination of technical tools, the award will also support the education and training of underrepresented minorities, expansion through virtual and on-site outreach activities to inspire appreciation of phonation biomechanics within a general audience and connect with interested patients, as well as interaction with pre-collegiate students from marginalized backgrounds through an annual summer workshop. <br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to analyze the three-way interaction between the vascular lesion, poroviscoelastic vocal fold tissue, and glottal airflow, to illustrate the biomechanical characteristics of the tissue and quantify metrics that are hypothesized to be associated with vocal fatigue. Therefore, the research objectives of this project include: (1) developing a fully coupled multi-component fluid-poroelastic structure interaction modeling approach integrating the turbulent glottal airflow and permeable fold tissue in presence of vascular lesions to assess voice fatigue indicators, (2) creating a computational solver for modeling the lesion progression in the form of the pressure-driven crack filled with blood propagating in the poroelastic tissue to explore the significance of phonation conditions, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty in the model predictions using a Monte-Carlo type simulation approach to evaluate how various physical parameters and morphological features affect the fold?s biomechanics and lesion propagation.

Nanoparticles delivered to the bloodstream are surrounded by red blood cells, a variety of white blood cells, and platelets. Despite blood?s complexity, most studies developing nanoparticles for imaging applications have focused on assessing off-target nanoparticle interactions with a subtype of white blood cells called macrophages. Macrophages are part of the body?s defense mechanism against foreign objects and are known to sequester nanocarriers in the body. Despite the abundance of platelets and other white blood cells such as neutrophils, these blood cells are often ignored in the design of nanoparticle imaging agents. Upon activation, neutrophils and platelets can stick together to form cellular aggregates that can block blood flow, just as a clump of hair clogs a drainpipe. This CAREER project will generate new knowledge on how the physical characteristics of metal oxide nanoparticles (their metal content, surface coating, and size) impact interactions with neutrophils and platelets. Dr. Bennewitz will investigate how nanoparticle design mediates cell uptake and transport, activation of neutrophils and platelets, and their downstream cell-cell interactions in static and dynamic systems. This project will lead to the creation of safer and more effective nanoparticle contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging by smarter design strategies to minimize off-target effects. The integrated education plan will target underserved students from rural, low-income, and first-generation college households in West Virginia, who are at-risk for not advancing their education. Collectively, the education plan will spark interest in STEM for all age groups from preschool to high school students in West Virginia. By combining hands-on research, experiential learning, creative integration of art and science, and exposure to real world applications in nanotechnology, imaging, and biomaterials, these outreach activities will inspire the next generation of young scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Conventional testing of novel nanoparticle contrast agents relies on evaluating off-target interactions with macrophages, disregarding neutrophils, and platelets. Activated neutrophils and platelets can form neutrophil-platelet aggregates that trigger downstream damage including release of web-like DNA fibers called neutrophil extracellular traps. Neutrophil extracellular traps provoke endothelial injury, platelet activation, and neutrophil recruitment to promote vessel blockage. Thus, there is a critical need to elucidate how nanoparticle contrast agents interact with neutrophils and platelets to maximize safety. Dr. Bennewitz?s group has shown that nanoparticle contrast agent coating and metal content modulates neutrophil function via differential release of neutrophil extracellular traps, reactive oxygen species, and cytokines. This CAREER project aims to determine how the physical characteristics of metal oxide nanoparticles used in magnetic resonance imaging mediate interactions with neutrophils and platelets in complementary systems including static in vitro assays, microfluidic chips, and a proof-of-principle mouse model. The central hypothesis is that the physical properties of nanoparticle contrast agents modulate neutrophil and platelet nanoparticle transport, cell activation, neutrophil-platelet aggregate formation, release of neutrophil extracellular traps, and thrombosis. The central hypothesis will be tested with the following research objectives: (1) Investigate metal oxide nanoparticle uptake and transport in neutrophils and platelets (2-3) Evaluate metal oxide nanoparticle-mediated neutrophil and platelet activation, aggregation, and release of neutrophil extracellular traps under static and dynamic flow conditions. This project will be transformative, as Dr. Bennewitz will be able to determine how manganese oxide nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, and conventional gadolinium chelate contrast agents impact neutrophil-platelet crosstalk, neutrophil extracellular traps, and thrombosis in vitro and in vivo to enhance contrast agent safety. The educational objectives of this CAREER project are to: (1) Host 10 rural, low-income West Virginia high school students in hands-on summer research through the Upward Bound Program. Students will be exposed to nanoparticle synthesis and incubation studies with neutrophils and platelets in static and dynamic systems. (2) Create and disseminate a Biomedical Engineering module to 4,000 middle and high school students state-wide via the West Virginia Science Public Outreach Team. Two hands-on activities will be integrated into the presentation to spark student interest in fluorescence imaging and polymer stimulus driven delivery, two key research concepts of this project. (3) Design and lead an interactive science meets art activity focused on fluorescent painting under blacklights for children aged 10 and under at the Spark! Imagination and Science Center. The education plan will cultivate interest in STEM education and careers for underserved West Virginia students and the public. Undergraduate and graduate students will gain valuable mentoring and teaching experience via their integral roles in creating and disseminating the outreach activities which will bolster their confidence, leadership, and retention in STEM. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Nanoscale Interactions Program within CBET and  the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the impact of these learning-enabled medical cyber-physical systems (LE-MCPS) are revolutionizing personalized patient care and health outcomes, assuring their safety and efficacy remains a formidable challenge.  Existing model-based design paradigms for learning-enabled cyber-physical systems require an abundance of ?clean? data or high-fidelity simulators ? unfortunately, LE-MCPS do not have that luxury.  Consequently, LE-MCPS development strongly depends on experimentation to generate data for design and assurance. The ethical and economic constraints of working in safety-critical medical applications necessitate experimentation efficiency. Yet, experimental design and learning-enabled component design are often weakly coupled -- which contributes to inefficiencies, increased development costs, and increased patient risk.  This CAREER proposal aims to develop foundations and tools for assuring learning-enabled medical cyber physical systems (MCPS) by bridging-the-gap between experimentation and model-based design.  Specifically, the research focuses on leveraging model-based design techniques to address foundational challenges associated with experimental design (ante-experimentation), protocol execution (during experimentation), and system assurance (post-experimentation). The project?s broader significance will advance the state-of-the-art in medical system design, accelerate learning-enabled CPS (LE-CPS) innovation, and provide abundant interdisciplinary and use-inspired education opportunities and outreach activities.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop foundations and tools for assuring LE-MCPS by bridging-the-gap between experimentation and model-based design. The proposed research will result in a high-assurance LE-CPS design framework spanning ante-, intra-, and post-experimentation. Prior to experimentation, this work will develop foundational techniques to address gaps in traditional experimental designed exposed by high-assurance LE-CPS design. During experimentation, new platforms and capabilities will be realized that can support tamper-evident run-time experimental data curation for assuring LE-CPS. After experimentation, techniques that leverage historical evidence and experimental data will maximally assure LE-CPS designs. Foundations developed in the project are prospectively evaluated in industrial LE-MCPS applications. While the research is motivated by medical scenarios, the developed technologies are immediately applicable to a wide range of LE-CPS applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One major source of ?hidden? diversity may be the many mites, nematodes, fungi, and protist symbionts that live inside insects. Such organisms are known to have associations with insects but detecting their presence and quantifying their diversity pose major challenges. This is a potentially massive oversight toward an understanding of global species diversity: if insect-associated symbionts are also often specialized on just one or a few species of insect, this would imply the existence of millions of undescribed and uncounted species, requiring a revision of global species richness estimates. This research will lead to the development of new methods to reveal the eukaryotic symbionts living inside insects. It will also apply those methods to the most ambitious surveys of insect-symbiont diversity to date, spanning two natural insect communities in two different habitats. The research will be integrated into public events in Iowa and Ohio where participants will learn about biodiversity and participate in sampling insects to be used in the research. A major theme will be how much diversity may be hiding even in our own backyards. This project will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students on two campuses, one which is a primarily undergraduate-serving institution. Students will participate in the proposed research but will also receive valuable mentoring in teaching and scientific outreach.<br/>The researchers will develop PCR blocking primers that inhibit amplification of 18S rRNA from the five largest orders of insects (representing >75% of all described insect species) but that permit amplification of 18S rRNA from any other eukaryote in a sample. They will also iteratively design blocking primers for large and/or common symbiont groups detected in natural samples so that smaller/rare symbionts may also be detected. These methods will allow detection of any eukaryotic symbiont associated with insects in the five largest orders (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Lepidoptera). Two first-of-their-kind symbiont diversity surveys will apply the developed methods to >1000 insects collected from each of two natural communities, interrogating all insect hosts for eukaryotic symbionts. Preliminary data show that blockers are effective at greatly reducing host insect DNA amplification and successfully detect mites, nematodes, fungi, and even single-celled apicomplexan protists associated with individual insects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The instrumentation upgrade will be installed in a multi-user facility which is focused on data collection and training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers and is incorporated into the classroom activities of some of the nation?s most diverse Earth Science classrooms. This TIMS instrument is used to measure the natural isotopic variations in earth and ocean samples. This analytical tool is incorporated into UCSC classroom instruction but also serves as the primary tool in geologic and climate research projects funded by the National Science Foundation. For example, a major use has been to produce absolute formation ages for rocks and minerals as apart of Earth and Ocean science investigations. This project supports the upgrade the instrumental ion detection system (how isotopic variations are detected) and the computer system that controls the instrument. These upgrades will both improve the quality of data and extend the lifetime of this instrument by replacing the original computer hardware and software. <br/><br/>The upgrade of the IsotopX Phoenix Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS) currently installed at UCSC is supported by this award. This instrument was originally installed in a multi-user facility as a part of a 2015 NSF MRI award (1532276) and has since served to produce U, Th, Pb and Sr isotopic data while training UCSC students, postdocs, and faculty researchers. The primary use of the instrument has been to produce U-Pb and U-Th radioisotopic ages for studies that range in time and applications from early solar system studies to Pleistocene climate. In addition to these geochronologic efforts, the instrument is used to produce Sr and Pb isotopic data for UCSC researchers from the Departments of Ocean Sciences, Anthropology and Earth and Planetary Sciences. The project will support the upgrade of the UCSC TIMS with the IsotopX ATONA amplifier technology and the accompanying 10kV high voltage (HV) and computer hardware/software systems. Collectively these modifications will: 1) permit ATONA-Daly collection of large U-series isotopic ratios, improving the precision of geochronologic dates 2) improve transmission of low abundance isotopes from the new HV system; 3) remove the need to exchange amplifier cards between different experiments and 4) ensure a stable computer configuration for this facility for years to come.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These regions harbor unique ecosystems only found in waters without oxygen, and they are important for Earth?s climate. Specifically, the production of nitrogen gas by two microbial processes, anammox and denitrification can control how productive the oceans are. Yet how much each process shapes ocean chemistry within these areas remains unknown. This project aims to study the oxygen deficient waters of the eastern tropical North Pacific ocean to better understand the mechanisms shaping marine nitrogen and carbon chemistry. Through this work, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students at three universities. The project aims to broaden participation in and understanding of ocean sciences by developing public videos about the methods used and the science behind the project. <br/> <br/>The investigators will conduct a research cruise in the eastern tropical North Pacific ocean, the largest oxygen deficient zone. They will measure many nutrients including inorganic carbon and nitrogen and natural abundance stable isotopes of nitrogen compounds. They will use these patterns to establish how the major reactions work together to control nitrogen cycling and gaseous nitrogen production. In addition, a high-resolution model of the ocean will reveal the influence of ocean mixing, set the timescales for reactions, and enable synthesis of the measurements into a global context. The work will determine how the input of oxygen through mixing controls chemistry, and it will distinguish between the processes restricted to the permanently anoxic core vs. those that tolerate (or are enhanced by) occasional oxygenation. Overall, the project will provide new information about nitrogen cycling pathways (anammox, denitrification, and nitrite oxidation) across the region and link the resulting isotopic signals to the global nitrogen budget.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tropical forests are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and hold some of the largest stocks of carbon in plants and soils globally. Thus, they are a ?carbon bank,? storing carbon in solid form and reducing potential carbon in the atmosphere as the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, these ecosystems are important to global societies for biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and climate moderation. This project studies the effects of drying on carbon storage and cycling in tropical forests, using a long-term experiment that reduces rainfall inputs to four distinct tropical forests in Panama. The forests have different background rainfall and soil fertility, which could influence how they respond to drying. The project was established in 2015, and thus is accumulating a long-term dataset. In the initial seven years of data there was large variation in carbon fluxes and cycling from year to year, possibly related to variation in rainfall between different years. This new project, called Panama Rainforest Changes with Experimental Drying (PARCHED), will now continue for an additional 5 ? 10 years of measurements. These results will help improve understanding of how tropical forest carbon storage changes over decades in response to climate variability. Undergraduate students will have opportunities to be involved in research, and there will be outreach materials produced in both English and Spanish. <br/><br/>Results from the past seven years of the PARCHED experiment have some anomalies relative to what would be predicted. Some model predictions matched experimental results, while some mismatches suggested that important processes in tropical forests were not represented in the model. In particular, the importance of reduced water fluxes into soils, and related reductions in delivery of nutrients into soils, were lacking from the model, which could be important in the context of inter-annual variation in rainfall and soil hydrology. This project works to: a) determine whether observed chronic drying effects on tropical carbon cycling years persist over one to two decades of background rainfall variation; b) allow for detection of changes in long-term soil carbon storage in tropical forests. The project measures tree stem and root growth, soil carbon levels, and changes in carbon losses from soils via CO2 fluxes. Ongoing work aims to improve the model characterization of important processes in rainforests under drying. In conducting these scientific activities, the project trains and support a full-time field technician, involves undergraduate researchers, and will be used as part of the Smithsonian?s science outreach efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The shortage of STEM teachers is a national concern. With a growing need for a specialized STEM-focused workforce, high-quality STEM teachers can prepare students for STEM careers, expand access to STEM education, and create a more inclusive and equitable workforce. To help address the shortfall of STEM teachers, the project will encourage qualified mathematics and science undergraduate students and graduates to pursue teaching careers at high schools and middle schools in high-need school districts. The project will support 30 prospective teachers through scholarships, early teaching experiences, mentoring, and teacher preparation. Once they have obtained a teaching credential and start teaching as novice teachers, the project continues to provide professional development opportunities in their first two years of teaching. During this time, STEM and Education professors and experienced teachers will mentor these new teachers and help them refine teaching skills and stay in the teaching profession. <br/><br/>The project at California State University San Marcos includes partnerships with three community colleges (MiraCosta, Palomar, and San Diego Mesa) and two high-need school districts (Escondido Union High School District and San Marcos Unified School District). Project goals are to (1) recruit and retain 30 high-quality STEM majors and professionals to teaching careers over five years; (2) recruit at least 50% underrepresented racial minorities and women in STEM; (3) expand and sustain recruitment and retention mechanisms from freshman to teacher induction; and (4) expand and sustain the STEM education community in the region. The theoretical framework is based on Wenger?s (1998) theory of social participation and identity in a community of practice.  A key feature of the project is to support participants as they develop their identities to include characteristics of both scientists and STEM teachers. The project?s intellectual merit includes a refined model for enhancing cross-disciplinary and cross-college faculty?s ability to recruit and produce high-quality STEM teachers and a deeper understanding of how students find balance between their STEM and teaching identities. The broader impacts of this project will aid the teacher shortage and increase role models for California?s diverse K-12 students. The models for faculty teamwork and collaboration with community colleges and school districts to support STEM teacher recruitment and retention can provide insights for other institutions as results are disseminated. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Concrete is the most widely used construction material and its production releases 8% of human-caused carbon dioxide. Limiting this environmental burden requires improved methods for predicting concrete performance and extending the useful life of new and existing concrete infrastructure. The microstructure of concrete is porous and evolves over time due to seasonal or long-term climate changes. Existing test methodologies and models based on stable environments may not detect this interaction, leading to concrete infrastructure that deteriorates in harsh, cyclical environments. Using a novel accelerated test method, concrete will be exposed to conditions that simulate extreme environments and then the interaction between these environments will be studied. The experimental results will supply data for the development of models to predict concrete performance in cyclical and changing environments. The research will attempt to supply engineers and material scientists with a fundamental understanding of the relationships between the evolving microstructure of concrete and its respective service life in harsh environments. This research will integrate education and curriculum development to increase involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced materials science, data science, and holistic model development.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to quantify changes in microstructural and transport properties imparted by cyclical, dynamic, and coupled environments and to understand the mechanism of interaction resulting from those changes. It has been established that aggressive environments alter concrete microstructure resulting in degraded performance when exposed to another environment, as occurs due to seasonal or climate change. The objectives of this research are to (a) simulate the deterioration caused by cyclical, dynamic, and coupled environments, (b) measure the resulting changes in microstructural and transport properties over the duration of the simulation, and (c) correlate microstructural changes to performance. The following fundamental questions will be addressed: (1) what microstructural characteristics of concrete are altered when exposed to cyclical or dynamic environments? (2) does an interaction occur between the physicochemical changes imparted by one environment and the durability of concrete in another environment? (3) how is the performance of concrete diminished by exposure to cyclical, dynamic, or coupled environments?

At the ocean interface, surface waves and their resulting dynamics regulate the transfers of momentum and scalars between the atmosphere and ocean and are thus fundamental in shaping the sea states and weather patterns, exerting a direct impact on many aspects of human life. Although we know surface waves must be fully integrated into weather and climate forecast models, we do not yet fully understand the fundamental processes that couple the surface waves with turbulent flows above and below the ocean surface. A better understanding of wind stress modulations by surface waves is required to reduce uncertainties and develop accurate predictive models. This project aims at advancing the current understanding of wind stress over ocean waves using combined high-resolution imaging and numerical simulations. The outcome of this work will result in tangible broader impacts and societal benefits beyond the scientific community. It will incorporate findings into educational materials for a comprehensive three-day air-sea interaction workshop.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will integrate laboratory measurements of wind-wave interactions with a high-fidelity digital twin model of the laboratory system to develop a data-driven model for sea-surface drag. The specific objectives of the project are to (1) understand skin friction modulations induced by surface waves, (2) evaluate pressure drag through a high-fidelity digital twin model, and (3) develop a sea-state-dependent total surface drag parameterization. Laboratory measurements will provide an accurate description of surface skin friction drag but fall short when it comes to pressure forces. The digital twin model will augment the experimental setup by providing pressure forces. This integrated approach will provide unique insight into wave-induced modulations of the total wind stress (sum of tangential and pressure stresses at the air-water interface) under a range of wind-wave conditions. A data-driven sea-state-dependent surface flux parameterization will be developed by examining these modulations, leveraging recent advancements in machine learning technology. The model will be tailored for large-eddy simulations of wind over ocean wavefields in strongly forced conditions. This approach is expected to significantly advance the fundamental understanding of air-sea fluxes and lead to improved parameterizations of wind stress over the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dr. Hsu is developing novel chemical compounds that attach to enzymes (protein catalysts) to probe the metabolism of fats and lipids inside of cells. These probes illuminate how cells are similar or distinct based on their metabolic status. Uncovering distinctive metabolic identities within a massive assortment of cells shows how seemingly identical cells differentiate into specific cell types (e.g. a nerve versus a muscle cell). The metabolic signals discovered through these studies may enable the development of new cell types or properties to push the boundaries of cell engineering. Graduate students receive unique training in chemistry and chemical biology to foster their development as outstanding leaders and role models in society.

Small molecule reporters are integrated with flow cytometry for massively parallel analysis of dynamic metabolic regulation across millions of live cells with unprecedented molecular resolution. Establishing metabolism as a mechanism for asymmetrical specification of cell biology reveals completely new cell phenotypes and has broader impacts in cell biology and engineering.

Conventional customization paradigms often aim at optimizing parameters of pre-defined torque profiles for specific locomotor tasks, which cannot accommodate the continuously varying activities humans perform every day. Prevalent approaches also place emphasis on minimizing slow-converging energy expenditures associated with human locomotion, which is important for able-bodied persons but might not be of high priority for individuals with pathological gaits. The goal of this project is to provide a paradigm shift from task-specific, slow convergent customization to task-invariant, rapid customization. This research will facilitate active learning and adaptation of lower-limb exoskeletons to drastically reduce the cost of gait rehabilitation for nearly a million Americans who sustain a new stroke every year. Key parameters throughout gait rehabilitation such as body-weight support ratio will be automatically customized based on stroke subject's training progress, which will otherwise be tuned by a team of therapists and engineers that usually lasts for hours. This research will also promote the use of exoskeletons for able-bodied users in manufacturing sites, warehouses, battlefields, and other relevant scenes by reducing the associated costs in control parameter customization. The integrated education plan will help cultivate the next-generation wearable robot researchers and motivating K-12 students to further pursue STEM degrees. The human subject studies and exhibits will promote the awareness of wearable technologies among the public, especially among traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) investigate invariant assistive strategies in continuously varying locomotor tasks and environments, 2) construct a complete framework for customizing exoskeleton assistance across locomotor tasks, and 3) understand how the customization framework facilitates assistance adaptations to different user?s volitional motion and activities. Utilizing a two-layer optimization structure will rapidly determine task-invariant assistive strategies in the inner-loop through tracking the desired energetics or centroidal momentum of a virtual reference model, meanwhile updating its parameters in the outer-loop based on human performance-based cost functions. The research the PI and his team will conduct will investigate task-invariant assistive strategies that alter human body energetics and centroidal momentum, construct a complete, human-in-the-loop customization framework that rapidly customizes these two quantities, and validate its efficacy via experiments on human subjects across various locomotor tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the project will enhance academic experiences in non-major STEM courses with a goal to attract more underrepresented minority students from non-major science courses into Geology and Chemistry; two disciplines at WTAMU that have low representation of diverse student populations. The project is also committed to retaining students through meaningful and practical research experiences that can position students for success as undergraduate researchers and in prospective STEM careers and advanced degrees. By tailoring learning modules (through online bridge courses) and properly training STEM research faculty with effective teaching practices (through thoughtfully designed workshops), the project will be proactively (rather than reactively) preparing students for future job opportunities and participation in the U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>RBCURE will be guided by two project goals: to enhance undergraduate STEM education in non-major STEM courses and to improve student experiences in both the classroom and the research laboratory. Fulfilling the goals of RBCURE will be accomplished through four project activities: 1) curriculum design in two non-major science courses (Geology and Chemistry); 2) creation of two online bridge courses to facilitate transitioning from the course for non-majors to the subsequent course for students selecting a science major;3) development of a research faculty workshop on STEM mentoring; and 4) development of an online module system for new research students. The project objectives are: to have equitable representation of student success in redesigned Geology and Chemistry non-majors part one courses by increasing ABC/DFIX ratios; to evaluate the effectiveness of two online bridge courses for student success and recruitment into part two science major geology and chemistry courses; to assess the effectiveness of a research faculty development workshop designed to identify best practices for conducting undergraduate research; to improve research student experiences by providing online support modules intended to front-load research information that students would complete at the start of their research project; and to develop an IUSE-HSI Track 2 Implementation and Evaluation (IEP) proposal for submission that uses findings and lessons learned.

Although Mount Erebus has been active for several decades, much less is known about how magma is transported from the mantle to the lava lake at the summit. Prior seismological studies at Mount Erebus have focused on the explosions of the lava lake or the icequakes at the flanks of the volcano which only allow investigating the upper part of the magmatic plumbing system. However, these studies have not provided a systematic analysis of all the seismicity present at Mt. Erebus nor information about the deeper magmatic processes. This project will use artificial intelligence techniques to identify and locate new earthquakes in seismic data from the past three decades. These new earthquakes may highlight previously unconstrained parts of the magmatic system activity beneath Mt. Erebus.

Mount Erebus has been active for several decades and multiple seismological stations have recorded seismic signals such as icequakes and explosions from the lava lake. However, there has not been a systematic analysis of the seismicity at Mount Erebus to test the frequency of other seismic signals such as volcano-tectonic events or deep long period events. This research will apply several deep learning algorithms to all publicly available seismic data with the objectives of detecting, locating, and characterizing the full range of seismicity at Mt. Erebus. This new comprehensive analysis of seismicity will better reveal the dynamics of the magmatic plumbing system and will answer key questions such as (i) What parts of the magmatic system are seismically active? (ii) Are there any changes in the seismicity rate or the type of seismicity before, during, or after the eruptive activity at the lava lake? and (iii) Does the seismicity reflect one or more physical mechanisms (slow fault ruptures, the resonance of a fluid-filled crack, magma degassing, etc.) within the volcano?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The effects of wildfire on sediment transport are well studied, and indicate that the absence of vegetation and hydrophobic characteristics of burned soils create conditions that intensify overland flow during subsequent rain events and can mobilize large volumes of fine sediment and initiate debris flows. However, much of this understanding of post-fire hydrologic and geomorphic processes is derived from steep (>30 degrees) and forested landscapes. Post-fire processes in the lower-slope (<1?10 degrees) grassland and shrubland landscapes of the Texas Panhandle are unknown. This project will contribute important data for management of federally classified critical habitat that hosts an endangered fish species, the peppered chub. The project supports undergraduate research at three Hispanic Serving Institutions across Texas.<br/><br/>This study is crucial for understanding the magnitude and timing of post-fire sediment transport in shrublands. A major contribution of this work will be the collection of the first post-fire sediment transport measurements in low-sloping environments like the Texas Panhandle. Measurements of sediment grain size and regolith thickness will inform the degree to which sediment transport rates are limited by stress exerted by overland flow or sediment availability. This project will also constrain the importance of vegetation as an intermittent fire-mediated storage site in low-sloping environments. Finally, measurements of suspended sediment in the Canadian River and Lake Meredith will constrain the transport timescales for fine sediment from hillslopes and tributaries to reach the sediment sink of Lake Meredith.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classical computing has specific limitations in addressing certain cryptographic challenges. The emergence of quantum mechanics provides a unique opportunity to explore alternative approaches that can overcome these limitations and offer enhanced security guarantees, by exploiting the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics. No-cloning means that it is impossible to create an exact copy of quantum information. This offers a promising avenue to tackle problems that are otherwise impossible to solve solely using classical computers. The overarching goal of this project is to develop the foundations of unclonable cryptography. The project is accompanied by a comprehensive education plan to engage undergraduate students in research through new course development, colloquia series, undergraduate crash courses, and accompanied by recruitment efforts that leverage the UCSB Early Scholars program and the California Cal-Bridge program.<br/><br/>There are three main aims associated with the project. The first aim is to propose and study novel notions of encryption schemes and digital signatures equipped with robust guarantees for protecting secret keys. The approach exploits a witness encryption procedure using a quantum state. The second aim is to propose and study new cryptographic notions to protect against the unauthorized distribution of software, by leveraging properties of pseudorandom functions augmented by public verification. The third and final aim is to propose new frameworks, proof techniques, and black-box separations that will lead to a deeper understanding of the area of unclonable cryptography, and having conceptual parallels with indistinguishability obfuscation of classical cryptography. These directions are expected to place unclonable cryptography on more solid theoretical footing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the research in genomics involves the use such methods; that is to say, they require data from thousands of participants in order to detect subtle relationships between genes and health outcomes. The work of recruiting participants and organizing their data is an increasingly complex task, outpacing the ability of individual scientists to produce data at the scale they need to conduct research. To address this gap, a variety of private entities, healthcare providers, nonprofits, research collectives and governmental funding agencies have formed organizations called biobanks. Biobanks produce large amounts of genetic and health data that can be used across a number of research projects. While biobanks are undoubtedly necessary for big data research, they also transfer a number of critical data collection decisions from laboratory scientists to biobank designers and database administrators. This project offers insights into how biobank design affects discovery in human genomics. The aim is to contribute to public understanding of the impact of digital technologies on knowledge of human health and disease.<br/><br/>This research project examines biobanking practices across multiple organizations, building on the concept of epistemic infrastructures, meaning the tools that shape and constrain how we produce knowledge. The research explores three key questions: How biobanks make decisions about which data they will collect; how research communities adapt their research aims in response to those choices; and how biobanks change over time in response to pressures from both within and outside of the research communities they serve. To address these questions, the project uses a mixed-methods approach, which includes analyzing technical literature about biobank design, research literature produced using biobank data, conducting interviews with biobankers, and observing their work. In the process, this research uncovers the mechanisms by which biobanks influence genomic research and offers a new perspective on the relationship between data infrastructures and the production of scientific knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Worldwide, the tremendous growth of large utility-scale solar power plants in desert-like regions has put extreme pressure on local water resources for cleaning dust from solar panels.  A typical solar power plant of 100 megawatts can power 42,000 homes. Over its 25-year life, this power plant requires 38 million gallons of potable water, transported by 4750 tanker trucks, and incurs $22 million in cleaning costs (without even factoring in 25 years of inflation). Cleaning over one-quarter of a million dusty solar panels multiple times a year would still result in a loss of $51 million in energy sales due to this soiling from dust. Reducing these losses and avoiding all these costs has a great impact on lowering the cost of our electricity for homes, electric vehicles, and the growing electrification of society.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to lower the cost of solar electricity, improve the reliability and predictability of solar power plants, and, importantly, eliminate the use of water in the cleaning of dusty solar panels in these desert-like regions. To address technological and scientific challenges related to this new technology, the research?s efforts will include a combination of experiments and modeling to increase the size of prototypes and verify their performance in laboratory and field conditions. The outcomes of these efforts will result in improved efficiency, lower cost, and scalability of this new approach. Our industrial partners will guide the commercialization efforts to facilitate wide adoption of this technology by the solar industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This workshop aims to galvanize synthesis of recent scientific advances in geophysics, gas geochemistry, geology, and geodynamic modeling that provide new methods to quantify mantle magma supply. Intensive work to understand mantle supply is critical to efforts such as the Subduction Zones in 4D initiative (SZ4D), a large-scale community effort in Earth sciences to probe the processes that underlie subduction zone hazards. Key outcomes of the workshop will include new interdisciplinary scientific collaborations to quantify and model mantle magma supply and forward-looking recommendations for instrument deployment and prioritization in the context of magma imageability.

(2) What opportunities lie within engineering tools to address fundamental knowledge gaps in women?s health? Using these guiding questions, the theme of women?s health, defined broadly as all conditions that disproportionately impact women across their lifespan, will be addressed.  How engineering tools in the following core categories are applied currently to women?s health engineering will be explored and identified: (1) Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering; (2) Biomechanics and Mechanobiology; (3) Devices, Sensors and Photonics; (4) Immuno-engineering.  By convening a diverse group of biomedical engineers and scientists, the conference aims to leverage biomedical technologies' transformative potential to make fundamental discoveries in women's health. Success for the conference will be achieved by identifying and highlighting engineering tools not commonly used in the context of women?s health, thereby catalyzing new collaborative and exploratory pathways within women?s health engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Variation in energy metabolism probably plays an important role because energy drives behavior, and is especially important for behaviors requiring peak performance, such as mate attraction and escaping from predators. However, the exact relationship between energy use and behavior is still poorly understood, particularly for energetically costly natural behaviors that affect fitness. To address this gap, this project will use repeated measurements of energy use and signaling behavior in a treefrog to determine how these traits relate to one another and allow these frogs to perform extremely challenging behaviors. These measurements will be made under different temperatures to determine how environmental conditions could modify the energetic costs of behavior, which could help to understand how organisms will respond to climate change. The genetic basis of the relationship between energy and behavior will be investigated to determine how these traits could evolve and potentially identify important regions of the genome affecting energetics and performance. The educational goals of this project are to build scientific capacity and knowledge, targeting middle school students? knowledge of behavioral energetics, data interpretation skills and appreciation for the value of scientific research, as well as graduate students developing their mentorship skills. <br/><br/>Variation in behavioral expression is often driven by variation in energetic physiology, but how these traits covary and whether they do so at the among- or within-individual level is poorly known, actively debated, and key to understanding evolutionary and ecological outcomes. The goal of this project is to identify the physiological drivers of individual variation in competitive acoustic signals in treefrogs, how physiology affects signaling plasticity in the face of environmental change, and the genetic basis of energy-signal covariance. The proposed approach is to 1) determine the energetic basis for individual variation in signaling, using repeated measurements to quantify among- and within-individual variance components in resting metabolic rate and the metabolic cost of calling, 2) test the competing predictions of different energy allocation models to determine the metabolic basis of variation in signaling plasticity, 3) discover the consequences of environmental temperature variation on behavioral energetics and its underlying individual variation and 4) use genome-wide relatedness measures to estimate heritability and the genetic covariance of these traits. Together, this project will answer fundamental questions on the mechanistic basis of individual phenotypic variation and represents a major advance in these efforts by studying a trait that is energetically costly, repeatable, and under direct sexual selection. The scientific findings from this work will be used to build a series of lesson plans aimed at teaching principles of behavioral energetics to middle school science students, and to provide a structured mentorship training program for graduate students working with undergraduate researchers.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Behavioral Systems Cluster and the Integrative Ecological Physiology program  in the Division of Integrative and Organismal Systems, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluorescent proteins are widely used to watch and track biochemistry in living cells. However, the relationship between specific motions and structures of the protein and how this relates to the light-catalyzed motion of the chromophore is not fully understood. The proposed computational work will provide insight into these relationships with techniques that model the motion of the entire fluorescent protein and its reaction to light. This line of research is expected to support the development of new monomeric, red anion sensors, tunable photoswitchable dimers, and potentially create broadly applicable rational design principles to create new sensors. This project includes virtual and classroom-based research experiences in computational chemistry for undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to apply computational chemistry to the understanding and rational design of new fluorescent protein (FP) sensors. FPs are used ubiquitously in biochemical experiments and as tools in chemical biology, where they can be applied to image molecules or mechanisms of interest. The development of new FP sensors is largely empirical?the relationship between the atomic details of the protein structure and photophysics of FP chromophores is not well understood. This fundamental knowledge gap makes the creation of targeted FP sensors especially challenging. Our central hypothesis that there is a physical relationship between the structural ensemble of the protein on the ground state and the motion of the chromophore on the excited state that, if clearly understood, could aid in the creation of new sensors. To test this hypothesis, the Walker team will use a combined approach of classical molecular dynamics (MD), excited state nonadiabatic quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) dynamics, and machine learning (ML) to investigate specific systems with the aims of developing new fluorescent probes and establishing rational design principles for FP sensors more generally. This work will characterize the impact of surface mutations on the homotetrameric Dicosoma red fluorescent protein vs monomeric derivatives, design and study new anion-specific red FP sensors based on NeonGreen and endeavor to determine the mechanism of action for photodissociative Dronpa dimers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Steady growth in human population and rapid industrial development have led to greater demands for water production. At the same time, anthropogenic activities, agricultural practices, and the disposal of wastewater have led to salinization of natural freshwater resources. The desalination battery combines the functions of desalination and energy generation to reduce the energy and costs associated with desalination, addressing challenges at the intersection of the water-energy nexus. The goal of the proposed research is to accelerate the commercialization of the desalination battery by evaluating the effects of various solution components present in real feedwater types on the performance of the desalination battery. Successful development of the desalination battery will help to safeguard access to freshwater resources and ensure an adequate freshwater supply, which are essential to advance the health and welfare of the American public. <br/><br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to commercialize a new desalination technology, a desalination battery, which is based on the patented use of Bi as a Cl-storage electrode in combination with a Na-storage electrode. Like conventional batteries, the desalination battery stores and releases energy during the charging and discharging processes, but they are also coupled with the storage and release of Na+ and Cl-. As the energy consumed during charging is recovered during discharging, the net energy required for desalination is drastically reduced. Furthermore, since Na+ and Cl- are removed via ion-specific electrode reactions, the desalination battery enables membrane-free desalination. While efficient removal of NaCl has been demonstrated, the effects of various other solution components present in real wastewater and seawater are still unknown. The goal of the proposed work is to accurately evaluate the effects of different salinities, pH conditions, and various inorganic and organic species present in real feedwater on the performance of the desalination battery and develop mitigation plans for any problematic components. The success of the proposed work is critical to perform accurate technoeconomic calculations to prioritize the most promising feedwater types to target and develop a tailored commercialization plan for specific applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process typically begins in a research lab with an invention by a scientist who may or may not choose to engage in technology transfer activities, such as patenting and the licensing of patents. Such engagement is not a required job activity, since it goes beyond the scientist?s primary job activity as a basic researcher. The project team is collecting data to better understand scientist engagement in technology transfer at several institutes of the NIH. The project is the first large-scale study of behavioral and organizational factors that could be relevant to engagement in technology transfer. Specifically, the project team is collecting data on individual factors, such as perceived ambivalence toward technology transfer, perceived fairness in the treatment of scientists, and scientists? representation in historically marginalized groups. In addition, the team is collecting data on organizational support variables, including supervisory championing and extent of an organizational climate stressing technology transfer. The project has important managerial and public policy implications for those who manage and govern technology transfer at federal agencies and academic institutions.<br/><br/>The project involves data collection in two stages. First, initial interviews are conducted with the Scientific Directors of participating NIH Institutes. The purpose of these interviews is to provide insights on the unique characteristics of each Institute that may be relevant to technology transfer. Second, using survey methods, the study is multi-level in that it simultaneously assesses individual scientists within the context of their organization (i.e., Institutes). With this design, the project generates insights regarding potential variation within and between research centers, branches, and institutes of NIH.

Increasing numbers of Americans are experiencing care within Intensive Care Units (ICUs), which are hospital areas dedicated to the sickest patients and staffed by healthcare teams with advanced training in critical care medicine. Progress in the science and practice of critical care has improved survival among ICU patients. Yet some patients experience an extended period of ill-health after their ICU stay that is caused not only by illness but also by side-effects of interventions. For example, patients can suffer lasting muscle weakness from paralytic medicines used in sedation or symptoms of post-traumatic stress. These side-effects, which span physical, cognitive, and emotional domains of health, are collectively called Post-Intensive Care Syndrome. This syndrome can prevent former ICU patients from returning to their workplaces and family lives. However, it remains unclear how and by whom the medical and social ramifications of critical care can be addressed. This project will result in patient- and family-centered proposals for action to address and mitigate Post-Intensive Care Syndrome.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to understand how medical professionals and health systems can address the consequences of intensive medical care among ICU survivors. How do healthcare workers in ICUs expand their goals and practices from short-term rescue to address the longer-term outcomes associated with Post-Intensive Care Syndrome? What new forms of longitudinal care for patients after the ICU need to be engineered? What does this syndrome reveal about the values, priorities, and challenges that underlie American health systems? While clinicians and patients alike hope for recovery, uncertainty remains about what recovery means and how it is experienced. In tracing how ICU survivorship is transformed through care practices, healthcare policy, and patient experience, this project contributes new understandings of recovery beyond medical rescue that will help to inform healthcare improvement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ULVZs are thin patches of material that sit on the Earth?s core-mantle boundary (CMB), which is at a depth of 2891 km (1796 miles).  As their name implies, ULVZs slow passing seismic waves by as much as 50%. This makes which makes them some of the most anomalous features of the Earth?s interior.  Several ULVZs are beneath some of Earth?s largest hot spot volcanoes, such as Hawaii, Iceland, and Samoa.  Imaging of the Earth?s interior shows that hot rising materials, or mantle plumes, connect these volcanoes from ULVZs to the surface.  But the origin, lifetime, size, and composition of these ULVZs are not known, nor is their role in the formation of the mantle plumes. This project will provide greater details as to where these features exist, their formation and composition. This work analyzes two types of seismic waves sensitive to thin ULVZ layering that interact with and bounce off these ULVZ features.  The study focuses on an area beneath the western Pacific Ocean because of extensive seismic data coverage and known ULVZs in the region. The project will create a new seismic database built from public records and networks in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. This database will then enable imaging of ULVZ structures at the CMB using modern statistical capabilities.  Computer simulations of mantle flow will help interpret the formation, motion, and role in mantle processes of the ULVZs.  This project includes an annual outreach STEM event for K-8 students for the local community.  This event will include activities to teach about the mantle plumes that form Pacific Islands through hot spot volcanism.<br/><br/>Ultra-Low Velocity Zones (ULVZs) are structures with strongly reduced seismic velocities at Earth?s core-mantle boundary (CMB) which have been associated with or linked to hot-spot volcanism, Large Igneous Provinces, core-mantle interaction, downwelling subduction and Large-Low Velocity Provinces (LLVPs) and thus are a critical component of global mantle dynamics. ULVZs are typically studied using waveform analysis of ULVZ-sensitive seismic probes (e.g., SPdKS, ScP, ScS), but previous studies suffer from large uncertainties in ULVZ parameters due to modeling trade-offs and lack a geophysical inference of ULVZs through rigorous parameter estimation.  This project will develop a transformative waveform inversion approach and apply it to characterize ULVZ properties including their seismic velocities, density, size, and shape. Specifically, the project will (1) collect a new database of ULVZ-sensitive ScP and PcP waveforms utilizing publicly available seismic array data as well as new data from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the International Monitoring System (IMS) arrays, (2) advance capabilities for full waveform Bayesian inversion for ULVZ properties to quantitatively distinguish regions with and without ULVZ structures (i.e., Bayesian model selection), and to perform joint inversion of ScP and PcP waveforms, (3) quantify the waveform effects from 2-D/3-D ULVZ structures, (4) search for additional, previously unlooked-for arrivals in the ScP wavefield consistent with 3-D ULVZ structure using array processing approaches, and (5) relate observed ULVZ localities and properties to lowermost mantle flow and dynamics through 3D geodynamic models.

Effective management of invasive species requires that scientists understand how they compete successfully with native species. One of the least understood behaviors of invasive plants is that a single invasive species can dominate in many different types of environments. In particular, scientists have identified a group of ?superinvaders? that, counter to what is expected for native species, can grow very fast in sunlight but also tolerate heavy shade in the forest understory. Although there is good evidence that this behavior drives their increasing abundance in both temperate and tropical forests, scientists don?t understand how this occurs: why should invasive species play by different rules than native species in the same environment? One hypothesis is that invasive species have fewer pests than native species, and this advantage allows them to persist in stressful environments. In this project, ecologists will experimentally test this idea in many different types of forests to determine how this ?superinvader? behavior emerges. Moreover, by linking how plants simultaneously respond to pests and environmental stress, scientists will better understand how species coexist to foster native biodiversity. The project will train two US doctoral students, one postdoctoral scholar and numerous undergraduate students. The project will foster international collaboration, research partnerships and knowledge transfer across the Americas. This will benefit US scientists, doctoral student trainees and postdoctoral scholar. A new Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the University of South Carolina and a summer workshop in Puerto Rico will contribute to broadening participation by undergraduate students from groups under-represented in science and technology. The postdoctoral scholar will lead an effort to create a Forest Superinvader Network that will increase the scope of this project to the global level to facilitate international knowledge transfer and more effective forest and land management worldwide through better understanding of plant invasion mechanisms.<br/><br/>The project involves two components. In the first, research teams will monitor the growth and survival of native and invasive tree saplings across lights gradients in 10 locations across the Americas, including temperate forests in Connecticut and South Carolina, tropical forests in Mexico, Costa Rica, and the Caribbean, and subtropical forests in southern Brazil. Using field measurements of metabolic activity of different tissues above- and belowground, researchers will test the hypothesis that lower energy costs in invaders, as a result of fewer pests, allows these invaders to circumvent functional tradeoffs typically associated with fast growth and shade tolerance. In a second component conducted in five locations, researchers will experimentally remove insects and fungal pathogens from native and invasive saplings to test whether shade tolerance is driven by pest loads. In both components, researchers will build and test integrative models of plant behavior that consider the energetic costs of seemingly disparate behaviors (e.g., resource capture versus defense) to further scientific understanding of critical linkages between plant functional ecology and population dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One component focuses on the study of enzymes with Fe4 clusters and analogues with Fe3M, M = Fe or Mo. The focus is on ?organometallic? states of these clusters, which feature an Fe-C bond. Once thought to be rare in life, such states are now proposed as intermediates in terpenoid-biosynthesis enzymes and are found as intermediates central to the function of the world?s largest superfamily of metalloenzymes, the ?radical-SAM (RS)? enzymes, with over 700,000 members identified throughout all forms of life, which carry out a spectacular diversity of essential reactions. A second component will investigate the active site cofactor of isozymes of the enzyme nitrogenase, Fe7M, M = Mo, V, or Fe.  In terms of societal Impact, the response to aims of teaching, training, and learning can be viewed as forming a pyramid. At the apex are intellectual/scientific contributions to the discipline and to the research community. Supporting these are contributions to the training of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates, not only in this group but in those of collaborators. A critical component of this outreach pyramid is an effort to broaden participation in the scientific enterprise, with focus on women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)/electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) studies of biomimetic synthetic [Fe3,M;S4]3+?alkyl/alkene/alkyne clusters, M = Fe, Mo, are expected to enhance understanding of intermediates of terpenoid-biosynthesis and RS enzymes, with comparison of the [Fe3,M;S4], M = Fe and Mo clusters offering insights into the role of the Mo in modulating the properties of the nitrogenase Fe7Mo catalytic cofactor. Furthermore, as shown by this program, the three nitrogenase isozymes function through a universal mechanism involving ten states, denoted En, n = 0-8. The n = even states of Mo-nitrogenase are EPR active and a majority have been characterized by EPR and ENDOR. In contrast, the n = odd states of the V- and Fe-nitrogenases are EPR-active, and given the mechanistic universality, their study will enable probing the catalytic n = odd states. New constructs of the nitrogenase isozymes will be used to probe whether reactivity differences among the three isozymes derive from influences of the different heterometals or from the differing isozyme active-site environments. In terms of broad scientific impact, better understanding of the nitrogenase enzyme is of great importance.  It is well to remember that the enzyme nitrogenase  carries out biological nitrogen fixation, the conversion of gaseous N2 to two molecules of ammonia, the biologically usable form of nitrogen and that approximately half the world?s human population depends on nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Molecular Biophysics cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These regions harbor unique ecosystems only found in waters without oxygen, and they are important for Earth?s climate. Specifically, the production of nitrogen gas by two microbial processes, anammox and denitrification can control how productive the oceans are. Yet how much each process shapes ocean chemistry within these areas remains unknown. This project aims to study the oxygen deficient waters of the eastern tropical North Pacific ocean to better understand the mechanisms shaping marine nitrogen and carbon chemistry. Through this work, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students at three universities. The project aims to broaden participation in and understanding of ocean sciences by developing public videos about the methods used and the science behind the project. <br/> <br/>The investigators will conduct a research cruise in the eastern tropical North Pacific ocean, the largest oxygen deficient zone. They will measure many nutrients including inorganic carbon and nitrogen and natural abundance stable isotopes of nitrogen compounds. They will use these patterns to establish how the major reactions work together to control nitrogen cycling and gaseous nitrogen production. In addition, a high-resolution model of the ocean will reveal the influence of ocean mixing, set the timescales for reactions, and enable synthesis of the measurements into a global context. The work will determine how the input of oxygen through mixing controls chemistry, and it will distinguish between the processes restricted to the permanently anoxic core vs. those that tolerate (or are enhanced by) occasional oxygenation. Overall, the project will provide new information about nitrogen cycling pathways (anammox, denitrification, and nitrite oxidation) across the region and link the resulting isotopic signals to the global nitrogen budget.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conducting successful research cruises on these ships requires that scientists (particularly those in supervisory roles on the survey trips ? or ?chief scientists?) understand the logistics of how to request time on ships, how to coordinate personnel and equipment, how to plan for operations and survey tasks at sea, and how to work with vessel crew and staff ? as well as how to deal with unexpected issues which may arise. To maintain a robust scientific workforce that can effectively request, plan, and lead this type of work, early career scientists need to gain training and experience, with consideration for some of the unique challenges faced at both poles such as planning routes through sea ice. There is a particular need for this training and capacity-building at the present time, given increasing arctic research interests and a lag in research cruises (and thus junior scientist training) during the COVID-19 pandemic. To equip and motivate a new generation of seagoing polar oceanographers to use these assets, the project team will host a training cruise on USCGC Healy for approximately twenty early career participants with support from four science mentors and one or more community observers. Participants will participate in virtual pre-cruise meetings, a one-day pre-cruise workshop, and a variety of training modules on the cruise to develop proficiency, build confidence, and become part of an early career polar oceanographer cohort. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The Arctic and Antarctic are hotspots for environmental change and cutting-edge research on oceanographic processes spanning an array of disciplines. Presently the U.S. science community uses a limited suite of vessels for polar oceanographic research, including USCG icebreakers as well as some foreign and private contract research vessels. The barriers to entry for using these platforms are relatively high for junior scientists. Investigators must be familiar with protocols and procedures for requesting these specialized vessels, must have knowledge of how to effectively plan and lead cruises (which sometimes involve multiple and multi-national project teams), and must effectively interface with polar community needs and sensitive ecosystems. As a result, new investigators may be hesitant to propose and lead such cruises, which in turn may limit the amount of novel research being proposed for the U.S. fleet. To equip and motivate a new generation of seagoing polar oceanographers to use these assets, the project team will host a training cruise on USCGC Healy for approximately twenty early career participants with support from four science mentors and one or more community observers. The proposed early career ?Chief Scientist? training program will be conducted on an opportunistic transit of Healy through the Northwest Passage, to train participants about the complexities of planning international research cruises and working with multiple specialists including officers, community observers, crew, and technicians as well as interdisciplinary colleagues. Participants will collect measurements and data along the route to use for educational purposes and/or provide pilot data for new proposals. The program will emphasize training in seagoing logistics, cohort building, a positive and supportive at-sea culture, communication with other leaders and specialists, problem-solving skills, and operational awareness and planning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current pathological grading/classification system requires extensive information processing by a human brain to interpret highly complex data resources. Histopathology, as the cornerstone of disease diagnosis, has advanced significantly with technological innovations allowing for the capture of images at greater speed and resolution. However, most current histopathological image analysis methods often overlook the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Understanding the intricate interactions among various cell types, which form the cellular components and, in turn, tissue architectures, is crucial for insights into biology and disease status. Analyzing pathological images is crucial, but effectively integrating associated biomedical text data, such as pathological reports, preliminary diagnosis reports, and clinical notes, poses additional challenges. This variety of text data is defined as medical captions, akin to extended image captions, which provide necessary context but also introduce further complexity in diagnostics. Enhanced computational methods that simultaneously leverage pathological slides and their captions could revolutionize the accuracy and efficiency of predicting clinical outcomes.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop novel pathological image-text analysis tools for clinical outcome prediction. The project will focus on 1) developing algorithms for pathological image analysis, which include auto-prompting fine-tuning framework for subtype cell segmentation, cell-level graph learning, patch-level graph learning, and intelligent integration of cell-level graph and patch-level graph for clinical outcome prediction; 2) fine-tuning large language models using biomedical text data to obtain improved text embeddings, which include the development of algorithms for biomedical text data analysis, incorporating fine-tuning of deep pre-trained models for precise biomedical text data representation; 3) Integrating pathological image data with biomedical text data for clinical outcome prediction, which include novel algorithms for the intelligent integration of multi-modal data and cross-modal learning models to generate biomedical text data representation from the histopathological images of the same patient. The successful realization of these aims promises to provide healthcare professionals with powerful tools to enhance the decision-making process, personalize treatment plans, and improve overall patient outcomes. Additionally, the proposed study stands to offer broader insights into the integration of multi-modal medical data, setting a new standard for how medical informatics can be leveraged in the era of big data and precision medicine. The multidisciplinary nature of this project also provides unique opportunities for integrating its components into existing curricula, as well as inspiring scientific interests in K-12 students and underrepresented students. The results of this project will be disseminated in the form of peer-reviewed publications, open-source software, tutorials, seminars, and workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In doing so, cells are able to assess what goes on in their environment and respond accordingly. Inspired by this function, the objective of this CAREER project is to develop unique strategies that enable the introduction of responsive pore-forming structures into polymeric vesicles. Specifically, the work aims to use tube-like macromolecules, known as core-shell bottlebrushes, to emulate the gating function of transmembrane proteins and enable a new class of materials that respond to mechanical activation, optical stimulation, changes in acidity, etc. These cell-like structures will help devise multiresponsive systems that may ultimately be capable of mimicking senses such as touch, sight, and smell. Building upon the results of this research endeavor, one can readily envision to use similar systems for applications such as targeted drug delivery, sensing, as well as active filtration devices for high-value applications. Concomitantly with these scholarly activities, community events will be used to promote STEM education to the general public and, particularly, underrepresented minorities. These activities will include initiatives that transcend the arts and sciences, encourage budding grade-school scientists to become makers, and provide graduate students with the tools to be scientific/technological global thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2: Technical summary<br/><br/>The underlying goal of this research is to comprehend the crucial phenomena directing the co-assembly of blocky linear and bottlebrush (BB) amphiphilic copolymers towards the fabrication of bioinspired multiresponsive polymersomes. To this end, an integrative and directed strategy that relies on three connected aims was devised: (i) structural evaluation of amphiphilic triblock copolymers (e.g. stiffness, interdigitation, side-chain length), (ii) understanding of the co-assembly of amphiphilic linear and BB block copolymers, and (iii) bestowing of multi-stimuli-responsiveness to polymersomes by incorporating pore-forming BB triblocks in membranes using stimuli such as pH, light, and mechanical force. The numerous parameters that can be controlled in BBs, often orthogonally, such as persistence length, grafting length and density, make them especially alluring for this project. This work aims to bring about hitherto underexplored aspects of the self-assembly of complex polymeric architectures and their co-assembly with conventional linear block copolymers. The broader results of this work may be implemented in the fabrication of intricate, compartmentalized polymersomes that emulate cellular processes, but also in systems such active filtration membranes and/or targeted delivery systems that rely on on-demand cargo release. The PI will also implement several activities to encourage diversity and promote STEM universally and enhance participation of underrepresented minorities. These activities will include maker conferences and hackathons, as well as blending arts and sciences by exploiting the inherent visual appeal of stimuli-responsive materials.

Well-publicized over the last few decades is the lack of healthcare solutions for diseases in preemie babies, who are born to mothers with significant socioeconomic inequalities. Case in point, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common and often fatal gastrointestinal, or gut, emergency in premature infants that disproportionately affects African American babies. The disease has not only confounded doctors and nurses for 200 years, but also these neonatal emergencies are also frightening to almost all preemie care providers due to its high mortality rate.  Its healthcare in the US requires $3 billion annually due to repeated x-ray testing, surgery, longer hospital stays, and long-term complications of its survivors. An early and accurate diagnostic test for NEC would be a disruptive paradigm shift in preemie intensive care: it would enable medical intervention to be more effective, reduce risk of disease progression, decrease medical care expenses by hundreds of millions annually, and lower mortality.<br/><br/>The proposed project will develop requisite reagents for a diagnostic test that will enable detection of infant proteins that play a role in gut health.  Absolute quantitation is a prerequisite for data interpretation and validation between experiments, laboratories, and testing platforms. Research objectives are directed toward critical technical hurdles: (1) determination of optimal reference standard to quantitate host biomolecules in clinical settings and (2) understanding the usage limitations of these reference standards in the background of high variation in the human population. Native and recombinant candidates will be compared and analyzed with various methods.  Anticipated results are reference standards that are age-specific for diagnostic use in the most fragile and smallest patients and that are acceptable to regulatory stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Persistent nutrient pollution has caused eutrophication and harmful algal blooms globally, estimated to cost more than 4 billion dollars annually in the United States alone. Nutrient pollution threatens ecosystems and food production. Soil erosion will continue to grow with the global urban population. The United States has spent more than a trillion dollars to improve water quality since 1972, equivalent to annual spending of $100 per American, making clean water arguably one of the most expensive environmental investments, more than the cost of clean air. Understanding water quality dynamics is essential yet has remained a major challenge, partly due to its complex nature and data scarcity. This project aims to improve understanding of water quality dynamics by developing forecasting tools and advancing knowledge on how and why water quality changes under different conditions and places. The outcomes will help policymakers, water managers, and the broader public to make informed decisions that ensure the sustainability of water resources.<br/><br/>Despite tremendous progress and efforts in the past decades, water quality measurements have remained arduous and expensive, leading to inconsistent data coverage. Understanding of water quality dynamics therefore is often limited to individual sites. The project aims to determine the patterns of and processes that regulate concentration-discharge relationships of water quality variables across the United States. The project will focus on common water quality variables, including nitrate, total phosphorus, and turbidity (a proxy for total suspended sediment). The project will test whether spatial patterns of concentration-discharge relationships are driven predominantly by land use (relative to other drivers) that regulates hydrological flow paths and source water biogeochemistry. The hypotheses will be tested using Process-Guided Deep Learning integrating traditional Long Short-Term Memory models with reactive transport models. The integration will address the limitations of data scarcity and the ""black box"" nature of deep learning models, and advance predictive accuracy.

Heritable aggregated protein assemblies in yeast and other fungi, known as fungal prions, provide a new mechanism for the inheritance and memory, as they control heritable traits that are not directly encoded in DNA sequence but are passed between generations in the form of rearranged proteins. This project will investigate how heritable aggregates are initially generated from a non-aggregated protein. Understanding the formation of heritable aggregates is important for linking environmental and physiological processes, such as cell stress, to heritable properties of cells and organisms. This may also help improve industrial applications, such as production of alcohol and biofuels by yeast. Research project will be integrated with course development, teaching and mentoring, thus contributing to education of diverse workforce in the areas of genetics, biochemistry and biotechnology. It will provide additional support for research infrastructure by strengthening interdisciplinary interactions. <br/><br/>The unifying hypothesis tested in this project is that the ability to form a heritable aggregate in vivo is modulated by complex interactions between aggregation-prone proteins, cellular factors and environment, and is under the evolutionary pressure that is minimizing uncontrolled aggregation. This hypothesis will be tested in proposed experiments. Pathways linking environmental stress to heritable protein aggregation will be uncovered. Mechanisms underlining the abilities of some protein aggregates to promote aggregation of other proteins will be studied. Divergence of protein aggregation capabilities in evolution will be addressed. Relationships between reversible protein condensates, formed by liquid-liquid phase separation, and irreversible protein aggregates will be deciphered. Emergence of molecular features that make protein aggregates heritable will be investigated. Interactions of newly generated aggregates with stress-induced protein folding helpers, termed chaperones, will be explored. The project will employ a combination of genetic, cytological, biochemical and biophysical techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As chicken is a widely consumed source of live-animal protein globally, there is a growing consumer preference for ethically raised animals. The project addresses this demand by fostering improved welfare practices in poultry farming. There are collaborative movements with major producers and institutional consumers to establish evidence-based welfare standards impacting entire supply chain. With a declining agricultural workforce in the United States, it is essential to have automated mechanisms to extend a farmer?s capabilities. This project will develop a smart monitoring system for the birds meeting these needs, resulting in improved bird welfare and amplification of the farmer?s capacity.<br/> <br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project uses audio monitoring and machine listening to measure animal behavior. Since poultry operations differ significantly from farm to farm and over the life of the chicken as it grows from chick to a mature bird, the machine learning algorithms must adapt. The monitoring systems must be appliance-like in that they do not require expertise or any more than minimal involvement on the part of the farmer. This research will result in the advancement and productization of acoustic machine learning algorithms which search out unusual behaviors in the animals in their environment and provide early indications of distress, sickness, discomfort, and feed and water issues to the grower based on intelligent listening and inference. Acoustic approaches do not disturb the animals, are more robust than video for long-term deployment in dusty environments, and operate around the clock and in the dark. By providing early actionable insights to the grower, this technology can correct problems early, thereby improving not only the animal?s welfare, but their productivity as well. By deploying inexpensive microphones at multiple locations in a grow-out house, activities and problems can be localized, bringing precision livestock technology to flock-based animal management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enhancers are sequences in genomes that control when and where genes are expressed and have profound roles during development of multicellular organisms. While they do not code for proteins, the information that enhancers contain is encoded as binding sites for transcription factors (TFs), which are key proteins in gene regulation. It is thought that a key contributor to enhancer function is grammar, or the characteristics of TF binding sites, such as type, number, binding affinities, and arrangement. However, there are still many questions about the principles of enhancer grammar and how those underlie mechanisms for gene regulation. A deeper understanding of enhancers will help us predict phenotypes from genetic information and can be applied in other areas, such as medicine and agriculture. This project will study enhancer grammar in nave-state pluripotent stem cells, which represent the earliest stages of mammalian development. In addition to advancing knowledge about how gene regulation is encoded into the genome, this work will engage 25-50 undergraduate students per year in mentored, investigative, and original research in preparation for science careers.<br/><br/>To investigate grammatical constraints that underlie nave-state specific enhancer function, this project will focus on the enhancers for the nave-state gene Klf4, which contain binding sites for the TFs OCT4, SOX2, ESRRB and STAT3. Preliminary work has indicated that low-affinity TF binding sites are critical for the nave-state specific function of one Klf4 enhancer. To illuminate the role of this binding affinity constraint in transcription activation mechanisms, this project will utilize molecular approaches to measure the effects of optimizing TF binding sites in this enhancer. Prior studies also have shown that TFs bind to the Klf4 enhancers in a hierarchical order, suggesting that the arrangement of TF binding sites is key to facilitate enhanceosome assembly, particularly interactions among TFs at the Klf4 enhancers. To address these questions, this research will utilize a combination of reporter assays, gene editing, and molecular techniques. Lastly, this project will apply knowledge from these and prior studies of the Klf4 enhancers to other nave-state specific enhancers. A combination of bioinformatics and molecular biology techniques will be employed to identify and analyze putative nave-state specific enhancers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic computational problem is to infer attributes of the nodes, such as subgroups among them, by only observing the connections between the nodes.  The same problem arises in numerous contexts such as protein-protein interaction networks or gene regulatory networks in biology, disease spread models in epidemiology and fraud detection in financial networks.  More generally, these computational problems are examples of ""Bayesian estimation"" which consists of determining hidden values from observations, that are often noisy and local.  Greater the number of observations, it gets computationally easier to infer the hidden values.  In other words, there is a tradeoff between data/observations collected vs computational resources needed.  This project aims to pin-down the minimum number of observations needed to make the computational problem of inference feasible, for a large class of Bayesian inference problems.  Concretely, a major theme in the project will be to precisely determine the minimum number of observations at which a  powerful algorithmic technique called ""sum-of-squares SDPs"" can efficiently infer the hidden quantities.  Bayesian estimation problems arise naturally in a vast variety of real-life applications, and the project's results will likely shed light on the computational limits for this entire class.<br/><br/>Bayesian estimation is the problem of inferring the values of hidden variables from observed data.  Formally, the problem is specified by a joint distribution over a set of hidden variables  and observations.  The algorithmic problem is to (even approximately) infer the hidden values  given the observations, using the Bayes rule.   The central focus of this project are a class of Bayesian estimation problems analogous to classical constraint satisfaction problems.  Specifically, these are Bayesian estimation problems where the observations are local, in that each of them depend on a small number of hidden values, and are noisy.  For brevity, we refer to these problems as ``Bayesian CSPs"".    They generalize a variety of models like planted CSPs, semi-random models, and stochastic block models.  There is an emerging precise and comprehensive theory of computational complexity of random instances of Bayesian CSPs.  Inspired by ideas from statistical physics, this theory predicts that Bayesian CSPs undergo a computational phase transition wherein they abruptly go from being computationally easy to intractable, as one increases the number of observations  This project will pursue the following research directions.<br/>1. (SoS lower bounds) Sum-of-squares SDPs are one of the most powerful and general algorithmic techniques known.  The project will establish lower bounds for sum-of-squares SDPs as evidence towards computational hardness of random Bayesian CSPs upto the predicted computational phase transition.<br/>2. (Reductions)  Classical complexity theory compares computational difficulty of different problems by reducing problems to each other.    This project aims to develop polynomial-time reductions between different Bayesian CSPs or the same Bayesian CSP in different parameter regimes.  <br/>3. (Beyond random instances) The project will transfer algorithmic insights developed in the context of random Bayesian CSPs, to worst-case settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Web browsers are applications that view web pages; popular ones include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Samsung Internet, and Mozilla Firefox. They use a variety of algorithms to run web applications quickly. One of the most important that applies to a web browser component called its rendering engine, is invalidation. Invalidation means reusing previously-computed results when they could not have changed in the meanwhile. While simple in concept, invalidation is difficult in practice because tracking what can and can not change is extremely difficult. Bugs incorrectly reuse old results or incorrectly recompute unchanged results, and that causes web applications to look wrong, stutter, or freeze. In this project, the investigator presents new programming techniques that automatically track what can and can not change, removing the hardest part of invalidation. If successful, web browsers could adopt these techniques and run web applications faster with fewer bugs. That would ultimately serve the national prosperity by improving software developers' productivity and making more software accessible over the web. The new techniques and tools will be widely disseminated. Research will be integrated into education and training for students, developers and users of web browsers. <br/><br/>Technically, browser invalidation algorithms are a set of cache invalidation algorithms for data with tree-structured dependencies. These algorithms are essential to reducing browser rendering latency. Today, these algorithms are written manually and susceptible to both under- and over-invalidation bugs. The projects explores a new monadic abstraction for tracking tree-structured dependencies between data values and automatically propagating invalidation messages (""dirty bits"") through this dependency graph. A programming interface based on Resource Allocation Is Initialization (RAII) techniques and abstract invalidation allows integrating this abstraction into existing rendering engines. To test whether invalidation bugs are in fact eliminated, the investigator plans to build a black-box invalidation testing tool for web browsers, which will automatically search for invalidation bugs, which should confirm a dramatic reduction in bugs using the invalidation abstraction. To reduce runtime overhead, a compile-time policy framework will allow incrementally annotating protected data so that the dependency-tracking abstraction compiles down to code competitive with today's manual invalidation algorithms. Finally, a tracing system that combines performance counters such as RDTSC with the dependency graph allows attributing computation time to individual HTML elements and Cascading style sheets (CSS) properties and highlighting that performance data in the browser developer tools. In combination, these thrusts aim to make web browsers faster and less buggy while improving web application developers' ability to adapt their applications to web browser invalidation for greater performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced computing resources have increasingly become a critical production factor for the advancement of science and national competitiveness. However, the utilization of such advanced computing resources tends to give advantages to well-resourced institutions and widen the equity gap between these institutions and minority or other under-resourced institutions. This project aims to provide data-enabled pathways to advance equity in the utilization of advanced computing resources. To achieve the goal, the research team implements three interconnected tasks: (a) understanding and defining equity from the stakeholders' perspectives, (b) studying and designing pathways to equity in utilization, and (c) developing and implementing a knowledge portal featuring an interactive data platform to support these pathways to more equitable utilization. These pathways unlock the talents and insights of the researchers in underserved institutions and fields of science for advancing scientific discovery and elevating national competitiveness. <br/><br/>This research studies and provides data-enabled pathways to equity in publicly-supported cyberinfrastructure utilization for scientific discovery. Cyberinfrastructure integrates hardware, software, people, and systems to provide geographically dispersed but operationally integrated advanced computing services to researchers. Equity is a core public value but a concern for utilizing cyberinfrastructure that favors high-capacity research institutions and principal investigators. The NSF?s cyberinfrastructure programs serve as an empirical focal point for understanding equity due to their scale, distributional effects, and impacts on scientific discovery. This project team assembles a database of NSF cyberinfrastructure utilization for 25,798 projects, encompassing 10,277 principal investigators, 1,044 organizations, and 215 science fields from 2003 to 2022. This research adopts a mixed-methods exploratory sequential design by gathering, analyzing, and integrating data from (a) combining the interactive data platform with a stakeholder-focused qualitative interpretive process and (b) analyzing a socio-technical networked system by considering levels and dynamics of cyberinfrastructure activities. This research advances knowledge and practice about equity in publicly-supported advanced computing cyberinfrastructure, the pathways to achieve a more equitable utilization, and the role of an interactive data and knowledge platform to enable these pathways. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Science of Science program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This affordable high-performance geolocated wireless monitoring system detects unsafe loads and movements on buildings, especially flat commercial rooftops found on schools, distribution centers, office buildings, malls, factories, arenas, apartments, condominiums, and warehouses.  This project will innovate scientific and technological advancements that realize the promise of the Internet of Things, generating not just useful products demanded by the marketplace but products that can save lives and fundamentally improve life cycle infrastructure management. The affordability of our technology directly benefits disadvantaged communities, especially in rural areas where resources are severely limited, and serious infrastructure and substandard building problems tend to linger for years.  In 2015, it was reported on a major national channel that more than 160 roofs collapsed or faced imminent collapse in Massachusetts alone due to snow load throughout 2014-2015.  This SBIR project will inform precisely where unsafe rooftop snow and water loads exist to ensure resources are allocated in advance and as required.<br/><br/>The proposed project efficiently pinpoints risks in flat roof structures at an affordable cost.  All 5.9 million commercial buildings in the USA are vulnerable to the destructive forces of nature and negligence. Out of building failures that occur for known reasons, accumulated ice, snow, and/or liquid water account for 33% of incidents.  Dilapidation caused by a lack of maintenance, which makes up 30.7% of known-cause building failures, often develops slowly and is not apparent immediately. Complete or partial building collapses leave occupants at risk of mortal injury and the valuable property contained in the structure lost or damaged.  Avoiding damage to large-scale infrastructure will save society significant resources and reduce lost productivity. Even minor collapses impact business continuity, affecting revenues and often the larger community, in the case of grocery stores and similar institutions.  The sensor technology improves greatly upon current structural health monitoring methods, limited to single-dimension measurements, higher system costs, and complex installations. The project will develop sets of battery-powered wireless sensors and deploy them across several building rooftops.  An intuitive online application will be developed to display building health data and provide users with alerts when loads exceed safety thresholds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On other celestial bodies (e.g. Mars), this platform can similarly be utilized to enable early exploration and development with minimal wraparound infrastructure investments.  The subject of the SBIR project is an electromechanical mass transfer system; this will be the first such innovation that enables a cost-effective mass transfer in low gravity environments leveraging centrifugal acceleration. This platform can enable the movement of resources through space without the use of consumable fuels or on-board propulsion systems, unlocking more cost-effective space operations. The successful execution of this project will enable swift TRL raising of the platform. The comprehensive testing and validation process will demonstrate the capabilities of our technology to potential customers and stakeholders, providing tangible evidence of its reliability, accuracy, and efficiency. The successful development of the platform can provide the mobility required to empower robust exploration, science, and economic development on the surface of the Moon. This platform will be more economical than other alternatives due to its low mass and plug-and-play functionality. Ultimately, the system aims to provide the cheapest, most comprehensive logistics services that catalyze the promising lunar market.   <br/> <br/>This SBIR Phase I Project will address the technical challenges associated with transporting resources across the lunar surface with a novel electromechanical ""throwing"" platform.

Over 600,000 people die from cancer in the United States each year, and cancer cases among the younger population are on the rise. Currently, only a handful of cancers, such as breast, colon, cervical, and prostate, have recommended early screening, and sadly, 70% of cancer deaths are caused by cancers without recommended screening. Early detection, coupled with accurate monitoring and surgery in appropriate cases, appears to be the ideal strategy to improve outcomes and quality of life and reduce healthcare costs. The availability of novel diagnostic technology for minimally invasive biomarker analysis using biofluids to accurately predict malignancy potential would greatly benefit patients and clinicians in the early diagnosis and management of deadly cancers. Development of the technology proposed herein would have a broad impact on the cancer diagnostic space in terms of accurate early detection and diagnosis, quality of life, mortality, and healthcare burden. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop multi-marker diagnostic assays to bridge a critical gap from biomarker discovery to diagnostic assay translation. This project leverages principles from synthetic chemistry, enzymology, spectroscopy, and engineering, leading to a novel biosensing platform that couples Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) and a protease turnover assay to provide highly accurate methods for biomarker detection. This project will lead to developing next-generation sensors to meet the unique requirements for a multi-molecular protease activity assay from highly viscous, proteinaceous clinical samples and deliver a stackable assay workflow readily accessible to clinical laboratory staff with rapid turnaround. The technological hurdles that will be addressed during Phase I will include: 1) synthetic development of ultrasensitive SERS-active dyes and their conjugates with substrates of proteases associated with high-grade dysplasia in pancreatic cysts and other cancers, and 2) development and optimization of a multiplexed multi-protease turnover assay employing the aforementioned substrates using an automated-SERS detection platform with high-throughput capability for eventual commercialization in a CLIA lab setting.

The new computer system will replace servers that are roughly a decade old and showing signs of critical failure. The new system includes (1) a main server for all user account homes, all software packages, and will handle mass storage for our growing global seismic data set; (2) a backup server; and (3) and a small firewall server. The overarching objective of the new computer system will be to support both current and future NSF-funded research projects, which predominantly focuses on cutting-edge investigations of Earth and planetary interiors. The new system is specially designed and built for a paradigm shift in seismic mapping of the interior using massive global data sets, and automated methodologies to mine, process, and analyze the data. All developed software, data products, and models will be made publicly available. The new system will allow continued mentoring and training of students and postdocs in seismological/geophysical research on Earth and planetary interiors, which helps them in successful job placement.

The GCF supports the research of seismological graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, research staff, and faculty as well as undergraduate research projects. The current, decade old servers in the GCF are showing signs of critical failure: disk controllers as well as hard disks have failed on our two main servers (resulting in loss of storage capacity). In addition, and most importantly, the hardware is now too old for operating system updates which not only present a security issue but effectively stunts ongoing research activities. Funds from this grant will be used to purchase three new servers to replace the aging four-server system. The new system includes a main server that will house all user account homes, all software packages, and will handle mass storage for our growing global seismic data set; it will also include a backup server and a small firewall server. The main server will host a software suite recently written by our group that automatically collects (and soon will automatically process) data from nearly two dozen data agencies. This ?big data? project involves storage capacity of over 150 Tb. Servers are tailored to the variety of seismological research project needs, allowing our NSF-funded research activities such as code development, access to GCF's in-house mass storage of global seismic data, and software applications for data processing, as well as web services and backups. Researchers can access the centralized updated GCF system from anywhere, via a  remote connection on their computers. This centralized server model is effective for our large data set and heavy computational seismological research needs, since it is not possible to locally store even a fraction of the GCF data and software on local user machines. Research mentoring beyond traditional seismology students will be made possible from planned data products created from the growing global data set.

Water quality best management practices (BMPs) are a popular method to prevent pollutants from entering the water bodies and to achieve the goals set by TMDL.  This action usually requires cooperation among different experts, data sharing, and engaged stakeholder involvement. This NSF project aims to improve our understanding of how to manage water quality better at different spatial scales. Three theories regarding human-environment interactions will lay the groundwork for our analyses. This project combines modeling, data analysis, and surveys to study farmers? BMP implementation decisions at different spatial scales.<br/><br/>The project is structured around three research tasks (RTs). RT1 engages stakeholders and experts in the project advisory board via regular meetings. The research team interviews and surveys local farmers to evaluate factors influencing the implementation of BMPs in the study area. RT2 involves the development of a two-way coupled agent-based water quality model, in which farmers are agents. The model simulates the agents? decisions and implementation of BMP using the Bayesian inference method based on socio-psychological theories. RT3 uses numerical experiments to evaluate the effect of future climate and socioeconomic scenarios and human behavior uncertainty on TMDL targets.

The principal investigator plans to use game theory to understand the circumstances under which economic agents (such as firms and politicians) have incentives to take socially desirable actions in long-term relationships. The research seeks to answer the following specific questions. First, does a firm have incentives to supply a high quality product when the market has limited information about its past behavior? Second, what kind of information should online platforms provide to consumers in order to motivate sellers to build a reputation for supplying high quality product? Third, can researchers deliver robust predictions on firms? behaviors that can be tested using data?<br/><br/>The principal investigator will answer these questions by using novel methods in the theory of repeated games, reputation, and learning. The first project analyzes how consumers? ability to observe other consumers? choices (i.e., observational learning) affects each seller?s incentives to build a reputation for supplying high quality. Consumers? information is summarized by a stochastic network, which determines whether a consumer?s action can be observed by each of their successors. The results identify network structures under which observational learning strengthens reputational incentives as well as those that cause reputational incentives to break down. The second project analyzes situations where consumers do not have detailed information about the firm?s history. The analysis sheds light on the effects of long social memories, the coarsening of market information, the heterogeneous quality of consumer information on the seller?s incentives to sustain a reputation, and on consumers? welfare. The third project analyzes situations where long-lived agents (e.g., sellers, politicians) can manipulate their past records, for example, they can erase signals from their records at some cost. This is motivated by applications to online platforms in which sellers can bribe consumers in exchange for taking down the negative reviews. The main result shows that, when sellers are sufficiently long-lived, their returns from building reputations are entirely wiped out, even when the market suspects that they may erase records with a low probability. It also shows that players? incentives to sustain cooperation do not necessarily increase with their expected lifespans; and this finding stands in contrast to the standard predictions found in the literature on repeated games.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon could provide a low-cost and simple way to sort sphalerite ores with different concentrations of trace metals.  The first goal of this study is to analyze samples from Butte and Philipsburg to map out the distribution of metal impurities in sphalerite at the scale of each mining district (several square miles by up to 1 mile deep).   The second objective is to make sphalerite grains in the laboratory that contain the same trace metals that are found in the natural specimens.  The researchers will then compare the fluorescence behavior of the man-made and natural specimens.  This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in the field of economic geology at Montana Technological University (MTU).  MTU is a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI) in an EPSCoR state.  Results from this project may reveal new ways that sphalerite and other ore minerals can be used to study mineral deposits.  This research may also have applications to the use of luminescent sphalerite in materials science and engineering.   <br/> <br/>Butte, Montana is the type example of a zoned, Cordilleran-style, porphyry-lode deposit, as well as being one of the nation?s top historic producers of Cu, Zn, Ag, and Mn.  This study will take advantage of the Anaconda Research Lab (ARL) Collection, a set of over 50,000 hand samples collected from Butte and other mines in Montana that is archived at Montana Tech campus.  Using the ARL Collection, as well as new samples from the active Continental porphyry Cu-Mo mine, the researchers will assemble a suite of > 200 polished ore specimens containing sphalerite and other sulfide minerals from known locations across the entire Butte district, to depths of up to 5000 ft. below the surface.  The sphalerite samples will be analyzed by optical microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PLS), Raman spectroscopy, laser ablation ICP-MS, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and hyperspectral cathodoluminescence (HP-CL) to reveal spatial and temporal patterns in trace element distribution, from the micron scale to the km scale.  Machine learning tools will be used to identify correlations between elements in the sphalerite database that will help illuminate the underlying mechanisms by which trace elements enter the ZnS structure.  For example, the researchers hypothesize that the deep red fluorescence mentioned above is linked to coupled substitution of Cu(+1), Ga(+3), and W(+6) for Zn(+2) in the sphalerite lattice.  They will synthesize sphalerite of known trace element compositions using hydrothermal methods and compare the HP-CL, Raman, and PLS signatures of the synthetic and natural specimens.  Finally, they will establish collaboration with a synchrotron laboratory capable of using XANES to verify the oxidation state of tungsten and other trace elements in their metal-doped ZnS and natural sphalerite samples.  This project will support cutting-edge research and graduate-student training in economic geology at Montana Technological University, formerly the Montana School of Mines, a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI) in an EPSCoR state.  Results from this project may reveal new ways that sphalerite and other ore minerals can be used to study mineral deposits, and may have applications to the use of luminescent ZnS in materials science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They bring innovative ideas, products, and services to the marketplace. There is a large literature in economics that studies what factors or situations facilitate or prevent entrepreneurship. Since new businesses often require non-negligible starting capital, a key concern is that lack of resources or inability to borrow may prevent some potentially ground-breaking enterprises from emerging. In many countries or industries, venture capital is either missing or tends to overlook projects by women and minorities. From an equity perspective, these may be particularly acute issues for individuals rich in talent but poor in funds. This research investigates whether bequests or gifts from parents to their adult children mitigate formal credit constraints and facilitate business creation. It also studies whether family-financed firms last longer and are more profitable than those created through other means. Answers to these questions can be used to understand to what extent altruism across generations can act as a substitute for poorly functioning credit markets and the importance of the problem of ?missing entrepreneurs.?<br/><br/>This research is made possible by the availability of rich administrative data on intergenerational transfers, socio-demographic information about donors and recipients, and rich measures of business performance, including the date the new business started. The data offer the opportunity not only to test how important parental transfers are for explaining new business creation, but also to test whether family-funded companies are more or less efficient than those created through more traditional channels. In particular, the research investigates whether parental transfers reflect better (soft) information than that available to formal credit markets as opposed to being a pure consumption good; it also investigates whether such transfers, by imposing a more family-led structure on the newly created business, may end up having a negative impact on its performance. The findings from the empirical analysis are used as inputs into a theoretical model that makes explicit the linkages between altruism across generations, credit market imperfections, and occupational choices. The research uses the model as a laboratory for studying the effect of various economic policies, such as changes in estate taxation, expansion and/or restructuring of governmental loan guarantee programs, and government coverage of old-age risks. The latter are an example of the important trade-offs faced by altruistic parents ? often torn between saving for leaving bequests to their children and saving for covering their own long-term health care costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current anti-drone techniques are often prone to failure, not cost effective, or could affect legitimate nearby aircraft. This proposal develops a Multi-UAV Drone Catch Net (MUCH-Net) system that uses a team of low-cost autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles to collaboratively tether a catch net to capture the target drone. This new system puts a high demand on the safe operations of the aerial vehicle team using a learning-based cooperative formation architecture design with environment-aware adaptive safety constraints. The broader impacts of the project include (a) a concept design contest for high-school pre-engineering program students, (b) a robot capture game competition (c) a robotic program for K-12 teachers, (d) promotion of exploratory learning assignments in undergraduate teaching, (e) a new graduate course on safety-critical intelligent multiagent systems, (f) and collaborations with industry partners to facilitate research development, verification, assessment, and technology transfer.<br/><br/>This CAREER project aims to make fundamental contributions to theories of learning-based cooperative control with new environment-aware adaptive safety analysis. Major technical challenges include: (a) due to the complex operating environment, the safety considerations are environment-aware and adaptive; and (b) for multiagent systems, the multiple safety requirements considered can be conflicting with each other or with the initial system state. Existing safety-critical control algorithms for multiagent systems only address constant or time-varying safety sets, which cannot dynamically adapt to the environment, and cannot address safety conflicts. The research investigates learning-based cooperative control architectures to address environment-aware adaptive safety requirements for multiagent systems. An integrated barrier function structure that integrates a cooperative dynamic deep neural network to learn the dynamics of a multi-dimension environment parameter and unknown target velocity is proposed. Safety conflicts are addressed by integrating initial state and virtual barriers into the integrated barrier functions, with indicator functions incorporated to modify the less critical (?soft?) safety sets, in order to guarantee the more critical (?hard?) safety requirements. The proposed architectures are widely applicable to many applications with multiagent systems operating in complex environments.

One reason for the dustiness of the atmosphere is that atmospheric dust concentration has increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution, possibly due to the expansion of cleared, tilled, agricultural land.  The prominence of dust as an atmospheric aerosol and its dramatic increase over time motivate research on its climatic effects, among them cooling by reflecting sunlight back to space, warming by trapping outgoing infrared radiation, and indirect effects due to the influence of dust on clouds.  But such research is complicated by the fact that mineral dust enters the atmosphere when strong winds blow over dry soil, thus extreme wind events occurring sporadically and over small areas can make an outsized contribution to the global burden.  The prominence of small-scale extreme events challenges efforts to understand the role of dust in the climate system, especially efforts that rely on long simulations of global climate models which lack the resolution and dynamical sophistication needed to capture small-scale windstorms.<br/><br/>Research under this award considers the role of two types of wind events in global dust emissions: downslope windstorms in mountainous regions and haboobs, strong straight-line wind events caused by the downbursts of collapsing thunderstorms.  Both types of wind events are associated with strong dust emissions and both are driven by small-scale dynamics that are not captured by current global climate models.  The project takes advantage of 40-day simulations of the Model for Predication Across Scales (MPAS), which has the fine-scale resolution (3.75km grid spacing) and more sophisticated dynamics needed for downslope windstorms and haboobs.  The surface winds from the MPAS simulations are taken as inputs to an offline dust emission model to determine the amount of dust emitted by these events.  A second line of research adjusts a state-of-the-art climate model, the Community Earth System Model version (CESM), to replicate the dust generated in the offline dust emission experiments.  The CESM simulations are ""nudged"" to conform to observed atmospheric circulation so that the dust aerosol concentration and its climate effects can be compared against real-world measurements.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given the potential climatic effects of airborne dust, the large uncertainty as to those effects, and the extent to which human activity could cause large changes in dust concentration.  The dustiness of the atmosphere has other effects, for instance it reduces air quality but it also provides a source of iron and other nutrients for marine ecosystems.  The project also includes a collaboration with the San Diego County Office of Education to develop teaching activities for California high school science teachers.  In addition, the project provides support and training to a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the current COVID-19 vaccines have saved countless lives and have allowed our society to get back to normal, they have their weaknesses.  The boosters are sometimes not effective, and when they are, they have short-lived efficacy and they can have mild to severe side effects. These weaknesses not only put individuals at risk of getting sick with COVID or the side effects, but those weaknesses also compromise confidence in the vaccine, which affects compliance. The proposed project promises to produce a next-generation vaccine that has better efficacy and significantly reduced side effects, as well as increased duration of effectiveness. This could pave the way for an effective annual administration schedule of the vaccine booster that addresses new strains, much like the seasonal influenza vaccine. <br/><br/>The proposed project intends to produce a next-generation vaccine that can renew confidence in vaccinating to prevent COVID-19. The project's objectives are to show that the vaccine candidate can not only create an immune response that can stop the spread of the virus but also kill the virus. Additionally, it is hoped that the project will show that the vaccine is safer than the current vaccines and that it promotes an immune response that lasts significantly longer than current vaccines. This will be accomplished by testing the vaccine in a Hamster model that simulates the human respiratory system well. Not only will efficacy be tested, but the longevity of the immune response will also be tested. As an additional objective of the study, the route of administration will be examined. The vaccine's effectiveness will be compared by administering it either through injection, nasal administration, or a microneedle patch.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address the grand challenges of global environmental change, scientists and practitioners need a causal understanding ? or robust evidence of cause-and-effect relationships ? of how and when global change impacts ecosystems. In response, this CAREER proposal will develop an integrated research and education platform to transform understanding of global change impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and to train the next generation of global change scientists. To facilitate these advances, the project will study how chronic drought impacts biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of grassland ecosystems in the southwest/central US because of their importance to the global carbon cycle and current projections of intensifying drought in this region. Then, the research will broaden insights to other ecosystems (e.g., to study warming impacts on alpine tundra), through cultivating inclusive, collaborative teams to tackle focal research questions with NSF Long Term Ecological Research and NEON data. This research?s broader impacts focus on training the next generation of scientists to enhance their methodological toolbox and ability to lead inclusive teams that promote diverse perspectives. To achieve these goals, the researcher will lead a distributed graduate seminar with training in inclusive team science; create innovative, open-source course modules on data science; and catalyze professional development for K12 teachers.<br/><br/>This CAREER proposal seeks to transform the methods used to acquire causal understanding and to generate new causal understanding about the mechanisms through which drought and warming will alter biodiversity and, in turn, ecosystem functioning. This project proposes a novel integration of existing NSF data, new experimental tests, and recent, multidisciplinary advances in causal inference techniques that are currently underutilized in ecology. This convergent approach will generate quantitative estimates of: (1) why and how biodiversity change dampens or amplifies the impacts of drought on ecosystem productivity, and whether the mechanisms through which biodiversity affects productivity (2) differ for soil functions and (3) vary with a site?s climate history and plant functional traits. Through a distributed graduate seminar, the project will include teams of graduate students to synthesize (4) how these direct and indirect effects of global change vary across drivers (e.g., warming, nitrogen pollution) and ecosystems. This integrated approach will deliver insights on the mechanisms through which global change alters the effect of biodiversity on productivity and generate broader advances in the causal inference in ecology. To deliver broader impacts, the researcher will lead a distributed graduate seminar that provides a vehicle to advance the use of best practices for inclusive team science and work with pedagogy experts and graduate students to create and evaluate data science modules. To extend benefits to K12 classrooms and low-income communities in Colorado, the project will work with CU Boulder?s Science Discovery?s Teacher Professional development program to collaborate with teachers to integrate concepts of global change and data literacy into their classes, potentially reaching thousands of students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oftentimes, these problems are extremely challenging to solve, requiring significant computational resources and running time. This project aims to use machine learning (ML) to solve these complex problems more efficiently. After all, the problems that, for example, a shipping company must solve to route its trucks will change daily, but not drastically: although demand and traffic will vary, the road network will remain the same. This means that there is likely underlying structure that can be uncovered with the help of ML to optimize algorithm runtime on future problems. This project aims to explore this new frontier of algorithm design where ML can be used to improve the performance of existing discrete optimization algorithms, help practitioners select among different algorithms, and--one day--design entirely new algorithms. In addition to its main technical objectives, this project extends its impact through community engagement and education. This includes expanding the ""Learning Theory Alliance,"" a mentorship program designed to support and develop the ML theory community. The project also includes plans to train graduate students, broaden participation in ML theory research, and integrate the research into new courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>This project investigates how ML can be integrated into algorithm design from a variety of different perspectives, including (1) Algorithm selection:  How can we use ML to choose which algorithm to employ to solve a computational problem?

How can we automate algorithm configuration using ML? (3) Algorithm discovery: The long-term goal of this research direction is to identify new algorithms using ML that have never previously been analyzed. Employing ML for discrete optimization is challenging because combinatorial algorithms are highly sensitive, and minor adjustments can result in significant changes in runtime or solution quality. These challenges pose a unique opportunity for the research in this project to provide theoretically-backed guidance for aligning ML approaches to the algorithmic tasks at hand, enabling us to solve extremely complex combinatorial problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finite element methods have undergone decades of study by mathematicians, scientists and engineers in many fields and there is a rich mathematical theory concerning them. They are widely used in scientific computing and modelling to generate accurate simulations of a wide variety of physical processes, most notably the deformation of materials and fluid mechanics. By contrast, deep neural networks are relatively new and have only been widely used in the last decade. In this short time, they have demonstrated remarkable empirical performance on a wide variety of machine learning tasks, most notably in computer vision and natural language processing. Despite this great empirical success, there is still a very limited mathematical understanding of why and how deep neural networks work so well. We hope to leverage the success of deep learning to improve numerical methods for partial differential equations and to leverage the theoretical understanding of the finite element method to better understand deep learning. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will also provide a good training experience for junior researchers. This project will support 1 graduate student each year of the three year project. <br/><br/>Piecewise polynomials represent one of the most important functional classes in approximation theory.  In classical approximation theory and numerical methods for partial differential equations, these functional classes are often represented by linear functional spaces associated with a priori given grids, for example, by splines and finite element spaces. In deep learning, function classes are typically represented by a composition of a sequence of linear functions and coordinate-wise non-linearities. One important non-linearity is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function and its powers (ReLUk).  The resulting functional class, ReLUk-DNN, does not form a linear vector space but is rather parameterized non-linearly by a high-dimensional set of parameters.  This function class can be used to solve partial differential equations and we call the resulting numerical algorithms the finite neuron method (FNM). Proposed research topics include: error estimates for the finite neuron method, universal construction of conforming finite elements for arbitrarily high order partial differential equations, an investigation into how and why the finite neuron method gives a much better asymptotic error estimate than the corresponding finite element method, and the development and analysis of efficient algorithms for using the finite neuron method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most livestock in the western United States are scattered in large pastures and allowed to roam individually and hence do not derive benefits from grazing by large herds of animals. This project aims to develop and test low-cost ear tags that use audio and electrical stimulation to reinforce the natural herd instinct of individual animals when they stray from the herd. High stock density/low duration grazing has the potential of reducing livestock greenhouse emissions and turning rangelands into a net carbon sink. Higher vegetation diversity, more water absorption, reduced erosion, and more wildlife habitat are just some of the other expected ecological benefits of this technology. This technology would also facilitate more efficient and cost-effective ranch management. The risk of livestock theft will be reduced, and the need for fences will decrease since the migratory instincts of livestock work best on larger land areas. Land, livestock, wildlife, ranchers, and the global community would benefit from the development of technology that reinforces the natural herd instinct of grazing animals.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will develop and test a novel approach to stimulating the herd instinct of livestock rather than geographically confining them. Key to implementing this approach is the additional innovation of a unique and low-cost strategy to use ear tags with low-power RF transceivers to calculate herd proximity from an accumulation of individual distance estimates. This technology will use a highly integrated system using an ear tag attached to each animal in the herd. Each tag will use a low-power RF transceiver to periodically send brief signals to the other tags in the herd. The tags will use signal strength measurements to calculate their own approximate distance to every other tag. Each tag will then use an algorithm to determine whether it is within an appropriate proximity to the rest of the herd. If an animal begins to stray from the herd, the tag will give an audio alert, potentially followed by electrical stimulation to encourage the animal to rejoin its peers. The capability of holding a herd at a density from 10,000 to 1,000,000 pounds per acre will be a key metric of success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heart-failure is a cardiovascular disease that is particularly challenging given that many patients end up readmitted to the hospital just months after initial hospitalization. Greatly improved outcomes for patients are already possible, keeping patients from returning to the hospital, but only if the patient treatment can be rapidly optimized for the medications prescribed for heart failure. This rapid optimization requires multiple trips back to the doctor for blood tests to guide the treatment plan, adjusting patient medication levels accordingly. Cardiologists have therefore been asking for new technologies to aid their ability to care for heart-failure patients, with an increasing call for remote monitoring technology.<br/> <br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create the first-ever wearable, heart-failure monitor for a peptide molecule released by the heart when the heart is struggling, therefore providing a direct and continuous measurement of how well heart-failure treatment is progressing. Specifically, aptamers, which are oligonucleotides, will be used to capture heart-failure peptide molecules on a tiny electrical wire sensor embedded painlessly a few millimeters beneath the skin surface. As these aptamers capture the peptides, they provide a continuous measurement of the peptide concentrations in the form of an electrical signal. The project will create a working prototype that is like the proven success of wearable continuous glucose monitors, leveraging decades of investment in glucose monitors and significant doctor and patient trust in glucose monitors. Under the Phase II project, the wearable heart-failure monitor prototype will be validated for more than one week of operation in an animal model, a key proof point that will enable further commercial investment in developing the wearable heart-failure monitor for human use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On average 400,000 preterm infants are born in the US each year and 49% experience difficulty feeding after discharge. Preterm infants who cannot successfully feed are at increased risk of hospital readmission resulting in significant financial and emotional burdens for their families. In the US the average length of stay for an infant born less than 32 weeks gestation is 13.2 days. The current practice is for babies to remain longer in the NICU at an average cost of $7,000 per day and a national cost of more than $26 billion a year. An estimated 2-day reduction in length of stay with this biomedical device will lower the financial cost of overall neonatal healthcare expenditure by $8.9 billion annually and will reduce the need for future medical interventions because infants are discharged with a stronger early-stage health baseline. Once this product is commonly used in US hospitals, it can be distributed globally to meet demand and benefit infants worldwide.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can save hospitals thousands of dollars while delivering better care and positive patient outcomes. For infants admitted to the NICU, successful oral feeding is a prerequisite for discharge home, but preterm infants often struggle with oral feeding skills largely due to problems coordinating swallowing with breathing. Achieving safe and efficient oral feeding in preterm infants is challenging because of these neurodevelopmental immaturities. Feeding progress is therefore limited by difficulties in maintaining cardiorespiratory stability. This biomedical platform and clinical algorithm interface use big data based on breathing patterns to quantify the synchronization of breathing and swallowing. A precise method of measuring infant breathing patterns during feeding gives clinicians a diagnostic tool to better inform decisions related to feeding advancement.  This device provides objective metrics of feeding success and discharge readiness and may result in decreased readmissions for failure to thrive, substantially reducing healthcare utilizations and post-discharge expenditures. Creating technology that helps infants feed better so they can go home sooner promotes improved parent-infant interactions and optimizes infant development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The igneous rocks include granites (New Hampshire is known as the Granite State) and volcanic rocks that form spectacular cliff faces such as the iconic 'Old Man of the Mountain' in Franconia Notch State Park.  The geologic trigger for this phase of magmatism, however, remains largely unknown.  The PI will train undergraduate students at Tufts University to sample the rocks throughout the region in order to obtain chemical and age information that can be used to link the magmatism to a particular geologic process that gave rise to the New Hampshire we see today.  The results will be disseminated in a series of peer-reviewed journal articles, and at professional scientific conferences. As a capstone to the project, the PI and students will develop a dedicated summer-long exhibition at the Museum of the White Mountains in Plymouth, New Hampshire in order to communicate the results to the general public.  The exhibit will include examples of rocks and minerals (both large-scale slabs and microscope slides) that are typical of the region, videos of tectonic plate motions during the opening of the Atlantic, primers on geologic dating techniques, and trail guides for hikers interested in learning more about geology in the White Mountains.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI and undergraduate students at Tufts University will focus on establishing a detailed geochronologic, petrologic, and geochemical dataset for the main phase of magmatism in the White Mountain Magma Series (WMMS), the White Mountain Batholith.  The White Mountain Batholith (WMB) is composed of a series of porphyritic syenites, hornblende granites, biotite granites, and comendite (Na-rich rhyolite) tuffs. Recently published ages from Kinney et al. (2022) reveal that the WMB is not a monolithic pluton, but is instead composed of two distinct magmatic centers: the western batholith and the eastern batholith.  Magmatism first initiated in the western portions of the batholith (198 -190 Ma) and then appears to jump to the eastern portions approximately 10 Myr later (184 - 180 Ma).  The researcher's work will establish the timing of emplacement between various units and plutons, the depths of emplacement, and the petrogenetic relationships between each unit.  Undergraduate student training is a central focus of this work and the PI will train a total of six undergraduate students at Tufts University on scientific research projects over the three year period.  Students will obtain high precision U-Pb zircon ages for key sample localities across the batholith to constrain the timing of emplacement, as well as obtain whole rock major and trace element compositions and Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic compositions for each lithological unit in the western, eastern, and central batholiths.  Their results will be an essential first step in distinguishing between various geodynamic scenarios for the origin of the WMMS.  A summer-long dedicated exhibition at the Museum of the White Mountains (Plymouth, NH), and associated public lecture series, will provide a capstone to the project and allow the PI and students to communicate their results to the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on complex concentrated alloys (CCAs), a class of novel alloys that mix atoms of different species at nearly equal ratios. The scientific drive for studying CCAs is to understand and utilize the vast chemical and structural design space associated with multiple elements in search of new materials properties. Current understanding about the stability, structures, and properties of alloys is limited to the corners and edges of the multi-element space, such as binary or dilute alloys. The information for CCAs close to the center of the composition space is virtually non-existent for systems with four or more elements. The project intends to fill this knowledge gap in alloy theory for these complex alloy systems by (i) establishing an accurate predictive understanding of the atomic structures in CCAs through a combination of quantum mechanical calculations and statistical mechanics methods, and (ii) integrating quantum mechanical calculations, empirical models and close-loop machine learning methods to predict the structural and defect features in CCAs for accelerated design of CCAs for structural or functional applications.  The multidisciplinary nature of the project brings perspectives from multiple academic fields into the forefront of materials research. The focus of the technologically relevant CCAs will strengthen the U.S. leadership in fundamental alloy research. <br/><br/>The education and outreach activities of the project includes five integrated parts that address learning tool innovation, broadening participation, youth material education, summer research exposure, and research career development.

Severe lattice distortion is an important phenomenon that is correlated to a variety of physical and chemical properties in CCAs. However, the nature of severe lattice distortions in CCAs is poorly understood, especially with the coupling of SRO. The PI will study SRO and related lattice distortions in CCAs with a unique synergy of mechanism investigation, predictive modeling, and methodology development. The research will elucidate SRO on the structures of lattice distortions in CCAs, which will be utilized to quantify the impact of the distorted lattices on the phonon characteristics of CCAs. Results and methodology from bulk CCAs will be applied to establish a predictive mapping linking defect characteristics with local environments in CCAs, providing the foundation for computational design of CCAs for superior mechanical properties. The project will be driven by the parallel research on a hierarchical data-driven computational framework that enables efficient predictions of structure-property relationships for CCAs. <br/><br/>The education and outreach activities of the project includes five integrated parts that address learning tool innovation, broadening participation, youth material education, summer research exposure, and research career development.

The realization that powerful broadcasts and sensitive scientific instruments could not easily coexist led to the creation of protected frequencies for radio astronomy and to the establishment of the National Radio Quiet Zone. These protections have been expanded over time. Nevertheless, the expansion of wireless communications to ever higher frequencies, and the advent of globe-spanning low earth orbit networks of satellites, have resulted in RFI at many more frequencies and in remote locations. The astronomy community needs solutions that enable these communications capabilities while protecting the viability of terrestrial radio telescopes. Building on prior NSF-funded design and planning work, this project will construct an Operational Data Sharing (ODS) system that supports automated, real-time spectrum sharing between radio astronomy observatories and satellite constellations. The project will deploy ODS and experiment with spectrum sharing between the Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico, the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, and the Starlink constellation operated by Space Exploration Technologies, Inc. (SpaceX). Students from diverse backgrounds will take part in this work as summer interns, and public awareness of spectrum issues will be enhanced by integrating real-time updates derived from the ODS system into the existing public-facing telescope status display. <br/> <br/>The planned ODS system transmits information about the radio astronomy observatory?s status and plans to the satellite operator, including the antenna pointing direction or phased array beam direction, receiver center frequency and bandwidth as a function of time. ODS is structured as a database queried by the satellite operator, so only the information needed by that operator is transmitted. The observatory and the operator mutually agree on sharing approaches.  For example, that satellites pointing phased-array beams into a specified zone near the observatory will only transmit in a subset of the operator?s licensed frequencies when the observatory is actively sensing in that band. The project explores methods that enable the operator to use more spectrum than is available under current static protection approaches when the observatory is sensing at other frequencies. The initial deployment and experiments focus on the 10.7-12.7 GHz band.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The burgeoning computing and data-intensive research community depends heavily on senior CI leaders, not only to oversee research CI design, development, implementation, and facilitation, but also to shape the research CI ecosystem and agenda, both locally at their own institutions and especially nationally. Crucial to surviving this expertise drain is capturing as much of that expertise as possible before it is irretrievably lost. A valuable mechanism for this is to establish mentoring relationships between senior CI leaders and emerging mid-career CI leaders, because these relationships not only will enable the transfer of knowledge, experience, and wisdom, but also will solidify the ability of the emerging CI leaders to continue to draw on the expertise of the senior CI leaders even after they retire. By co-locating this workshop with a Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation (CASC) meeting, participating emerging CI leaders will have an expanded opportunity for peer-mentoring, because CASC serves as the de facto professional society for institutional CI leaders. CASC has committed to accept all CILA workshop participants who are non-CASC members as guests for the associated CASC meeting, at no registration charge. This workshop grant covers the travel expenses of a cohort, for both this workshop and the associated CASC meeting. CASC provides opportunities both to sustain these activities and to broaden their impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference aims to bring together early-career researchers and experts to study tensor invariants, their appearance in pure algebraic and differential geometry, and their application in Algebraic Complexity Theory and Quantum Information. The workshop will feature talks from both seasoned experts and promising young researchers. The event is designed to facilitate new research connections and to initiate new collaborations. The  conference will expose the participants to state-of-the-art research results that touch a variety of scientific disciplines. The activities will support further development of both pure mathematics and the ""down-stream"" applications in each area of scientific focus (Algebraic and Differential Geometry, Algebraic Complexity, Quantum Information). <br/><br/>The conference is centered on invariants in geometry, divided into three themes: Algebraic and Differential Geometry, Tensors and Complexity, and Quantum Computing and Quantum Information. Geometry has long been a cornerstone of mathematics, and invariants are the linchpins. Regarding Algebraic and Differential Geometry, the organizers are inviting expert speakers on topics such as the connections between projective and differential geometry. Considerations in these areas, such as questions about dimensions and defining equations of secant varieties, have led to powerful tools both within geometry and applications in areas such as computational complexity and quantum information. Likewise, the organizers are inviting application-area experts in Algebraic Complexity and Quantum Information. This natural juxtaposition of pure and applied mathematics will lead to new and interesting connections and help initiate new research collaborations. In addition to daily talks by seasoned experts, the conference will include young researchers in a Poster Session and provide networking opportunities, including working group activities, to help early career researchers meet others in the field, which will provide opportunities for new (and ongoing) research collaborations.

Currently, the question of which genes are being expressed by gut microbes (which can be studied using RNA transcripts) is an extraordinarily promising research field for advancing the understanding of host-microbial interactions. This is because bacteria that make up a small amount of the gut microbiome can still influence the community dramatically through their gene expression. This can be overlooked by DNA sequence data, which only measures bacterial abundance. Despite this, RNA remains under-utilized, as RNA quickly degrades outside of the cell, and most laboratories lack the capability to measure RNA at any significant scale reliably. The main activities of this project will be (1) refining a process for RNA capture and storage, (2) integrating these into the automated hardware system, and (3) developing the methods and infrastructure for analysis of the resulting RNA datasets. This project will allow studies of gene expression in the gut microbiome to become commonplace, allowing researchers to discover more powerful clinically relevant biomarkers for precision medicine applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to minimizing the economic and environmental costs resulting from computer energy consumption, enhancing the energy efficiency of computers will also allow for increased computing capabilities with beneficial impacts throughout society. This project will therefore design and experimentally demonstrate computing systems with extreme energy efficiency, both for high-performance computing and for artificial intelligence. This extreme energy efficiency will be achieved by leveraging magnetic skyrmions, which are magnetic quasiparticles that have been predicted to be suitable for energy-efficient conventional computing in the reversible computing paradigm as well as for energy-efficient artificial intelligence through the reservoir computing paradigm. This project will significantly advance the development of computers with extreme energy efficiency, thereby reducing environmental harm, facilitating economic development, and enabling revolutionary computing applications that require minimal power dissipation. This project will also have beneficial impacts on workforce development through the inclusion of undergraduate research participants and the vertical training of graduate students from devices to systems.<br/><br/>This project will design and experimentally demonstrate reversible and reservoir computers with magnetic skyrmions. Magnetic skyrmions are swirls of magnetic spin texture that are energy-protected once created. They are tunable in size, can operate at room temperature, and have dynamical response to current, voltage, and field, making them a good choice for use in future computing paradigms. Based on preliminary designs and simulations of the PIs on the efficient use of skyrmions in reversible and reservoir computing, this project has four main objectives. Firstly, skyrmion reversible computer co-design will be carried out to efficiently drive the skyrmions, to determine optimal parameters, and to develop a roadmap for the future of skyrmion reversible computing. Secondly, skyrmion reversible computer fabrication will be carried out to demonstrate and analyze skyrmion stability, voltage-driven skyrmion propagation, skyrmion interactions mediated by the skyrmion-Hall effect, and reversible skyrmion logic gates. Thirdly, skyrmion reservoir computing co-design will be carried out to maximize the reservoir expressivity and energy efficiency, to determine optimal parameters, and to develop a roadmap for the future of skyrmion reservoir computing. And fourthly, skyrmion reservoir computer fabrication will be carried out to measure multi-skyrmion interactions, to control repeatability through pinning sites, and to demonstrate and characterize skyrmion reservoir computers. This project will advance the science of thin film magnetism, improve understanding of the dynamics of magnetic nanostructures, develop new device designs and fabrication methods for skyrmion-based devices, and develop and implement circuits and systems to leverage those dynamics. This project will thus advance knowledge in materials, devices, and computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this age of big data, the significance of uncertainty within the gathered demand data becomes more evident due to factors such as data acquisition device error, measurement inaccuracies, sampling fault, data integration error, etc. This is especially true due to the wide deployment of sensor monitoring infrastructures and increasing prevalence of technologies. This project aims to study a set of facility location optimization problems in face of uncertain demand data, and the goal is to explore new ideas and techniques to develop efficient algorithms to solve these optimization problems on uncertain data. The research will incorporate a variety of methodologies from diverse areas such as discrete math, graph theory, combinatorial optimization, probability theory, operations research, computational geometry, data structures, etc. This project will engage undergraduate and masters students in the development and implementation of algorithms to increase the throughput of them who pursue careers in theoretical computer science research, including continuing on to Ph.D. programs. The research results produced from this project will be integrated into several courses on data structures and algorithms, which will benefit both undergraduate and graduate students with diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>In this project, three topics will be investigated: The first topic is faulty-tolerant facility locations to provide a safeguard against failures of facilities; the second topic is chromatic facility locations to situate multiple types of facilities; the third topic is proximity connected facility locations to address intelligent facility location problems. Specifically, the faulty-tolerant generalized versions, the chromatic generalized versions, and the proximity connected generalized versions of several fundamental minimax and minisum optimization models, as well as other variations will be explored in facility location scenarios including various graph networks and the plane. More efficient or first-known algorithms will be developed to solve these optimization models with certain and uncertain data inputs. This research will advance knowledge and understanding within the field of Algorithms in theoretical computer science by developing efficient algorithmic approaches for solving these fundamental optimization problems on uncertain data and improving the understanding of the computation on uncertain data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), threaten the natural resources of the United States. Separation is the current state-of-practice for PFAS management, but this produces hazardous waste where disposal is costly and introduces long-term liabilities. Plasma is a promising technology, but it struggles to scale. This project investigates in the field an innovative geometric design that enhances plasma ignition and propagation while minimizing energy consumption. Field deployment will positively impact the environment due to water reclamation, waste elimination, and carbon and energy footprint reduction. This project encourages multidisciplinary collaborations and explores novel business models, such as buy-one-donate-one and pay-it-forward. These models couple the success of customers with additional societal benefits. Purafide is also collaborating with LaGuardia Community College?s environmental science program for workforce development. Overall, this project will strengthen the security, stability, and sustainability of water.<br/><br/>The project will pilot a plasma-based treatment technology at a remediation site and a state-maintained landfill, which was identified as high-priority sites by the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team. These are challenging matrices but also where the plasma reactor has successfully eliminated CECs in the past. The innovative geometric approach maximizes the plasma-water interface and enables scaling to commercially relevant flow rates. The success criteria for the pilots will be achieving PFAS levels below the Michigan Maximum allowable PFAS Levels with an effective flow rate of about five gal/min for 1+ (>90%) log reduction. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) will serve as indicator compounds due to their prevalence and the strict standards proposed under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Purafide will design, manufacture, deploy, and parametrically assess the technology in the field. Purafide will also develop in-house analytical capabilities, such as Draft EPA Method 1633, and a technoeconomic model to reduce and predict costs, respectively. Assuming the technical objective is accomplished, the technology readiness level will significantly increase, suggesting the minimum viable product will be ready for the full scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology will enable continued breastfeeding and improved infant nutrition. Commercially, the solution will provide the first at-home solution for breast milk preservation, addressing an unmet need for mothers and caregivers. Facilitating continued breastfeeding supports public health by reducing risks of disease and medical costs associated with low breastfeeding rates. Nearly half of new mothers leave full-time careers after childbirth versus less than a quarter of new fathers. While the overall decision for women to leave their careers is multi-faceted, the unequal burden of providing breast milk to feed a child can play a role. Successful development of this technology can open up new research directions in food science, nutrition, and maternal, perinatal, and postnatal health.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of breast milk-preserving formulations composed of safe, food-derived compounds identified through a novel high-throughput screening approach. These formulations inhibit fat breakdown, restore nutritional content, and preserve the structural integrity of frozen breast milk. Human breast milk is the gold standard for infant nutrition, but its complex structure deteriorates during freezer storage, resulting in fat loss, rancidity, and infant rejection of the milk. Infant rejection of breast milk leads many lactating parents to switch to commercial infant formulas even though they are imperfect substitutes for human milk. With a formulation that has been shown to inhibit fat breakdown and preserve other key nutritional indicators for over six months of freezer storage, this technology may be the first affordable, at-home solution to extend breast milk's shelf-life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Efforts focus on creating simple and efficient computer algorithms capable of learning from real-world data to suggest ideal charging times and conditions for EVs. The significance lies in users adapting to increasingly complex energy environments, adopting more sustainable options and behaviors, and gaining more control over energy use. The project centers on EVs as integral to reducing carbon emissions from transportation. Despite significant advancements in battery and charging technologies, there are many challenges in planning how EVs are charged, and the situation is poised to worsen with the expected increasing penetration of electrified transportation. The aim is to ensure these tools will be accessible to all EV users, focusing not only on making charging recommendations that promote the use of renewable energy but also on considering individual preferences and potential benefits to the entire energy system. The ultimate objective is to simplify decision-making, making it easier for users to manage energy consumption in optimal ways without feeling overwhelmed. Advanced statistical techniques are employed, utilizing highly efficient computer algorithms that will ensure speed, flexibility, interpretability, and real-world policy relevance. The proposed system adapts and learns charging preferences in real-time, providing energy management recommendations in the context of coordinated EV charging while considering factors such as electricity demand, pricing, and grid stability. <br/><br/>The methodical modular Markov chain fast and scalable sampler of the proposed incentive-compatible recommender system is designed by integrating: an expansion of Ultimate Plya-Gamma data augmentation for multi-index choice models to create conjugacy where it does not exist, amortized and non-factorized variational inference for efficiency, Choquet aggregation for complex nonparametric tradeoffs across service features (relaxing linear compensatory behavior), Bayes endogeneity controls, Bayesian optimization for tuning hyperparameters and for integration with a system equilibrium algorithm, and flexible semiparametric representation of heterogeneity in preferences and motives between and within strategic agents. The research team implements the project through an actual residential program for coordinated scheduling of electric-vehicle charging, such as avoiding in-force price endogeneity and constraints via self-selection price discrimination through discrete targeted bundles. In simpler terms, a helpful guide is created for individuals driving electric vehicles, suggesting ideal charging times and needs based on their preferences and driving patterns. Smart technology is employed to gather information, enabling the provision of personalized suggestions to users. The impact of the project extends beyond individual assistance, contributing to the overall sustainability of energy systems and providing valuable tools for energy-related organizations, utilities, and policymakers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The promise of 5G is to enable unprecedented connectivity - smart cars, smart homes, etc. The technology also promises equity of information in the form of broadband coverage across the United States. Thus far, the dream of 5G has been limited due to poor signal range and prohibitive cooling costs. This solution is a thermally-optimized power amplifier that dramatically increases signal range and stays cool - reducing costs. As a result of boosted signal range, broadband coverage will be incentivized in more rural areas, preventing the deepening of the digital divide. Lower costs enable next-generation connectivity between smart devices - such as that between cars which can dramatically lower motor vehicle accidents. Finally, the development and production of this technology, all within the United States, will contribute to the ongoing effort to revitalize the nation?s semiconductor industry.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the scaling and commercialization of an innovative power amplifier technology. State-of-the-art power amplifiers (PAs) are made of gallium nitride. In many cases, the performance of these PAs is thermally limited - they can't handle the heat they generate during operation. The result for wireless communication systems, such as 5G telecom and radar systems, is limited signal range and high cooling costs. By inserting a thin aluminum nitride layer in its semiconductor stack, the power amplifiers developed in this Phase II project will have significantly improved thermal management, resulting in increased efficiency and power handling capabilities. The resulting power amplifiers will reduce cooling cost and increase signal range, enabling next generation telecommunications and advanced radar systems. In this project, production will transition from the university lab to a scaled, commercial process. This transition will involve multiple rounds of power amplifier fabrication and assessment, as well as the formation and maintenance of key partnerships. The result of this project will be a demonstration of the minimum viable product at commercial scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Any changes in the local economic environment will have ripple effects throughout the network, generating distributional and aggregate consequences. This CAREER award funds research that adopts this network-based view to deepen our understanding of economic growth, capital flow, and industrial policy in an interdependent world. The first project analyzes the network of global capital flows and studies the implication of capital account openness on growth and international convergence. The second project collects new, comprehensive data on input-output tables across countries and analyzes the evolution of production networks as economies grow. The third project studies the incentives and implications of industrial policy when regions engage in economic competition. The fourth project builds a model of global innovation spillovers and analyzes countries' strategic incentives to conduct innovation policy in an interdependent world.<br/><br/>This research develops and applies network models to answer general equilibrium, policy-relevant questions surrounding industrial policy, resource allocation, innovation, and global capital flows. The first project develops a new growth model of the global economy featuring frictional and imperfectly substitutable flows of goods and capital between countries. The model is suitable for studying the dynamic response of countries around the world to changes in trade and investment frictions. The second project develops a production network model with a continuum of sectors. The advantage of working with a continuum is that real-world input-output tables, which come with different levels of aggregations, can be seen as discretization of the continuum, thereby making these tables from different countries or time periods directly comparable. The project applies the model to newly collected, comprehensive panel data on input-output tables and analyzes the evolution of production networks across stages of economic development. The third project studies the strategic incentives for local governments to implement industrial policy in a setting where regions are connected through input-output and trade linkages and thus local industrial policy has general equilibrium impact on other regions. Sufficient statistics that capture the local and cross-region spillover effects of industrial policies show that decentralized interventions can backfire if a local government's policy objectives differ from the central planner's. The project applies the model to study decentralized industrial policy and state interventions in China. The fourth project develops a multi-country, multi-sector endogenous growth model with global knowledge spillovers across countries and sectors. The project analyzes the dynamic and global implication of an economy?s innovation policy targeting both the domestic allocation of R&D resources and the barriers to knowledge diffusion across borders. The model provides a quantitative framework to analyze questions in global innovation policy, technological competition, and protectionism relating to intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to minimizing the economic and environmental costs resulting from computer energy consumption, enhancing the energy efficiency of computers will also allow for increased computing capabilities with beneficial impacts throughout society. This project will therefore design and experimentally demonstrate computing systems with extreme energy efficiency, both for high-performance computing and for artificial intelligence. This extreme energy efficiency will be achieved by leveraging magnetic skyrmions, which are magnetic quasiparticles that have been predicted to be suitable for energy-efficient conventional computing in the reversible computing paradigm as well as for energy-efficient artificial intelligence through the reservoir computing paradigm. This project will significantly advance the development of computers with extreme energy efficiency, thereby reducing environmental harm, facilitating economic development, and enabling revolutionary computing applications that require minimal power dissipation. This project will also have beneficial impacts on workforce development through the inclusion of undergraduate research participants and the vertical training of graduate students from devices to systems.<br/><br/>This project will design and experimentally demonstrate reversible and reservoir computers with magnetic skyrmions. Magnetic skyrmions are swirls of magnetic spin texture that are energy-protected once created. They are tunable in size, can operate at room temperature, and have dynamical response to current, voltage, and field, making them a good choice for use in future computing paradigms. Based on preliminary designs and simulations of the PIs on the efficient use of skyrmions in reversible and reservoir computing, this project has four main objectives. Firstly, skyrmion reversible computer co-design will be carried out to efficiently drive the skyrmions, to determine optimal parameters, and to develop a roadmap for the future of skyrmion reversible computing. Secondly, skyrmion reversible computer fabrication will be carried out to demonstrate and analyze skyrmion stability, voltage-driven skyrmion propagation, skyrmion interactions mediated by the skyrmion-Hall effect, and reversible skyrmion logic gates. Thirdly, skyrmion reservoir computing co-design will be carried out to maximize the reservoir expressivity and energy efficiency, to determine optimal parameters, and to develop a roadmap for the future of skyrmion reservoir computing. And fourthly, skyrmion reservoir computer fabrication will be carried out to measure multi-skyrmion interactions, to control repeatability through pinning sites, and to demonstrate and characterize skyrmion reservoir computers. This project will advance the science of thin film magnetism, improve understanding of the dynamics of magnetic nanostructures, develop new device designs and fabrication methods for skyrmion-based devices, and develop and implement circuits and systems to leverage those dynamics. This project will thus advance knowledge in materials, devices, and computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award will support the organization of a workshop focused on the utilization of LLMs for biological discoveries: LLMs4Bio accompanies the 2024 AAAI conference. The AAAI conference series has established itself as the world?s premier research conference in AI. This workshop addresses these challenges and brings together researchers from computer science, information science, and molecular, cellular, and systems biology to address unique challenges in advancing biological discoveries. This workshop activity will increase student participation in the 2024 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) that will take place from Feb 22-28 in Vancouver, Canada, by providing travel grants to U.S.-based students. The AAAI conference series has established itself as the world?s premier research conference in AI. Outcomes include the formulation of new problem spaces, the inclusion of more researchers in the identified intersectional communities, and the catalysis of further innovation on accessible and inclusive LLMs to power the next scientific breakthroughs. A strong representation of US researchers at the conference also helps maintain US competitiveness in this important area.<br/><br/>This workshop activity will  provide an international forum for presentation of AI technological advancement and applications in societal areas. The conference covers all aspects of AI, including theories, algorithms, software, and systems, and applications. The award will support: i) ?LLMs for biology? panel discussions, ii) paper presentation and Q&A interactions, iii) networking across NLP and biological domain experts, and iv) outlook of future opportunities of our communities. These activities will support students and young researchers as they prepare to advance their careers in scientific research, as well as broaden the participation of under-represented groups in computing and, in particular, in AI research. The current pace of research in LLMs makes it challenging for researchers to deeply understand scientific problems, community-acceptable standards, datasets, metrics, and benchmark tasks that truly capture our ability to advance on a problem, and precious knowledge gathered over decades of hard-fought research. The current trend of closed or poorly-described industry models that remain beyond resources typically available to academic researchers, often disseminated through non-peer reviewed platforms is also not conducive to cross-fertilization of research. This workshop addresses these challenges and brings together researchers from computer science, information science, and molecular, cellular, and systems biology to address unique challenges in advancing biological discoveries, such as standardized datasets, community-accepted benchmarks, experimental noise and uncertainty quantification, interpretation, and injection of prior biological knowledge. A Github project, https://github.com/LLMs4Science-Community, that accompanies the workshop activity provides a long-term platform for sharing workshop research articles, datasets, benchmarks, metrics, and other resulting knowledge for the workshop in this debut offering and other planned annual offerings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, electric cars are still not as practical as gasoline cars because, among other issues, they are difficult to recharge in short times. To improve this, new materials need to be developed since the currently used materials in LIB are already close to their maximum capabilities. This research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, focuses on designing and synthesizing materials and elucidating structure-property trends that may lead to insights on how to improve the capacity of batteries. The project combines computational approaches with modern materials chemistry experiments to develop nanoscale materials, one hundred times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, with increased electron transport capabilities. The principal investigators make use of computational fundamental science to guide experiments and therefore virtual testing of a wide variety of materials, reducing the cost of testing and trial-and-error to reasonable budgets. Since batteries are used in all areas of human activities, it is difficult to imagine any activity in our society where remote electricity would not be beneficial. Additionally, the projects supports efforts to increase diversity and train the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, researchers at the University of Cincinnati and Texas A&M, investigate the design and synthesis of hybrid electrode materials that combine carbon nanomaterials and copper metallic surfaces to create an efficient and robust pathway for electron transport. To facilitate the understanding and quantification of electron transport at the interface, the team employs open-ended carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attached to a bulk copper substrate using stable linker molecules. The CNTs are oriented vertically compared to the Cu substrate, and only the ends of the CNTs are connected to Cu atoms. The research combines ab initio analysis, synthesis, and characterization studies. With the aim of impedance matching at the interface the team studies the materials as anodes for Li batteries, investigates energy storage performance and dendrite formation in the context of computational and experimental structure-property correlations. The results of this research could pave the way for more efficient batteries, new sensors, new catalysts, and new biodevices. Additionally, the multidisciplinary project provides experiential opportunities for the next generation of scientists. The principal investigators encourage diversity and actively motivate more minorities to pursue college and specialize in fields of science and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Touchscreen phones and car dashboards demand visual attention, putting people's safety at risk. Virtual environments neglect or diminish users' abilities to grasp and move objects, impacting dexterity. The emerging immersive education and work training opportunities largely exclude blind and low-vision users. Finally, the fact that telecommunication (for example, calling family to check in) lacks social touch and a sense of co-presence leads to anxiety and depression over time. Advances in programmable touch technology, known as haptic technology, can offer a future free of these challenges, but experienced haptic designers are few, and becoming an expert in haptics takes years of practice. The main question in haptic design remains: ""How can I convey the desired meaning to users through touch?"" It is surprisingly difficult to design vibration signals that can evoke relevant meanings in users' minds and are easy to distinguish from one another. Currently, creating such signals relies on trial-and-error exploration of engineering parameters and extensive user testing. This inefficient process discourages domain-expert designers (car manufacturers, accessibility experts, educators, therapists, and the like) from including haptics in their applications. To address this barrier to using haptics, this project will democratize vibration design by investigating how humans interpret and distinguish vibration signals. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project will develop models that predict how people (1) describe a signal's meaning with natural language and (2) perceive the similarity of signals. Next, the investigator and her team will (3) build haptic authoring tools that interleave these models with designer input to help quickly converge on plausible haptic signals for an application. The investigator team will then study the tools' impact on enabling designers to achieve their creative visions. This project will focus on three vibrotactile technologies that target receptors in our hands and offer the widest range of contact and contactless vibrotactile feedback: mechanical vibration actuators, surface electrovibration devices, and mid-air ultrasound haptics. In contrast to previous studies that rely on signals with a few controlled parameters, this research will model the human processing of complex signals created by human designers. The outcomes of this research will pioneer the development of a new class of sensory language models, reveal generalizable trends in human vibrotactile perception and language across three technologies, and identify specific opportunities for haptic tools and residency programs to scaffold learning and collaboration for interdisciplinary haptic design teams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, our world was recently turned upside down by an RNA virus, which was then partially contained by an RNA vaccine. Contrary to common wisdom, RNA is not just an intermediate ?messenger? between the more well-known DNA and protein, but it can also have profound biological functions such as controlling gene expression. These functions are determined by RNA structures (the ?shapes? of the RNAs), and therefore accurate modeling of these structures is critical for understanding RNA functions and for designing vaccines, test kits, and drugs. However, existing experimental methods for determining RNA structure are extremely expensive and often limited to short sequences, and existing computational tools are rather slow and not completely accurate. This slowness hinders their applications to full-length viral genomes such as coronavirus (about 30,000 nucleotides or ?letters?). Therefore, there is a critical need to develop better computational methods to predict RNA structures that are more accurate and more efficient and scalable to longer sequences such as whole genomes. Advances in this direction could improve our understanding of RNA viruses (which include common cold, influenza, Rabies, HIV, Ebola, polio, measles, and more) and increase our readiness to fight the next pandemic.<br/><br/>This project develops efficient algorithms for predicting the structures of multiple related (?homologous?) RNA sequences such as SARS-CoV-2 variants. These algorithms will scale linearly in both the average sequence length and the number of sequences. This linear scaling will enable whole genome applications. The researchers aim to achieve these goals with ideas from two branches of artificial intelligence (AI): natural language processing and deep learning. Specifically, this project will improve three types of homologous folding algorithms and adapt them to structure discovery: (1) align-then-fold: first align the homologous sequences and then predict the consensus structure for the aligned sequences; (2) iteratively align-and-fold: iterate between sequence alignment and structure prediction; and (3) simultaneous align-and-fold: jointly predict alignment and structures. The team will adapt these fast methods to discover conserved structures using global structure prediction for RNA viral genomes and transcripts. This research will make it possible to discover new RNA structures and functions, and will help the design of vaccines, test kits, and drugs.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Divisions of Information and Intelligent Systems and of Chemistry and the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods Program in the Division of Chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is why electronic devices are engineered to shed heat and reduce the temperature under operation. This problem is critical at the nanoscale, where it is necessary to control thermal conduction at boundaries between different materials and components. Consider two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, which have shown great promise. These consist of layers of atoms that are tightly bound in the plane and weakly bound between layers. If heat cannot be efficiently transported between layers, there would be significant limits to the use of 2D materials in next generation electronics. On the other hand, a strong thermal boundary could provide the potential for remarkable materials with thermal isolation better than air. The need to understand and control thermal boundary conductance at 2D-2D interfaces and between 2D and bulk materials motivates this project. Investigators will manipulate the thermal properties of 2D materials through changes in their interface structure and chemistry. Investigators will study how to control physical coupling and the effect of novel heat transfer mechanisms. An integral part of this project will be to develop experiential education programs for underrepresented students at the University of Texas at Dallas, the Carnegie Institute of Washington, and local high schools and community colleges. The researchers will work with local museums to develop new artwork conservation programs using optical techniques such as Raman spectroscopy.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>A major gap in the present knowledge of thermal boundary conductance (TBC) is how it can be manipulated by changing the structure of 2D-2D and 2D-bulk interfaces. As these interfaces are often set when the sample is fabricated, only a subset of structure-property relationships has been investigated, and often across disparate samples subject to the variation common to 2D materials. This project is applying extreme pressure within a diamond anvil cell as a new technique for broadly changing the structure of the same interface while measuring the TBC. This is allowing researchers to decode fundamental knowledge on the structure-property relationships for the TBC while also gaining insights into practical pathways for manipulating the thermal properties of 2D materials and thermal limitations of 2D devices. Specific structural and chemical changes at the interface include (1) the increase of physical coupling, (2) the transition from nonbonded to bonded chemistry, and (3) the onset of new phononic and nonphononic heat transfer mechanisms. Raman spectroscopy at optical wavelengths is being used to simultaneously characterize the interface and measure the TBC. The measurements are backed by first-principles modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to the TBC, these models are allowing researchers to identify renormalizations of the phonon dispersion and scattering, which can affect many phonon-limited areas of energy transport and conversion in 2D materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent years have witnessed several empirical successes of RL, such as RL agents that outperform humans in video and board games. However, many empirical RL algorithms today often require many training examples to learn and can produce unreliable solutions (solutions that exhibit catastrophic failures, for example). While these issues are typically not problematic when training RL agents in simulators, they pose significant difficulties when deploying RL to real-world problems where data (including human feedback) is expensive, and reliability is essential. The main novelty of this project will be the development of new RL algorithms that can learn efficiently (from as few training data points as possible) and reliably (avoid catastrophic failures with high probability). The development of such RL algorithms can expand the applications of RL systems from simulation to real-world applications where data is expensive to collect and safety is critical. In autonomous driving, the developed technologies can make self-driving cars adapt to new road conditions safely by making fewer mistakes. In generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), efficient and reliable RL algorithms that can learn from rich human feedback will enable better human-AI alignment, making AI systems improve reliably and safely under human guidance.<br/><br/>The main research goal of this project is to enable real-world RL by advancing RL techniques, theoretically and empirically. The critical innovation in the project is to develop safe and efficient RL algorithms by leveraging specific problem structures and rich human feedback. The project has three main thrusts. First, the project will establish risk-averse RL algorithms that are provably correct and scalable to high dimensional data. Second, the project will develop RL algorithms that can leverage common problem-specific structures for improved sample efficiency. Third, the project will create new algorithms for RL with rich feedback beyond scalar rewards (including preference-based feedback and positive demonstrations). In addition to the proposed work on algorithmic advancements, the project will focus on their deployment to real-world problems, including database query optimization and optimizing generative models such as Large Language Models and Diffusion Models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will observe plasma dynamics in the Auroral Acceleration Region (AAR), a plasma region that bridges the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere.  This mission will address the scientific questions: 1) What is the perpendicular spatial and temporal structure of the electric and magnetic field in the AAR?  2) What is the perpendicular spatial and temporal behavior of the electrons in the AAR?  3) How do the first two questions vary in altitude?  We will design and utilize the electric field instrument necessary to address these questions for this mission.  This design will be the first step in optimizing electric field instrumentation for small-sat technology.

For example, biosensors operate at the interface between living matter and electronics. Hybrid perovskites with organic and inorganic components have shown great promise for high efficiency and low-cost solar cells. Hybrid materials consisting of alternating layers of organic and inorganic species linked by metal ions have shown promise for device applications. By varying the species and their interactions, it may be possible to tune the electronic and optical properties for a given application. Despite the importance of interfaces in these materials, there are fundamental questions about how the spacing, bonding, and orientation of molecules affect the properties of these metal ion linked multilayers. The goal of this research is to determine the structure of the multilayer assemblies and how that structure dictates their performance. Investigators will elucidate the properties of these structures by studying how polarized light is absorbed and emitted, combined with vibrational spectroscopy that detect oscillations of bound atoms. These studies will enable the rational design of structured multilayers with targeted properties for improved performance in solar cells, catalysis, sensing, and more. Complementing these research efforts are multifaceted outreach/education activities.

Unfortunately, that structure is largely unknown. The goal of the research here is to 1) use a combination of polarized attenuated total reflectance (p-ATR), emission anisotropy, Raman, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the structure of multilayer assemblies, 2) understand how the metal ion and binding motif impact the multilayer structure and performance in photon upconversion solar cells, and 3) transfer knowledge of the technique and build a p-ATR instrument in the FSU Spectroscopy Lab user facility for use by the greater research community.

Despite the long history of research, understanding the mechanism and influence of nucleation on crystal structures is still challenging due to the difficulty in characterizing tiny and random phenomena at the sub-nanoscale level.  This CAREER award, jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), aims to figure out how the structure of salt solutions changes as their concentration increases and how this structure affects the final crystal formation.  To overcome the challenges, a levitation technique and powerful X-ray and neutron scattering will be combined, collaborating with Argonne National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The outcomes of this study will significantly enhance our understanding of the complex process of crystallization and its impact on the final crystal structure.  This knowledge could benefit industries like pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and batteries.  Throughout the project, a consortium will be formed as an educational platform to promote diversity in the STEM field, educate young scientists and engineers, and share our findings with K-12 students, teachers, and parents in Iowa through existing outreach programs led by Iowa State University.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Nucleation dominates the subsequent crystallization, crystal growth, and the structure and properties of final crystals.  Recently, nucleation has been reported to occur in multiple steps, forming pre-nucleation clusters (PNCs).  It is apparent that PNCs play a critically important role in multi-step nucleation and the final crystal structure, yet their nature is poorly understood.  The rationale for the proposed research is that a mechanistic understanding of complex crystallization will likely provide new opportunities to develop a method to control the nucleation and growth of desired crystal phases.  For this reason, this CAREER award, jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), aims to identify the concentration-dependent structural evolution of PNCs in aqueous salt solutions and the influence of solution structure on the crystallization pathways and the final crystal structure.  The current experimental obstacles will be overcome by integrating the solution electrostatic levitator (SEL) with synchrotron X-ray scattering at Argonne National Laboratory and neutron scattering at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The long-term goal of the project is to develop a predictive framework to anticipate and control the multi-pathway and multi-step crystallization in various aqueous solutions to obtain desired microstructures in the final crystal products.  The proposed research will lead to a vertical-step advancement toward elucidating the mechanism of complex crystallization in electrolyte solutions and its influence on the final crystal structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because these traits often lead to trade-offs that affect reproductive success and survival, understanding them is a fundamental question in biology. Leopard seals are large predators in the Southern Ocean and an extreme example of female-biased size dimorphism in mammals, where females are the larger than males. This project will investigate the causes and consequences of the size differences in leopard seals and will generate new data on the life history, reproductive physiology, and breeding biology of this important and difficult to study polar predator. The information is critical for understanding leopard seals? past, present, and future?from how the species evolved to predicting their resilience to environmental variation. The project also has a strong education component. It aims to increase polar biology research participation by training, mentoring, and supporting two postdocs, two grad students, and 25+ undergraduates. It will also engage students and the public in scientific research through outreach activities at local, national, and international scales.<br/><br/>Trait differences can lead to important trade-offs that affect biological processes at multiple scales, from intraspecific differences in fitness to species-level life history strategies. Leopard seals exhibit an extreme form of female-biased size dimorphism. However, for solitary, wide-ranging polar species like leopard seals, it is difficult to study their life history and reproductive biology. As a result, it is unknown how leopard seals? size dimorphism relates to other aspects of their biology. The goal of this project is to examine fitness trade-offs associated with female-biased dimorphism in leopard seals. Specifically, this study will (1) assess differences in male and female morphology and life history, (2) compare reproductive physiology between males and females, (3) investigate their breeding behavior and reproductive activities, and (4) conduct a cross-clade synthesis of female-biased dimorphism in mammals. The team will analyze existing specimens from biological collections and conduct field efforts to generate novel, complementary data. This information is critical for understanding how leopard seals evolved to survive and persist in the variable environment of the Southern Ocean. The research aligns with NSF?s Strategic Vision for Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research and supports ongoing efforts to create and utilize open polar research software, as well as data and sample reuse in polar research.

The campaign makes observations of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), the layer of the atmosphere from roughly 14km to 18km between the tropical troposphere and stratosphere, using balloons designed to float at a constant altitude for flights of up to 3 months.  The balloons are launched from the Seychelles and float around the equator just above the top of the TTL or in the lower stratosphere at an altitude near 20km.  Strateole-2 was planned as a set of three deployments, a preliminary engineering deployment with 8 balloon flights followed by two science deployments with 20 flights each. The first two deployments took place in 2019 and 2021 and funds for the PIs' participation in these deployments were provided through AGS-1642277.  The third deployment is scheduled to begin in October 2025.<br/><br/>Funds provided here support the development and deployment of a new instrument with the acronym RATS, for Reel-down Atmospheric Temperature Sensor.  Roughly speaking RATS is a thermometer lowered on a long tether below a balloon gondola which contains a second thermometer. The difference in temperature between the two thermometers can be used to detect gravity waves, atmospheric waves similar to ocean surface waves only they can propagate vertically as well as horizontally. RATS can detect gravity waves because the up and down motions of the waves cause cooling and warming, thus the difference in temperature between two appropriately separated thermometers can record the passage of a wave. The title of the proposal refers to the use of the RATS thermometers for the Characterization of Atmospheric Tropical waves of the lower Stratosphere (CATS).<br/><br/>Motivation for the work comes from the role of gravity waves in driving the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), the reversal in zonal wind direction over the equator that begins in the upper stratosphere and descends to the tropopause over a period slightly longer than two years.  The QBO matters for subseasonal weather prediction because it has been linked to modes of climate variability that influence weather around the world.  Models used for weather prediction have difficulty capturing the QBO, in part because the waves that drive it have wavelengths that are smaller than typical model grid spacings, particularly in the vertical.  RATS can detect waves with vertical wavelengths between 2 and 30 times the distance between the two thermometers, which is set to either 200m or 300m to capture wavelengths from 400m to 6km or 600m to 9km.  The longer wavelengths can be resolved by operational models and thus compared with the model output while the shorter ones are unresolved.<br/><br/>The award covers the development of the RATS hardware, which includes a Lower Measuring Unit (LMU) containing a thermometer (developed by CNES) along with an RS41 radiosonde sensor module (from Vaisala) to measures temperature, humidity, and pressure, and a GPS receiver for determining position.  The LMU is raised and lowered using a spool and pulley system that allows it to be docked to the gondola for launch and reeled down when the balloon reaches its flight altitude.  The gondola contains a second thermometer along with a barometer and GPS receiver.<br/><br/>The work is of societal interest given the prospects for better long-range weather predictions through improved representation of the wave driving of the QBO. The Strateole-2 field campaign involves collaborations with two operational weather prediction centers, thereby providing a connection from research to operations.  All field campaign data is made available to the global research community to pursue additional research topics on TTL physics and dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The lake's influence on weather is evident in rainfall totals, as considerably more rain falls over the lake than the catchment around it, and in the diurnal cycle of rainfall, as the lake creates a land-sea breeze effect which causes rain to fall during the day over the land and at night over the lake.  Given the lake's outsized influence on weather it is natural to ask what role it will play in climate change over the Lake Victoria Basin.  The question of Victoria's role in climate change is challenging for several reasons, among them the lack of observations over the region and the difficulty of making simulations which capture the range of scales and processes that matter for the region's weather and climate. Regarding the spatial scales the range extends from the size of the mesoscale thunderstorm complexes the deliver much of the rain to the regional-scale circulation patterns that control the seasonality of rainfall.  The region could also be influenced by changes in surface temperature over the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.<br/><br/>Research conducted here takes up the challenge of Victoria Basin climate change using a nested modeling strategy in which a regional model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, is run with three nested grids to capture the relevant scale range.  The outer grid covers all of Africa and much of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a 27km grid spacing while the innermost grid covers the Lake Victoria Basin at 3km, sufficient resolution to capture thunderstorm complexes.  WRF is coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), which includes a representation of Lake Victoria and its interactions with the overlying atmosphere.<br/><br/>The work involves simulations of past, present, and projected future climate over the basin.  Past climate simulations focus on a period 17 thousand years ago when the lake dried out completely, and the PIs hypothesize that the dessication of the lake was the result of changes in incoming solar radiation due to Earth's orbital cycle (which also caused the ice ages).  The project also considers the more general question of how regional climate depends on the size of Lake Victoria, which can be varied in the model simulations.  Changes in lake size could drive precipitation changes that cause further lake size change, as the lake receives perhaps 80% of its water input from local rainfall (rivers flowing into the lake provide the other 20%).<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given that about 40 million people live in the Lake Victoria Basin and are dependent on its water resources.

For example, more than 90% of DHH children in the US have hearing parents who do not know a sign language at the time of their DHH child?s birth. By the time these children are school-age, only 26% are using sign language regularly with their families at home and 53% are using some sign language at school. Consequently, a substantial number of DHH people are learning a sign language for the first time as young adults. Despite being one of the most common ways for DHH people to learn a sign language, researchers know very little about the factors that support second language learning success in this learning context. For example, proficiency in the first language and working memory are predictors of second language proficiency in other language learning contexts--are these predictors also important for DHH learners? Additionally, the quality and quantity of early language input that DHH people receive is highly variable--does this variation affect second language learning of a sign language?<br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation study aims to (1) extend existing research on predictors of second language proficiency to a new learning context, DHH second language signers, and (2) investigate relationships between spoken first language proficiency, non-verbal working memory, and signed second language proficiency. This research conducts a mediation modeling study assessing spoken language reading comprehension and non-verbal working memory in DHH people who grew up using a spoken language as a primary language and started learning a sign language as young adults and investigate how these variables relate to sign language receptive comprehension. The results of this study will lead to more generalizable theories of second language learning that account for variability in the quality and quantity of early first language acquisition. The results also inform family and school language policy for DHH children as well as second language teaching curriculum and interpreting strategies for adult DHH second language signers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Millions of adults live with neurological disorders, brain injury, mental illness, limb loss or paralysis. There is a need for accessible technologies that can more effectively address the care and rehabilitation needs of these patients. However, innovation in neurotechnology faces several challenges: The pace of innovation exceeds the rate of evaluation for acceptable performance; standards for the validation of safety, efficacy, and reliability of neurotechnology are lagging; current technologies are costly, limiting their deployment for treatment of disabilities; and the need to train new generations of physicians and engineers in emerging technologies steadily increases. <br/><br/>The Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Building Reliable Advances and Innovations in Neurotechnology (IUCRC BRAIN) will address the above challenges. The Center?s vision is built on a convergent research approach to the design and validation of reliable, ethical, patient-centered neurotechnologies and their use in understanding neural systems. BRAIN leverages wide-ranging expertise from neural, cognitive and rehabilitation engineering to neurorobotics, neuromodulation, and ethical artificial intelligence to enhance the rate of development and empirical validation of new neurotechnologies through partnerships with industry and other strategic partners while developing a highly skilled workforce; evaluating the impact of these technologies on quality of life; and integrating knowledge across disciplines ?such as the humanities with neurotechnologies ? to understand collective intelligence, and augment physical and cognitive capabilities. <br/><br/>The Center?s mission is multifold: to accelerate the progress of science and advance the national health by transferring neurotechnology to end users and to promote access to science, technology, engineering, and math by broadening new participation and retaining current participants.

As supplied primarily by natural gas and oil, hydrocarbons provide most of our energy needs through combustion, and also serve as the source of many manufactured products, including plastics, lubricants, fabrics, and building materials, among others.  Unfortunately, traditional high-temperature combustion and manufacturing processes are challenging to control, resulting in low energy efficiency, high emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), and generation of undesired side products (the latter compounding process complexity and energy inefficiency through the need for downstream separations).  The project explores a novel electrocatalytic approach to hydrocarbon utilization that operates near room temperature and controls the elementary steps involved in incorporating oxygen atoms into hydrocarbons such that combustion efficiency is greatly improved, while chemical manufacturing of oxygen-containing hydrocarbon products can be directed more effectively to desired products, resulting in lower energy consumption. Aside from the technical benefits, the project will be complemented by efforts to make the understanding of electrochemical processes more accessible to students and the general public.  To this effect, the project includes an approach to make the behavior of electrochemical interfaces audible, thus employing these ?electrochemical sounds? as a tool to teach electrochemistry at the university and high school levels.<br/> <br/>The project is built on the observation that the origin of low efficiency and selectivity in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions derives from the vastly different conditions needed for each of the elementary steps involved in the catalytic reaction pathway.  Controlled oxidation requires substrate adsorption in the correct binding mode, oxidation of intermediates to the desired product, and product desorption without inducing further reaction. Yet, conditions favoring one step often disfavor another. The project addresses this challenge by modulating the voltage applied to the electrocatalyst in sequence with the reaction steps, thereby rearranging the electrochemical interface formed between the electrocatalyst and the electrolyte.  Independent control is thus achieved to sequentially enhance hydrocarbon adsorption, the oxidation of adsorbed compounds, and the desorption of desired products.  The efficacy of the dynamic potential modulation approach will be examined in an alkane fuel cell application and in the sustainable synthesis of oxygenated precursor chemicals for plastics.  Taken together, these efforts will open novel avenues to the efficient production of chemicals, while aiding the clean energy transition of the U.S. chemical industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These networks not only provide habitats for freshwater species but also serve as conduits for water-borne pathogens that can cause severe diseases. Researchers will develop a predictive framework that will provide quantitative understanding of how the topological (structural connectivity), geometric (channel length, slope, etc.), and emergent features (e.g., channel ephemerality) of river networks influence the dynamics of flux movement under both steady and transient conditions. This framework will have the potential to assess how different scenarios of change, such as climate and land use change, may affect the future of river networks in their capacity to transport hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical fluxes throughout the landscape. This framework can also inform decisions about managing river networks to reduce their flooding potential and frequency, as well as the concentration of pathogens at critical locations within a basin. The project will disseminate fundamental and applied knowledge about river networks and their transport patterns and properties, with a focus on their relevance to hydrologic, engineering and earth sciences, to an audience of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students.  <br/><br/>The proposed research takes a holistic (mathematical-physical-observational) approach to understanding the flux dynamics on river networks by integrating static, dynamic and emergent connectivity attributes within a single framework that offers the potential to assess how different scenarios of change, such as climate and land use change, may affect the future of river networks in their capacity to transport hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical fluxes throughout the landscape. It leverages the strengths of network theory, remote sensing and field observations, hydrologic principles and numerical modeling to decipher the key topological, geometric, and emergent controls that govern dynamic patterns of flux transport on river networks. In particular, the researchers aim to (i) unveil the most relevant controls imposed by river networks on the aggregation of fluxes during the transport process, (ii) quantify their relation with external forcing such as climate and human actions, and (iii) propose vulnerability indicators for identifying hot spots of change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These challenges are exacerbated in systems with multiple strategic agents. The goal of this CAREER project is to advance the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of RL by addressing these challenges, and enable efficient and resilient RL-based control in engineering systems. This project will particularly focus on applications in computer and communication networks, which will guide the problem formulation, methodology development and evaluation.

In particular, physical predictions have led to the development of mathematical invariants which count algebraic curves in spaces, and conversely, the mathematical study of these invariants has led to advances in string theory. This project further develops two curve counting techniques, the ""logarithmic gauged linear sigma model"" (log GLSM) and ""quasimaps"", and their combination, with the goal of making progress on challenging conjectures from physics, which have appeared out of reach of mathematicians until recently. This project will offer ample training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. In addition, the PI will organize a yearly intensive weekend learning workshop on a topic of interest, as well as organize events aiming to counter stereotypes in STEM.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project will result in a proof of the localization formula for log GLSM, which is of utmost importance for the application of this technique. In addition, effective invariants, which are a major ingredient of the localization formula, will be studied. In a different direction, the PI will explore applications of log GLSM to the tautological ring, to establish structural predictions observed in physics, such as the ""conifold gap condition"", for the quintic threefold and other one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to establish the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence for quintic threefolds in all genera. With regard to quasi-maps, the second main technique employed in this project, the PI will use quasi-maps for explicit computations of Gromov-Witten invariants of non-convex complete intersections. Quasi-maps appear necessary for approaching some of the more mysterious predictions from physics, and hence log GLSM will be extended to allow for quasi-maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Building operations account for a large portion of infrastructure energy footprint.  Adaptive building components, such as origami-inspired adaptive facades, are a potential pathway to reduce this cost, by enabling building exteriors to be reconfigured based on light or thermal conditions.  Yet, a major challenge holding these concepts back is their inability to be systematically designed.  Moreover, there is a critical need to provide early and interactive design feedback to better facilitate more useful, nuanced, and ecologically responsive ideas.  This research will create tools that promote creativity, knowledge sharing, and collective workflows that lead to effective technology in all regards, from aesthetics to function.  The work will simultaneously create a new educational track for architecture and engineering students to learn about and test their ideas for adaptive building concepts.  This educational effort is fully integrated into the research by providing a testbed and the critical dataset to inform the computational tools.  Thus, this work will create new design processes for origami-inspired structures and seed the upcoming generations of designers with the skills and penchant to explore adaptive structure concepts.  <br/><br/>The overall goal of this work is to establish a new strategy to integrate architectural design processes and human-derived designs with physics-guided machine learning and computational design optimization, and to evaluate this strategy on the application of origami-inspired responsive architecture.

The production of concrete, the most widely used manufactured material, is a contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The production of cement results in 4-8% of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  There is a need to reduce the CO2 emissions both during construction and throughout the life of the concrete.  The Concrete Advancement Network (CAN), an Industry-University Cooperative Research Phase I Center (IUCRC) established by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Oregon State University, focuses on reducing the global warming potential (GWP) of concrete while improving the long-term durability of concrete thereby enabling significant economic and societal benefits. CAN focuses on implementing nanotechnology advancements, recyclability, digital manufacturing, multi-scale modeling, artificial intelligence, and advanced testing techniques will be used to fast-track the implementation of cutting-edge concepts into this key industrial sector, which frequently relies on older technology. Breakthroughs in the concrete field can be achieved using model-based prediction and verification combined with experimental methods, thereby advancing the pace of technology transfer from concept to implementation.  The CAN center aims to develop innovative concrete mixtures with reduced GWP while establishing methods to quantify the GWP and performance for member companies while training a diverse and skilled science and engineering workforce for the industry at large.  Thus, CAN activities are strategically important to the U.S. economy because they will provide long-term solutions for the nation?s deteriorating infrastructure and meet the demand for transportation and buildings.<br/><br/>The CAN University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee site has unique expertise and capabilities related to the use of nanotechnology in concrete, which are translated to the development and effective use of nano-engineered composites, ultra-high-performance concrete, photocatalytic concrete, smart sensor-embedded construction, innovations in by-product utilization, application of supplementary cementitious materials, carbon reduction and sequestration, digital manufacturing, and the extension of service life.

The targeted reactions are expected to lead to a diverse set of cyclic structures containing carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms. Detailed studies of the mechanisms underpinning these transformations will also be undertaken, helping to facilitate future discoveries. The outcomes of this research stand to have broad scientific and societal impacts including in the pharmaceutical, material, and agrochemical industries. The funded research will also support the training of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art chemistry techniques, helping to strengthen the future STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce in the United States. In addition, Dr. Newton and his team will work to create and disseminate free, open-access chemistry educational tools to reduce barriers and broaden engagement in STEM. Finally, this award will support an outreach program, in collaboration with local high school teachers, to provide hands-on laboratory experience and career guidance to the greater Athens, GA community.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the research program under the guidance of Christopher Newton is to develop novel, pericyclic-based strategies for the convergent synthesis of high-value complex ring systems. This study aims to tailor the reactivity of cycloaddition reactions, including the venerable Diels-Alder reaction, through the use of atypical, high oxidation state building blocks. The joining of these novel fragments leads to products of increased complexity and functionality when compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. The research plan has three distinct objectives: (i) development of the first general family of cross-coupling active Diels?Alder dienes, (ii) a one-step Diels?Alder/ring expansion route to 7- and 8-membered hetero- and carbocyclic motifs, and (iii) development of a novel, highly reactive class of aza-dienophiles.

The goals of the research include verification and documentation of the capability, in sufficient detail to allow commercialization by vehicle manufacturers. The approach will include the use of testing data from smart freeway infrastructure to validate the system design.

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. <br/><br/>This project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them.

This CAREER award aims to understand how nanoparticles adhered to leukocyte surfaces influence cell deformability and migration from blood microcirculation to inflamed tissues. A combination of biophysical models and microfluidic experiments will be used to generate both fundamental knowledge and design rules for engineering cellular drug carriers. The integrated education plan will disseminate research findings by providing enriching learning experiences at various levels: e.g., a nationwide outreach program for K-12 students, new interdisciplinary teaching examples for undergraduates and graduates, and science communications for the public.<br/><br/>There exists a critical knowledge gap between multiscale mechanical and adhesive properties and particle transport in microscale flows, hindering the development of architected materials. This award aims to test the hypothesis that drug nanoparticles influence leukocyte mechanical and adhesive properties across multiple length scales, thus modulating the delivery of drug payload to the site of inflammation and therapeutic efficacy through three major transport steps: crossflow movement in small blood vessels; rolling and adhesion on the vascular surface under physiological shear; transendothelial migration through small pores. In contrast to in vivo techniques commonly used in biomedical research, this award explicitly models the physical interaction between nanoparticles and cell membranes to examine multiscale deformations; a microfluidic cell culture recapitulates the kinetics of vascular adhesion and transport in vitro. This in silico-in vitro approach will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of leukocyte transport and efficiently explore a multi-dimensional parameter space for nanoparticles (e.g., shape, size, rigidity, concentration, and adhesion strength). Phase diagrams and multiscale structure-property relationships generated over a broad parameter range will serve as a robust and high throughput platform technology to design drug carriers tailored for various species, diseases, and drug administration methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the developing nervous systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, neurons express a wide diversity of cell adhesion molecules, which mediate interactions that are essential for specifying target selection and connectivity patterns. This proposal will study the molecular control of circuit development through a combination of genetic and biophysical approaches in which binding affinities and cell surface localization of cell adhesion molecules are manipulated and their effects on neural circuit formation are studied in the larva fruit fly. The proposed research will have a significant impact on multiple research fields due to the generality of the phenomena to be studied. Moreover, integrating computational and structural biology with developmental neuroscience is likely to stimulate similar collaborative efforts in these fields. In terms of training, students and postdocs working on this project will develop a deep appreciation of both computational and experimental work, thus providing exemplars for broadly trained interdisciplinary scientists. Women scientists constitute over 50% of the participating groups. The research program includes training of high school and undergraduate students, many of whom are from underrepresented minorities in sciences, through summer internships. The team will continue partnering with a network of high schools across lower-income districts and minority serving colleges, and run the DREAM-High cloud computing course for high school students that increases student awareness of and interest in biological sciences, empowers students to adopt scientific reasoning and critical-thinking skills, and inspires students to seek post-secondary education in related fields.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of binding affinity and cell surface availability of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on circuit formation in Drosophila. The study will focus on the larval neuromuscular system and mushroom body development. At the molecular level, the focus will be on two interacting groups of CAMs, the Dprs (Defective in Proboscis extension Response) and the DIPs (Dpr Interacting Proteins). The choice of these proteins and anatomical structures is based on the deep understanding of the biophysical properties of DIPs and Dprs that has emerged over the past few years, and on the demonstration of their crucial roles in the development of these anatomical structures. Here, by examining various Dpr/DIP cognate pairs in different neurodevelopmental settings, the findings should deepen currently limited knowledge of the in vivo consequences of altering avidity using both changes in binding affinities and in expression levels. A particular focus will be on the phenomenon of cis inhibition, whereby interactions between cognate binding partners on the same cell compete with trans binding to partners on apposed cells. The underlying hypothesis is that cis-inhibition is a key regulatory mechanism in neural development.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Neural Systems Cluster in IOS and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in MCB of the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This transition is even more remarkable due its precariousness - its cellular and metabolic complexity and photosynthetic capabilities are the result of stealing and repurposing cell parts and genes of its algal prey. This research will determine how this process happens, and thereby shed some light on important, yet enigmatic, evolutionary processes. The project will help to train two postdoctoral scientists and prepare them for a professional career in scientific research. The project will also train undergraduate students in the laboratory, and will engage with the Zephyr Foundation, a marine science literacy and education program, which serves regional schools (levels 6-12), including districts with predominantly underrepresented groups in sciences.

Mixotrophy in Mesodinium is driven by organelle stealing (or kleptoplasty), which in M. chamaeleon evenly supports its nutritional and energy needs between feeding and photosynthesis. However, in M. rubrum it is more a means to steal organelles, including the active nucleus of its prey, to fully exploit its prey?s photosynthetic metabolism. Understanding how M. rubrum has adapted to be fully reliant on stolen organelles and their metabolism for its survival is one of the main objectives of this project. The project will use comparative omics approaches between these two species and the heterotroph, M. pulex, to illuminate genetic and metabolic adaptations and innovations. The project will also use spatial proteomics and immunochemistry, to understand how proteins from the stolen nucleus in M. rubrum transit to the chloroplasts, despite massive reorganization and loss of endomembrane continuity in their new host.

This success is largely attributed to the paradigm of training ML systems by minimizing a single loss function using efficient optimization algorithms. Yet, the landscape is shifting, with many emerging ML applications being better described as games played between multiple intelligent agents or algorithms. These games can be explicit, as seen in markets, traffic routing,  game-solving systems (such as AlphaZero), and multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems, or implicit, as in the case of generative adversarial networks, adversarial examples, robust optimization, and so on.  While game theory offers a lens to understand these agent interactions, its classical form struggles to address challenges in contemporary ML applications. This is because traditional game theory often focuses on simpler, low-dimensional games, while ML frequently grapples with complex, high-dimensional ones. This project aims to provide a new theory for these complex, high-dimensional games, and as a result, offer new methods to analyze, train, and design multi-agent ML systems. This project includes an education plan that incorporates course development of both graduate and undergraduate courses, as well as training for graduate students and research opportunities for undergraduates.<br/>   <br/>The first part of the project focuses on concave games, which encompass many that traditional game theory has studied, including all finite games. A game is concave if each agent chooses their strategy from a convex set, and their utility is a concave function in their own strategy. The investigator aims to develop optimal uncoupled algorithms for computing and learning equilibria in high-dimensional games. These games are common in ML applications, and the high-dimensionality often arises from numerous agents or complex available actions. Uncoupled algorithms require minimal knowledge about the game and little player coordination, making them especially suited for high-dimensional games and the preferred type of algorithms in practice. The second part of the project shifts focus to non-concave games, where agents may have non-concave utilities. The investigator plans to thoroughly reassess foundational solution concepts, given that conventional equilibrium existence often hinges on the concavity of utility functions. The main goal of this part is to identify appropriate solution concepts for non-concave games and understand their computational complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This megadrought is an ongoing climate crisis that is severely impacting natural ecosystems, managed forests, agricultural systems, and human water resources. Despite such serious consequences, our understanding of the megadrought is quite limited. Specifically, the research community lacks a comprehensive understanding of how the megadrought has impacted soil moisture, particularly the deeper moisture pools that are critical for vegetation health. There is also a limited understanding of how carbon and water cycling have changed over the last 23 years; an important indicator of ecosystem function that mediates global climate feedbacks. This research enhances our ecological understanding of how drylands have been impacted by the megadrought, which sets the stage for a more predictive understanding of future climate change impacts. This knowledge is transferable to other dryland and non-dryland biomes, as such megadroughts are projected to increase in frequency and severity globally in the coming decades. <br/><br/>To accomplish these aims, the research combines hundreds of long-running soil moisture depth profiles with remotely-sensed estimates of shallow soil moisture, deep water availability, and groundwater. These data allow us to assess the impacts of the megadrought on plant-available water, and serve as a crucial validation of these remotely-sensed products for drought monitoring. Data from 21 eddy covariance towers are paired with a new gridded dataset of empirically-modeled ecosystem fluxes to uncover the drivers of dryland ecosystem function, and quantify the impact of the megadrought on carbon-water fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolutions. By synthesizing these data sources their unique strengths are leveraged; addressing detailed mechanistic questions with in situ data, and examining broad trends in carbon-water cycling using modeled and remotely-sensed data. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Ecosystem Science and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome this challenge, this project will design, fabricate, and test modular 3D printing nozzles engineered to structure multi-material composites rapidly before deposition. Achieving faster multi-material printing with higher resolution will open new avenues to product development and manufacturing in several sectors, including health care, electronic device fabrication, and food processing.

However, it is unclear how architectures distort when the tortuous geometries are operated at high flow rates. This award will use experimental and computational tools to systematically study architecture fidelity as a function of three classes of independent variables: device geometry, ink rheology, and volumetric throughput.

This grant supports research on how organic semiconductor crystals can be fabricated as networks of twisted braids that counterintuitively outperform single crystals in the transport of electrons and detection and emission of different types of light. These twisted crystals are formed from the melt, making it possible to leverage high throughput fabrication methods. These novel materials support plastic electronics industries based on flexible light emitting diodes and displays, transistors, and wearable electronics for sensing and health monitoring thus augmenting the U.S. economy. At the intersection of solid-state physics, materials science, and process engineering, this multidisciplinary research serves as a rich training platform for undergraduate and graduate students, contributing to workforce development as called for by the CHIPS and Science Act. The colorful patterns created by twisted crystals form the basis of interactive STEAM workshops at the K-12 level. Through this activity, students learn about the concepts of crystals and light-matter interactions.<br/><br/>Designing materials for chiroptoelectronics has relied on the synthesis of chiral molecules enantioselectively or the labor- and atom-intensive resolution of racemic mixtures of enantiomers. Twisted crystals that form spontaneously from the melt can manifest mesoscale chiroptical properties. The challenges facing the advancement of twisted crystals for chiroptoelectronics are the lack of spatial control over the twist sense and direction, and the incompatibility of current batch processing with high throughput manufacturing. This research articulates mechanisms governing twisted crystal formation and how the organization of crystal fibers affects electron and photon transport. This understanding guides the development of scalable processing methods to fabricate twisted crystal films with prescribed orientations and twist sense. Hybrid screw extrusion and roll-to-roll coating of molten material into patterned films are investigated as a scalable manufacturing method for these chiroptoelectronic materials. This continuous processing method involves inline mixing of molecular compounds and twisting additives prior to extrusion; precise control over film thickness, crystallization temperature, and shear profile; and tunable patterning using corrugated rollers.

The PI will address these issues by leveraging a novel theoretical framework known as the entanglement bootstrap program, which was pioneered by the PI. This theoretical framework will lead to the development of efficient methods to identify and characterize strongly entangled phases of matter in experiments and in many-body simulations on classical computers. The PI will also develop a comprehensive education and outreach plan, which includes an education and training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar. Moreover, the research activities will be disseminated in a form that is accessible to a broad set of researchers.

First, the PI will discover the topological invariants that can characterize many-body quantum phases. Second, the PI will develop a method to extract these topological invariants from the data that are readily available from numerical studies and experiments.

Recent technological advancements have enabled the development of therapeutic mRNAs that can be delivered to humans, notably evident in widely used vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. The success of these therapeutics suggests the potential of new generations of mRNA medicines with applications beyond vaccines, such as anti- cancer therapies and treatment for genetic disorders. Realizing these goals will require the design of mRNAs that optimize protein expression and can be customized for specific tissues and cellular environments. The goal of this project is to leverage a strategy for quantifying the translation functions of synthetic libraries of thousands of RNAs to discover features that modify the timing and quantity of protein production. Insights into these fundamental rules for gene expression will be important building blocks for engineering new classes of mRNA therapeutics to address a broader spectrum of human disease, thus advancing RNA biotechnology. The project will also provide training opportunities for postdoctoral scholars and engage middle and high school students in RNA biology.<br/><br/>The quantity of protein synthesized from an mRNA can span more than two orders of magnitude, vary across cell types, and rapidly change in response to cellular signals. The features of mRNAs that determine this range of expression remain largely unknown. Possibilities include sequence motifs recognized by RNA-binding proteins, structured RNA elements and nucleotide modifications that affect the translation process. This project will employ a recently developed massively parallel reporter assay to systematically identify features of thousands of human and viral 5?

Aim 1 will examine the translation functions of diverse classes of nucleotide modifications and identify the molecular mechanisms that recognize them. Aim 2 will quantify protein production from a synthetic library of circular RNAs to identify RNA elements capable of accessing mechanisms for non-canonical translation initiation.

This is essential in enabling neural network models to be widely deployed in sensitive fields across engineering domains.

The second is the Allen-Cahn equation, where the solution strategy of physics-inspired neural networks is analyzed. In the second problem, the adaptivity of neural networks to low-dimensional moving interfaces plays a key role when comparing to e.g. fixed mesh finite element methods.

This data movement consumes significant energy and slows down the processing speed, particularly for data-driven applications such as machine learning workloads. In-memory computing (IMC) is a promising solution to address this issue by performing computations inside memory. However, IMC techniques using emerging memory technologies suffer from multiple key technical challenges that limit their applicability in today?s computing systems. Significant error in the computations is likely with these IMC techniques. The processing latency also increases significantly with data-width; e.g., this is approximately an exponential increase for the multiplication operation. This project addresses the critical challenges with today?s IMC techniques by exploiting a simple and uniform representation of data. Complex arithmetic operations on weighted binary data are transformed into simple bit-wise memory-friendly operations on uniform bit-streams. Successful completion of the project will accelerate and reduce the power and energy consumption of a wide range of applications from biomedicine (e.g., retinal implants), to security (e.g., miniaturized unmanned aerial vehicles), to smart sensors and machine learning (e.g., speech recognition). The team will share the project outcomes, including articles, simulators, and hardware and software toolkits, with the research community. The findings and technical outputs will be integrated into instructional materials for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 classroom settings. The project activities will engage active participation of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project combines the complementary properties of two emerging technologies, IMC and unary computing (UC), to implement a high-performance, reliable, and energy-efficient data processing platform with high computational ability.

It also addresses the latency and cost-efficiency of the existing UC designs with combinational CMOS logic. The technology explored in this project aims to improve the robustness of IMC operations to noise and variation by processing uniform bit-streams. The platform is highly parallel and effectively scales with the size of computations. It enables fast, accurate, and simple execution of a wide range of arithmetic operations entirely in memory. It enjoys independent bit-wise operations, avoiding long chains of operations, an important source of in-efficiency in today?s IMC techniques.

Both flows are also hypothesized to mediate long-distance biochemical signaling within the plant that coordinate whole-plant function and represent important targets for crop improvement for sustainable agriculture. This project unites expertise on physicochemistry, device engineering, and plant biology to develop new tools for interrogating these processes and new fundamental biophysical and biological understanding of them. Many fundamental questions remain on the physiological mechanisms of operation and functional roles of these transport processes, particularly relative to the phloem and its coupling to the xylem and other tissues: 1) the biophysics of the loading and unloading of sugars, water, and signaling molecules to and from the phloem; 2) the dynamics of phloem transport as a function of biotic (e.g., photosynthetic rate and localized tissue growth) and abiotic (e.g., diurnal variations in water status) processes; and 3) the coordination of these processes at the whole-organism scale. Progress on these topics has been hindered by the lack of experimental tools with which to investigate hypotheses across scales, from local membrane-mediated to system-scale processes, either in vitro or in planta. To address these questions, an international team of researchers in the USA and France will work together to develop the first synthetic system that allows for recapitulation of the full, coupled operation of the xylem and phloem systems to test a diversity of biophysical hypotheses on the mechanisms and function of plant vasculature. The team will also develop new sensors for sensing of vascular transport processes, in-plant; and inform and confront in vitro experiments with biophysical and biochemical experiments in vivo.

These benign viruses introduce RNAs into plants to turn off the genes of pathogens that invade crops, thereby enhancing the ability of the plant to fight off pathogens through a process called virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). This project will use computational approaches, including artificial intelligence methods, to design hairpin shaped RNA structures that, when inserted into the virus genome, will increase the inherent stability of the viral RNA genome or the hairpin?s stability when encountering the enzyme that is responsible for replicating the genome. The VIGS RNAs will, thus, remain intact and capable of silencing the genes of pathogens that invade the plant hosts. This type of RNA therapy has significant impact on the agricultural economy, with direct application to treating, for example, citrus greening, a disease that has significant affected both domestic and foreign production of citrus fruits. In addition, graduate students and postdoctoral trainees will gain experience in working under an academic/private company collaboration.<br/><br/>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) makes use of plus-strand RNA viruses as vectors to exploit natural antiviral defenses (RNA silencing) in plants. Drs. Simon and Gao have determined that thermodynamic features of every viral hairpin contribute to stability of the entire viral genome, and natural hairpin structures reflect the end point of long-term thermodynamic evolution. Thus, hairpins inserted into viral RNA genomes that maintain the thermodynamic properties of endogenous hairpins should be stable. The investigators will extend our understanding of parameters required for stable hairpin design, focusing on features found in the few hairpins that were unstable when inserted into the citrus yellow vein associated-virus (CYVaV). They will investigate whether similar parameters dictate hairpin stability when inserted into unrelated tobacco rattle and citrus tristeza plant viruses. If CYVaV hairpins are not stable in these viruses, we will assess if hairpins that mimic their own hairpins are stable. They will also test the hypothesis that the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible for insert instability due to the inherent lack of fidelity of these polymerases. Additionally, they will determine if non-optimized hairpins introduce new RdRp obstructions to processivity. Rational design will be used to increase the fidelity of the CYVaV RdRp to ascertain if this enhanced property leads to stabilization of previously unstable hairpins. Effect of alterations on the fidelity/processivity of the RdRp will be determined using Nanopore sequencing to assess if there are fewer 5? terminal truncated RNAs and deletion products like defective RNAs, and if unstable hairpin inserts are now stabilized. Finally, to assist other researchers who desire stable inserts in their viruses, they will develop computational methodologies for stable hairpin design, which will require repeated interplay between experimental results and algorithm design software.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Plant Genome Research Program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach simplifies network management in various environments such as cloud computing data centers, enterprises, and mobile networks. IBN also holds potential for enhancing network security by reducing human errors and responding swiftly to emerging threats. However, there has been little attention given to the unique security challenges posed by IBN for network vendors, administrators, tenants, and users. This project seeks to bridge that gap by addressing IBN's security and trust aspects. The project's novelties are designing a secure and trustworthy IBN architecture, identifying vulnerabilities in current designs, defending against operational attacks, and enhancing resilience against emerging threats. The project's broader significance and importance are in influencing real-world designs, standardization efforts, and industry practices to create a safer and more resilient digital infrastructure for society.<br/><br/>The project aims to embed security considerations into the foundational principles of IBN, design a secure reference architecture, and explore IBN's interactions with other network components. The research team addresses these goals in three central and interdependent research thrusts. The first thrust focuses on securely fulfilling network intents, including designing formal models, identifying security-related race conditions, and addressing side-channel attack vectors. The second thrust ensures the secure fulfillment of network intents through scalable network provenance collection for generating access control policies and maintaining overall decision-making integrity. The third thrust involves integrating secure IBN into the broader network infrastructure, addressing cross-plane vulnerabilities, enforcing correct cross-plane functionality, and enhancing reasoning capabilities through root cause analysis.

Indeed, eigenfunctions are steady-state solutions to the Schrdinger equation, and their eigenvalues are the corresponding energies. To illustrate the connection to number theory, the task of accurately counting the number of eigenfunctions of a given frequency on the flat torus is equivalent to counting the number of ways an integer can be expressed as the sum of, say, two squares.

Expected outcomes include the possibility of model-free operation, which can enable communication when traditional model-dependent modes requiring mathematical models are out of reach. International collaboration between India and the US will broaden the project impact, and software and hardware testbeds will translate theory into practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research generated by this project will reveal adaptations for maintaining this cellular complexity in a unicellular organism, which has diverged from ancestors inhabiting ponds, estuaries, and sediment surface habitats, to become a major photosynthetic planktonic species in the world?s coastal oceans with wide reaching ecological roles. This transition is even more remarkable due its precariousness - its cellular and metabolic complexity and photosynthetic capabilities are the result of stealing and repurposing cell parts and genes of its algal prey. This research will determine how this process happens, and thereby shed some light on important, yet enigmatic, evolutionary processes. The project will help to train two postdoctoral scientists and prepare them for a professional career in scientific research. The project will also train undergraduate students in the laboratory, and will engage with the Zephyr Foundation, a marine science literacy and education program, which serves regional schools (levels 6-12), including districts with predominantly underrepresented groups in sciences. The project will also engage with the public in a collaboration with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History?s Underwater Parks Day to help educate the public about the oceans? ?invisible? (i.e., microscopic) biodiversity. <br/><br/>The project will compare cellular, metabolic, and genetic adaptations across a genus of ciliates that span functional nutritional modes of heterotrophy to phototrophy, through a continuum of mixotrophy. Mixotrophy in Mesodinium is driven by organelle stealing (or kleptoplasty), which in M. chamaeleon evenly supports its nutritional and energy needs between feeding and photosynthesis. However, in M. rubrum it is more a means to steal organelles, including the active nucleus of its prey, to fully exploit its prey?s photosynthetic metabolism. Understanding how M. rubrum has adapted to be fully reliant on stolen organelles and their metabolism for its survival is one of the main objectives of this project. The project will use comparative omics approaches between these two species and the heterotroph, M. pulex, to illuminate genetic and metabolic adaptations and innovations. The project will also use spatial proteomics and immunochemistry, to understand how proteins from the stolen nucleus in M. rubrum transit to the chloroplasts, despite massive reorganization and loss of endomembrane continuity in their new host. The same techniques will also seek to understand what ciliate genes may be contributing to maintaining and controlling stolen organelles and facilitating exploitation of their metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using an interdisciplinary approach based on science and technology studies, food studies, and urban geography, this research will improve the urban food system by revealing how people think about the future of food, how platform technologies are reshaping both food access and people?s food practices, and how platforms affect food insecurity. Results will be distributed to directly benefit local food system administrators, legislators and planners focused on addressing food insecurity. Research findings and lessons will also be of more general use for federal food, health and wellness programs, and for state agencies developing food access and nutrition policy. <br/><br/>The project broadly asks: how do food platforms shape the ways people think about and access food, how do they reorganize both the urban food system and individual food practices, and how does platform technology influence the structural conditions that cause hunger? The project hypothesizes that platform technology produces contested food imaginaries, directs the flow of food in ways that privilege chain retail, changes what and when people eat, and increases food insecurity by increasing access to convenience food in low-income areas. The intellectual merit of the project centers on how platforms both shape, and in some cases deepen, social inequality and food injustice. The novel methodology expands how platforms are analyzed in relation to food, domestic spaces and everyday forms of social reproduction. It also develops and tests new research techniques by using platform technology to conduct digital surveys, interviews, media content analyses, geospatial mapping, and ethnographic investigations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced semiconductor packaging is increasingly an essential process to achieving the performance demands of many of the emerging applications that are now at the forefront of technological innovation?for example, fifth-generation (?5G?) wireless communication, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and machine learning, advanced sensors, and virtual/augmented reality. Currently, the United States does not have a meaningful onshore semiconductor advanced packaging manufacturing sector, as less than 3% of semiconductor advanced packaging manufacturing occurs in the United States; the nation is overwhelmingly reliant on offshore foundries, primarily in Asia. As the limits of Moore?s Law are reached and packaging becomes a more complex and important part of the semiconductor manufacturing process, this NSF Engine is positioned to capture the economic growth, drive key technological advances in a rapidly-changing sector, and secure our national defense by rooting a vital industry on American shores. In addition to the significant national impacts, the NSF Engine has the potential to create thousands of good-paying jobs in a highly dynamic and innovative technology space. The NSF Engine has already created flagship upskilling and retraining programs that have created ladders into economic opportunity for workers from all educational backgrounds. If successful, the concentration of semiconductor talent, existing physical infrastructure, and research capacity of the region could represent a key national security asset and a new force for economic prosperity in the region.<br/><br/>The broader region of service encompasses a seven-county region in Central Florida centered around Osceola County. This is a strategic location for an emerging semiconductor hub, and the NSF Engine is uniquely positioned for success in part by geography. NeoCity, the heart of the NSF Engine?s efforts, is located in one of the nation?s fastest growing metropolitan areas for STEM talent, with proximity to the Space Coast and one of the nation?s leading technical universities with a strong concentration of the nation?s semiconductor research talent, the University of Central Florida. Additionally, the NSF Engine has built a STEM-focused high school in the NeoCity Industrial Park with specific workforce tracks and internships that feed into various opportunities within the local semiconductor industry.<br/><br/>The region was also the recipient of a Build Back Better Regional Challenge award as well as significant investments from the state of Florida totaling nearly $300 million to position and scale the region?s capacity to serve as a semiconductor hub for the nation. These efforts have been led by ICAMR, Inc. (d.b.a. BRIDG), which is a non-profit public-private partnership with heavy involvement by Osceola County government, R1 academic and nonprofit research institutions (University of Central Florida, University of Florida, imec-USA), a Hispanic Serving Institution and technical community college (Valencia College), a workforce development provider (CareerSource Central Florida), economic and community development organizations (Orlando Economic Partnership, Florida High Tech Corridor), and various industry partners. Each play a significant and complementary role within the broader ecosystem.<br/><br/>Use-inspired research and translation activities by the NSF Engine, both occurring in academic labs and municipally-owned industrial fabrication facilities, stand to advance the current state of practice by advancing digital twin technology as it relates to the semiconductor industry, creating new technology for assured and secured semiconductor packaging, and developing new technologies for the implementation of vertical interconnects and interposers (e.g., through-silicon via, through-glass via, through-substrate via) that would position the NSF Engine at the leading edge of chip packaging design and manufacturing. Leading industry partners in the semiconductor sector have already initiated direct engagement with researchers to inform, test, and scale prototypes that result from research activities, further positioning the region as a central point for research talent and industry partners in the semiconductor sector to crossover and converge to ultimately produce significant advanced packaging innovation.<br/><br/>This NSF Engine ? due to a combination of intentional efforts to train a prepared workforce, unprecedented investments in physical infrastructure (including a county-owned fabrication lab), targeted economic development initiatives, and a regional concentration of experienced semiconductor research and engineering talent ? has a unique capacity and the necessary competitive advantage to succeed and thrive in a highly competitive sector and provide our nation with a key domestic supply chain resource for one of the most important technologies in the world today. It is also poised to create another vital national resource: a highly trained semiconductor workforce. Together with key partners such as Valencia College, the NSF Engine has already begun the essential work of creating pathways to high-paying jobs in the sector for residents from across the region that open opportunity and create economic stability for families up and down the economic ladder. These factors position the NSF Engine to be a powerful engine for U.S. competitiveness, economic opportunity, and advanced semiconductor packaging innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, one might say ""John is building a house"" for an event that happens over time"" or ""John is crossing the finish line"" for an instantaneous event. Different languages express time in events differently. To talk about ongoing events in English, speakers use the same -ing form in ""John is building a house"" and ""John is crossing the finish line"". In other languages, by contrast, different grammatical markers indicate whether an ongoing event happens over time or instantly. Such differences in how time in events is expressed can be tricky for English speakers learning such languages. This doctoral dissertation project examines difficulties that native English speakers may have when learning how to express time in events in a second language that encodes such differences in the grammar. The study focuses on two things: how the grammar and meanings of such grammatical markers express time in events, and how use of these markers connects to real-world situations. In addition to the training of a graduate student, this research is expected to be beneficial to second-language teachers and inform textbooks. The project provides insights into the challenges speakers face in learning and using different grammatical markers.<br/><br/>Three experimental studies investigate knowledge, production, and comprehension of grammatical aspect markers. Study 1 explores whether second language learners know the ways that an aspect-marking language expresses time in events by having them judge the naturalness of sentences with time-in-event markers. Study 2 looks at how these same participants express time in events by having them continue the beginning of written sentences that include a variety of such markers. Study 3 examines how these same learners link spoken sentences containing time-in-event markers to pictures representing events in the world. By comparing results from these studies, the study sheds light on what makes such grammatical markers challenging to learn and use for second language speakers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The thirteen-lined ground squirrel is an obligatory mammalian hibernator. During hibernation, squirrels switch to lipid metabolism and do not eat during the entire hibernation (up to 8 months). This remarkable abstinence from food is referred to as self-induced seasonal anorexia. How hibernators exhibit negligible hunger drive despite a prolonged period of food deprivation and how their metabolism copes with this process remains one of the biggest mysteries in energy homeostasis regulation. This proposal seeks to understand the molecular, cellular and circuitry mechanisms that allow hibernators to survive for months without food, using tools and approaches from a spectrum of disciplines that have not been previously used for hibernation research, such as optogenetics and fiber photometry.  This grant will support outreach program (Sensory Physiology Club), an extracurricular educational activity aimed to promote scientific knowledge in animal neurophysiology among school students from middle- and high schools from Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts. The efforts are designed to spark interest in biological science through lectures and interactive experimental activities, which go beyond the school curricula. The outcomes of study have far-reaching implications for fundamental biology, medicine, and the future of humanity. Induction of a hibernation-like state could help improve organ transplantation, recovery from ischemia, stroke, or brain injury, and may ultimately enable long-distance space travel, e.g., for manned missions to Mars.<br/><br/>The main scientific goal of this study is to broaden our limited understanding of seasonal metabolic reprogramming and anorexia during hibernation. This study will test the hypothesis that the reversible, self-induced anorexia during hibernation is achieved through uncoupling between peripheral hunger/satiety hormones and the hypothalamic feeding center. Specific aims of this proposal include investigation of the neuronal mechanisms that support insensitivity to metabolic cues and permeability of blood brain barrier and their contribution to hunger suppression during hibernation. This proposal represents an interdisciplinary endeavor that spans multiple scales and integrates various tools and approaches from a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines. Ranging from biochemical blood and tissues analysis, metabolic profiling, transcriptomics to in vivo imaging, electrophysiology, and animal behavior studies. A major innovative aspect of this proposal is the use of in vivo brain imaging, which has not been previously used in hibernating animals. The outcome gained from this study will lay the foundation for rational design of pharmacological tools to understand how life in mammals can persist under extreme conditions of long-term cold exposure and starvation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The high level of WAT in humans, as compared to other primates, is interpreted as an adaptation to the assumed frequent dietary scarcity faced by our hominin ancestors. This concept is central to the idea that human bodies are adapted to face scarcity, and thus that humans are evolutionary predisposed to store energy in the form of fat (the thrifty-genotype and thrifty-phenotype hypotheses). The current obesity epidemic, according to this idea, results from a mismatch between a past environment of scarcity and the contemporary dietary abundance that is found in many places around the globe. If this idea is correct, the obese-tendency trait should be found in humans but not in other primates. However, very few data exist to indicate whether or not other non-human primates present this characteristic. If this trait is present in other non-human primates, it would suggest that a high WAT level is an ancient evolutionary trait and not a recent adaptation to scarcity. This doctoral dissertation project addresses this question by investigating how dietary changes affect body composition in humans and baboons. The study includes a variety of outreach activities, and collaborations with the Great Ape Heart project, which is constituted by a group of experts that aid in understanding and treating cardiac disease in great ape species.<br/><br/>To assess whether the obesity-prone tendency of humans is a trait shared with other primates, the researchers: (1) examine how dietary composition correlates with dietary biomarkers in humans; (2) assess body composition and bone mineral density in baboons (Papio anubis) that ate a low fiber but high fat and sugar diet, and (3) compare adipose deposits and lean body mass between species using DiceCT scans. The study informs about the variation in the plasticity of body composition across primate species, providing insights into the evolutionary history of human and non-human primate adiposity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To circumvent these issues, the technique of using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) has been proposed. RIS can redirect reflected signals toward intended users, thus avoiding signal blockage, mitigating interference, or increasing security. Engineering the desired propagation environment, however, requires knowledge about important parameters such as the directions of the users or transmitters to be available at the RIS. To address this need, this project will develop a new type of hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (HRIS). The HRIS will be designed to sense the incident waves on the entire surface, deduce relevant information, such as the directions of users and transmitters, and reconfigure their reflection patterns accordingly. By developing the HRIS, this project paves the way for the implementation of a truly smart and autonomous propagation environment. This project also examines other opportunities that can be enabled by the HRIS to sense the environment with high spatial resolution, such as imaging objects for context-aware homes and buildings or threat detection. The research project is complemented by a comprehensive educational plan to engage graduate and undergraduate students in designing metasurfaces and HRIS, developing compressive sensing techniques, and devising intelligent electromagnetic environments. This project also includes several undergraduate-led efforts where they will learn to use the HRIS to track devices and provide them with focused beams for wireless power transfer (WPT). The resulting adaptive WPT demonstrations will be used in interactive workshops on topics of electromagnetic research and emerging trends in wireless communications and sensing, as well as at outreach events.<br/><br/>This research project will outline the design of HRIS and experimentally demonstrate their utility in typical wireless communications settings. It will thus make innovative contributions including 1) the design of a novel metasurface that allows for reconfigurable reflection and sensing of the incident wave, 2) the development and experimental validation of novel algorithms for compressive sensing of the propagation environment with high spatial resolution using only a few receiving units, 3) a smart adaptive communications link where the HRIS detects the transmitter and users and transform its reflection patterns accordingly, and 4) development and experimental validation of novel imaging configurations where the scattered wireless communications signals (signals of opportunities) are collected by the HRIS and processed to retrieve reflectivity maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result of the sun's energy, pollutants on the surface of the earth can be broken down. Even though the oil is invisible once it has been cleaned up, it can still have detrimental effects on aquatic health. Sunburned oil produces compounds that are water-soluble and can mobilize through the water. Several of these compounds contain heavy metals which are frequently found in petroleum mixtures. Research is necessary on heavy metal reactivity and fate, as well as heavy metal effects on aquatic life.  The energy in sunlight can break down petroleum, but very little is known about the resulting materials.  Project data will show how sunlight helps release the metals from the petroleum and how their transformations affect the natural biogeochemical cycle. The research will be complemented by education and outreach activities aimed at diverse students. Activities will introduce students to potential STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers, including in industry. This will be accomplished through a collaboration with a local nonprofit organization.<br/><br/>Under this award, petroporphyrins will be exposed to simulated sunlight.  Experiments will assess both physical and chemical changes that occur.  Metal concentrations will be determined using inductively coupled plasma triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).  Phototransformation pathways will be determined in the petroporphyrin and water layer using electron paramagnetic spectroscopy and chemical probe methods. Studies in the presence of humic and fulvic acids will be undertaken to evaluate the impacts of petroleum bound metals (PBMs) on colloidal stability, complexation and their role in biogeochemical cycling. Photoredox transformations of PBM-soil interactions will dictate their bioavailability in aquatic environments.

Plagued by a chronic scarcity of affordable and available homes, rapidly rising costs, the largest home construction labor shortage in over twenty years, and pre-Industrial Revolution production processes that prohibit innovation and efficiency, a drastically different paradigm is required to ensure we have the high-quality housing stock available to provide for the safety, security, and well-being of all US families. The NextHouse vision is a future where housing in the US is primarily built in factories and delivered as integrated and fully-engineered products enabling greater affordability, sustainability, resiliency, health outcomes, and equity. The NextHouse innovation ecosystem will be a central fixture in the Midwest tech corridor to produce disruptive technologies, spur new business, and drive economic growth. Based in a region with a glut of legacy cities and corresponding racial disparities, it will catalyze much-needed economic growth and improved employment opportunities through an expanded factory-built housing industry. Driven by coordinated Indiana and Michigan innovation and workforce development, a fully-automated, and scaled-up factory-built housing industry will deliver innovative and customer-responsive products that improve sustainability, quality of life, and housing equity with a more diverse and inclusive workforce.<br/><br/>The award will be used to launch and grow a NextHouse organization. The leadership team will start by developing procedures and programs for engaging and strengthening partnerships, including a process for soliciting and reviewing proposals for activities by partners that strengthen the ecosystem. A fee-paying NextHouse Industry Consortium will be established as a joint venture with the Purdue Center for High Performance Buildings to facilitate development of direct pathways (i.e., a technology pipeline) to partner companies for deployment of NextHouse technologies and processes. Concepts from R&D and workforce development partners will be funded that demonstrate technology pipeline benefits to strengthen industry relationships. NextHouse will also fund partner proposals to support assessments of opportunities for establishing new regional factory-built housing factories. During the award, partner workshops will be held to: i) identify and prioritize needs for R&D, translation to practice, workforce development, and DEIA; ii) engage regional stakeholders (e.g. housing authorities, economic development agencies, advanced manufacturing partnerships) to identify federal/state initiatives and plan pilot sites in Indiana and Michigan; and iii) grow industry and venture capital participation.

Battery-free implantable sensors have been growing rapidly in clinical uses because they have the advantage of near zero power consumption, potentially allowing for long-lifetime and maintenance-free operation. Several wireless biomedical implants have been developed for dynamic monitoring of physiological parameters in human bodies, enabling the management of chronic diseases (e.g. heart failure, eye disease, or brain injury) and improving patients' quality of life. Despite their potential benefits, implantable sensors face a significant challenge in accurately and reliably detecting physiological parameters using radio-frequency (RF) signals. This project will bring together commercial, research and education efforts across disciplines to develop a high-performance, energy-efficient, and reliable biotelemetric system. The purpose of the research is to enable real-time acquisition and wireless transmission of biological signals from wearable medical devices and bioimplants.<br/><br/>This project will develop a parity-time (PT)-symmetric biotelemetry system that provides new ways to use RF interrogation of an implantable microsensor using an ultracompact, portable reader, enabling real-time, continuous wireless monitoring of physiological signs with high accuracy, unprecedented resolution, and good reliability. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of wireless health technologies, and this growth is expected to continue far beyond the pandemic. This PFI project enables miniature and unobtrusive microsensors and bioimplants for future healthcare Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, which require low-cost, energy-efficient, and ubiquitous operation. The team will translate research on PT-symmetric biotelemetry inspired by non-Hermitian quantum physics into in-vitro/clinical wireless biosensing, and, ultimately, commercialization. Advanced wireless sensors and systems will impact multiple medical electronics and surgical equipment industries, including pulmonary artery monitoring in heart failure, intraocular pressure monitoring for glaucoma management, and intracranial pressure monitoring in the intensive care unit.

The NSF Engine team aims to create a robust, multi-faceted, place-based innovation ecosystem focused on food security while unlocking economic opportunity for regional populations and communities that have been historically left behind by other emerging technologies. If successful, the innovation ecosystem driven by the NSF Engine will result in unprecedented advances in Agricultural Technology (AgTech) by driving new technologies, industry collaborations, and emerging startup companies; creating good jobs across a variety of emerging technologies; and generating greater economic opportunity and shared prosperity to all residents of North Dakota.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine will initially focus on the following topic areas related to advancing agriculture and the transition to a real-time monitoring and analysis approach: (1) novel genomics studies; (2) advanced predictive climate modeling; (3) scalable on-farm data collection management and utilization including reconfigurable agile data sensor networks; (4) communication networks, edge and cloud computing, real-time analysis of acquired data via artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a focus on last acre connectivity; and (5) diffusion of AgTech innovation through human-centered approaches. The NSF Engine is assembling a cross-sector team to collaboratively address the needs of the agricultural community and industry as the NSF Engine develops and implements advanced AgTech technologies. This approach will help retain North Dakota?s next-generation farmers and technologists as well as attracting talent regionally and nationally.<br/><br/>The North Dakota Advanced Agriculture Technology Engine led by North Dakota State University, includes an ecosystem of partners with representation from the large agricultural companies, technology companies, farmers, universities (including Tribal Colleges and Universities, and two- and four-year institutions), regional and statewide economic and workforce development organizations (including Engine core partners Greater Fargo Moorhead Economic Development Corporation and the Fargo Moorhead West Fargo Chamber Foundation), Tribal organizations, and innovation testbeds. This diverse coalition of partners will be central to R&D, translation, and workforce development efforts.<br/><br/>The research and translation goals of the NSF Engine are to: (1) develop and leverage regional expertise to solve agricultural-related challenges aligned with the top identified topic areas; (2) launch and sustain an innovation corridor that meaningfully engages and prioritizes all in the state, including Indigenous and small-farm communities, to grow and develop early-stage technology projects; and (3) generate more substantial investments, technology development, intellectual property activity, startups, and commercial activities to accelerate AgTech. Test beds and programs from Engine core partner Grand Farm will connect innovative companies to the region?s innovation ecosystem. Collectively, these goals will enable this state to become a global leader in advanced agricultural technology innovations and in accelerating regional economic growth.<br/>The NSF Engine has the potential to better connect existing efforts and dramatically expand the pathways into emerging careers within AgTech. Partners will include state and local government officials, economic and workforce development organizations, industries, career and technical education programs, Tribal Colleges, and other universities to build training and mentorship opportunities across the state. Specific activities include train-the-trainer programs aimed at creating a new generation of STEM educators; supporting K-12 educators to link digital agricultural topics to foundational STEM classes; and programs that meet trainees where they are with equitable agriculture sector training opportunities. Workforce development activities will prioritize equitable agricultural opportunities across the region of service, including rural and tribal communities, and address industry?s current and emerging needs. Establishing a knowledge network to share and quickly disseminate learning is also a primary goal of the workforce development strategy.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has brought together a strong coalition of partners and has identified close alignment with regional assets and priorities to address food security, an issue of national importance. The inclusive, community driven approach with strong backing from cross-sector stakeholders represents a unique opportunity to build a new model for advanced AgTech development. The NSF Engine has identified critical R&D topic areas that must be advanced to drive agricultural innovations that are accessible throughout the state and across technology topic areas, namely public crops. It will support R&D and translational activities to cultivate an innovation ecosystem of tech companies that will support the nation?s transition to a more climate-resilient advanced agriculture sector, and will drive regional economic growth and opportunity. The NSF Engine?s transformative potential lies in the intentional focus on bringing tribal, rural and farming communities meaningfully into the co-creation to yield a blueprint for the future of advanced agriculture and inclusive economic development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Still, it remains difficult for people to truly grasp how actions in the present can create negative consequences for those in the distant future. Thus, motivating people to be less selfish in the present and more generous toward the future is a fundamental step in safeguarding the well-being of future generations. Exploring motivations for this kind of intergenerational selflessness via the present project has multi-faceted scientific significance, from contributing to the scientific understanding of legacy-focused thinking and its link to environmental sustainability to demonstrating the advantages of using cutting edge computational methods in social science research. Furthermore, this project informs how a deeply rooted psychological motivation?the motivation to establish a posthumous legacy?can be leveraged to promote environmental health and ensure a healthy and sustainable world that generations can enjoy for many years to come. <br/><br/>Although prior studies have demonstrated that reflecting on one?s posthumous legacy promotes concerns and behaviors related to environmental sustainability, the details of these reflections and effects remain unclear and underexplored. Across two online survey studies, the research team uses a mix of cutting-edge computational and traditional statistical techniques to illuminate what people are thinking when they report their desired posthumous legacy (Research Question 1), how these themes may differ between demographic groups (Research Question 2), and which themes are positively associated with environmental sustainability concerns and behaviors (Research Question 3). Showing how advancements in computational techniques can aid social scientific research via efficiency and scalability may inspire future researchers to adopt similar approaches. Additionally, insights gained through the project aid future researchers and public health organizations when developing/testing messages that can effectively motivate sustainability concerns and behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The robotics activities will include elements of socio-emotional learning that includes learning about responsible decision-making, self-awareness, social awareness, and collaborating with other people. The curriculum will inspire these students to re-enter their education with an interest in pursuing STEM as a future career. Overall, the project will inform other efforts to design both robotics learning experiences and opportunities for pre-service teachers to develop their teaching practice.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to 1) develop a semester-long robotics program built on the principles of socio-emotional learning and deliver this program to middle school students in the juvenile justice system; 2) train undergraduate pre-service teachers to mentor middle school students in the juvenile justice system using socio-emotional learning in the instruction of robotics. The research will examine the relationship of participating in this socio-emotional learning robotics middle school program with the STEM-identity of participating students and compare the STEM-identity of participating students among three middle school populations, two of which are part of the juvenile justice system. The research questions about the semester-long program for integrating robotics and socio-emotional learning are as follows. How does the STEM-Identity of students involved in the juvenile justice system change? How do the career and educational interests of students who are involved in the juvenile justice system? How do the perceptions of students involved in the juvenile justice system with respect to the need for an education compare to a broader population of students following participation in this program? Is participation in the proposed program related to reduced rates of JJAEP students returning to the juvenile justice system as confined youth? Data gathered include surveys of students?

Over its five-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 51 unique full-time students, who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in engineering or computer science. First-year students and transfer students will receive four years of scholarship support. The project will leverage available programs in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and incorporate activities, which include cohort building and nurturing throughout the undergraduate education, a three-pronged mentoring program with faculty, peers, and industry partners, a professional practicum through a guaranteed paid internship program, senior preparation course, and a design project. The direct impact of the project will be on the participating scholars and future engineers. In addition, the project has the potential to impact departmental programs and policies. UIC is in a unique position in that implementation and development of a sustainable project will model how these practices may be adopted at other institutions that are research intensive, have a significant portion of transfer students, or are minority serving institutions. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. To achieve this goal, the team will focus on several project objectives. The first is to increase the one-year retention rate. The second objective is to increase the six-year graduation rate. The third is to increase the percentage of graduates with a major-related job offer/graduate study admission within six months of graduation. Multiple research methods will be used to advance the understanding of how high-achieving engineering students from low-income backgrounds develop their engineering identity during their time at UIC, and what are the prevalent aspects of a transfer student?s time at UIC that impact engineering identity development. In addition to providing higher financial support to Pell-eligible students, the institutionalized components of the project will have ripple effects that can impact the success of all UIC engineering students. The project consists of a diverse group of faculty members with synergistic expertise in the various engineering and computer science disciplines, education, and interdisciplinary social sciences.

Water scarcity is the defining challenge in the southwestern US, and globally, drylands cover 41% of the land surface, supporting 38% of the human population. Water is life, and the proposed region (encompassing the Navajo Nation, New Mexico, and far west Texas) has the highest household water insecurity in the nation. Approximately one-third of all Navajo families and dozens of communities near the Mexico border lack piped water or adequate sanitation. Regionally, ~78% of people rely on groundwater for drinking water, but large supplies of water are unusable without treatment, including saline water and water contaminated by industry, agriculture, and military facilities. Gaining access to clean water requires energy for hauling, piping, pumping, and cleaning it.  Innovation closing the large gap between the regional potential for clean energy and the realized capacity to meet regional needs for clean water will also address economic and climate needs by developing a broad and highly skilled workforce while transitioning to the region to clean energy. The project team will co-create solutions with underserved communities and incorporate indigenous knowledge with a holistic approach that will lead the invention and commercialization of technologies that maximize resilience and bring clean water to every tap, decarbonized power to every door, and a diverse, inclusive, and vibrant economy to the region.<br/><br/>The proposed innovation ecosystem represents a partnership of 2- and 4-year higher education institutions, national laboratories, community groups, government organizations, and both for-profit and non-profit companies in a region of exceptional cultural diversity with 48% identifying as Hispanic and 10% as Native American across 23 tribes. Communities in the region experience high economic distress, exceeding the national average of 13% living in poverty, with New Mexico (NM) and El Paso County at ~19%, and Navajo Nation at a staggering 33%. To help lift communities out of poverty and launch development of essential infrastructure, project activities are designed around holistic community-engaged projects that emphasize regional strategic economic development imperatives: alignment with stakeholders in a collective, representative ecosystem, expanded capacity for techno-economic development initiatives in rural and tribal communities, preparation of a skilled workforce to enable renewable energy transitions and solutions to water scarcity, and new bridges between industry and technological experts. Community engagement efforts will include Tribal led ?learning tours? to help ecosystem members integrate Native perspectives and knowledge into all clean water and clean energy projects. Use-inspired research efforts will develop plans for a network of integrated water/energy resilience testbeds for four topics: clean water, clean energy, integrated water/energy resilience, and maps & models of unconventional water resources. Workforce development efforts will strengthen the coalition of community colleges through shared comprehensive training programs, and entrepreneurship will be expanded by building upon programs that are tailored to meet the unique cultural needs of different communities, ensuring inclusivity and relevance.

Data from these environments holds immense scientific (biodiversity and geological processes), societal (archaeological and cultural remains), environmental (natural resources and mineral deposits), and health-security-economical (asset management and monitoring) significance. However, human operation in crawlspaces is costly, slow, and risky. Existing snake and insect robots can crawl in pipes and operate within centimeter-scale spaces; however, they are too slow or not completely autonomous. There is a pressing need for fast, agile, and efficient autonomous systems specifically designed for crawlspaces. Legged locomotion and multi-rotor flight show promise in addressing this challenge, having already revolutionized numerous remote sensing tasks by surpassing the capabilities of any other robot category. However, their operation remains limited to spacious tunnels. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project supports research that seeks to harness the exceptional agility, efficiency, and speed of legged and rotary-wing robots and adapt it specifically for use in crawlspaces. The project designs a multi-modal robot with extensive locomotion plasticity capable of efficiently traversing extremely tight crawlspaces with agility through bipedal walking and flying. Furthermore, this project aims to promote gender equity in Northeastern University?s robotics program, a significant area of growth identified by school leadership.<br/><br/>Achieving efficient, agile, and fast legged-aerial locomotion in crawlspaces represents a new advancement in robot locomotion. Three knowledge gaps still exist in bridging legged locomotion and multi-rotor flight in crawlspaces: (1) Actuation challenges hinder the scalability of motion control performance, necessary for fast and precise foot placement, when transitioning from legged robots designed for open spaces to smaller robots operating in crawlspaces; (2) Instability issues arising from multi-rotors? air jets near surfaces pose flight immobilization risks; (3) Crawlspaces need several modes of locomotion and there is no systematic robot design framework to accommodate the requirements dictated by these modes. This project will engage in fundamental research to address these gaps, designing a bioinspired locomotion robot capable of walking, hovering, jumping, and running over inclined surfaces to push the operational envelope of mobile robots, making autonomous operations inside extremely tight crawlspaces possible. The project?s efforts revolve around robot and control design. This project?s key areas of innovation include (1) Introducing actuation design paradigms for small robots based on computational structure design for achieving comparable motion control performance seen in large robots; (2) Research and validation of new locomotion feats and underlying models and nonlinear controllers based on the integration of posture manipulation and thrust vectoring to overcome air jet risks in aerial robotics; (3) Co-designing robots and controls through generative design methods to accommodate conflicting requirements imposed by many locomotion modes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These structures exhibit extreme properties such as low-mass and weight, high-resilience, high-strength, and rich-tunability. These properties can be harnessed for use in engineering applications and potentially exceed the performance of currently established solutions. In addition, tensegrity structures have been used in an increasing number of engineering applications, including deployable domes, tunable antennas, and sustainable adaptive solar arrays to name a few. From a geometrical perspective, tensegrities have been shown to be scalable: applications ranging from large space structures to the micro and nano scales have proven their cross-scale applicability. Although many have viewed the prestress requirement as a hindrance to further development of tensegrity structures, this project explores this burgeoning trend by continuing to examine the premise that prestress requirements enable tensegrities to be deployable, tunable, and morphable. This research project will contribute theoretical, computational and experimental capabilities to advance the field of tensegrity structures and metamaterials, and to discover novel modes of tensegrity functionality.

Specifically, this project should lead to the creation and analysis of elegant Class-1 (?floating struts?) reprogrammable tensegrity metamaterials, and large-scale tensegrity structures which may be used in the design of temporary shelters or structural component protection, among others. As such, it will advance the knowledge base in structures, theoretical and computational mechanics, manufacturing, and materials engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Addressing a critical gap in current TBD diagnostic methods, this project will develop a comprehensive platform for Lyme disease, Babesia, Anaplasma, and relapsing fever. By encompassing different TBDs co-located in similar geographical areas, the platform provides a single test solution to determine exposure to multiple TBDs, thus capturing a significant segment of the available market. The simplicity and affordability of the tool make it beneficial for resource-limited and rural areas, most impacted by TBDs. Furthermore, the platform is expected to have significant societal and healthcare benefits, allowing patients and physicians to conduct timely testing to measure immune response against multiple TBDs, which is critical in determining patient care and treatment regimens. The commercial potential of this project lies in filling a substantial market need for comprehensive and cost-effective TBD diagnostics, promising widespread adoption in various healthcare settings, including clinics and field-stations. By enhancing scientific understanding and technology in the medical diagnostics field, this project aligns with the broader goal of improving global health.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of a POC, multiplexed, serological assay capable of detecting multiple TBDs simultaneously. The technology addresses the challenge of cross-reactivity, co-infection of different TBDs in endemic regions and limited sensitivity and specificity in current serological tests. By integrating specific antigen epitopes for various TBDs into a single multiplexed assay and employing advanced machine learning algorithms, this solution aims to significantly enhance serodiagnostic accuracy. The research involves iterative epitope selection and optimization of the paper-based immunoreaction platform comprising the multiplexed panel. The technology also involves developing a robust, machine learning-based diagnostic algorithm to analyze different biomarker-specific signals into interpretable and actionable diagnoses that can be used by physicians to treat patients. This project addresses the current lack of a point-of-care (POC) multiplexed test for TBDs, where patients typically require multiple tests at different centralized labs. The project's anticipated outcomes include improved serodiagnostic capabilities for various TBDs, contributing significantly to the fields of medical diagnostics and public health, particularly in areas with a high prevalence of tick-borne infections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As they navigate international borders and higher education, bilingualism is a critical aspect of their everyday life. These border-crossing students are not a homogenous group; they come from a range of backgrounds and have varying perspectives. They may have different answers to questions such as, ""Which location do you prefer?"" or ""Do you feel connected to your campus?"" In turn, this diversity can map on to differences in language use across languages. Sociolinguistic research has studied how speakers use linguistic variation to construct styles that reflect socially meaningful categories within a local community. People can vary how they speak to emphasize a quality about themselves or an aspect of their identity. For example, they may use certain linguistic features to sound more ""feminine,"" or ""cool,"" or from a certain region. Since much of this work has focused on monolingual communities, an ongoing research question is how bilingual speakers draw on resources from multiple languages to construct styles that represent different social identities. Thus, the present study analyzes the varied bilingual styles that emerge among college students. By documenting the experiences of bilingual transborder students, this work not only advances research in sociolinguistics and bilingualism but also represents a valuable contribution to fields in related areas, such as education and border studies. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation aims to study how college border commuters vary in their linguistic practices and how higher education and regional identity shape their language use. To address these questions, this dissertation employs sociolinguistic interviews and ethnographic fieldwork at multiple postsecondary institutions representing different types of college experiences.

These events commonly develop in vegetated slopes and manifest as shallow failures; however, despite the demonstrated stability functions of vegetated systems on slopes, the mechanical and hydraulic effects of different root systems on the failure process and landslide consequences have never been investigated. The overarching research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to advance the understanding of RTL to better predict their potential damage, considering vegetation effects and changes in rainfall patterns due to climate change. This will be achieved by improving predictive tools that inform geotechnical engineers and stakeholders to make responsible decisions about landslide risk. This effort will also provide new guidelines to improve the efficiency of bioengineering solutions for landslide prevention and community preparedness. An outreach plan will disseminate the technical information to maximize its impact on society and advance and transform the way slope stability and consequence analyses are currently approached. An integrated multi-generational education plan will also serve local communities, including low-income rural minorities, by increasing public scientific literacy, promoting STEM, and raising awareness about landslide hazards and climate change through guided activities and expositions in regional museums. Future geotechnical engineers will also be educated on use of state-of-the-art numerical and machine learning tools capable of solving future challenges, on climate change awareness, and on effective communication.<br/> <br/>The specific research objectives of this research project include: (i) developing a physically-based numerical strategy for the hydromechanical analysis of RTL capable of unifying failure with post-failure kinematics while efficiently incorporating the effects of vegetation and advanced soil constitutive models; (ii) providing a new physical understanding of how different root systems in combination with initial soil characteristics influence the overall instability process of RTL; (iii) assessing the probability of failure and exceedance probability of the runout distance of RTL taking into account uncertainties from precipitation, vegetation characteristics, and soil parameters vital for quantitative risk assessments by means of an efficient mechanistic-based machine learning surrogate model. The new developments will be assessed by systematic validation against available laboratory data and benchmarks. The resulting knowledge will be transformative not only in the field of RTL, but it can be further applied to other extremely relevant related hazards such as wildfire consequences on slopes, tailings dam failures, and internal erosion and scour of levees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This family of compounds, based on natural products derived from grapefruit and Alaskan yellow cedar bark, is already proven to be both safer and more effective than existing commercial repellents. This family of compounds is currently produced by fermentation processes and is used as flavor/fragrance components, but it is still too expensive for consumer insect repellents. The proposal presents an existing eight-step chemical synthesis for the parent compound of the family (nootkatone), along with a plan to greatly streamline, optimize and reduce the costs associated with this synthesis. The successful completion of this project will lead to the reduction of the production costs close to the price range of other commercial insect repellents. Furthermore, this process will disrupt the flavor/fragrance market for this compound family, possibly leading to wider adoption.

This system would be replaced, using heterogeneous catalytic technology developed over the last 40 years, with a far cheaper catalyst that would also be easier to separate from the reaction products. This single action could in turn be applied to reduce manufacturing costs in other syntheses (e.g., pharma intermediates). In many other ways, other overly complex or expensive steps in this synthesis will be optimized to reduce reagent and solvent costs, in some cases by the use of a commercial ozonizer and chiller, by solvent substitutions, by better oxidant (ozone) control in the selective oxidation reactions, and by the reduction in solvent loadings in certain process separation steps, which will be made possible by the use of a modern automated flash chromatographic separation unit. All these modifications to the synthesis have been designed to streamline and optimize the synthesis of the compound, and to generate purer nootkatone products.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Vision and Change (V&C) report (AAAS, 2011) identified five core concepts in biology and called on undergraduate biology instructors to use these concepts to connect their teaching and their students? learning across biological scales and subdisciplines. The report highlighted the need to prepare undergraduate biology students to contribute to emerging interdisciplinary fields that address complex problems by building their ability to make connections across seemingly disparate pieces of information, concepts, and questions. However, currently available instructional tools primarily focus on teaching core concepts in sub-disciplinary contexts. The CCTTs developed as part of this project will address the need for instructional tools that teach students to transfer core concept knowledge across scales and subdisciplines.<br/><br/>The project will bring biology educators with expertise across scales and sub-disciplines together to participate in faculty learning communities to develop, test, and publish a collection of CCTTs in CourseSource.

When neurons and neuronal circuits are perturbed by trauma, growth, or disease, the activity of neurons and the release of so-called neuromodulators is affected.  However, after a delay following the perturbation, activity often is restored thanks to mechanisms triggered by changes in neural activity and/or effects of the neuromodulators.  These mechanisms are not well understood, especially not the role and mechanisms of the neuromodulators. In this project, the role that neuromodulators play in determining the constellations of proteins expressed by individual neurons will be studied, with an emphasis on proteins that constitute channels in the cell membrane of neurons and that affect neural activity.  The objective is to identify the mechanisms activated after severe perturbation of the neural network that lead to the recovery of the neurons? normal activity. For this purpose, a small neural network from crabs is used because this networks? neuronal components are few, very well known, and relatively accessible experimentally. Students of all levels (from high school to doctoral student) and diverse backgrounds will participate in a collaborative and highly interactive lab environment. <br/><br/>Neuromodulation through metabotropic receptor action is commonly thought to rapidly and transiently modify and expand the output repertoire of neurons and neuronal networks by regulating ionic currents, synapses, and transporters. In this project, the hypothesis is examined that, over long time scales (? hours), the opposite may happen: neuromodulators constrain neurons and networks into restricted regions in the parameter space that determines their activity, and this effect may hinder the neurons? plasticity and ability to recover from perturbations. By reducing the region of parameter space that neurons and networks can inhabit, neuromodulators are thought to sculpt patterns of activity required by the system to serve specific functions, analogous to what happens during development. However, this hypothesized sculpting role of neuromodulators may also limit the possible neural activity patterns needed to respond adaptively to insults, damage, or other persistent perturbations. Understanding the various mechanisms that a network can use to maintain its functional activity, or restore it after it has been perturbed, will broaden our understanding of how networks can be resilient. Here the simple, accessible and well-characterized pyloric network of the crab is used to reach a mechanistic understanding of the role of neuromodulators in defining the neuronal elements (neurons, ionic currents) that specify adult patterns of activity, and control their functional plasticity over large time scales. By using an already well-defined system and computational approaches, a relatively simple path to understanding the role of neuromodulators will be taken, which can then be applied and tested in more complex systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology is expected to have a direct impact on workforce development, and deployment of the solution will drive economics in consumer electronics.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to achieve photon-limited image denoising using a lightweight algorithm that has the potential to be implemented on a camera chip. Accomplishing this goal requires several technological breakthroughs, collectively leading to a new image signal processor (ISP) known as a Small and Learnable ISP Module (SLIM). The key to SLIM is to identify the bottlenecks of physics-based ISPs and replace them with customized learning-based modules. Specifically, SLIM consists of five innovations: (i) learning-based frequency demodulation, (ii) guided denoising, (iii) learned feature extraction, (iv) learned indexing, and (v) learned filtering. In Phase 1, the team proposes to optimize SLIM and implement it on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). This includes shrinking the size of the filters and streamlining the indexing scheme to further speed up SLIM, introducing new encoders to improve generalization, and optimizing the memory, communication, and processing through improved programming and real-data evaluation and demonstration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The threats to the physical security of computer chips and countermeasures have been widely researched. However, adversaries with physical access to the system can still bypass conventional defenses and threaten the systems? security. Examples include tampering with the printed circuit board of a computer chip or removing its package to read out secret keys stored on it. Such attacks, originating at various stages of the microelectronics supply chain, cannot be addressed solely by conventional software security protections due to the lack of awareness about the events occurring at the hardware level.<br/><br/>This project investigates technologies that can secure electronic computing hardware against sophisticated physical attacks originating at various stages of the microelectronics supply chain. Central to this project is a better understanding of the computing machine's physical layer, i.e., its power delivery network (PDN) and its role in achieving secure and trusted hardware. There are three research thrusts to investigate: (1) Fusing the existing statistical metrics used for the analysis of PDN-based signatures, enabling non-invasive, holistic, golden-free, and root cause-aware tamper detection; (2) Using information-theoretic notions to investigate the strength of PDN-based side-channel attacks (i.e., impedance analysis) and developing countermeasures; (3) Creating the PDN-based sensors and fingerprints to monitor the physical integrity system. Successful outcomes of this project will significantly improve the security of computing hardware. Moreover, this project includes various outreach activities, such as organizing special sessions and tutorials, open-sourcing benchmarks, and exposing high school students to basic circuit concepts and simple electrical diagnosis tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Building operations account for a large portion of infrastructure energy footprint.  Adaptive building components, such as origami-inspired adaptive facades, are a potential pathway to reduce this cost, by enabling building exteriors to be reconfigured based on light or thermal conditions.  Yet, a major challenge holding these concepts back is their inability to be systematically designed.  Moreover, there is a critical need to provide early and interactive design feedback to better facilitate more useful, nuanced, and ecologically responsive ideas.  This research will create tools that promote creativity, knowledge sharing, and collective workflows that lead to effective technology in all regards, from aesthetics to function.  The work will simultaneously create a new educational track for architecture and engineering students to learn about and test their ideas for adaptive building concepts.  This educational effort is fully integrated into the research by providing a testbed and the critical dataset to inform the computational tools.  Thus, this work will create new design processes for origami-inspired structures and seed the upcoming generations of designers with the skills and penchant to explore adaptive structure concepts.  <br/><br/>The overall goal of this work is to establish a new strategy to integrate architectural design processes and human-derived designs with physics-guided machine learning and computational design optimization, and to evaluate this strategy on the application of origami-inspired responsive architecture.

These novel materials, termed dual-atom alloys, consist of an energetically stable pair of different metal atoms embedded in the surface of a host metal. Compared to single-atom alloys, a similar class of materials with well-defined active sites, dual-atom alloy active sites are anticipated to be more reactive and enable more challenging reactions including targeted bond scission.  However, accelerating the discovery of novel alloys requires addressing numerous challenges including identifying promising combinations of metals from the large materials space of potential pairings, understanding their structure/function relationships, and creating an effective feedback loop between experiment and computation. Dr. Montemore and his students will use machine learning combined with density functional theory (DFT) to identify candidate structures based on surface stability and low energy barriers for specific chemical reactions. Dr. Sykes and his students will experimentally synthesize, characterize, and test the predicted structures. Their discoveries could lead to the development of an entirely new class of catalysts where well-defined metal atomic structures can be combined with predictive models to accelerate a range of multistep reaction mechanisms. In addition to these broad scientific impacts, this project will also support a virtual reality K-12 outreach workshop, provide mentorship for Hispanic scientists and engineers, and inspire students from underserved high schools by facilitating a Reverse Science Fair.<br/><br/>Dual-atom alloys leverage several of the advantages of single-atom alloys: a well-defined active site that allows clear correspondence across computation, surface science, and reactor studies; opportunities to deviate from linear correlations in reaction energetics; and unique electronic structure. Just as with single-atom alloys, in which surface science experiments and computation preceded catalyst synthesis and testing, Montemore and Sykes will couple theory and surface science experiments to explore dual-atom alloy structure-reactivity space. This research is expected to lead to the development of structure-function relationships on a broad set of well-defined active sites, which would then serve as a guide to the larger heterogenous catalysis community. Furthermore, these studies have the potential to uncover new classes of materials with high catalytic performance, a particular need for reactions that are challenging with traditional heterogeneous catalysts, such as selective cross-couplings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop, test, and publish a collection of Core Concept Teaching Tools (CCTTs) that teach students how to transfer their knowledge of biology core concepts across scales and sub-disciplines to understand novel and complex biological phenomena. The Vision and Change (V&C) report (AAAS, 2011) identified five core concepts in biology and called on undergraduate biology instructors to use these concepts to connect their teaching and their students? learning across biological scales and subdisciplines. The report highlighted the need to prepare undergraduate biology students to contribute to emerging interdisciplinary fields that address complex problems by building their ability to make connections across seemingly disparate pieces of information, concepts, and questions. However, currently available instructional tools primarily focus on teaching core concepts in sub-disciplinary contexts. The CCTTs developed as part of this project will address the need for instructional tools that teach students to transfer core concept knowledge across scales and subdisciplines.<br/><br/>The project will bring biology educators with expertise across scales and sub-disciplines together to participate in faculty learning communities to develop, test, and publish a collection of CCTTs in CourseSource. Each CCTT will begin with a brief narrative describing a complex biological phenomenon. The activities and questions following the narrative will be constructed using Branchaw and Cary?s Conceptual Elements Framework (2017) to guide students through the process of recognizing the core concept elements in the narrative, recalling what they have already learned about those core concept elements, and applying their prior knowledge to understand the novel phenomenon described in the narrative. Approximately 45 CCTTs will be developed, and pilot tested at diverse institutions across the nation, before they are published in CourseSource. Instructors will be able to search the CourseSource database for CCTTs by subdisciplines, core concepts, and conceptual elements, and download them for free.

An important quality control step in the flow of genetic information is to eliminate faulty and/or foreign messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules so that proteins that may be harmful to the cell are not produced. One of the ways that cells can identify faulty RNAs is by sensing the length of the sequence within an RNA that encodes for a protein versus not. While this mechanism works well in simple organisms such as yeast, the human genome has evolved to have naturally long regions of mRNAs that do not encode for a protein but serve regulatory purposes. How then does the cell know to not degrade such normal transcripts and yet identify potentially toxic RNAs that arise from mutated genes or viral genomes? This project will leverage evolutionary analysis, molecular biology, and genomics tools to identify and understand signals that could allow physiological RNAs that resemble aberrant RNAs to escape quality control. The project will also promote broader societal impacts by engaging 8th- and 9th-grade students in Aurora Science and Tech, a local school that primarily serves underprivileged and low-income populations in Aurora, CO, in hands-on research to facilitate their training and exposure to scientific research. <br/><br/>Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is a quality control process that degrades transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTC) to prevent the production of toxic truncated proteins. NMD senses aberrant transcripts either via the presence of exon junction complexes (EJCs) downstream of the terminating ribosome or via the long 3? untranslated region (UTR) generated by premature termination. Many non-aberrant endogenous transcripts and certain viral transcripts also mimic PTC-containing transcripts by virtue of possessing long 3? UTRs and are also targeted by NMD. However, through the course of evolution, several transcripts with long UTRs, both viral and endogenous, have evolved mechanisms to bypass NMD by antagonizing the central NMD factor, UPF1. In this project, natural NMD evasion mechanisms will be investigated for novel insights into this fundamental quality control mechanism. The goals are to identify mechanisms of endogenous and viral bypass of long UTR NMD (Aim 1), determine the role of a mammal-specific UPF1 isoform in the arms race between NMD and its targets through experimental evolution in human and drosophila cells (Aim 2), and engage 8th-9th grade students from a local high-needs school in investigating the cross-regulation of different UPF1 paralogs and viral antagonists in yeast (Aim 3).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this surge in size brings forth a myriad of vulnerabilities that threaten everyone's digital security. Statistics reveal that software exceeding one million lines of code harbors an average of 0.66 defects per 1,000 lines, with 36% classified as vulnerabilities. This project addresses this critical issue by exploring security testing tailored explicitly for discovering vulnerabilities in large software. It focuses on scaling fuzzing---a predominant testing strategy embraced by software vendors and open-source communities---to maintain high effectiveness and efficiency for large software. The research outcomes advance the scientific study of security testing under new challenges posed by large software's unique properties. The anticipated results also improve the security of various types of large software that play a crucial role in daily lives, such as Chromium, Firefox, Thunderbird, MySQL, LibreOffice, PDFium, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. The outcomes of the research will lead to technology transfer to industry. The research will be integrated into education and training through new curriculum and outreach to Utah's Youth Education program as well as capture the flag (CTF) competitions.<br/><br/>Technically, this project introduces three key innovations to enable scalable fuzzing for large software. First, it employs object-oriented decomposition to address the extreme complexity of large software, breaking it down into self-contained code units based on the data objects it manipulates. This approach allows for testing individual code units, overcoming the challenges associated with fuzzing entire software systems and enabling deeper code coverage. Second, the project integrates fuzzing-centric optimizations into compilers and operating systems to enhance testing speed. These optimizations minimize fuzzing-irrelevant operations and dynamically adapt to the progress of fuzzing, unlocking hidden speed potential. Third, the project develops history-informed crash analysis to expedite the fuzzing-to-patching cycle by filtering and triaging crashes encountered during testing. Leveraging historical data produced by fuzzing, this analysis comprehensively understands and processes crashes, offering the fidelity and efficiency necessary for addressing large software systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can drive power outages and damage power components while also affecting pipelines and train systems. Developing the ability to predict GICs is important to protecting infrastructure and limiting the impact of geomagnetic storms on public safety and the economy. This project addresses GIC prediction by seeking to understand the connection between localized temporal changes in magnetic field measurements (dB/dt) and the magnetospheric and ionospheric phenomena causing them. This work will support the training of two graduate students that will be prepared to enter the STEM workforce with knowledge of space science, space weather, and machine learning and support the career of a woman PI leading the project. This project is jointly funded by the Magnetospheric Physics program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Aeronomy program.<br/><br/>Several studies have shown that peaks in dB/dt can be very localized, on the scales of hundreds of km. Thus, forecasting is needed at a localized level to provide power companies with actionable warnings. The current physics-based models used by the Space Weather Prediction Center lack the resolution needed to include physical phenomena at the spatial scales of the dB/dt peaks. Higher resolution models are being used for scientific studies, but are computationally expensive and take longer to run, making them more challenging to use for timely forecasting. An advantage of machine learning (ML) models is that once trained, the runtime to make predictions is significantly lower than physics based direct modeling. ML networks? ability to model nonlinear relationships in datasets can allow us to better understand the phenomena that result in localized dB/dt through the use of model explainability techniques. The following science questions will be addressed: (1) What are the spatial characteristics of localized magnetic perturbations? (2) What magnetosphere and ionosphere phenomena correlate with localized magnetic perturbations and why? The first question will be tackled using two methods that take advantage of the NSF-funded SuperMAG database: by characterizing the Region to Specific Difference (a parameter that compares the value at one location to the average values within a defined region) and by interpolation with spherical elementary current systems, and then comparing the results. The second question will utilize explainable machine learning techniques to explore magnetosphere and ionosphere phenomena that correlate with the spatially localized perturbations, incorporating datasets from satellites (e.g., DMSP, AMPERE, TWINS, and THEMIS). The results of this work will improve our understanding of geomagnetically active intervals, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, and the causes of localized perturbations in the ground magnetic field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven remarkably successful at describing the interactions of the known fundamental particles for the past 50 years.  However, the SM is known to be incomplete, and there are compelling reasons to expect that the SM will eventually fail to describe some observed properties of matter.  To address the question of whether there is new physics beyond the Standard Model, a precision measurement of the weak charge of the electron will be performed in a collaborative experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia.  The electron?s weak charge is the weak force analog of the common electric charge of the electron, and it is precisely predicted in the SM.  Any deviation of the measurement from this prediction would be evidence for undiscovered phenomena that represent new physics beyond our current understanding.  The experiment is named MOLLER and it comprises a range of hardware design and construction activities as well as software development which will provide excellent training for students and young scientists. The experience of working in a collaborative modern science enterprise with state of the art technology provides a strong basis for a variety of careers.<br/><br/>The funds provided by this project will support construction of essential apparatus for the MOLLER experiment (Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction) at Jefferson Lab. MOLLER will measure the electron?s neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders, providing excellent sensitivity to physics scenarios that extend beyond the Standard Model.  The MOLLER experiment consists of three major subsystems: 1) the beam/target/spectrometer to prepare the scattered Mller electrons to be observed, 2) apparatus to measure the raw parity-violating asymmetry to the needed statistical precision, and 3) apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control to achieve sub-ppb and sub-% level systematic uncertainty and normalization control goals.  The collaborative project described in this proposal will develop subsystem #3; namely the design, construction, and testing of the MOLLER Normalization and Systematic Control apparatus.  The work will be done over the period December 2020 ? November 2024. This includes the tracking system, background detectors, auxiliary asymmetry measurement detectors, and certain aspects of beam monitoring/control and beam polarimetry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The lake's influence on weather is evident in rainfall totals, as considerably more rain falls over the lake than the catchment around it, and in the diurnal cycle of rainfall, as the lake creates a land-sea breeze effect which causes rain to fall during the day over the land and at night over the lake.  Given the lake's outsized influence on weather it is natural to ask what role it will play in climate change over the Lake Victoria Basin.  The question of Victoria's role in climate change is challenging for several reasons, among them the lack of observations over the region and the difficulty of making simulations which capture the range of scales and processes that matter for the region's weather and climate. Regarding the spatial scales the range extends from the size of the mesoscale thunderstorm complexes the deliver much of the rain to the regional-scale circulation patterns that control the seasonality of rainfall.  The region could also be influenced by changes in surface temperature over the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.<br/><br/>Research conducted here takes up the challenge of Victoria Basin climate change using a nested modeling strategy in which a regional model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, is run with three nested grids to capture the relevant scale range.  The outer grid covers all of Africa and much of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a 27km grid spacing while the innermost grid covers the Lake Victoria Basin at 3km, sufficient resolution to capture thunderstorm complexes.  WRF is coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), which includes a representation of Lake Victoria and its interactions with the overlying atmosphere.<br/><br/>The work involves simulations of past, present, and projected future climate over the basin.  Past climate simulations focus on a period 17 thousand years ago when the lake dried out completely, and the PIs hypothesize that the dessication of the lake was the result of changes in incoming solar radiation due to Earth's orbital cycle (which also caused the ice ages).  The project also considers the more general question of how regional climate depends on the size of Lake Victoria, which can be varied in the model simulations.  Changes in lake size could drive precipitation changes that cause further lake size change, as the lake receives perhaps 80% of its water input from local rainfall (rivers flowing into the lake provide the other 20%).<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest given that about 40 million people live in the Lake Victoria Basin and are dependent on its water resources.  Rainfall is a hazard as well as a resource given that much of the rain falls in severe storms, a particular hazard for the fishing fleet.  The PIs conduct public outreach regarding climate change in the region through a traveling museum exhibit to be presented at the Mayborn Museum at Baylor University and at the National Museum of Kenya.  In addition, the project provides support and training to two graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin and one at Baylor University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins are the workhorses of the cell. Encoded by our genes, these tiny molecules perform many key biological functions that range from converting one chemical to another to letting cells talk to each other. Historically, it was assumed that a protein needed to fold into a specific three-dimensional shape to work properly.  However, over the last decade, it has become clear that certain protein regions play important roles without adopting a defined three-dimensional shape. These intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are found in around 70% of human proteins, yet because they don?t adopt a specific three-dimensional shape, they have been hard to study. One area that has been particularly challenging is understanding how disordered protein regions evolve. This is important because evolutionary information is critical for understanding how mutations impact protein function, for designing new bio-inspired materials, and for elucidating the fundamental principles of how cells work. This project will develop new computational methods to understand the types of features associated with evolutionary information in disordered proteins, as well as deploy a new way of doing accelerated artificial evolution in the lab to study how disordered regions change because of evolutionary pressure. In parallel, this project will also educate the next generation of scientists with a mixture of computational biology, machine learning, and computer science, enabling students to develop new methods to study IDRs. <br/><br/>This project involves the development of new computational methods to identify signatures of conservation that go beyond conventional alignment-based metrics. These tools will use IDR amino acid sequence information and use it to identify signatures of evolutionary conservation in the context of molecular interactions and environmental responsiveness, taking advantage of a previously developed approach for directed evolution (OrthoRep) to evolve disordered regions under different types of selective pressure. The aim is to study how IDR sequences change under different types of evolutionary pressure if evolutionary ?trajectories? from the same starting point travel along similar paths in sequence space, and if trajectories from different starting points end up in the same place. The overall goal is to develop accessible methods to allow other researchers to easily analyze conservation in disordered regions, while, in parallel, expanding the foundational understanding of the biophysical and physiological constraints associated with IDR evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This NSF CAREER Award aims to investigate mechanisms involved in insect cuticle formation by testing three possible mechanisms whereby the newly synthesized cuticle is protected from degradation during molting as the old cuticle is broken down by enzymes. While insects provide numerous benefits to humankind, they can also inflict extensive damage to crops and serve as vectors for pathogens that cause deadly diseases. Therefore, the research results could lead to innovative pest and vector management strategies. The acquired knowledge will be integrated into existing curricula and active learning approaches involving 3-D visualization modules on insect physiology will be developed, thereby enhancing the educational impact of the project. The project will offer multidisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of insect physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. By providing students from local institutions with comprehensive laboratory research experiences and opportunities to present their work at regional/national conferences, the project seeks to empower students to pursue STEM-based careers.<br/><br/>Chitin serves as a crucial structural component of the insect cuticle (exoskeleton), peritrophic matrix (gut lining), trachea, and eggshell. Insects periodically replace their old cuticle through molting or ecdysis to accommodate growth. During each molt, a new cuticle forms, while the old one simultaneously undergoes partial degradation by chitinases before being shed. Notably, chitinases do not degrade the new cuticular chitin despite being abundant in the procuticle. Previous research has demonstrated the critical role of the protein Knickkopf (Knk) in preventing premature degradation of the new cuticle by chitinases, albeit through an unknown mechanism. This CAREER project investigates how newly synthesized cuticular chitin is shielded from chitinase activity during molting to ensure the integrity of the newly forming cuticle. It will test the hypothesis that chitin deacetylases play a pivotal role in maintaining cuticle integrity by shielding against chitinases, potentially in collaboration with Knk. The project will (1) examine the impact of chitin deacetylation on chitinase function, (2) identify accessory proteins required for chitin deacetylase function, and (3) assess the importance of chitin deacetylation in gut peritrophic matrix integrity. To better understand the function of chitin deacetylases in maintaining cuticle integrity, the research will employ, and train students in, various molecular biology, confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and mass-spectrometry techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their generation mechanisms remain a subject of much debate, with strong coronal and interplanetary discontinuities or shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CME) being likely responsible. Previous observations studied these shocks at different solar distances from the Earth?s orbit to the outer heliosphere, but were limited to distances mostly outside the Earth?s orbit (>1 au). Currently, however, observations with Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) allow us to build a more complete picture by probing extensively distances below 1 au. A key consequence of studying this region, which is the goal of this project, is that these in-situ observations will provide SEP and shock measurements that are dramatically less affected by transport effects as the spacecraft progressively get closer to the Sun.<br/><br/>The data from PSP and SolO will be analyzed for periods when these spacecraft observe shock events with exceptionally high SEP intensities. The results will address the significant issue of energetic particle acceleration by shocks near the Sun and how the particles affect the structure of these young shocks. Additionally, as energetic-particle-mediated shocks are predicted to occur in various astrophysical settings across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, our comprehensive search for such structures very close to our Sun may fundamentally contribute to our understanding of well-known ?cosmic ray?-mediated collisionless shocks. The science goals of this project are to (1) quantify SEP-mediated shocks, (2) assess SEP impact on shock mediation, and (3) explore shock-SEP relationships.

These attacks manifest by exploiting timing observations from microarchitectural events, leading to either illicit communications among isolated entities or exfiltration of private data. Due to the rapid integration of new microarchitecture innovations by both industry and academia, it is widely believed that the microarchitectural attack surface will continuously expand. Therefore, a comprehensive and scalable evaluation of microarchitecture security beyond manual inspection is imperative. This project investigates systematic and automated leakage reasoning techniques on given microarchitecture designs to identify new vulnerable microarchitectural states and discover novel exploitation mechanisms. The project then explores principled mitigation and prevention techniques to thwart microarchitectural information leakage.  <br/><br/>This project includes the following complementary research efforts: (1) Building models using microarchitecture-level abstraction and constructing model checking-based frameworks that reason timing explicitly for microarchitectural leakage analysis; (2) Developing ways to instantiate microarchitectural vulnerable abstract patterns to ISA-level executions, validate and quantify new leakage attack vectors in both commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and novel microarchitectural mechanisms for future systems; (3) Exploring leakage-free and composable secure microarchitecture schemes with low overhead by employing mitigation techniques according to performance characteristics of the underlying hardware.

Peatlands are wetland ecosystems that naturally store C due to very slow decomposition of plant material, and thus now store a massive amount of C as organic matter. How the C cycle in these peatlands will change as climate warms is unknown. Michigan is positioned at the southern end of the range of boreal (northern) peatlands, which means that Michigan peatlands will be among the first to be affected by warming. This project will establish a climate transect of peatlands to help predict how future warming will affect the C stored in these ecosystems. The transect contains seven sites, from Portage in the south to Newberry in Michigan?s Upper Peninsula. The sites span 5C in average temperature, which is approximately equivalent to the warming expected over the next century. The project will exploit these natural differences in temperature to determine how C cycle processes in peatlands will change with warming. In addition, a new course for first-year undergraduate students will be developed, centered around a field trip to sites on the peatland transect in the week before the start of classes, to train and inspire the next generation of environmental scientists.<br/><br/>The net C balance of the peatland ecosystem is determined by the net balance of C inputs (from plant growth) and C losses (through microbial decomposition of organic matter). Predicting future changes in the C balance has proved difficult because both of these fluxes are expected to increase with warming. C losses will be evaluated by measuring carbon dioxide and methane emissions from the soil, as well as litter bag decomposition experiments. Changes in C inputs via plant growth will be mediated by nitrogen (N) availability, due to the strong N limitation of peatland ecosystems. Therefore, the temperature sensitivity of N mineralization will be assessed in field measurements across the transect. Finally, the effects of warming on net C accumulation will be assessed using a geochemical approach, taking advantage of the 1C of warming that Michigan has already experienced. The long-term accumulation rate will be compared to the recent accumulation rate, using computer modeling to account for organic matter included in the recent rate that is still undergoing aerobic decomposition. This will allow direct testing of the hypothesis that warming has already begun to slow down peat accumulation in marginal peatlands at the southern edge of their climate window. Together, these approaches will provide a complete picture of how C inputs and losses from peatlands will change in response to the warming expected over the coming decades.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The NSF Engine will cover the battery lifecycle spanning materials, components, cells, modules, packs, system management, industrial applications, and recycling, with industry partners secured along each step. The NSF Engine will address industry- and technology-level challenges including material sourcing and recovery, battery component innovation, safety testing and certification, pilot manufacturing, applications integration, and workforce training. The industry- and community-responsive NSF Engine programs will catalyze high-tech R&D outcomes, broaden participation to build an inclusive innovation ecosystem, and drive equitable economic development at the regional and national levels. The Engine will leverage transformational investments from the Economic Development Administration  and the NSF and the collective capacity of NSF Engine partners to position Upstate New York?s emerging battery ecosystem as an international leader in the sector, powering American battery innovation and supply chain resiliency.<br/><br/>The Upstate New York Energy Storage Engine service region comprises 27 counties in Western, Central, Southern Tier, and Finger Lakes Regions of the state of New York spanning micropolitan and majority-rural areas with more than 4 million residents and more than 100 federally designated Opportunity Zones. The region has suffered from decades of economic downturn and has 30% rural and 28% environmental justice communities.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine leverages a large ecosystem of core partners that includes R1 universities (Binghamton University, Cornell University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Syracuse University, and University of Buffalo), major industry partners (including BAE, Raymond, Li-Cycle, iM3NY, NYSEG, Electrovaya, Kodak and others), many of the region?s small and medium manufacturers, industry trade organizations (including New York Battery and Energy Storage Technology Consortium ? NY-BEST), incubators and investors (including Launch NY and IncubatorWorks), and workforce development partners (including BOCES, SUNY Corning Community College, SUNY Broome Community College, Jamestown Community College, Green Force). This diverse coalition of partners will be central to R&D, translation, and workforce development efforts.<br/><br/>The key areas identified for use-inspired R&D were shaped by extensive discussions with industry partners, National Laboratories, and Federal agencies. These areas include innovations in material sourcing and processing, alternative chemistries and next-generation battery technologies, improved metrology, battery manufacturing process innovation, material recovery and recycling, and safety and testing. All these research thrusts are aimed at developing leapfrog innovations to bolster domestic battery production and reduce dependence on non-domestic supply chains. Lithium battery production depends upon critical minerals whose domestic supply is at risk for disruption, and there are further major gaps in the processing of active materials and production of key battery components; these gaps underscore the need to develop alternative approaches, such as introduction of new and alternative materials, as well as improved metrology in production lines to reduce waste in manufacturing. Material recovery and recycling, as well as the development of alternative chemistries, can reduce the need for critical minerals and dependence on unstable foreign supply chains. Finally, with safety and testing issues critical at various levels of battery development and production, the NSF Engine will pursue a holistic design approach to improving battery system safety, with system-scale testing capabilities.<br/><br/>The Upstate New York Energy Storage Engine provides a comprehensive technology translation plan from lab to market that starts with industry-informed R&D and transitions technology development through venture launch and growth, proof-of-concept, prototyping, to pilot projects, scaling, and commercial development with external funding. Specifically, the NSF Engine will provide support for early-stage regional startups with gap grants for early development prototyping efforts, as well as for venture development needs including intellectual property. The NSF Engine will provide a comprehensive suite of regional R&D, testing, and pilot production infrastructure to support battery development at various stages. <br/><br/>The Upstate New York Energy Storage Engine has worked closely with industry partners to identify skills and training needs, and with workforce development organizations to develop a comprehensive plan for workforce development to support this important industry. The NSF Engine will expand STEM education and workforce development across all levels to deliver skilled technicians, engineers, and entrepreneurs to support the projected growth of the industry and the development and deployment of battery innovations. Workforce development efforts span from next-generation pre-college; to undergrad, grad, and postdoc; to reskilling of existing workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, terrestrial and aquatic microbiomes mix in rivers, soil microbial communities invade one another in agriculture, and human skin microbiomes come into contact when two people shake hands. Such cross-microbiome invasions are collectively termed community coalescence. How these mixing events impact the function of microbiomes and how often new communities with novel functions form as a result remains unclear. This research project uses fermented food microbiomes, including sourdough starters, kombucha, and fermented vegetables, to determine how microbiomes reassemble when they mix and how coalescence impacts microbiome functions. Findings from these experimentally tractable fermented food systems identify how community coalescence can be used as a tool for microbiome engineering and its potential to improve the manipulation of medically and industrially relevant microbiomes. The broad appeal of fermented food systems is also used to increase participation in undergraduate research and broaden the public understanding of microbiomes. This project also engages the public more broadly through popular science articles and interviews on MicrobialFoods.org, a popular science venue developed to explain complex biological concepts in scientific papers in accessible content for food enthusiasts and educators.<br/><br/>The mechanisms that govern cross-community invasions remain poorly understood. Most research has focused on the consequences of community coalescence in natural systems, while determination of underlying mechanisms is limited. This project manipulates a suite of fermented food model systems, derived from fermented food microbiomes, including sourdough starters, kombucha, and fermented vegetables, in conducting community coalescence experiments. The investigation sheds light on the consequences of coalescence, the mechanisms that govern it, and its potential utility for microbiome engineering. With the use of co-culture interaction assays, metabolic modeling, RNA-sequencing, and targeted metabolomics the project dissects the underlying interaction mechanisms that shape coalescence outcomes. Experimental evolution is used to determine how abiotic and biotic adaptation constrains or promotes cross-invasion outcomes. This project provides a mechanistic understanding that is required for predicting coalescence consequences and for leveraging community coalescence in industrial applications with microbial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Leishmania infections, even after patients clear out the parasites, the liver stays enlarged due to substantial changes in its tissue structure. This project aims to uncover how these parasites cause changes in the liver extracellular matrix (ECM) ? the tissue components that surround and support cells. At the core of this exploration are hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), pivotal architects orchestrating the construction of liver ECM. The investigators hypothesize that Leishmania manipulates these cells, instigating modifications to the ECM and an increase in liver size. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will employ materials that mimic the ECM in human bodies to culture HSCs and create mini tissue models in the laboratory. The team will then use these models to study how HSCs behave after Leishmania infection and examine their interactions with macrophages ? immune cells that are the preferred host for these parasites. Inspired by these research ideas, in parallel, the investigator will create a tissue engineering workshop for Latine middle-school students, implement an international virtual exchange for graduate students enrolled in ?Global Health in Biomedical Engineering."" and use crocheted SciArt and social media to inform people about the increasing dangers of these and other tropical parasites.<br/><br/>Organ enlargement is a common phenomenon observed in chronic protozoal infections. Protozoa of the Leishmania subgenus cause substantial swelling of the liver. Liver enlargement persists after parasite clearing and is linked to extensive modifications of host extracellular matrix (ECM). The biological processes through which these parasites induce ECM remodeling is not well understood. Because hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the dominant drivers of ECM production in the liver, the central hypothesis of this project is that Leishmania infection induces ECM remodeling through the activation of HSCs. Considering macrophages are the primary resident cell for Leishmania, a secondary hypothesis is that infected macrophages also mediate the activation of HSCs. Testing these hypotheses is not possible using traditional in vitro systems because culture on tissue culture polystyrene leads to the spontaneous activation of stellate cells. Furthermore, most Leishmania in vitro models study a single host cell type cultured in environments that fail to account for the characteristics of host ECM. The investigator will address these concerns by leveraging biomaterials to engineer improved in vitro models that address the following research objectives: (1) design a biomaterial that supports the culture of quiescent HSCs, (2) assess HSC activation and ECM production after infection with Leishmania donovani, and (3) evaluate HSC phenotype after co-culture with Leishmania-infected macrophages or their released extracellular vesicles. Thus, this proposal will leverage engineering and biomaterials strategies to address critical gaps in our understanding of host-parasite interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Now, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), post pandemic incidence of such conditions has increased by 25-35% worldwide and the WHO is calling for all countries to step up mental health services and support. This highlights the need for more accessible and less invasive treatment options for neurological disorders. Electrical neurostimulation methodologies, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have proven effective in treating various neurological disorders. TMS stimulates the brain using short-duration pulses of electrical current induced by a magnetic field. However, TMS requires stable high-power systems typically found in hospital settings. TMS treatment plans involve daily hospital visits for three weeks, or sometimes multiple treatments in a single day, which limits accessibility to patients who are already managing depression or anxiety symptoms such as social withdrawal and sleep irregularities that disrupt their everyday routines. Moreover, attending regular in-person treatment sessions may not be feasible for those in rural or low-income demographics. However, nanosecond electrical pulses (NEPs), distinguished by their high intensity and extremely narrow pulse width, have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for various neurological disorders. NEP has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in stimulating cells and nerves without causing harm and has potential for portable devices that would help reduce the need for hospital visits and greatly increase accessibility. This project seeks to understand the limitations of traditional NEPs and find solutions to adapt them to smaller devices. The project will produce a medical device prototype incorporating the research findings, broadening the range of non-invasive, accessible neurological treatment options for patients. The project's K-12 outreach, in collaboration with Sierra Nevada Journeys and employing biosensors in Family Science Nights and adult programs, will enhance STEM education through their feedback expertise.<br/><br/>NEPs offer substantial neuromodulation potential, capable of replicating physiological stimuli for non-invasive treatment of neurological disorders. Despite their potential, NEPs encounter obstacles in non-invasive in-vivo applications due to constraints in penetration depth and signal distortion through human or animal body. The objectives of this study are to (1) understand the limitations of traditional NEPs and find solutions to adapt them to smaller devices, (2) address the issue of signal distortions caused by varying anatomical differences, and (3) develop a medical device prototype that incorporates solutions to the aforementioned challenges. Leveraging the potential of NEPs, the research will employ RF signals for enhanced penetration, utilize deep-learning techniques for anatomical compensation, and incorporate wider pulse widths and MHz pulse repetition rates to lower the threshold voltage. The use of digitally generated RF-NEP could represent a significant innovative shift in neurostimulation methodology. This non-invasive approach allows for deeper penetration into animal bodies while including specific waveforms that satisfy specific needs. The integration of these innovative solutions into the design of a new medical device speaks to the translational potential of this research. This project anticipates advancing theoretical knowledge and a concrete, tangible improvement in neurostimulation treatment methods, contributing significantly to the broader neuroscience and neurological therapeutics field.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems (CCSS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This synergy has been significantly transformed by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), a move that, while dramatically enhancing system capabilities, also introduces a layer of complexity, presenting new challenges in ensuring their safety, reliability, and accuracy. Unfortunately, there is a significant gap in the analysis and comprehension of these advanced systems, and many state-of-the-art techniques fall short of verifying their correctness, especially compared to their effectiveness in traditional systems. This project addresses the challenges of testing Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) with integrated AI components, using an approach to find counterexamples by means of simulation. It addresses critical scientific needs for analyzing the current adoptions of AI algorithms within smart systems. This research has the potential to develop an open-source falsification tool, accompanied by a dataset package, encouraging more innovations in the field of model-based verification. Upon successful completion of this project, many of the tools can potentially be adapted to various other applications that include AI-driven systems. In this project, PIs also aim to bridge existing gaps by fostering collective initiatives with academic and industrial partners. The project expands the learning experience by creating new project-based courses on software verification for smart systems and AI. It further enriches learning through mentoring undergraduate and graduate students to solve real-world software verification problems and encourages the involvement of more female students in research activities.<br/><br/>Building upon recent research and preliminary results, the project highlights significant gaps in benchmarking and in-depth analysis of AI-enabled CPS. It also addresses the need to improve the detection capabilities of state-of-the-art techniques specifically for these systems. In its first phase, the project investigates current adoptions of AI-enabled CPS and their verification practices through benchmarking and categorization of CPS models, as well as a large-scale empirical assessment of existing falsification methods. The empirical study aims to identify the limitations and challenges of applying existing falsification methods to AI-driven CPS models. The study also explores potential correlations between various model components and the effectiveness of falsification techniques. The insights from this phase will provide CPS practitioners with a deeper understanding of the inherent limitations in existing software verification practices. In its second phase, the project develops and evaluates an innovative approach that combines Deep Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization. This approach is designed to identify high-risk areas in the input domain leading to system property violations and apply effective decision-making within these regions. The optimization process serves to identify the input areas most prone to violate the system properties. The identified high-risk regions are integrated into the decision-making policy of the reinforcement learning algorithm, which attempts to locate the most critical falsifying traces that violate the specified property. The goal of this approach is to reduce the number of executions required for isolating high-risk input regions, thereby increasing the likelihood of detecting the most critical violations. This endeavor will improve the safety and reliability of AI-driven systems across various real-world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Annual productivity losses are estimated to cost an additional $4.5 billion. There is a considerable health disparity in the diagnosis of skin cancer within the U.S.; The average wait time to see a dermatologist is currently 32.3 days but it varies greatly by location. Early detection reduces disfigurement by reducing the size and extent of surgical removal and reducing the side effects that late-stage patients experience from systemic therapies. Furthermore, the project increases the economic competitiveness of the U.S. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to productize a novel, pigmented, lesion analysis system for wide field-of-view images. The product will be built on a previously developed total body photography system and proof of concept lesion classification software as a medical device that was developed in Phase I. The dermatoscope-like resolution provides a solid foundation for a system that can automatically (without the involvement of a dermatologist) detect and classify various skin conditions in a clinical setting and/or a radiology center (similar to how mammograms are done). Skin cancers, including both melanomas and non-melanomas, are the most common types of cancer in the United States. Early-stage identification of suspicious pigmented lesions in primary care settings can lead to improved melanoma prognosis and a possible 20-fold reductions in treatment cost.

The validation of this new CPM intervention will be demonstrated by designing potent and selective CPM-based inhibitors targeting certain cancers. The success of this project will establish a powerful pharmaceutical technology for designing personalized therapies to treat the oncogenic mutant-driven lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers, where treatment options are extremely limited. This project will also enhance the academia-industry partnership, strengthen a burgeoning life science ecosystem in the Buffalo area, and develop a globally competitive STEM workforce for the Western New York region.<br/><br/>The proposed project addresses a critical barrier in the clinical translation of monobodies - a class of powerful tool biologics that are not cell-permeable despite their small size. The CPM technology overcomes this barrier by combining orthogonal crosslinking ? a proprietary method to rigidify monobody structure through site-specific inter-strand crosslinking - with monobody surface supercharging. As a result, the CPM technology potentially possesses several innovative features: 1) genetic modifications facilitate recombinant production of CPM in bacteria both at research scale and for manufacturing; 2) high binding affinity and specificity toward intracellular oncogene targets can be readily obtained using well-established display technologies; and 3) robust cytosolic transport efficiency can be obtained owing to the rigid scaffold and tunable surface charge. This project aims to unlock the commercial value of CPM technology by identifying potent and selective inhibitors oncogenic KRAS mutants that proved to be elusive with the small-molecule approach. Extensive optimizations of charge distribution and physicochemical properties will be performed using a reported monobody-based KRAS inhibitor as a template, with a goal to identify one CPM with sub-micromolar inhibitory activity in the KRAS mutant-harboring cell lines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the food waste in the cheese industry occurs during processing, with cheese/milk lost to trim losses. The new sensor will reduce trim losses by providing real-time information on the mechanical behavior of the cheese that will allow automated adjustments to cutting parameters. In addition, the mechanical property data gathered for each pack of cheese will create a detailed and labeled database that will be very valuable for cheese makers and retailers. For instance, cheesemakers may use the database to infer dietary, seasonal, and regional variations of cheese texture and constituents. This, in the long run, will promote standardization and reduce trim losses due to variations in cheesemaking. The database will facilitate quality control and pack-to-pack consistency and improve customer satisfaction at the retail stage. The sensor can be extended to other segments of consumer-packaged goods, such as portioned fruits, vegetables, meat, and cereal bars.  In addition, trainees will develop technical and entrepreneurial skills through this project. <br/><br/>This project will address the challenge of trim losses in cheese processing, which can result in up to 30% lost revenue and several billion pounds of cheese/milk loss annually. A sensor will be prototyped that leverages recent developments in using information contained in surface waves emitted during cutting to determine material behavior. The objectives are: (1) to develop a prototype sensor, (2) to test the sensor on well-controlled cheese substitutes, and (3) to test the sensor on common cheese.  The prototype sensor will be developed using low-cost optical sensors, which will undergo validation against multipoint laser vibrometry. Initial sensor testing will be completed on gelatin with deformable fillers. This cheese substitute has been selected because of prior research use and because it allows tight control over material behavior to confirm the sensor output.  Subsequent sensor testing will focus on cheeses that account for 2/3 of U.S. cheese consumption (mild/sharp cheddar, Gouda and mozzarella). The anticipated technical outcomes will be a working prototype sensor and a thorough understanding of the relationships between surface waves and cheese properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this requires the construction of large-scale energy infrastructure that can be energy- and cost-intensive during manufacturing and decommissioning. In particular, there are critical sustainability challenges in the manufacturing and recycling of wind turbine blades. These challenges originate from the permanent nature of the fiber-reinforced thermoset polymer composites that underlie the structure of wind turbine blades. This CiviL Infrastructure research for climate change Mitigation and Adaptation (CLIMA) award supports fundamental research that accelerates the discovery of a new family of polymers, Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs), and their composites that are mechanically strong yet reversible to enable recycling, repairing, and reprocessing. Knowledge to be obtained from this project facilitates cost-effective manufacturing and recycling of wind turbine blades, thereby improving the competitiveness and sustainability of wind energy in the global clean energy landscape and augmenting U.S. industry and economy. Additionally, this project supports outreach activities to engage researchers in national laboratories and the wind energy industry, educate K-12 students in composites, organic materials, computer-aided design and clean energy, recruit undergraduate researchers especially underrepresented groups, and enrich curricula through guest lectures.<br/><br/>Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs) are polymers crosslinked by covalent bonds that become reversible upon heating or other external stimuli. They combine the structural stability of thermosets and the malleability of thermoplastics. This project aims to establish a systematic research framework to discover new CANs and their composites to meet the multi-faceted requirements of material properties posed by the manufacturing, operation, and recycling of wind turbine blades. The research features an interdisciplinary collaboration among mechanics, materials, and manufacturing, and includes three components: molecular design, organic material synthesis, and mechanics of the new polymers. For molecular design, a cyber-platform combining machine learning and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is created to generate candidate monomers of CANs. The synthesis component establishes a feasible molecular design space and allows CAN polymers to be synthesized from candidate monomers for manufacturing and testing. The mechanics component focuses on testing and modeling the mechanical behavior of the CAN polymers. The three components are integrated by preparing coupon-scale CAN composite samples and benchmarking their mechanical properties against the thermoset composites currently used in wind turbine blades. Manufacturing and recycling processes such as vacuum bag molding, thermoforming, lamination and chemical dissolution of CAN composites and the effects of processing conditions are also investigated. <br/><br/>This project is supported jointly by the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MoMS) and the Advanced Manufacturing (AM) programs of the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Division in the Directorate for Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decarbonizing process industries, especially as they relate to food, energy, and water, is of particular and timely importance. Engineers have an ever-constant mission of improving the health, safety, and robustness of these complex systems that support and improve society. However, innovation inherently increases complexity and, therefore, the efforts to solve complex and interconnected challenges, which include designing new systems and improving existing systems, rely heavily on computational modeling, simulation, and optimization-based approaches. There are two major challenges that this proposal aims to address: (1) the current performance of computational optimization approaches limits their applicability to simplified, lower-complexity problems, and (2) university engineering programs often lack cohesive computational-thinking activities throughout their curricula. Solving (1) will alleviate the current computational bottlenecks and broaden the scale and scope of complex problems that can be solved. Solving (2) will not only help train the next generation of engineers on computational modeling approaches but improve their overall problem-solving skills.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to develop scalable deterministic global optimization (DGO) algorithms and open-source software implementations by exploiting alternative stream computing architectures for parallelization, to enable the solution of higher complexity models that include first-principles models and machine learning elements involving nonlinear (partial) differential and algebraic equations. The significance of the proposed work lies in unlocking the massive parallel computing performance of graphical processing units (GPUs) for DGO with the development of a new branch-and-bound deterministic search algorithm. The result will be a significant speedup over the current state of the art, which will enable the solution of larger-scale higher-complexity problems that arise in food-energy-water (FEW) applications, among others. The first major innovation is a method for automatically generating source code representations of convex/concave relaxations of nonconvex functions in the optimization formulation, and subgradients thereof, on arbitrary domains of interest. The second major innovation is a scalable GPU-compatible parallel DGO algorithm and open-source software implementation for the guaranteed solution of nonconvex programs. This project will align the proposed research with educational activities aimed at transforming a diverse cohort of students into skilled computational thinkers. This project will support the training of students to understand the complexity of systems models from an optimization context to better understand the practicality of optimization-based approaches. This project will deliver methods, tools, and training modules to serve the immediate and future technology workforce training needs of engineering fields that will increasingly depend on optimization for innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Building operations account for a large portion of infrastructure energy footprint.  Adaptive building components, such as origami-inspired adaptive facades, are a potential pathway to reduce this cost, by enabling building exteriors to be reconfigured based on light or thermal conditions.  Yet, a major challenge holding these concepts back is their inability to be systematically designed.  Moreover, there is a critical need to provide early and interactive design feedback to better facilitate more useful, nuanced, and ecologically responsive ideas.  This research will create tools that promote creativity, knowledge sharing, and collective workflows that intend to lead to effective technology in all regards, from aesthetics to function.  The work will simultaneously create a new educational track for architecture and engineering students to learn about and test their ideas for adaptive building concepts.  This educational effort is fully integrated into the research by providing a testbed and the critical dataset to inform the computational tools.  Thus, this work will create new design processes for origami-inspired structures and seed future generations of designers with the skills and penchant to explore adaptive structure concepts.  <br/><br/>The overall goal of this work is to establish a new strategy to integrate architectural design processes and human-derived designs with physics-guided machine learning and computational design optimization, and to evaluate this strategy on the application of origami-inspired responsive architecture. The integrated computational-experimental research effort includes three thrusts: 1) establish a coupled human-computer design strategy for component-level origami-inspired adaptive structures to simultaneously meet multiple external environmental interaction goals and intrinsic structural requirements; 2) create a computational framework to evaluate the performance of origami-inspired adaptive structures, and augment their design based on human input and computer guidance; and 3) establish a framework for the introduction of new structural concepts in an architectural design process and application of this framework to identify emergent origami-inspired concepts for adaptive structures.  The project intends to establish an overarching framework that accelerates and widens innovation through a novel combination of computational tools, which not only connect to the user, but can also augment human creativity.

In nature, fish, birds, and other entities capable of movement display complex choreographies when interacting in dense groups, even without a centralized conductor to guide them. These complex behaviors hold great promises in engineering, where crowds of micro-robots could coordinate their actions to complete a global task. This project hypothesizes that linking ?mindless? active units to spring-like structures is a pathway for achieving such a vision. The research activities will show how to program assemblies of elastically coupled active units that perform complex tasks, e.g., ?solving a maze?, although they have no traditional sensing or information-processing capabilities. This work will advance our fundamental understanding of the ?mechanical intelligence? achievable by active elastic systems and could translate into new capabilities in the field of soft robotics. Concurrently, the project provides a simple, modular, and inexpensive experimental platform to illustrate abstract concepts during teaching and outreach efforts and delivers an interdisciplinary learning experience for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project aims to demonstrate that we can leverage flexural structures to coordinate and program stochastically moving small-scale components. To this end, the researchers will devise a system where activity meets nonlinear elastic deformations. They will experiment with elasto-active structures comprising long and thin elastic beams connected to active agents and develop theoretical models and numerical simulations to rationalize their mechanics. Those agents are centimetric rigid-bodied micro-robots that use vibration to ""walk"" across a flat surface. The project first focuses on the spontaneous self-oscillations observed when a beam is clamped on one end and loaded by a micro-robot on the other end.  This system will be used to establish a minimal model that couples Langevin dynamics and the Kirchhoff equations for elastic rods. The project will next study the ""runners"" that form when a beam is loaded by a micro-robot at each end, resulting in the beam buckling and moving across the plane. The interaction of these runners with boundaries, e.g., planar reflection, interaction with obstacles, and passage through a slit, will be examined to elucidate the contributing factors to the runners? ability to solve complex mazes. Finally, the project will explore systems with three or more micro-bots involved, enabling run-and-tumble motions and wave propagation, thereby expanding the operating modes of these elastically coupled active agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cellular tRNA molecules are decorated with a huge diversity of chemical modifications that are essential for correctly tuning tRNA structure, stability, and efficient and accurate protein synthesis. Defects in the enzymes and biochemical pathways that install tRNA modifications are linked to a wide range of human diseases from cancers to neurodegenerative disorders. However, for many of the enzymes that install key chemical modifications on tRNA, a clear understanding of how these enzymes selectively carry out their modification reactions is missing. Filling this gap in knowledge is important for our fundamental understanding of cellular RNA biology. This proposal will define the detailed atomic-level mechanisms for two distinct classes of metal-dependent enzymes (metalloenzymes) that install key modifications on tRNA that directly impact protein synthesis. Closely integrated with this research, a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) will be developed that engages both undergraduates and high-school students from underrepresented groups in a collaborative, discovery-based course where students will make and experimentally test predictions about protein-tRNA interactions. The outcomes from this work could provide new information on how tRNA-modifying metalloenzymes carry out complex, multistep reactions on tRNA and broaden engagement of students in research-focused activities at the undergraduate and high-school levels.<br/><br/>Hypermodification of the tRNA anticodon loop is essential for proper codon-anticodon recognition and mRNA decoding in the ribosome during translation.

With this project, which is jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), a collaborative research team from the University of Maine and the University of Alabama develops, synthesizes, and investigates a new class of perovskite halides for optoelectronics. In this combined theoretical and experimental investigation, the team also evaluates the materials? stability under ambient environmental conditions. Unlike traditional halides with two to three metal elements, these newly developed perovskite halides consist of five or more principal metal elements in nearly equal concentrations. The workplan features a closed feedback loop between theory and experiment and focuses on materials advancement by performing theoretical predictions, developing synthesis methods, characterizing optoelectronic properties, and evaluating stability under exposure to gases, light, and heat. New perovskite halide materials discovered from this project could lead to a wide variety of optoelectronic applications including solar cells, light-emitting devices, photodetectors and lasers, photoelectrochemical catalysts, radiation detectors, and sensors. This research allows project participants from interdisciplinary programs at these two universities to interact and contribute to technology development within Maine and Alabama. Three Ph.D. graduate students and six undergraduates are trained to acquire skills and competency in the three foundational pillars of computation, experiments, and data analysis which are key attributes for the next-generation workforce. STEM outreach and education activities disseminated to K-12 students, high-school teachers, and the general public within Maine and Alabama are aimed at conveying how collaborative energy-materials design-driven research is relevant to addressing societal challenges. <br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This project, which is jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), aims to computationally design and experimentally realize a new class of lead-free perovskite halide materials with enhanced thermodynamic and environmental stability along with desired optoelectronic properties. Entropy-stabilized perovskite halides (ESPHs) containing five or more principal metal elements are investigated for enhanced optoelectronic properties and stable environmental performance. The key hypothesis is that the configurational entropy of mixing plays a dominant role in stabilizing a single-phase crystalline ESPH structure. The validation of this hypothesis not only provides a new experimentally controllable pathway to design more stable perovskite halide materials but also yields unique composition-structure-property relationships that are absent when chemical order prevails. Specific objectives are to (i) predict the combinations of metal elements that can give rise to stable ESPHs using high-throughput first-principles calculations, (ii) synthesize the predicted ESPHs using the solid-state solution, hydrothermal, and solvent precipitation methods, (iii) characterize the compositional, structural and optoelectronic properties of the synthesized ESPHs, and (iv) evaluate and analyze the stabilities of experimentally synthesized ESPHs under various laboratory environments including humidity, oxidizing/reducing gases, and heat. New ESPHs from this project are poised to substantially expand the chemical space of perovskite halides, providing more capabilities to tune and tailor materials properties of interest (such as lattice parameter, bandgap, optical absorption strength, and conductivity) and render high potential for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications including solar cells, light-emitting devices, photoelectrochemical catalysts, photodetectors and lasers, radiation detectors, and sensors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, our knowledge is limited due to challenges in analyzing genomics data, such as bias arising from an overrepresentation of European study participants and simplistic statistical models that do not sufficiently capture the data. This project overcomes these challenges across three main scientific goals, in which innovative statistical models map DNA mutations to their target genes, and two educational goals, in which scientific training and diversity are simultaneously cultivated. First, the investigators will improve the fidelity of mapping mutations to target genes for groups of individuals that are not well-studied, such as minority populations. Second, the investigators will develop a new method to connect mutations to genes by considering how genes interact with each other in genome-wide networks, suggesting functional effects for many uncharacterized mutations. Third, the investigators will characterize the specific cells in which mutations exert their effects using scalable models that reflect the natural distribution of data from single cell genomic assays. This research advances the fields of bioinformatics and human genetics by introducing new, robust statistical models that link mutations to their target genes. This project also enhances equity and diversity in biomedical discoveries, while simultaneously enhancing diversity within research environments. Toward the latter, the investigators initiate a multi-week on-campus research program for high school students from under-resourced communities, as well as genetics training courses for undergraduate and graduate students, supplying quantitative interdisciplinary skills coveted by industry and academia alike. This award will generate extensive datasets, open-source statistical models and genomics tools, high-impact publications, and course materials, thereby engaging and fueling the scientific community to partake and propel related research. <br/><br/>This project focuses on developing new genetic models to understand how specific genetic variations influence gene expression. These models overcome current limitations in characterizing the function of genetic variation, which often has the subsequent goal of implicating target genes in the regulation of human phenotypes such as height and cancer risk. Challenges of existing algorithms include statistical issues due to finite sample sizes (especially for understudied minority populations), multiple hypothesis burdens restricting the knowledge gained from genome-wide analysis, and model misspecification especially for new datatypes of growing popularity, such as single cell genomics. The investigators address these challenges across three main objectives. First, the investigators link genetic variation to changes in gene expression in understudied minority populations, by jointly modeling genetic associations across globally diverse datasets. Second, the investigators develop a comprehensive approach to map genome-wide genetic variants to changes in gene expression using a priori knowledge of gene regulatory networks and advanced machine learning algorithms to reduce the burden of multiple testing. Third, the investigators design a new statistical model to characterize the cell-type-specificity of gene expression regulation at high resolution; this model leverages the natural distribution of single cell data, resolving model misspecification of state-of-the-art methods and reduces measurement noise by modeling millions of single cell measurements across donors. This award supports the generation of open-source genomics software and data repositories characterizing the function of genetic variants, while also creating educational and training opportunities for under-resourced high school students and motivated undergraduate and graduate students. The symbiotic research and educational intertwine in a relationship that is expected to enhance both the diversity in research environments, as well as the diversity in research cohorts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon is essential for the development and health of all organisms. The PI uses yeast cells as a model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying gradient sensing, which are thought to be broadly applicable to cells in more complex organisms. In previous studies, he discovered a ?gradient tracking machine? that cells must assemble before they are able to sense the direction of the chemical source. In this investigation, he will continue to investigate how this machine functions to decode chemical gradients. During this project period, the PI and his senior research specialist will mentor select biology students from the City Colleges of Chicago, to enhance their chances of graduating from a four-year institution with a BS in a STEM field. The proposed undergraduate research and mentoring program is designed to inspire, instruct, advise, and support students who are interested in a STEM career. Two outstanding candidates will be chosen to participate each year based on their academic potential and motivation to pursue a STEM major at a four-year institution. By participating in regular tutoring sessions, paid summer research internships in the PI?s lab, and public outreach events, students will gain experience conducting scientific research, an ability to critically evaluate the research of others, and practice presenting their work. This program is expected to increase the chances of eight students to succeed as science majors at four-year institutions. The investigation will also provide the PI's students with interdisciplinary training through interactions with collaborators who are experts in interdisciplinary scientific areas.<br/><br/>The best-known gradient-stimulated cellular outputs, chemotaxis (directed cell movement), and chemotropism (directed cell growth), are required for a wide range of biological processes. Although they ultimately exhibit quite different behavior, chemotactic and chemotropic cells face similar challenges: the responding cell must sense small differences in chemical concentration across its surface, determine the direction of the gradient source, and polarize its cytoskeleton toward it. The mating response of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae is chemotropic: mating cells interpret complex pheromone gradients and polarize their growth in the direction of the closest partner. Like many chemosensing cells, yeasts use G protein-coupled receptors to detect chemoattractant. The goal of this project is to understand how yeast cells accurately sense direction in shallow, complex, and dynamic pheromone gradients. Based on discoveries made in a previous project, the PI published a deterministic model of gradient sensing that explains, in broad terms, how yeast cells translate a vanishingly small differential of activated receptors across their surfaces into accurate and robust directional responses. Mating yeast initially ignore the pheromone gradient, as they first colocalize signaling, polarity, and trafficking proteins to the default polarity site they use for budding, building a ?gradient tracking machine? (GTM). Once assembled, the GTM moves along the plasma membrane to the point of maximal pheromone concentration, where it marks the chemotropic site used for mating. The primary negative regulator of G-protein signaling, the RGS protein Sst2, is essential for this process, and phosphorylation of one of the G-protein subunits (Gbetagamma)plays a critical role. The priorities of this investigation are to learn how Sst2 is controlled in space and time, how the phosphorylation of the G protein subunit contributes to gradient tracking, and how dynamic intercommunication between GTMs enables mating partners to orient toward a common fusion site. These questions will be answered using imaging, genetic, biochemical, proteomic, and computational approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of the diversity in composition, the surface of a HEA nanocrystal naturally presents an enormous number of atoms in distinct coordination environments to produce a near-continuum distribution of adsorption energies for the key intermediate of a reaction. As such, HEA nanocrystals offer a versatile platform for the rapid development of new catalytic materials. Despite some progress in recent years, it remains a grand challenge to control the composition and surface structure of HEA nanocrystals, making it impossible to quantitatively and accurately describe the structure-property relationship of HEA-based catalysts. During this project, a transformative technique is developed to achieve deterministic and even predictable synthesis of HEA nanocrystals with controlled compositions and surface structures. The as-obtained nanocrystals can directly serve as advanced catalytic materials to benefit U.S. economy and society. The multi-disciplinary and collaborative nature of this project offers a vehicle to enhance and enrich the education and training experiences of students while also expanding the number of them in cutting-edge research. In particular, the students learn firsthand how to discover and develop advanced catalytic materials twice as fast at a fraction of the cost. The results from this project are also adapted to enhance classroom teaching, including the development of demonstrations and experiments to better illustrate the key concepts of science and engineering. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This research represents the first attempt to develop single-phase HEA nanocrystals with well-defined and controllable compositions and surface structures. Traditionally, colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals involves one-shot injection of the metal precursor. When directly applied to a bi- or multi-metallic system, such a protocol is subject to failures because different precursors have distinct reduction kinetics and their instantaneous concentrations in the reaction solution would decay differently with reaction time. Parting from the traditional method, the investigators co-titrate the solutions of different precursors dropwise into a reaction solution so that the instantaneous concentration of each precursor is kept in a predefined steady state throughout the synthesis. As a result, metal atoms are produced from the different precursors at stable, pre-specified rates for the generation of HEA nanocrystals with a uniform composition, with the atomic ratios determined by the reduction rates of their precursors in the steady states. When conformally deposited on preformed seeds with different shapes as overlayers of a few atomic layers in thickness, HEA nanocrystals with well-defined facets are obtained. The seeds can be selectively etched away to release the HEA overlayers as ultrathin nanoplates. At a thickness of three atomic layers, the nanoplates are perfect for resolving the composition and surface structure by electron microscopy and spectroscopy. In parallel, the HEA nanocrystals are tested for catalytic reactions, with a focus on the identification of a catalyst optimal in activity and durability toward oxygen reduction and bond-selective hydrogenation. The synthetic method can also be extended to accelerate the rational development of other types of nanomaterials with complex compositions for a range of applications, including those related to chemical production, petroleum industry, national security, and public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, electric cars are still not as practical as gasoline cars because, among other issues, they are difficult to recharge in short times. To improve this, new materials need to be developed since the currently used materials in LIB are already close to their maximum capabilities.

The project combines computational approaches with modern materials chemistry experiments to develop nanoscale materials, one hundred times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, with increased electron transport capabilities. The principal investigators make use of computational fundamental science to guide experiments and therefore virtual testing of a wide variety of materials, reducing the cost of testing and trial-and-error to reasonable budgets.

To facilitate the understanding and quantification of electron transport at the interface, the team employs open-ended carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attached to a bulk copper substrate using stable linker molecules. The CNTs are oriented vertically compared to the Cu substrate, and only the ends of the CNTs are connected to Cu atoms.

With the aim of impedance matching at the interface the team studies the materials as anodes for Li batteries, investigates energy storage performance and dendrite formation in the context of computational and experimental structure-property correlations. The results of this research could pave the way for more efficient batteries, new sensors, new catalysts, and new biodevices.

It is widely prevalent in natural systems like DNA, proteins, and beetle shells. It is also of vital importance in diverse fields such as chiral mechanical and optical structures, bioseparation, and pharmaceuticals. Current exploration of chiral structures mostly involves molecular design and self-assembly of low mechanical strength organic materials. However, the kind of hybrid organic/inorganic materials with superior properties required for engineering applications are plagued by significant knowledge gaps in terms of synthesizing these materials. With this CAREER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Condensed Matter Physics program, both in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator and her research group at the University of North Texas investigate new strategies for developing chiral hybrid materials by using abundant chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) as templates for nucleation and growth of these hybrid organic/inorganic materials. This is an integrated education-research program that centers on a fundamental understanding of the chemical reactions, physical behavior, and structural engineering involved in transforming LC morphologies into hybrid or fully inorganic materials; and revealing underlying structure-property relationships to unlock chirality-endowed multidimensional structures, as well as potentially novel optical and mechanical properties. The project promotes STEM education in soft-matter science and engineering, with a particular emphasis on engaging female and Hispanic students. By creating summer research opportunities, workshops and outreach activities, the principal investigator strives to include, inspire, and empower students from underrepresented groups, kindling their interests and participation in materials science. Activities are specifically designed to educate a new generation of scientists and engineers who better reflect the diversity of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and to build a nationally-recognized soft-matter program in North Texas and beyond. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>Chiral nematic or cholesteric phases in liquid crystals (LCs) exhibit asymmetrical packing of molecules, and thereby result in a finite twist angle between adjacent molecules and long-range chiral ordering similar to helical superstructures in DNA. The increase in chirality leads to the formation of 3D cubic symmetry, known as blue phases (BPs), that consist of double-twisted cylinders. The chiral properties of LCs (from nano to micrometers) are widely used in display technologies, electro-optics, and sensors. However, exploiting the full potential of such beneficial chiral structures to adapt to diverse engineering conditions, e.g., temperature, stress, and chemical environments, needs to overcome the inherently mechanically weak nature of LCs. In particular, the rapidly growing market for miniaturized device technologies requires materials with integrated flexibility and optical and mechanical performance at micro/nanoscale precision, all of which put CLCs in a more unique position than conventional solid crystalline materials. In this CAREER project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Condensed Matter Physics program, both in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator and her research group study novel reaction mechanisms facilitated by 2D/3D chiral templates to synthesize hybrid organic/inorganic materials with chirality across disparate length scales. The functional polar groups in mesogenic monomers used for LC structure polymerization serve as reactive moieties for sequential infiltration synthesis of metal oxides. The helical hierarchical and 3D lattice structures formed by highly chiral LCs, including BPs, guide the diffusion, nucleation, and growth of organometallic precursors inside the templates. By combining advanced experimental techniques and computational modeling, the research advances the fundamental understanding of thermodynamics, transport, and site selectivity of inorganic species in CLCs. Furthermore, the principal investigator studies the interplay among molecular architecture, synergistic self-assembly, and spatially controlled nucleation and growth of organic/inorganic species within complex multidimensional CLC/BP structures. This fundamental understanding allows the rational design of chiral-structured metal oxide-reinforced LC composites and unlocks their full potential in diverse application fields that include chiral optics, chiral mechanical devices, asymmetric catalysis, chiral separation and sensors<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A goal of restoring agricultural land to grassland is to promote the recovery of diverse native plant communities that can withstand and bounce back from periodic stress, and that improve the health of soil degraded from cultivation. However, the composition of plant communities that develop and rate at which soil recovers in restored grasslands is highly variable and difficult to predict. Forecasting plant community outcomes and soil recovery is further complicated by an increasingly variable climate, especially in the southern Great Plains. This research uses a series of grassland restorations established in an agricultural field every other year for twelve years, encompassing a wide range of climate conditions, to understand of the role of climate variability on plant community composition, the resilience of restored communities to drought, and the rate at which carbon accumulates in the soil. This long-term study provides new insights into the role of climate in achieving conservation goals and reduces uncertainty about the capacity for restored grasslands to sequester carbon in soil. <br/><br/>The similarly reconstructed grasslands provide a novel framework to test the hypotheses that stochastic variation in climate has deterministic consequences for restored community states, resilience develops as communities age and interact with community state, and climate-driven differences in plant composition contribute to variation in soil carbon accrual. Previously collected and continued measurements of plant species composition are used to model the effect of planting-year climate on restored community trajectories of change. Climate-influenced community states in these grasslands vary uniquely and widely in the ratio of C4-grasses and C3-forbs. The grasses and forbs produce organic matter that varies in both substrate quality and stable carbon isotopic signatures that are measured to determine whether soil carbon accrual is influenced more by recalcitrant or high-quality inputs, respectively. The occurrence of multiple droughts over the course of establishing this long-term experiment provides a rare opportunity to evaluate whether resilience varies predictably with restoration age and whether it interacts with climate-influenced community state. Ultimately, this research helps to transition long-term studies in community ecology toward prediction, advance understanding of factors influencing resilience in ecosystems, and help resolve competing hypotheses regarding plant-based controls on soil carbon accrual.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Ecosystem Science and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The broader impacts of the project include promoting the grid integration of sustainable energy, developing open-source curriculum, and encouraging the engagement of a broad range of students in research and educational activities.<br/><br/>In most practical power systems, traditional synchronous generators are gradually being replaced by inverter-based resources such as wind and solar power. This transition will introduce the low-inertia challenge to grid operation and stability. However, traditional day-ahead unit commitment models cannot effectively consider the impact of this emerging challenge. To bridge the gap, this project will develop an innovative frequency-constrained unit commitment (FCUC) model by leveraging optimization methods and machine learning technologies especially graph neural networks. This project will first develop a frequency stability performance metric estimation model and then integrate it into FCUC as additional constraints to enforce frequency stability requirements. Moreover, this project will develop machine learning-assisted approaches to reduce the model complexity of FCUC by converting a subset of variables into constants and eliminating unnecessary nonbinding constraints. Lastly, this project will develop machine learning-assisted accelerated decomposition algorithms to further enhance computational efficiency and ensure quality solutions can be obtained within the specified timeframe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The medium is a periodic array of carefully designed nanoscale cavities with a single-atom-thick membrane stretched over them.  When the membrane is vibrated, each cavity emits a high-frequency sound wave, much like a nanoscale drum. These waves can then be tuned, coupled to each other, propagated preferentially, or even completely canceled, thanks to the unique properties of the medium. As such, this study will advance our understanding of wave propagation in novel materials and develop the nanotechnology necessary for harnessing these waves. Among the numerous envisioned applications are electro-acoustic signal processing components intended for use in communications, national security, environmental monitoring, and biotechnology. The project also integrates research and education by fostering a research collaboration between a primarily undergraduate institution and a research-intensive university.  The research, education, and mentoring opportunities will facilitate workforce development in an emerging area of technology. <br/><br/>The overarching scientific goal of this project is to understand wave propagation in nanostructured dynamic systems with extreme linear dimensions. The studies will be carried out in a tailor-made dynamic system incorporating a single-atom-thick 2D material, such as graphene, into a periodic skeleton structure. This system will allow for coupling individual single-atom-thick acoustic resonators on a nanostructured compliant lattice, opening up new and exciting acoustic wave dynamics. Experimental access to these acoustic waves will be achieved by a variety of ultrasensitive optical and electrical transducers, and the waves will be characterized using amplitude and phase-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, the acoustic properties of this dynamic system can be tuned by applying external perturbations, which will allow for harnessing its unique attributes in possible radiofrequency device applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, it will examine intercontinental plant transfer during the early colonial period. It aims to use this critical period in the history of science to bring attention to how Indigenous people in the Hispanic world made key contributions to modern botany, as well as exploring how earlier societies dealt with the rapid influx of new information in an Information Age of their own. Many plants are familiar to global audiences, including marigolds from Mexico, citruses from China, lilies from South Africa, and many more. Most of these plants became familiar to global audiences only after the rise of the colonial empires, when regular cross-oceanic voyages made the transfer of plants, animals, people, and information around the world faster and easier than ever before. The results of this project will illustrate the many ways in which people have understood the natural world over time, recognizing the continued co-existence of multiple worldviews in different places. By providing public outreach based in the modern botanical garden, this project will help the public and students connect this period in history to the physical and intellectual world they live in today.<br/>	<br/>In tracing the movement of plants and plant-related knowledge in the early modern Spanish empire, this project brings together archaeological, anthropological, and historical information to better understand how plants moved around the Atlantic. By comparing printed botanical texts with archaeological and documentary evidence about where plants were grown, this project provides new tools for investigating how people thought about plants outside official circles.

These new hydrogel elastomers have the potential for broad impact across the U.S. healthcare and medical device industries. Their utility as both a low-friction, durable structural design material and as a bio-inert surface coating alternative makes them relevant in a wide range of new and existing medical device technologies. To avoid environmentally damaging perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) substances, the need for new, low friction, durable polymer alternatives has become more acute. This technology is in a prime position to fill an emerging void in the biomedical materials landscape. The potential broader impact can be extended to new tools, ranging from complex surgical instruments and implant technologies to simple wound care dressings and medical tubing.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) hydrogels possessing the necessary durability, elasticity, wear resistance, biostability, and biocompatibility to be considered as structural materials in medical device design. These materials were engineered to exhibit intrinsic surface lubricity at a range of material durometers while remaining perfluoroalkyl substance- (PFAS) and fluoropolymer-free. TPEs are key components in a broad range of medical devices, but there is a critical need for low friction lubricity at the exposed surface to minimize interactions with biological tissues. Existing TPE materials lack such lubricity, and biomedical device designers are forced to depend on expensive and complex hydrophilic surface treatments or on the use of hydrophobic, fluoropolymer liners or resin coatings to achieve low surface friction and biological surface passivation. Hydrogel based materials, with their intrinsic lubricity and tendency to suppress bioactivation, have been touted as possible players in such devices, and the hydrogel material technology this project explores would be one of the first on the market that can meet the durability demands required in most product applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by identifying classroom practices that enable a greater number of students to thrive in these courses.  Whether or not a person completes a four-year undergraduate degree is a primary driver of income levels.  Thus, barriers to earning degrees can present significant obstacles to socioeconomic mobility in the United States.  One such barrier is successful completion of introductory STEM courses.  Persistence in these courses varies even in STEM disciplines in which students from under-represented groups enter the major at the same rates as their majority peers.  Persistence of students is affected by how their instructors teach.  For example, incorporating active learning methods in introductory STEM courses can increase student achievement and lower performance gaps. However, not all implementations of active learning are equally effective for supporting these outcomes. A meta-analysis of over 46,000 students in a wide array of STEM courses compared student outcomes in lecture-based versus active learning classrooms.  Active learning reduced achievement gaps in exam scores by an average of 40% and the gap in failure rates by 75%. Surprisingly, some active learning interventions widened achievement gaps, raising questions about why the variation exists.  Findings from the literature point to two complementary elements of the classroom experience that are necessary to close achievement gaps: (1) an inclusive environment where all students believe they can be successful, which primes them to meaningfully engage; and (2) active learning that follows best practices for how people learn.  This project team aims to identify and test the impact of specific elements of classroom culture and course design that effectively narrow achievement gaps.<br/><br/>This project has three aims: (1) Generate an explanatory model of achievement gaps by identifying and measuring a set of critical elements for closing these gaps in 12 courses identified in a meta-analysis that either narrowed or widened achievement gaps; (2) Establish generalizability of critical elements on achievement gaps by training and validating a predictive model on a national sample of 40 additional introductory courses from a wide array of institution types; (3) Develop, evaluate, and promote a Practitioner?s Toolkit for Closing Achievement Gaps.  This Toolkit will include instructor and student questionnaires that feed directly to a data processing application that fits the predictive model for unique classrooms. In addition, the Toolkit will include self-reflection activities to promote engagement with the personalized results of the predictive model and a guidebook for improvement that explains implementation of each critical element.  Thus, this project intends to produce a novel set of tools that instructors can use to enhance student performance in higher education, helping to make a four-year degree attainable by all students.  The tools developed by the project will be freely available online and disseminated through invited seminars, workshops, and presentations at national meetings.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

However, for youth, it is often presented as settled, a fixed collection of facts, principles, and theories that can seem sterile and unimaginative. This project is designed to combat that idea. This Research in Service to Practice project brings scientists, middle school youth and choreographers together to explore unsettled scientific phenomena from a complex systems perspective using choreography and agent-based modeling (ABM), to engage all participants in cutting edge scientific inquiry. Given the ubiquity of complex systems, being able to adopt a complex systems perspective is critical to understanding the world and our relationship to it. However, research has shown that this can be a challenge, specifically for youth. While most complex systems research has not focused on the role of the body, recent studies have shown the promise and potential of embodiment as its own form of reasoning about complex systems. Thus, this project will create exploratory science spaces foregrounding embodiment in the process of scientific discovery. The program has two phases: (1) a 20-hour training workshop where scientists and choreographers engage in interdisciplinary collaborative design work, and (2) a 60-hour summer program where the researcher-practitioner partnership involving scientists, choreographers and youth engages in agent- based & embodied choreographic scientific modeling. The summer program takes place in community-based centers in Gainesville, FL and Boston, MA broadening perceptions of what science research looks like and can be. Each site will host 20 youth, two local scientists, and a local choreographer. Participants will engage in embodied collaborative inquiry, brainstorming and modeling to create choreographic representations and culminate in a public event for the community. The project aims to understand the experiences of and shifts in youth and scientists as they engage in these activities and to understand how to design such a model for informal learning. The project will also help scientists apply a complex systems lens to their own work and settled perspectives. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. <br/><br/>Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, the project will develop and expand embodied and agent-based learning theories, while also piloting, analyzing, and refining collaborative models for science learning in informal spaces. The research questions are: 1. How does engaging in the process of creating embodied and agent-based models of complex systems contribute to new ways of understanding science, de-settle ideas about the process of how science gets ?made?, and impact understanding of the role of the body in making science? and 2. How can arrangements of bodies and modeling tools work together to support understanding of complex systems? The research and design are informed by three main theoretical principles: (a) science is ?dance of agency?, a process of inquiry that through iterative dialogic interaction with tools, technology, and humans, produces understandings that more and more closely explain natural phenomena; (b)  embodied-interactionist theories of learning allow us to understand representational sense-making by looking closely at the processes by which representations are made, not just at representational end- products; and (c) creative embodiment and agent based modeling are valuable tools for sense-making around complex science ideas and emergent phenomena. Two cycles of design, implementation, and analysis across two different informal learning sites will be conducted. Data will be collected at both sites, resulting in four implementation and data collection periods.  Each round of implementation will be staggered so that reflections and lessons from an implementation can inform the next design iteration. This project will provide insights on the relationship between choreography and ABM as tools for scientific sense-making and expand ABM to consider the role of movement and bodies more broadly in physical space. It will also contribute to an understanding of how underrepresented youth?s perceptions and conceptions of science can be shaped through embodied science activities, and of the relationships these youth see between their own bodies and identities, science, and the creative arts. Finally, by involving individuals from underrepresented communities as researchers, designers, scientists, evaluators, and advisors, this project expands cross-cultural and training opportunities within the field of education and STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the next ten years, about 2000 OW turbines are expected to be constructed off our nation?s eastern coastline from Massachusetts to Virginia at a cost of about $100 Billion. This brings great challenges and opportunities for the shared-use of our coastal waters. The marine ecosystem in this region is already under great stress due to climate change which has reduced biodiversity and fishing stocks; thereby, communities in this region are very concerned about additional stresses on the marine ecosystem that offshore wind may bring. MOCEAN (Mission is the OCEAN) is the lead for this NSF project, and it aims to: (i) make OW farm development a win for all (OW industry, fishers, coastal communities, ocean habitats); (ii) drive large-scale sustainable OW energy that will contribute greatly to achieving U.S. climate goals and ocean health; and (iii) catalyze the investment required to build and operate OW farms to address societal inequities. This project will engage industry, stakeholders, public officials, affected communities, and public and private decision makers to develop an effective strategic plan and innovation community to achieve MOCEAN?s mission. <br/><br/>MOCEAN?s strategic plan and innovation community will be developed to support making significant advancements in science and technology; engineering, economic, and educational models; and associated policy drivers; the region of this community will include coastline areas from Massachusetts to Virginia. If the project succeeds in becoming an NSF Engine, then the advancements in science will range from the micro-to-macro scale, and these will include the formation of marine communities, marine biology, impact of stressors on habitats, the effect of different materials and coatings on marine growths, local ecosystems, as well as regional ecosystems. The advancements in technologies will include new sensing systems (e.g. eDNA, acoustic, image-based), robotics, coating systems, more durable materials, intelligent nature-inclusive scour protection, artificial reefs, and future-proof foundations. The advancements in engineering models will account for important factors that are presently ignored or insufficiently considered in practice (e.g. soil-foundation structure interaction, impact of cathodic protection on design life and the environment). For economics, the advancements will quantify the effect of local labor, environmental impact, and new blue technology within economic models that can be used in the decision-making process for the design and operation of offshore wind farms. In education, advancements will create new methods of engagement, support, and learning that lead to much greater participation of students and workers from marginalized communities in the New Blue Economy within MOCEAN?s region of service. The composition of the MOCEAN team was designed to make intellectual progress at the intersections between different fields, and to create system-of-system models. This Development Award will enable the team to engage in a regional, collaborative planning process to prepare a future Engine to meet these goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The NSF Engine will discover, develop, and deploy innovative viable technologies that (1) attract water-intensive manufacturers to the Great Lakes region while maintaining environmental health; (2) recover valuable resources (like energy, critical minerals and nutrients) from wastewater streams and convert them to wealth; and 3) create an innovation ecosystem to foster employment, ownership, and wealth-building opportunities for people and communities, especially those most in need of economic opportunity.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has an initial region of service that spans three states ? Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin ? with several anchor points including Chicago, Cleveland, and Milwaukee as priority areas of impact for the first two years. The NSF Engine will be led by Current Innovation NFP, a U.S.-based non-profit. The NSF Engine builds a strong ecosystem including core partners with representation from the manufacturing and energy sectors, national labs and universities (including public and private four-year institutions and two-year institutions), economic and workforce development organizations, entrepreneurship support organizations, non-profits, philanthropies and investment firms that are essential to the NSF Engine?s success. This diverse coalition of partners will be central to R&D, translation, and workforce development efforts.<br/><br/>The vision of the NSF Engine is to transform ?waste to wealth and health? in the context of water quality. Specifically, this means recovering energy, nutrients, freshwater, and critical minerals from water and wastewater for economic value and removing emerging contaminants such as PFAS? widely used chemicals that break down very slowly over time and have been linked to harmful health effects in human and animals?  from water to protect human health. The NSF Engine has three core functional areas: (1) Use-Inspired Research and Development (R&D); (2) Translations and Partnerships (Translation); and (3) Inclusive Ecosystems (Ecosystems), each of which inherently addresses one or more key barriers that must be overcome to realize the vision.<br/><br/>The Great Lakes Water Innovation Engine?s R&D and translation efforts will focus on the following challenges: Challenge 1 will lead to novel material platforms for efficient and selective separation of valuable resources and contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS) from wastewater and associated waste streams; Challenge 2 will result in emerging process technologies to advance recovery of energy and critical minerals from various water sources; and Challenge 3 will deliver sensors and sensor networks for real-time sensing, monitoring, and detection to support sustainable and economically viable processes needed in the first two challenges. Built on the NSF Engine?s strong and evolving partnerships across academia, government, and end users in industry and utilities, this NSF Engine aims to develop intelligent water resource recovery systems testbeds at multiple scales (bench, pilot, and full) to demonstrate, integrate, and deploy these novel technologies to support sustainable water-intensive industry that is growing in this region. The NSF Engine also aims to develop domestic supply chains for materials essential to growing industries like battery production and electrification.<br/><br/>Recognizing the relatively undefined and immature nature of the markets for water resource recovery and circular water economy technologies, the NSF Engine centers the workforce development efforts around training and education programs aimed at preparing future innovators, workers, and entrepreneurs in the emerging space of a circular water economy. The NSF Engine will leverage the Inclusive Ecosystem Work Group, which engages more than a dozen regional foundations, family offices, community organizations and nonprofits with workforce development and entrepreneurship investment priorities, as a governing body to create and implement a workforce development and STEM education strategy that aligns with the NSF Engine?s technical goals. Specific activities include developing new K-12 curriculum, pre-apprenticeships, apprenticeships, job/skills training programs, higher education curriculum, or other needs as the NSF Engine?s initial and continuous gap analysis concludes.<br/><br/>This NSF Engine brings together a strong coalition of partners and core functions that are in excellent alignment with regional assets and priorities. The leadership team has identified critical R&D topic areas and expertise to drive circular water innovations to support sustainable water-intensive manufacturing industry in the region. The innovation ecosystem built through this NSF Engine cultivates sustainable talent development and collective discoveries across critical partners, which creates connected pathways that translate innovation to impact in the circular water economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How do these traits influence the success of individuals in producing more offspring (i.e. increasing fitness)? These questions are fundamental to our understanding of biological diversity but remain poorly understood. This project aims to explicitly link genes, traits, and fitness in a group of colorful songbirds, called wood warblers. The researchers have previously identified candidate genes responsible for differences in coloration in the group, particularly those involving carotenoid molecules. This project will test how those genetic differences actually translate into differences in the enzymes that interact with carotenoid molecules. The project will also include a field study of birds that differ in their carotenoid coloration to study how different coloration traits influence reproduction. In addition, given that carotenoids must be obtained from the diet?i.e. birds cannot synthesize them on their own?the project includes undergraduate researchers using molecular tools to test hypotheses about the diet of birds from fecal samples. Finally, to help broaden participation in science, inspire students, and entice them to learn more about the natural world, the project will develop a set of virtually immersive evolutionary biology experiences focused on avian ecology and evolution.<br/><br/>The research project focuses on wood warblers (Parulidae), a family of birds with over 100 species that diversified within the last 10 million years, and which has one of the fastest diversification rates across songbirds. The goal of the project is to study the evolutionary history of genes?and their function?potentially involved in the diversification of this group. The focus of the current study is on carotenoid processing genes, specifically beta carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2). This gene has been implicated in plumage coloration in these and other birds, yet it has not been functionally characterized outside of domesticated species. The goal will be to characterize the carotenoids present across the radiation of warblers, and also synthesize the multiple BCO2 protein variants and test how they interact in vitro with different carotenoid substrates. The work includes a field study of hybridizing Vermivora warblers, which differ in their BCO2 genotypes, to test whether these have an influence on phenotypes. This will require a multi-generational pedigree of individuals within the hybrid zone. Recognizing the dietary dependence of carotenoids, the project engages undergraduate researchers in using molecular tools to analyze fecal samples from these birds in the hybrid zone. This allows for testing hypotheses about the birds' diets, shedding light on the intricate relationship between gene expression, traits, and other ecological factors. Finally, the work includes a partnership with Penn State?s Center for Immersive Experiences to generate a set of virtual reality experiences and 360-degree videos that will give high-school and undergraduate students in central Pennsylvania a sense of the type of field work, as well as teach them about the biology and genetics of hybridization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical vapor polymerization is a process where gas phase chemical species are reacted on surfaces to create thin polymer films. Although chemical vapor polymerization has been widely adopted by industry to create polymer coatings, e.g., for the microelectronics industry, the polymer coatings have been limited to flat films. This award supports fundamental research needed to expand the capabilities of chemical vapor polymerization to large-scale manufacturing of surface coatings with tailored nanoscopic structures, including end-attached nanofiber arrays or ?nanograsses?, quasi-two-dimensional networks of interconnected nanofibers or ?nanosheets?, and rigid end-attached nanofibers or ?bed-of-nanonails?. Potential applications for this next generation of nanostructured coatings include improved adhesives, biomedical sensors, biomaterials for growing replacement organs, and water filtration membranes. This collaborative project provides an outstanding context for the multidisciplinary training of graduate students in next-generation manufacturing processes. The project also integrates an initiative that is focused on the engagement of veteran students in advanced manufacturing research. <br/><br/>The scientific approach underlying this project is based on a convergence of ideas from two largely disconnected fields ? liquid crystals and chemical vapor polymerization. Specifically, thin films of liquid crystals supported on surfaces are used as dynamic molecular templates to guide the formation of polymeric nanostructures via chemical vapor polymerization. The latter process is achieved by thermal sublimation and pyrolysis of paracyclophanes, which subsequently polymerize into shape-controlled nanostructures templated by the liquid crystal films. The research elucidates the chemical and physical processes that control the formation of newly discovered polymeric morphologies, e.g., nanofiber sheets, that can be accessed at scale by chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystal films. Fundamental questions regarding the role of topological defects in liquid crystal-templated chemical vapor polymerization are investigated by using multiphase liquid crystal films containing dispersions of microparticles and immiscible oil droplets. Post-synthesis processes are also explored as an approach to achieving an expanded palette of nanostructures and functional properties, e.g., the synthesis of electrically conductive and morphologically tunable nanofiber arrays prepared via post-deposition pyrolysis. Other key aspects of the research revolve around the manufacturing of functional thin films with emergent photoluminescent, electrical, and transport properties. A unifying fundamental challenge underlying the approach is understanding how the information encoded in the atomic-scale structure, e.g., chirality, of reactive monomers is amplified across spatial scales by the liquid crystal during chemical vapor polymerization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The drag is known to increase when the relative velocity (correspondingly, the Reynolds number of the flow) increases, while many of the common drag reduction techniques are known to lose effectiveness with the increase in Reynolds number. This project will investigate the reasons for this loss of effectiveness and propose new strategies that may potentially overcome this limitation. In particular, a drag reduction mechanism in fluids flowing across a pipe that imparts a certain motion to the walls of the pipe will be considered. A hypothesis that specific parameters (such as frequency and wavelength) of such wall motions significantly influence the drag reduction will be investigated, via high-fidelity computational simulations across the range of Reynolds numbers. The project will also seek to improve the quality of education of fundamental mathematical and physical disciplines for the engineering students, via enhancing the course curriculum, engaging undergraduate students in research, and conducting outreach activities to underrepresented students across the metropolitan Phoenix area.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the hypothesis that the loss of performance of some common drag reduction mechanisms with increase in Reynolds number is associated with the increasing influence of large scales which may not be efficiently controlled by conventional drag reduction mechanisms. In particular, the traditional inner-scaled actuation and a less investigated outer-scaled actuation mechanisms will be compared and analyzed on an example of a turbulent pipe flow with streamwise traveling waves of transverse wall velocity as a drag reduction mechanism. Depending on the frequency and the wavelength of a traveling wave, different scales of motions in a turbulent flow will be actuated, and their role in drag reduction depending on the Reynolds number will be quantified. Additionally, a novel approach that targets small and large scales of flow simultaneously, termed a multi-scaled actuation, will be investigated. This new approach promises to overcome the limitations of previously explored methods, especially at high Reynolds number flows. Enhancing the capabilities to reduce skin friction drag at increased Reynolds numbers, approaching the target for realistic applications, will have a strong impact on the world economy, global energy usage, and emission reductions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues.

Additionally, bootcamp opportunities will transform motivated grad students and post-docs into future inventors of new analytical tools and functionalities, which will grow the community of morphologists working in digital environments.  MorphoCloud will make working with digital biological specimen data as routine as working with genomics data, so that biologists can focus on their scientific questions rather than get bogged down with complex workflows, technicalities, and limited resources.

Intrinsically meaningless speech sounds and letter shapes hit our eardrums or eyeballs, and, through a series of processing steps are turned into meaningful ideas in our heads. We can do this despite the fact that the linguistic input that we receive is not perfect; we understanding language in noisy environments, when faced with idiosyncratic factors such as accents, we can adjust to ambiguous words and structures, among many other factors. These challenges are not only due to uncertainty in the input; the human cognitive system has its own limitations, with lapses in attention or failures of memory impacting how we process language.  To remain successful and efficient in tasks of language processing despite this uncertainty, the human brain generates predictions about upcoming information based on the current context and/or prior knowledge. This project investigates this prediction, specifically focusing on the process of how we pick out the intended words - based on information like meaning, part of speech, and pronunciation, among a large set of competing words. Specifically, it looks at how the overall distribution of potential upcoming words - and specifically uncertainty about upcoming words - influences our ability to perceive and produce language, measuring this distribution at the level of an individual person with their own idiosyncratic experiences of the world. In terms of broader impacts, this project builds the language science community at Mississippi State University through the development of co-taught courses across different departments engaged in language science, and training students and faculty from across the university on how to use more advanced tools to answer a variety of questions about the nature of language processing. <br/><br/>To obtain a valid, sensitive and nuanced measure of uncertainty associated with upcoming linguistic material, the investigators measure ""information entropy"" for each research participant in specific sentential contexts. Information entropy reflects the uncertainty associated with the next word following a sentential context, and when measured for each participant for each context, it reflects uncertainty experienced by specific individuals in specific semantic domains, thereby providing a customized entropy measure for each individual. The investigators collect behavioral data, such as reading times, as well as brain data, such as ongoing brain activity commonly known and electroencephalogram or EEG, to assess how the human brain generates predictions about upcoming input. The investigators also measure other brain functions such as working memory span and attention control to examine how prediction generation interacts with those functions. The results of this project will advance our knowledge about the role of prediction when humans produce and comprehend language, and how those skills interact with other critical human brain functions such as working memory and attention. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Perception, Action and Cognition program, the Linguistics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MOFs are useful for a wide range of applications, from charge and ion transport, separations, gas- and solution-based sensing, catalysis, environmental remediation, and more. The formation of large-area separation membranes is especially significant for a range of gas separations, such as for CO2 removal from air or flue gas. Small-scale (1 cm2) MOF-based membranes have shown utility for a range of high-value separation applications. However, a lack of fundamental knowledge exists to create easily scalable, advanced manufacturing of large areas of MOF membranes that still preserve the lab-scale performance. This award supports a combination of x-ray probes, modeling, and experimental techniques to fully understand how MOF thin films form. This fundamental knowledge is used to develop a continuous, roll-to-roll coating technique that can create large-area MOF thin films with outstanding separation performance. Students are engaged to contribute to the development of new MOF crystallization theories and modeling tools that can be used in research as well as industrial environments. The project endeavors to train students, particularly from underrepresented minority backgrounds, to become successful chemical engineers and material scientists. <br/><br/>Large area, scalable thin-film MOF formation required for low-resistance, low-cost separations is difficult to achieve due to limited know-how on controlling solution chemistry for precision synthesis of MOF thin films using a scalable solution coating process. This project uses an integrated approach involving in-situ experimentation, modeling, and separation measurements to obtain fundamental manufacturing research on MOF thin film formation using scalable coating techniques, such as flow coating, or the recently developed percolation-assisted coating (PAC) method. Rapid timescale, in-situ x-ray scattering measurements coupled with microkinetic modeling are used to understand thin film MOF nucleation and growth mechanisms under evaporative/pervaporation conditions. The microkinetic model simulates billions of oligomerization reactions to predict nucleation rate, growth rate, and size distribution. The microkinetic model helps in selecting a range of operating conditions for high throughput (HT) PAC experiments for the optimization of MOF thin film structure and maximizing performance. By connecting it to a gas chromatograph, the HT setup is also used to obtain gas separation factors for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 mixtures. The ensuing process-structure-property relationships guide the scaling of the PAC method to grow 50 cm2  MOF films, followed by a model-based design of a roll-to-roll coating system for large-scale manufacturing of MOF films.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most professional societies grapple with issues related to lack of representation and inclusion of members of demographic groups that have historically been underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and career paths. One among these professional societies includes the Society for the Advancement in Biology Education Research (SABER), a leading premier international society with a primary focus on undergraduate biology education research. Scholarship related to this organization impacts every undergraduate biology learning environment. Additionally, members of this organization are also members of other professional societies, which makes SABER a critical lever for advancing systemic changes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion across various biology sub-fields and thus, helping to exert a larger impact on undergraduate biology education. <br/><br/>SABER since its inception and as exemplified by a self-study in 2019, has struggled with issues of diversity and representation at every level of its organizational structure, including key leadership positions. This aspect directly impacts the culture and climate of this society which ultimately affects the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts related to undergraduate biology education. Despite significant changes in its organizational structure, a concerted effort is needed to institute a permanent change related to equity and inclusion. This project aims to enact sustainable change by including diverse perspectives and voices to fundamentally change the culture of the organization and implement initiatives that promote an environment to enable cultural change. The goals of this project are as follows: (1) broadly and systematically advertise and recruit for SABER to broaden its reach to organizations, institutions, and individuals who are not currently aware of SABER, (2) offer travel support for individuals that are members of groups typically underrepresented in biology or who work at historically black colleges and universities and other minority serving institutions to attend the national meeting, (3) offer mentorship related to inclusion to individuals in leadership positions at SABER, and (4) develop networking, mentoring, and leadership opportunities to sustain the involvement of diverse members within SABER. We posit that increasing the number and including the perspectives of underrepresented scientists within SABER will enable a shift in the culture of this society to help advance inclusion by (1) creating welcoming spaces that foster an enhanced sense of belonging and professional growth of diverse individuals, (2) creating a supportive environment for members by developing and empowering environmental stewards within the SABER leadership and by offering them travel support and mentoring activities, and (3) introducing structural changes that will ultimately affect the culture and climate of SABER as an organization to create pathways that diversify the society?s leadership for diverse individuals. Finally, as members of SABER are members of other sub-fields of biology, these efforts will directly impact other professional societies in their efforts to becoming inclusive.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This frameshifting in translating the mRNA triplet code has been found to be preprogrammed in viruses and human cells to modify the expression of gene products and to regulate biochemical processes. This study aims to computationally predict and experimentally test how introducing mutations to mRNA affects its three-dimensional structure and, consequently, programmed frameshifting in prototypical viral genomes. Revealing the specific structural and sequence requirements for frameshifting in prototype viruses will facilitate the design of novel efficient frameshifting elements, with potential applications to viral packaging of genes. This project will provide interdisciplinary training to students in mathematics, computer science, biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering, with particular emphasis on enhancing minority participation in STEM activities. Public outreach efforts will be included to reach general audiences and highlight the intersection of mathematics, biology, computing, and biotechnologies that have implications in human health.<br/> <br/>Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a widespread mechanism for modifying the gene expressed by altering the mRNA triplet-nucleotide transcript to generate an alternate gene product. Indispensable to many viruses including HIV and SARS-associated coronaviruses for translating overlapping mRNA reading frames, PRF is also a mechanism in endogenous human, eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. Because PRF has been shown to dramatically influence viral viability or the biochemical regulation of human processes, the modulation of frameshifting defines a platform for engineering gene expression. However, the complex aspects of frameshifting and the structural plasticity of the RNA frameshifting element (FSE) must be understood before engineering and therapeutic strategies can succeed. In this synergistic biological, chemical, mathematical, and computational research program, graph-theory-based tools will be developed to predict FSE mutations for prototype viral systems aimed at substantially lowering frameshifting efficiency as a novel biotechnological strategy against viral infections and related human diseases associated with PRF. The effect of these mutations will be assessed by Luciferase assay measurements, and the resulting FSE structural landscapes analyzed by techniques suitable for RNAs with multiple conformations. Besides an improved understanding of the mechanisms of frameshifting and computational tools for predicting FSE-landscape-altering mutations, this project will produce new biotechnological, RNA modifying tools as potential therapeutic agents against RNA viruses or applicable to human and other genes that employ frameshifting. Applications to viral packaging/drug delivery also arise, as frameshifting is a compact mechanism to store gene coding information and can be exploited to overcome genomic size limitations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Chemistry (CHE), the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS), and the Division of Physics (PHY) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The utilization of nanostructured materials, however, is limited by their poor thermal stability against grain coarsening and defect annihilation, as well as difficulties of the scale-up of existing synthesis techniques and their integration into modern manufacturing processes. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) International Multilateral Partnerships for Resilient Education and Science System in Ukraine (IMPRESS-U) award supports the exploration of a novel non-contact approach to surface nanostructuring based on a simultaneous generation of a high density of crystal defects by short pulse laser processing and stabilization of these defects through the laser-assisted nanoalloying. The goal of this project is to provide a proof of concept for the feasibility of a nimble laser-assisted defect engineering and stabilization, pushing forward the frontiers of the laser processing technologies. The project benefits from the complementary expertise and existing research links between the members of the international research team from the United States, Lithuania, and Ukraine. One of the major goals of the project is to establish a long-term sustainable collaboration fully integrating Ukrainian researchers into the global research community. Mutual visits, exchange of research expertise, and educational activities create a fertile ground for the emergence of a new area of research strength at the Lviv Polytechnic National University. In particular, the best practices of a well-established Center of Laser Technologies in Vilnius, Lithuania are adopted by the research center emerging at Lviv Polytechnic. Leveraging computational expertise at the University of Virginia grounds investigations at the Ukrainian research center on solid fundamental understanding of processes underlying material modifications from short pulse laser processing.<br/><br/>The challenge of revealing and untangling the intertwined processes responsible for the generation of various crystal defects in laser nanostructuring is addressed in this project by combining large-scale atomistic modeling of laser-induced structural and phase transformations, advanced large-area non-ablative laser processing using a novel setup for nanoalloying, and nanoscale characterization of the laser-modified surfaces. The stabilization of laser-generated highly nonequilibrium defect structures through nanoalloying is achieved by adding alloying elements that preferentially segregate to grain boundaries and other defects, thus reducing the free energy of nanocrystalline structures and acting as obstacles for defect migration. The fundamental mechanisms responsible for the generation of crystal defects at a rapidly advancing crystallization front and their stabilization through nanoalloying is systematically investigated in atomistic simulations. The conditions of the simulations are mapped to those realized in laser processing, and the computational predictions are verified in a detailed experimental characterization of surface regions modified by short pulse laser irradiation. The direct mapping of the computational predictions to the results of nanoscale characterization of laser modified surfaces guides the exploration of the multidimensional space of laser processing parameters and enables the verification and refinement of the model assumptions. Several strategies for expanding the range of irradiation conditions leading to nanocrystallization are explored, including suppression of subsurface cavitation and spallation by performing laser processing in a liquid environment and under confinement by a transparent solid overlayer. The effect of alloying/compositional gradients on the solidification kinetics and final nanostructure are systematically investigated for different target configurations in simulations and experiments.<br/><br/>This EAGER: IMPRESS-U project is jointly funded by NSF, Research Council of Lithuania, US National Academies of Sciences, and Office of Naval Research Global (DoD).

The Southwest (SW) region of the U.S. is changing rapidly, and like many regions around the world, is experiencing increasingly harsh climate conditions?with wide-ranging impacts, from extreme weather events that damage infrastructure and pose serious health risks to increasing water and energy insecurity that threaten economic prosperity. The SW region comprising Utah, Nevada, and Arizona is especially vulnerable due to extreme aridity and heat coupled with rapid population growth (the 2020 U.S. Census shows that Utah, Nevada, and Arizona are first, fourth, and fifth, respectively, for population growth during the period from 2010 to 2020). In fact, as rapid growth increasingly conflicts with severe water shortages, the economic development of the SW is reaching a critical threshold. For example, Phoenix presently experiences temperatures approaching 115 degrees Fahrenheit, and like surrounding cities, is frequently impacted by extreme weather, drought, and wildfires. Within the next 10 years, temperatures will rise to more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit and drought conditions will be more severe. Such conditions if unabated will threaten the vitality, livability, and economic future of the SW. <br/><br/>In addition to its focus on technical innovations, the NSF Engine will also focus on sustainability innovations in policy and governance. If successful, the NSF Engine will transform the SW region into a national innovation hub, leading not only to positive climate impacts, but also to high wage jobs, economic growth, and technology-based startups and venture capital investments. In pursuit of this vision, the NSF Engine will (1) serve as catalyst to connect and institutionalize a distributed regional sustainability innovation ecosystem ? industry, researchers, innovators, investors, decision-makers, and community leaders; (2) incentivize co-innovations in technology and governance to overcome limitations to community and economic development and facilitate just and equitable water and energy futures; (3) expand infrastructure and capacity for inclusive knowledge translation through startups and intellectual property   licensing, enabling continued and sustainable economic and population growth; and (4) prepare a diverse and highly skilled sustainability innovation workforce that creates new businesses, meets the needs of existing employers, and provides inclusive access to high-wage STEM jobs by leveraging innovations in education and training at scale.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has a region of service spanning three states?Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. The scale of the challenges in the American southwest demands a coordinated approach across state boundaries. The collapse of the Colorado River water allocations and the failing energy grid system are prime examples of traditional uncoordinated approaches. The NSF Engine aims to cross disciplinary and sector boundaries to bring teams of engineers and physical scientists together with experts in policy and governance to co-innovate technology, as well as new regulatory, policy, governance, and market-based approaches for implementing technology across cities and states. The NSF Engine has an extensive network of core partners and regional stakeholders, spanning for-profit industry, entrepreneurs, state and local government, and workforce and economic development partners, with mature ties to active water-energy-carbon co-innovation, translation of innovation to practice, workforce development, and community and economic growth.<br/><br/>Informed by the current state of practice and major gaps identified by the regional ecosystem of partners, the NSF Engine will focus on three strategic priorities during the first two years of the award period?renewable energy, water capture and recycling, and carbon capture. To ensure solutions that collectively address technical, governance and policy, market, and industry demands, the NSF Engine?s organizational structure includes a governing board, external advisory board, and interrelated working groups, comprising an extensive network of public and private partners. In addition to a slate of projects already identified and ready for investment, new use-inspired R&D and translation projects will be supported through grant competitions.<br/><br/>With respect to translation of innovations to practice, the Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine?s overarching goal focuses on expanding inclusive and rapid access to knowledge translation, getting technology and governance innovations rapidly to market and practice, and connecting currently distributed resources, expertise, and programs for translation into a community of practice. To achieve its goal, the NSF Engine will support several interrelated translation support efforts: (1) translation training?the Engine will develop and facility training in translation for participants in co-innovation R&D; (2) incubators and tech transfer hubs?the Engine will formalize partnerships with Incubators to support startup formation from both university- and community-based Engine R&D and innovations; (3) venture capital (VC)?the NSF Engine will develop pathways to access VC investments in year one, through existing partners such as StartupNV and university-based funds; starting in year two, the NSF Engine will host investor pitch events bi-annually; and (4) Communities of practice?the NSF Engine will extend collaborative communities of practice to build relationships and align programs across currently decentralized networks to accelerate translation opportunities.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has engaged state and local economic and workforce development organizations, industry, and community and technical colleges that will help address workforce gaps with a portfolio of entrepreneurship, career technical, and upskilling workforce programs aligned with NSF Engine partners and designed specifically to be inclusive of underserved populations to build generational wealth in historically excluded communities. Specific activities will focus on sustainability innovation education for K-12 students; leveraging sustainability innovation career discovery technology platforms that connect jobseekers to education partners, certificate programs, and fast-track training to build skills needed to advance careers; the creation of the Sustainability Entrepreneurship and Innovations Certificate program, which will prepare budding entrepreneurs to accelerate ideas through startup methods focused on innovations in carbon capture and water and energy security; supporting entrepreneurs via executive-level internships; and developing a full pipeline of workers via technical and university pathways.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has brought together a strong coalition of partners and stakeholders and has demonstrated a strong alignment with regional assets, investments, and priorities. The NSF Engine has identified critical R&D topic areas that must be advanced to drive sustainability innovations in water-energy-carbon co-innovation. It will support R&D, translation of innovation, and workforce development activities to cultivate a thriving regional innovation ecosystem of tech companies, researchers, innovators, investors, decision-makers, and community and industry leaders, that will transform the southwest into a national hub for innovation. The Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine will drive economic growth through job creation and training opportunities in the sustainability sector, particularly for historically underserved and/or rural communities, across the southwest region of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Importantly, RNAs can now be readily identified that bind virtually any other biomolecule of interest and display unique functions, including enabling the catalysis of chemical reactions, fluorescence, and more. But there is a major challenge obstructing progress ? RNA structure is incredibly sensitive to the local environment. Current strategies to identify functional RNAs almost universally proceed in test tubes, mostly yielding functional RNAs that also work well only in a test tube and unfortunately fail when translated into biological environments. This project seeks to deliver and optimize a new platform that will enable rapid and robust identification of functional RNAs directly in the mammalian cellular environment. The approach involves application of next-generation strategies to attain laboratory-timescale RNA evolution in cells, enabling efficient selection for desired RNA functions. Because the novel RNAs are identified within cellular milieus to begin with, they will consistently function in biological settings ? unlike functional RNAs discovered using current test tube-based methods. Alongside this progress, the project will provide opportunities for PhD student training as well as enable substantive expansion of an ongoing, successful high school internship program.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis of this work is that in-cell based directed evolution can solve the environment-sensitive folding and structure challenge that has hamstrung the functional RNA field. The research aims to deliver a bespoke, custom-designed mammalian phage-assisted continuous evolution system to enable the robust and efficient identification of mammalian cell-functional RNA aptamers, allosteric activators, and glue RNAs. The selection couples developed will be highly modular and generally useful for anyone in the field to evolve functional RNAs of interests. The resulting RNA-mPACE platform is intended to deliver ease-of-use, strategies to support parallelization, scaling, and speed of directed evolution campaigns, and methods to specifically target mutagenesis to the gene encoding the RNA of interest to further accelerate functional RNA development. Successful execution of this research will enable the enormous potential of functional RNAs in biology to finally be unleashed. For research applications, it will become far more feasible to modulate the activity of any biomolecule of interest. For medical applications, RNAs could become a preferred modality for all types of targets. Key fundamental insights will also become accessible, especially related to how cellular environments shape RNA structure-function landscapes.<br/><br/>This work is jointly supported by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Systems and Synthetic Biology cluster in MCB.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The impacts included major damage to the surrounding region and a number of hurricane-related deaths. The city of Wilmington, NC entirely was cut off by historic flooding from the Cape Fear River. The dense population and development along its coastline continues to leave South Carolina communities highly vulnerable to coastal flooding from these seasonal hurricane events. The major causes of hurricane-related flooding events are the coastal storm surge caused by extreme winds and/or the occurrence of concentrated and extreme precipitation within vulnerable, flood prone areas. During flooding events, perishable data, such as high-water marks, are potential evidence of the highest water levels during a flood and they provide valuable data for understanding extreme flood events. In this study, valuable information will be obtained from such perishable data through field visits. <br/><br/>The overall objective of this research project is to visit the locations of coastal flooding to investigate (a) the reliability of the weather forecast in terms of different spatio-temporal scales for extreme rainfalls, and (b) the joint probability of extreme rainfall and storm surge to gain insight into an increase in flood risk under hurricane scenarios. This research projects aims to amass data with which stakeholders can improve their current design standards for future flooding preparedness. The PI also expects (c) to utilize observed and collected perishable data in developing a statistical modeling framework both to generate spatial risk maps and to identify critical vulnerabilities of important coastal infrastructure regarding compound events. Such information is critical for maintaining coastal infrastructure networks and for providing alerts during extreme events. This research project will advance knowledge about the influence of extreme rainfall and storm surge on coastal flooding as well as the potential impact of such events on environmental sustainability. By documenting perishable data, the research project provides an excellent opportunity to study the compounding effect of two extreme weather events at multiple locations and to estimate the return period for such events with respect to historical periods. The research results will be used to develop strategies for improving awareness about compound extreme events amongst stakeholders to minimize flooding impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project proposes and tests a model of the interdependence between stress, cognition, changes in the abundance of resources, and group decision-making. The model contributes to the science of group decision-making by investigating how stress (biology) and resources (the environment) impact how groups make decisions. The model seeks to explain why some groups of diverse people coalesce and effectively manage shared resources in uncertain environments, while others fail. The results of the project inform decision-makers faced with complex challenges related to climate variability, public health, and defense by building tools for diverse teams to cultivate systems thinking, manage shared resources, and improve cooperation over time. The project also broadens participation in online education and systems thinking skills.<br/><br/>This project develops and tests an embedded Model of Adaptive Capacity (eACM). The eACM proposes that the capacity of groups to continually solve complex problems depends on the ability of individuals to cognize key challenges in a resource system and to converge on joint solutions to those challenges. The eACM couples resource dynamics with individual variation in mind-body systems through the process of group sensemaking. Sensemaking occurs when groups create an understanding of their environment and form joint plans of action for cooperation. The project tests the eACM through behavioral experiments and manipulation of stress. Formal models of the systems dynamics of group decision-making aid in generalizing the results of the experiments.

This process requires exquisite control of gene expression. Enhancers are the primary units of gene control in mammals and often activate genes across vast genomic distances, thus, an understanding of 3D genome structure is needed to understand the action of enhancers.  This project will investigate the regulation of 3D genome structure through the study of protein-mediated loops and domains termed Topologically Associating Domains (TADs).  A major focus will be to integrate the proposed research into a class that the investigator teaches, in which students will build their own microscopes and study DNA looping.  Outreach efforts to high school students and undergraduates with a focus on promoting the full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities will also be conducted. Additionally, the technological developments pioneered by this proposal will be openly shared with the scientific community. <br/><br/>An understanding of dynamic genome topology is needed for understanding the regulation of gene expression.  At the 3D genome scale relevant to enhancers, the proteins CTCF and cohesin fold mammalian genomes into loops and domains termed Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). Cohesin extrudes loops until it is blocked by CTCF, which then holds together a TAD. To better understand TADs, the proposed work will visualize TADs and CTCF loops directly in living cells and quantify their dynamics, loop lifetime, and looped fraction. An integrated approach that combines genome-editing, perturbation experiments, super-resolution live-cell imaging of CTCF/cohesin loops, 3D genomics, and integrative 3D polymer modeling will be used to address three key mechanistic questions related to the formation and regulation of TADs and loops. The investigators will explore how adjacent TADs form nested structures and higher-order interactions; how cohesin abundance and residence time controls TAD and loop formation and whether active transcription regulates TADs and loops positively or negatively.  These measurements will provide quantitative and mechanistic information on TAD and loop formation in living cells, which will improve current understanding of 3D genome architecture and associated modulation during gene expression.<br/><br/>This award is funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, wearable devices such as physical activity trackers, continuous glucose monitors and ambulatory blood pressure monitors are worn concurrently to provide measurements of distinct subjects? characteristics. There is enormous potential in integrating that concurrent information from the distinct vantages to better understand between-view associations and improve prediction of health outcomes. Existing tools for data integration are sensitive to outliers, and are not designed for mixed data types (e.g. continuous skewed glucose measurements, zero-inflated activity counts, binary indicators of sleep/wake). The PI will develop a more robust framework for multi-view data integration that is better able to account for outliers, better match the mixed types of data actually collected, and be more accurate in separating common from view-specific signals. The new methods will be implemented in open-source software accompanied by reproducible workflow examples, providing immediate and easy access for other researchers. The educational component centers on the development of structured research experiences (SRE) for students. SRE enhances students written communication, software development and reproducible research skills, all of which are lacking in traditional curriculum. This will improve students? preparation for conducting research, and widen their STEM employment opportunities. The involvement of students from traditionally underrepresented groups will positively impact their retention rate and will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>Popular dimension reduction methods, such as principal component analysis and discriminant analysis, are tailored for single-view data, and thus fail to discover coordinated multi-view signals on a global level. On the other hand, existing multi-view dimension reduction methods suffer from reliance on the Gaussianity assumption, an inability to capture joint functional signals, and a lack of theoretical guarantees. The PI will address these drawbacks by (i) developing a joint dimension reduction framework for skewed continuous, binary and zero-inflated view types; (ii) a joint dimension reduction framework for mixed functional multi-view data and (iii) a new paradigm for simultaneous extraction of signals across views based on hierarchical low-rank constraints.  This work will lead to critically needed new statistical methods for data integration with direct relevance for researchers working with wearable monitors, microbiome and multi-omics data through interdisciplinary collaborations of the PI. The proposed structured research experiences will center on the design and reproducibility of simulations studies, and align with computational components of the proposed research, including direct students? involvement in multiple simulation studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use dental plaque collected from healthy donors and test how it may be used in oral microbiome transplantation ? that is, the movement of bacteria from the mouth of a healthy donor to someone who struggles with oral issues such as dental decay (caries) or gum disease (periodontal disease). Specifically, this project will test the introduction of different mixtures of beneficial microbes into the mouth of people with different diets, lifestyles, or diseases. The development of this technology will also support the career development of a woman faculty member-entrepreneur who will build a company. She will use her experiences to educate the public and other women who are interested in building their own companies. As a result, this project builds the foundation for development of a new technology that can be commercialized for the dentist?s office or for an at-home treatment to prevent dental decay and periodontal disease. <br/><br/>This project will develop a new technology to improve oral health. Dental decay and periodontal disease are two of the most chronic diseases experienced globally. New technologies are needed to prevent and treat oral disease, especially treatments that help develop healthy microorganisms in the mouth. This project generates basic information on how donated dental plaque ? with thousands of oral microbes ? can be transplanted into someone who needs them to improve health. This research will examine how successful these microbial transplantations are in people who eat different foods, live different lifestyles, or suffer from different diseases. This research employs a new 3D printed system that can grow, propagate, and compete microorganisms from dental plaque in the laboratory to examine this problem. The project will inform how to match the correct donor to the right recipient and determine which microbes are best to transplant using a reproducible system in the laboratory.

The invention of lithium-ion batteries has been paradigm-shifting, finding widespread applications in mobile phones, laptops, electric vehicles, and more. However, the continuous development and improvement of battery technologies is currently facing major challenges, as existing battery chemistries are limited in energy density and safety. The fundamental factors determining such limits are still not well understood. The project will bridge this knowledge gap by using a set of tools to probe the internal processes occurring at anode-electrolyte interfaces. The project will focus on the early stages of the battery cycling process and determine the interfacial electrolyte and passivation layer structure. The insights gained from this project will serve as guiding principles to design novel electrolytes for safer, more powerful, and more durable batteries. Education activities of this project, in synergy with the research efforts, are focused on disseminating knowledge on surface/interface science and renewable energy to the scientific community and the general public, especially underrepresented minorities, through hands-on instrument training, scientific demonstration, mentoring, and teaching. These efforts will strengthen the materials characterization capabilities in the research community, raise the awareness and stimulate interest in clean energy and STEM among K-12 students as well as the general public, and enhance the knowledge of electrochemistry and renewable energy among undergraduate students. In the long term, the research and education activities combined will foster a diverse population of qualified individuals to work in STEM and the energy sector.<br/><br/>In lithium-ion batteries, a critical component is the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is formed at the anode-electrolyte interface during early battery cycles. While significant efforts in the research community have been devoted to characterizing the structure and composition of fully-grown SEIs, their dynamic nucleation and growth process and the underlying mechanism remain largely elusive, which is a major bottleneck preventing the predictive design of electrolytes and SEIs for targeted battery applications. The project will study how the structure of solvation layers (also called electrical double layers) at the anode-electrolyte interface plays a dominant role in the SEI nucleation and growth processes. The project will determine the structure and dynamic evolution processes of the electric double layer (EDL) and SEI by combining in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical 3D atomic force microscopy (recently developed in the PI?s lab), ex situ methods, and atomistic simulations. One outcome of the project will be a quantified electrolyte-EDL-SEI correlation. Specific objectives include: (I) determining the EDL structure at pristine graphite (anode) surface, (II) unraveling initial SEI nucleation and correlation with EDL, and (III) deciphering the mature SEI structure and its formation mechanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project contains three thrusts, listed from the most well-defined to the most exploratory.  The first thrust involves analyzing genomic data in order to investigate tumor evolution trees that lead to the development of cancer.  The second involves analyzing faulty data generated by computer networks while utilizing information about the network such as its topology and delay pattern.  The third is exploring other areas for which the techniques developed for the first two thrusts apply, making progress towards the goal of developing general techniques for analyzing faulty data in the absence of a known ground truth using domain information.<br/><br/>In the model that this project assumes, the input contains errors that have been probabilistically generated according to a known distribution in unknown locations.  The goal that the investigator would like to explore is the creation of sampling techniques that do not blindly take random samples from the prohibitively large space for the ground truth; rather, it is to use the knowledge about restrictions that limit the possible space that could have led to the noisy input and analyze this much smaller space.  In particular, the first focus of this project is to explore how such information can be used to generate efficient sampling techniques in order to infer properties of tumor progression trees, and, later on, more general phylogenetic trees.  Later parts of this project involve applying this knowledge to routing graphs and other data with underlying well-structured graphs.  Since such techniques rely on graph-theoretic assumptions underlying the inputs, the goal for all three thrusts is to develop widely applicable probabilistic techniques that will help one analyze noisy graph information in general, pushing existing theoretical knowledge forward, as well as bringing a better understanding to applied areas with strong theoretical underpinnings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop, test, and publish a collection of Core Concept Teaching Tools (CCTTs) that teach students how to transfer their knowledge of biology core concepts across scales and sub-disciplines to understand novel and complex biological phenomena. The Vision and Change (V&C) report (AAAS, 2011) identified five core concepts in biology and called on undergraduate biology instructors to use these concepts to connect their teaching and their students? learning across biological scales and subdisciplines. The report highlighted the need to prepare undergraduate biology students to contribute to emerging interdisciplinary fields that address complex problems by building their ability to make connections across seemingly disparate pieces of information, concepts, and questions. However, currently available instructional tools primarily focus on teaching core concepts in sub-disciplinary contexts. The CCTTs developed as part of this project will address the need for instructional tools that teach students to transfer core concept knowledge across scales and subdisciplines.<br/><br/>The project will bring biology educators with expertise across scales and sub-disciplines together to participate in faculty learning communities to develop, test, and publish a collection of CCTTs in CourseSource. Each CCTT will begin with a brief narrative describing a complex biological phenomenon. The activities and questions following the narrative will be constructed using Branchaw and Cary?s Conceptual Elements Framework (2017) to guide students through the process of recognizing the core concept elements in the narrative, recalling what they have already learned about those core concept elements, and applying their prior knowledge to understand the novel phenomenon described in the narrative. Approximately 45 CCTTs will be developed, and pilot tested at diverse institutions across the nation, before they are published in CourseSource. Instructors will be able to search the CourseSource database for CCTTs by subdisciplines, core concepts, and conceptual elements, and download them for free.

However, in practice, human demonstrations can be inadequate, partial, imperfect, environment-specific, or suboptimal. To address these challenges, this project introduces a novel framework that allows formal specifications to guide the data-driven learning process of IL. The project?s novelties are new theories and algorithms for combining formal specifications of different forms with data in imitation learning. The project's impacts are manifold, including overcoming the over-reliance on data in current IL approaches, improving their performance and robustness, and catalyzing new cross-disciplinary research at the intersection of machine learning and formal methods. With strong institutional support, the project is providing outreach opportunities to K-12 students from disadvantaged backgrounds, broadening the participation of women and minorities in STEM research, and helping inspire younger generations to pursue a college degree or a future career in engineering.<br/><br/>The central idea behind this project is that expert inputs need not be limited to demonstrations. For instance, it can be more natural and economical for an expert to specify safety properties that the learned policy must satisfy, instead of showing the many different ways that the system can fail (imagine crashing an expensive vehicle hundreds of times just to generate these ""negative examples""). In addition to offering complementary information, specifications can also provide structures to the learning process and improve the overall learning outcomes. For example, automata-based rewards are much more suitable for modeling temporally extended tasks than Markovian rewards. This project is exploring the synergies between data and formal specifications in a unified learning framework, and has the potential to transform how we develop AI systems in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These programs will profoundly impact human health, climate targets, energy supplies, food security, agriculture, supply chain resilience, and national security. Incomplete understanding of the reasons for poor synthetic program robustness and lack of reliability, and an inability to predict the emergent behavior of biosystem interactions, are great engineering challenges. Such incomplete understanding is due to complex biological interactions at multiple structural and temporal scales, as well as nonlinearities, stochasticity, non-modularity, and measurement difficulties when organisms are alive. Consequently, synthetic programs often have unintended behaviors and limited functionality. To increase program functionality, this project will investigate adding new control programs that are external to the biology, a ""cyber-biological system."" Output biological protein and molecule production will be regulated via external sensing, computation, and actuation. This project will also encourage early enthusiasm in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by adding blood clotting concepts to a popular game with high female play. Gains in bioengineering stimulation and engagement over baseline will be assessed.<br/><br/>The state-of-the-art in cyber-biological control is to overcome biological complexity when testing new program function by restricting program use to single celled model organisms, single triggers to a biological cascade, or a single environment condition, often with a single disturbance.

Thus, this project will: (1) establish the control of safety-critical biological systems with characteristic nonlinearities; (2) extend powerful and pervasive linear feedback control design methods for use with nonlinear biochemical dynamics; and (3) compensate for innate biological stochasticity. These aims will respectively address knowledge gaps in control, analysis, and diagnostics. Nonlinear control advances will apply to nonnegative systems beyond biology such as manufacturing plants, thermodynamics, air traffic flow, multi-agent communication, network congestion, filtering, sampled data, and economics.

Nonvolatile electronic memories have a rich history, and they can be broadly categorized into three primary groups: phase change material (PCM), memristor, and ferroelectric memory, operating through thermal-induced atomic restructuring, current-driven ionic dynamics, and electric field-oriented polarization, respectively. Over the past half-century, electronic memory technologies have witnessed significant growth, achieving a high level of maturity in terms of scalability, endurance, and CMOS integration. Being able to perform uniform phase transitions over a subwavelength scale makes PCMs particularly suitable for photonic applications. For switching between amorphous and crystalline states, the chalcogenide PCMs are brought to a melting temperature to break the covalent bonds. The cooling rate determines the final state. The high melting temperature sets the upper limit of clock rate, integration density, and the device lifetime. The proposed works will explore alternative optical reversible tuning mechanisms, address a few myths and challenges in the new material platform, and locate proper photonic memory device schematics. The CAREER project will be carried out by graduates, with the involvement of undergraduates and high school interns. Through local society-organized summer camps, our undergraduate and high school interns will share their initiatives and motivations for choosing STEM with the younger generations. The proposed projects bridge the fields of layered material physics, semiconductor manufacturing, and photonic technologies, and strengthen multidisciplinary education among quantum mechanics, nanofabrication, optoelectronics, and photonic system engineering.<br/><br/>The proposed work explores melting-free mechanisms in layered chalcogenide materials for nonvolatile tuning and switching in integrated photonics, enabled by the unique atomic structures in these materials.

To protect individual privacy, many organizations, both from the public and private sectors, have adopted differential privacy as a rigorous privacy measure. However, recent deployments of differential privacy have revealed key research gaps. First, much of the existing theoretical work in differential privacy focuses on worst-case analyses, which often lead to overly pessimistic results and fail to inform algorithm design in practice. Despite recent advancements, differentially private algorithms for machine learning and data sharing are still not widely adopted technologies. Lastly, the lack of comprehensive tools for privacy risk assessment makes it difficult for practitioners to evaluate the effectiveness of differential privacy and to determine appropriate privacy risk parameters.   This project aims to address these challenges in differential privacy by expanding the repertoire of privacy-preserving algorithms and developing auditing mechanisms to assess the privacy protection these algorithms provide.<br/><br/>The research focuses on two fundamental and closely related problems: private learning and private synthetic data. In private learning, the goal is to learn accurate machine learning models using sensitive data with differential privacy guarantees. In private synthetic data, the goal is to differentially privately generate a synthetic dataset that preserves important statistical trends of the sensitive dataset. The project advances the frontiers of these two problems with three research thrusts. The first thrust develops a theoretical framework that goes beyond pessimistic worst-case analyses to better capture practical scenarios and guide algorithm design. The second thrust designs practical algorithms that are informed by theoretical principles and empirical structures of the problems in practice. The third focuses on privacy attacks and auditing mechanisms that evaluate the privacy risks of learning and synthetic data algorithms.

While much of the previous research on this topic has looked at language outcomes at the sentence level, this project aims to better understand the effects of late first language acquisition by looking below the sentence and word levels at how signers process the smallest pieces of language that make up signs/words. This work is necessary for a more complete understanding of the effects of late first language acquisition and better insight into how the human brain processes language more broadly. Practically, this work helps those who work with deaf individuals, like speech language pathologists and educators, to better understand how late first language signers process the linguistic pieces that make up language. <br/><br/>In this dissertation, participants are deaf signers who acquired a sign language at a variety of ages, from early in childhood to late in adolescence.

Study 2 investigates how the signers perceive the manual forms of sign language through similarity judgments.

However, in the post-Moore?s Law era, the limitations of semiconductor fabrication, combined with the continuous growth of data sizes, have hindered further progress. Simultaneously, the rapid evolution of quantum computing has ushered in a new era, holding immense potential. This has sparked interest in quantum-based data science and learning, with the anticipation that certain systems could provide a quantum speedup. This project will harness the multi-disciplinary expertise from our NSF TRIPODS collaboration to develop noise-aware and resilient quantum learning systems. This project bridges the gap between research communities in traditional data science and quantum computing, thereby introducing classical data science researchers to the opportunities in quantum data science (QuanDS). Furthermore, this project will contribute to developing a skilled workforce, well-versed in cutting-edge AI and equipped to navigate the unique challenges of this emerging field in QuanDS.<br/><br/>This project develops a quantum learning system using a data-driven approach that integrates static-dynamic combined circuit analysis. This method combines static metrics with the inherent dynamic noises of quantum systems by developing a set of noise-involved evaluation metrics, such as circuit sensitivity indicator. A topology-aware resilient circuit transpilation mechanism tailored to quantum learning will then be developed to optimize the execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era hardware under quantum noise. Additionally, the project provides a holistic analysis of the vulnerability in distributed quantum learning by reasoning the strategic behavior of the attacker to quantum computing nodes, and devises resilient learning countermeasures in the distributed quantum-classical learning paradigm. Furthermore, it develops educational modules in quantum control systems combined with resilient quantum learning techniques. The comprehensive outreach activities will be developed to integrate QuanDS research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this requires the construction of large-scale energy infrastructure that can be energy- and cost-intensive during manufacturing and decommissioning. In particular, there are critical sustainability challenges in the manufacturing and recycling of wind turbine blades. These challenges originate from the permanent nature of the fiber-reinforced thermoset polymer composites that underlie the structure of wind turbine blades. This CiviL Infrastructure research for climate change Mitigation and Adaptation (CLIMA) award supports fundamental research that accelerates the discovery of a new family of polymers, Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs), and their composites that are mechanically strong yet reversible to enable recycling, repairing, and reprocessing. Knowledge to be obtained from this project facilitates cost-effective manufacturing and recycling of wind turbine blades, thereby improving the competitiveness and sustainability of wind energy in the global clean energy landscape and augmenting U.S. industry and economy. Additionally, this project supports outreach activities to engage researchers in national laboratories and the wind energy industry, educate K-12 students in composites, organic materials, computer-aided design and clean energy, recruit undergraduate researchers especially underrepresented groups, and enrich curricula through guest lectures.<br/><br/>Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs) are polymers crosslinked by covalent bonds that become reversible upon heating or other external stimuli. They combine the structural stability of thermosets and the malleability of thermoplastics. This project aims to establish a systematic research framework to discover new CANs and their composites to meet the multi-faceted requirements of material properties posed by the manufacturing, operation, and recycling of wind turbine blades. The research features an interdisciplinary collaboration among mechanics, materials, and manufacturing, and includes three components: molecular design, organic material synthesis, and mechanics of the new polymers. For molecular design, a cyber-platform combining machine learning and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is created to generate candidate monomers of CANs. The synthesis component establishes a feasible molecular design space and allows CAN polymers to be synthesized from candidate monomers for manufacturing and testing. The mechanics component focuses on testing and modeling the mechanical behavior of the CAN polymers. The three components are integrated by preparing coupon-scale CAN composite samples and benchmarking their mechanical properties against the thermoset composites currently used in wind turbine blades. Manufacturing and recycling processes such as vacuum bag molding, thermoforming, lamination and chemical dissolution of CAN composites and the effects of processing conditions are also investigated. <br/><br/>This project is supported jointly by the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MoMS) and the Advanced Manufacturing (AM) programs of the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Division in the Directorate for Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed approaches introduce selective chemical crosslinking into monobodies to reinforce their structure, and together with surface supercharging endow cell permeability to the engineered monobodies. This project will provide multidisciplinary research opportunities to underrepresented undergraduate students through collaborations with several minority-focused programs at SUNY at Buffalo. The results of this project will also be integrated into the Experiential Learning Network for undergraduates to enhance their classroom learning.<br/><br/>This research project seeks to optimize orthogonally crosslinked monobody scaffolds for the design of bioactive cell-penetrating monobodies targeting the intracellular proteins. By incorporating a genetically encoded noncanonical amino acid called beta-lactam-lysine into a monobody for selective chemical crosslinking, two complementary approaches will be explored to enhance the capability of the monobody scaffold: a computational approach based on deep learning; and an experimental approach based on bacterial surface display. The utility of the optimized monobody scaffolds will be evaluated by designing potent and selective cell-permeable monobodies targeting oncogenic KRAS mutants and examining efficacy. These studies are expected to provide insight into the relationship between protein topology and cytosolic transport, which is crucial for the use of protein-based ligands to study life processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The medium is a periodic array of carefully designed nanoscale cavities with a single-atom-thick membrane stretched over them.  When the membrane is vibrated, each cavity emits a high-frequency sound wave, much like a nanoscale drum. These waves can then be tuned, coupled to each other, propagated preferentially, or even completely canceled, thanks to the unique properties of the medium. As such, this study will advance our understanding of wave propagation in novel materials and develop the nanotechnology necessary for harnessing these waves. Among the numerous envisioned applications are electro-acoustic signal processing components intended for use in communications, national security, environmental monitoring, and biotechnology. The project also integrates research and education by fostering a research collaboration between a primarily undergraduate institution and a research-intensive university.

These materials will meet the growing needs of many current and emerging scanning and sensing applications that are limited by the strength of THz-frequency light sources. The introduction of brighter THz light sources into current and developing scanners will provide enhanced resolution and sensitivity in a broad range of imaging and sensing applications, including in airport scanners, medical imaging devices, and quality control scanners in manufacturing. These results will expand the impact of THz-frequency scanners, which are safe (non-ionizing radiation) and can provide unique information in many scanning, medical imaging, and sensing applications. The project will also train a diverse group of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in the field of materials development and entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>The proposed project involves the scale up of newly discovered organic materials capable of generating high intensity terahertz-frequency light. Scanning and imaging instruments that employ terahertz-frequency light are safer than many common X-ray based scanners yet are often limited by the lack of bright terahertz-light sources. The organic new materials being produced for commercialization in this proposal provide nearly double the THz light output from current commercial sources. The scale up and growth of larger terahertz-generating crystals will meet the growing demands of companies and researchers who are developing new terahertz-based technologies and who require brighter terahertz sources. Organic materials generally have limited lifetimes due to decomposition under ambient conditions. On this project, commercialization of our prototype layered crystal structures will both enhance THz output and minimize crystal damage during terahertz light generation. These more robust sources of terahertz light will enable the use of organic terahertz light sources in scanners and imagers that previously could not employ this technology due to the short lifetime of organic crystals. In combination, the commercialization of these technologies will facilitate rapid growth in the terahertz scanner sector, enabling safer and more sensitive scanning and imaging technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Alliance is furthering an advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing and R&D Engine (Engine) in the distressed Richmond/Petersburg Region in Central Virginia. To establish this Engine, Activation Capital will team with 23 core partners, including all 14 Alliance members, over an 18-month Development Phase period to accomplish 25 planning and capacity building activities that will position the Alliance to build a mature advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing (APM) innovation ecosystem capable of creating significant jobs and investment in the Region. These planning activities are critical for the Alliance to implement the integrated translational, commercialization, and workforce development activities which can help to re-shore safe and affordable medicines and create wide-reaching impact for individuals across the United States and beyond. Of the 23 core partners, three will be direct subrecipients ? Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU);  US Pharmacopeia (USP); and the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing (CCAM). <br/><br/>This project addresses the challenge that virtually all medicines rely on overseas production for key starting materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), finished dose formulations, and often all three. With 73% of FDA registered API manufacturing facilities located overseas, the supply of quality medicines is uneven, at risk, and difficult to regulate and monitor. Since 2014, VCU?s Medicines for All Institute, has led the U.S. in research and development to optimize API production to create cleaner, faster, and cheaper APM methods. These innovations have led to direct process dissemination to manufacturers for scale-up and implementation and allowed the Region to emerge as a leader in innovative hybrid and continuous flow manufacturing (CFM), an FDA-recognized emerging technology. In order to accelerate the creation of an end-to-end translational APM Engine that will drive the nation?s effort to secure its supply of quality affordable medicines, the Engine will accomplish five strategic goals as part of this Development Phase: 1) assemble a robust, qualified and diverse Engine Governance Board and Leadership Team; 2) build a foundational Strategic Implementation Plan; create a well-rounded recruitment and management strategy for strategic partners; 4) craft a comprehensive workforce development plan; and 5) strengthen and align the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) Plan with federal standards.

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. <br/><br/>This project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them.

Additionally, bootcamp opportunities will transform motivated grad students and post-docs into future inventors of new analytical tools and functionalities, which will grow the community of morphologists working in digital environments.  MorphoCloud will make working with digital biological specimen data as routine as working with genomics data, so that biologists can focus on their scientific questions rather than get bogged down with complex workflows, technicalities, and limited resources.

Underserved and small farms in the state are predicted to be most vulnerable to the effects of climate change as they are often located in areas more exposed to risks associated with extreme weather events. Building climate resilience into small farms requires a vibrant innovation ecosystem in which farmers? needs are communicated to researchers, discoveries are translated to demand-driven products, and farmers are incentivized to adopt new technologies and practices to build environmentally and economically sustainable farms. The CROPS project confronts entrenched sources of social, economic, and racial inequity by igniting the full potential of an innovation corridor to meet the needs of small- and mid-sized farms, especially underserved farmers, in the face of climate change. The overall goal is to develop an overarching CROPS ecosystem that seeds more equitable and needs-centric knowledge sharing, technology development, and creation of incentives to de-risk adoption among farmers, universities, industry, and stakeholder communities. In this Development phase, CROPS builds a strong organizational infrastructure that promotes and sustains this ecosystems? growth and maturity. CROPS prioritizes diversity within our multifaceted stakeholder ecosystem ? farmers, researchers, policy makers, funders, and industry. CROPS focuses on key nodes of systemic connectivity between underserved farmers, consortium research partners, and education-focused academic and extension agents who are dedicated to preparing a future ready workforce, while addressing climate, technological, economic, and societal challenges faced by NC farmers.<br/><br/>Although the major NC metropolitan regions of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) and the Piedmont Triad (PT) have promoted technological innovation and economic opportunity, there has been insufficient economic impact in the underserved rural counties of Eastern and Central NC whose focus on agriculture. This award mechanism better positions the RTP and PT regions to cultivate and bolster interdisciplinary, multi-organizational teams of researchers, industry, entrepreneurial, and non-profit partners, and other stakeholders to work collaboratively with underserved farmers, small business owners, and landholders. The lead institution of this engine is North Carolina A&T State University, the largest HBCU in the nation, which has a long history of working with a diverse group of farmers to improve their success through its extension network. Core CROPS partners also include Alamance Community College, Duke University, East Carolina University, NC Biotechnology Center, NC State University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, RTI International, and Wake Forest University. The proposed 42-county NC Agricultural Tech Innovation Corridor mobilizes innovative research, accelerates product commercialization, and trains the workforce needed to sustain the ecosystem.

For example, terrestrial and aquatic microbiomes mix in rivers, soil microbial communities invade one another in agriculture, and human skin microbiomes come into contact when two people shake hands. Such cross-microbiome invasions are collectively termed community coalescence. How these mixing events impact the function of microbiomes and how often new communities with novel functions form as a result remains unclear. This research project uses fermented food microbiomes, including sourdough starters, kombucha, and fermented vegetables, to determine how microbiomes reassemble when they mix and how coalescence impacts microbiome functions. Findings from these experimentally tractable fermented food systems identify how community coalescence can be used as a tool for microbiome engineering and its potential to improve the manipulation of medically and industrially relevant microbiomes. The broad appeal of fermented food systems is also used to increase participation in undergraduate research and broaden the public understanding of microbiomes. This project also engages the public more broadly through popular science articles and interviews on MicrobialFoods.org, a popular science venue developed to explain complex biological concepts in scientific papers in accessible content for food enthusiasts and educators.<br/><br/>The mechanisms that govern cross-community invasions remain poorly understood. Most research has focused on the consequences of community coalescence in natural systems, while determination of underlying mechanisms is limited. This project manipulates a suite of fermented food model systems, derived from fermented food microbiomes, including sourdough starters, kombucha, and fermented vegetables, in conducting community coalescence experiments. The investigation sheds light on the consequences of coalescence, the mechanisms that govern it, and its potential utility for microbiome engineering. With the use of co-culture interaction assays, metabolic modeling, RNA-sequencing, and targeted metabolomics the project dissects the underlying interaction mechanisms that shape coalescence outcomes.

The campaign makes observations of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), the layer of the atmosphere from roughly 14km to 18km between the tropical troposphere and stratosphere, using balloons designed to float at a constant altitude for flights of up to 3 months.  The balloons are launched from the Seychelles and float around the equator just above the top of the TTL or in the lower stratosphere at an altitude near 20km.  Strateole-2 was planned as a set of three deployments, a preliminary engineering deployment with 8 balloon flights followed by two science deployments with 20 flights each. The first two deployments took place in 2019 and 2021 and funds for the PIs' participation in these deployments were provided through AGS-1642277.  The third deployment is scheduled to begin in October 2025.<br/><br/>Funds provided here support the development and deployment of a new instrument with the acronym RATS, for Reel-down Atmospheric Temperature Sensor.  Roughly speaking RATS is a thermometer lowered on a long tether below a balloon gondola which contains a second thermometer. The difference in temperature between the two thermometers can be used to detect gravity waves, atmospheric waves similar to ocean surface waves only they can propagate vertically as well as horizontally. RATS can detect gravity waves because the up and down motions of the waves cause cooling and warming, thus the difference in temperature between two appropriately separated thermometers can record the passage of a wave. The title of the proposal refers to the use of the RATS thermometers for the Characterization of Atmospheric Tropical waves of the lower Stratosphere (CATS).<br/><br/>Motivation for the work comes from the role of gravity waves in driving the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), the reversal in zonal wind direction over the equator that begins in the upper stratosphere and descends to the tropopause over a period slightly longer than two years.  The QBO matters for subseasonal weather prediction because it has been linked to modes of climate variability that influence weather around the world.  Models used for weather prediction have difficulty capturing the QBO, in part because the waves that drive it have wavelengths that are smaller than typical model grid spacings, particularly in the vertical.  RATS can detect waves with vertical wavelengths between 2 and 30 times the distance between the two thermometers, which is set to either 200m or 300m to capture wavelengths from 400m to 6km or 600m to 9km.  The longer wavelengths can be resolved by operational models and thus compared with the model output while the shorter ones are unresolved.<br/><br/>The award covers the development of the RATS hardware, which includes a Lower Measuring Unit (LMU) containing a thermometer (developed by CNES) along with an RS41 radiosonde sensor module (from Vaisala) to measures temperature, humidity, and pressure, and a GPS receiver for determining position.  The LMU is raised and lowered using a spool and pulley system that allows it to be docked to the gondola for launch and reeled down when the balloon reaches its flight altitude.  The gondola contains a second thermometer along with a barometer and GPS receiver.<br/><br/>The work is of societal interest given the prospects for better long-range weather predictions through improved representation of the wave driving of the QBO. The Strateole-2 field campaign involves collaborations with two operational weather prediction centers, thereby providing a connection from research to operations.  All field campaign data is made available to the global research community to pursue additional research topics on TTL physics and dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It recently has been suggested that the artificial introduction of chlorine into the atmosphere to remove methane might be a viable option for mitigating the climate impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. While limited laboratory studies have shown the potential for such a mechanism to remove methane, there is essentially little understanding of the viability of the method and its potential for causing harmful impacts.<br/><br/>The MDSA (mineral dust-sea spray aerosol) mechanism depends on the recycling of hydrogen chloride by the methane and chlorine (CH4 + Cl) reaction. Establishing the catalytic efficiency of the process with respect to iron and chlorine under different atmospheric conditions is the key goal of this project. An aircraft campaign will be conducted near Barbados over a 6-week period during June/July 2024 in conjunction with MAGPIE (Moisture and Aerosol Gradients/Physics of Inversion Evolution), a dynamical meteorology project funded by the US Navy and NOAA. Measurements will be made of aerosol load and size distribution, and concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and hydrogen chloride, as well as 3-D wind speed and direction and temperature. Air samples will be collected for subsequent analysis of delta 13C in CO and CH4 as this data will validate the existence of the chlorine-hydrogen abstraction mechanism from atmospheric methane, believed to yield highly depleted 13CO in the summertime. This project to evaluate the viability of adding chlorine to the atmosphere to remove methane has high societal relevance for mitigating climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Centered in the ?textile belt? of North Carolina, the NSF Engine aims to disrupt and revolutionize the $96B textile industry. Textiles are ubiquitous. If successful, the innovation ecosystem driven by the NSF Engine will result in unprecedented advances in, for example, smart textiles and wearable tech to textiles being used in innovative ways for protection or in the medical field. While other regions of the US have lost textile jobs, this region?s textile jobs have stabilized and the region boasts the largest concentration of textile workers in the US with over 27,000 workers and an additional 30,000 in adjacent industries such as waste streams and furniture workers, spanning almost 2,000 companies. The NSF Engine is led by The Industrial Commons, a non-profit   with a strong reputation within the textile sector as well as other fields for being a hub of regional, rural innovation with deep local, national, and sectoral knowledge and relationships. North Carolina State University?s (NCSU?s) Wilson College of Textiles (WCOT) is leading the NSF Engine?s research and development (R&D) innovations. The NSF Engine also includes partnerships across community colleges, manufacturers, brands, economic development, and state government, among others. The team is thus poised with the infrastructure and ties to rapidly develop, revitalize, and scale a cutting edge and environmentally sustainable textile industry that can be competitive in the global economy. <br/><br/>Circularity is the pinnacle in terms of sustainability and the NSF Engine will push industry toward it, building replicable systems and innovations to capture and process post-consumer waste at scale, and process it into the building blocks that can become fibers for new textiles. At the same time, the NSF Engine is looking toward immediate impact by taking a broader approach that focuses on all aspects of the sustainability ecosystem. This includes an emphasis on designing for end of life, increasing durability of products, expanding repair capabilities to keep products in use and developing better systems and processes for textile reclamation. The NSF Engine will also focus on increased consumer education and increased re-use of materials including additional material from the landfill and toward downcycling options such as production of nonwovens. The NSF Engine will research and advance additive chemistries, new materials, manufacturing and operations, and chemical and mechanical recycling. The NSF Engine will also be forward-looking with textile applications in, for example, fiber-based materials used in wind turbine blades or health monitoring of roadways, bridges, and structural components; nanofibers used in battery components such as the separators, anodes and cathodes to improve storage performance; and geotextiles used in hardscape and landscape applications to prevent pests from accessing crops without compromising water and light penetration. Last, the NSF Engine will also seek opportunities to both develop and inform policy, standards, and labeling that create clear definitions for textile circularity and sustainability, while facilitating broader understanding of advanced and sustainable materials.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine has a region of service that encompasses the local textile supply chain covering central and western North Carolina, and stretching into the Appalachian regions of upstate South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and southern VA. The NSF Engine has a strong foundation in inclusive economic development and workforce development through its lead organization, which founds and scales employee-owned social enterprises and industrial cooperatives and supports frontline workers to build a new southern working class. NCSU?s WCOT, an international leader in textile innovation, will drive R&D together with other academic institutions. The NSF Engine?s translation of R&D to products is built on partnerships such as the Manufacturing Solutions Center?which supports U.S. manufacturers through, for example, a business incubator and will be providing product testing, prototyping, and sourcing; Bear Fiber?the nation?s first processor and manufacturer of American grown textile-grade hemp fiber, yarn, fabric and apparel; and capital access and venture capital development such as the state-level foundation, NC IDEA. Leading the workforce development efforts, together with other community colleges and manufacturers, is Gaston College?s Textile Technology Center, which will provide, for example, testing, rapid prototyping, and will develop better equipment and measurements for biodegradation testing and overall sustainable fiber life cycle testing. The NSF Engine is further supported by North Carolina?s Department of Commerce and North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. RTI International, a nonprofit research institute, will be leading the NSF Engine?s evaluation efforts, leveraging its expertise in technology-based regional economic development.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine is deeply committed to ensuring accessibility to well-paying, quality jobs for all communities in the region of service and to preparing the region?s existing and future workforce for the innovations to come in sustainable textiles. The NSF Engine?s workforce development efforts involve creating new curricula and certificates at the partnering community colleges focused on the NSF Engine?s topic, growing apprenticeship and internship opportunities for high school and community college students within the range of textile manufacturing companies in the region, and increasing worker diversity, worker voice, and agency. For example, partnering with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, the NSF Engine plans to establish a formal textile career pathway. The NSF Engine will also continue to expand partnerships with workforce development entities including state and government institutions and job pipeline programs, such as the county health departments, many of which are investing opioid settlement funds into programs and strategies that create new career pathways . It will additionally build partnerships with organizations that provide wrap-around services that address barriers to employment in order to create resources for manufacturers to navigate these processes, update internal policies and more quickly hire veterans, immigrant workers or returning citizens as well as sharing wage scales, communicating with all employees the opportunities to advance within their workplace. It also plans to establish ?Job Quality Standards? to hold employers accountable to health and safety standards, as has been successful in the Carolina Textile District.<br/><br/>This region has deep roots in the textile industry, with over one hundred years of experience, together with a density of companies, textile workers, and R&D expertise that can drive forward innovation, making this NSF Engine the prime location in the US to revitalize this industry and build a textile-focused, environmentally sustainable innovation ecosystem. The assembled starting coalition includes a well-established group of leaders, connectors, innovators, and doers in the textile sector, all driven by the goal of inclusive economic development that will bring with it new jobs, opportunities, and economic prosperity for the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the developing nervous systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, neurons express a wide diversity of cell adhesion molecules, which mediate interactions that are essential for specifying target selection and connectivity patterns. This proposal will study the molecular control of circuit development through a combination of genetic and biophysical approaches in which binding affinities and cell surface localization of cell adhesion molecules are manipulated and their effects on neural circuit formation are studied in the larva fruit fly. The proposed research will have a significant impact on multiple research fields due to the generality of the phenomena to be studied. Moreover, integrating computational and structural biology with developmental neuroscience is likely to stimulate similar collaborative efforts in these fields. In terms of training, students and postdocs working on this project will develop a deep appreciation of both computational and experimental work, thus providing exemplars for broadly trained interdisciplinary scientists. Women scientists constitute over 50% of the participating groups. The research program includes training of high school and undergraduate students, many of whom are from underrepresented minorities in sciences, through summer internships. The team will continue partnering with a network of high schools across lower-income districts and minority serving colleges, and run the DREAM-High cloud computing course for high school students that increases student awareness of and interest in biological sciences, empowers students to adopt scientific reasoning and critical-thinking skills, and inspires students to seek post-secondary education in related fields.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of binding affinity and cell surface availability of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on circuit formation in Drosophila. The study will focus on the larval neuromuscular system and mushroom body development. At the molecular level, the focus will be on two interacting groups of CAMs, the Dprs (Defective in Proboscis extension Response) and the DIPs (Dpr Interacting Proteins). The choice of these proteins and anatomical structures is based on the deep understanding of the biophysical properties of DIPs and Dprs that has emerged over the past few years, and on the demonstration of their crucial roles in the development of these anatomical structures. Here, by examining various Dpr/DIP cognate pairs in different neurodevelopmental settings, the findings should deepen currently limited knowledge of the in vivo consequences of altering avidity using both changes in binding affinities and in expression levels. A particular focus will be on the phenomenon of cis inhibition, whereby interactions between cognate binding partners on the same cell compete with trans binding to partners on apposed cells. The underlying hypothesis is that cis-inhibition is a key regulatory mechanism in neural development.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Neural Systems Cluster in IOS and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in MCB of the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If successful, the eventual NSF Engine stemming out of this project will leverage: 1) The benefits of technology developed for space, in-space experiments and manufacturing, and unique terrestrial facilities to conduct use-inspired R&D that is all but impossible to perform without space as a catalyst; 2) Ohio?s premier space-related facilities and academic institutions, which provide the Engine?s foundation in space research and workforce development; 3) Proven commercialization practices and a robust accelerator and investor community; 4) A continuum of workforce development programs; and 5) Ohio?s appeal as a highly attractive destination, offering economic incentives and a high quality of living that draw individuals and organizations to establish themselves in Ohio.  <br/><br/>Technologies developed for space applications must be highly reliable and sustainable in a harsh environment. Resulting innovations include high-temperature resistant, lightweight, long-life, and high-efficiency products with enormous potential to improve life on Earth. Operating in space offers a unique research and manufacturing environment to a broad range of sectors due to microgravity (which provides weightlessness), a near-vacuum state, and higher levels of radiation. A key enabler of space-based research and manufacturing is access to long-term microgravity. Gravity influences everything on Earth, from the development of life to the interactions between materials. The micro-gravity environment aboard an orbiting spacecraft allows scientists to conduct experiments and develop manufacturing processes that are impossible to achieve on Earth. SPARC Ohio will leverage facilities and services that support both ground- and space-based research to significantly expand the existing partnership between the state and federal government, industry, and academia throughout Ohio. The Engine will develop pathways to connect critical space, biological, and physical science knowledge with regional and national stakeholders to solve use-inspired problems.  Projected outcomes include re-establishing US competitiveness in semiconductors, improving consumers? lives through innovative products, advancing health and wellness, strengthening food production and security, and promoting environmental sustainability. This Development Award will enable the SPARC Ohio to engage in a regional, collaborative planning process to prepare a future Engine to meet these goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern applications, however, require more than compression. In domains such as computational biology, terabytes of highly compressible data are generated at an increasing rate. To fully take advantage of this data, it needs to be not only stored in a small space but also accessible and searchable. Recent years have witnessed the birth of data structures called ""compressed indexes"" that can accomplish this task. The research so far, however, has mostly focused on static indexes, leaving out important aspects such as support for updates and efficient construction. This project's overarching goal is to develop powerful, dynamic compressed indexes capable of handling a versatile set of queries and various representations, that can moreover be efficiently constructed. This will make it significantly cheaper, faster, and more energy-efficient to store and share highly compressible datasets such as DNA collections, thereby fully unlocking the potential of advances in DNA sequencing. The advances of this project will also be integrated into research experience for underrepresented students, as well as outreach to non-computer science students.<br/><br/>The main research goals of this project can be broadly classified into the following three directions. First, the project will lead to new efficient algorithms for constructing compressed indexes. The new approach lies in first preprocessing the input using lightly sub-optimal compression and then constructing the final index in compressed time, i.e., time proportional to the precompressed text. Second, the project aims to utilize and improve modern suffix sampling techniques to design new and powerful indexes that are both compressed and able to support powerful queries, including multi-string representations. Finally, the project will study the underdeveloped landscape of lower bounds for compressed indexes. Currently, only the most basic queries, such as random access, are well-understood, and much less is known about lower bounds on more versatile representations or lower bounds for compressed computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this collaborative project researchers examine the emergence of one such imperial formation at an archaeological site that saw the transformation from an independent city-state into a tributary city. The expansion of ancient territorial empires has historically resulted in profound changes to the material culture and daily life of such settlements, regardless of their resistance to imperial incorporation. Existing research has predominantly focused on the evidence from the pre- and post-imperial control periods in such locations. However, pre-imperial traces of socio-political organization were often purposely erased or altered with the arrival of new ideologies and strategies of empire building. This makes it difficult to understand how societies adapted or resisted to imperial incorporation. Archaeology can provide insight by looking at contexts of continuous cultural practices like places of worship, rituals, and public activities that remained undisrupted, and thus, see variations on cultural traditions and learn how people responded to imposing external ideologies and governing in the past. This research provides insights into how local ethnicities maintained, modified, or altered their traditions in the service of new political systems are pertinent for comprehending how indigenous communities respond to contemporary foreign global expansions.

Rice University is a small, private, four-year institution of higher education located in Houston, Texas, a city of approximately 2.4 million people that stands as the most diverse city in the United States. Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 53 unique, full-time students every year who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in science and engineering disciplines. This project will facilitate the transition of a group of academically talent low-income students from the time they are admitted to college to the start of their major core courses?and then throughout the remainder of their undergraduate programs. The project will begin in the summer and will combine a six-week, immersive bridge program that will cover the most challenging topics students will face in first-year mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science courses with numerous interventions: individualized professional advisors? coaching throughout the students? time at Rice, cohort-building activities, and other interventions designed to fuel persistence and remove barriers for success. Moreover, the project will sponsor summer activities such as opportunities to participate in state-of-the-art research, internships, and summer courses. This S-STEM grant will support academically talented low-income students in science and engineering, strengthening the pipeline of professionals across all STEM fields, while shedding light on the significance of critical events in the formation of STEM identity and persistence to a degree completion in STEM, as well as the effectiveness of the project in addressing student needs. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  The central hypothesis is that by using a series of carefully planned and integrated interventions, it will be possible to remove the barriers that lead to attrition in STEM and, thereby, advance persistence and academic success. The overall goal will be accomplished by pursuing the following objectives: 1) mitigate disparities in access to educational opportunities by helping students acquire core STEM content knowledge and develop college-ready study habits and skills; 2) provide an intentionally designed cohort experience that fosters belongingness and cultivates students? identity as members of the Rice science and engineering communities; 3) coach and mentor students throughout their college studies to build social capital and navigate or remove barriers to persistence; and, 4) provide summer academic and scholarly opportunities for sophomore and junior students. Critical events (called shocks) cause individual students to re-evaluate their educational arrangements, in part because shocks send messages about identity and expected futures. To understand the types of shocks experienced by students, the perceptions of their severity, and whether they differ by student socioeconomic status, a series of qualitative interviews will be performed. In addition, quantitative studies of student identity upon matriculation (i.e., STEM and status identity), shocks experienced during their first two years of study, and an assessment of student outcomes will be performed. The project will advance understanding of the types of critical events that students are experiencing, perceptions of the severity of those critical events, whether these perceptions differ by student status, and the effectiveness of the project in mitigating the adverse effects of these events. The success of the project will be assessed by formative and summative external evaluation, and the results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and papers presented at academic conferences. The project will also host a half-day workshop every summer to share effective strategies with other universities and community colleges across Texas. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how muscle controls movement is essential for animal performance and evolution, and for maintaining human health throughout life. However, muscle function during fast, unsteady motions in complex environments cannot be accurately predicted by current models.  Current understanding is limited by isolation among fields, resulting in knowledge gaps between ?bottom-up? reductionist approaches that characterize molecules and tissues and ?top down? organismal approaches that focus on animal behavior. The Integrative Movement Sciences Institute (IMSI) will bridge these gaps by connecting ?bottom-up? and ?top-down? approaches to integrate the contributions of mechanical, neural, and sensory systems to movement control. An interdisciplinary team spanning 21 institutions across the country will lead scientific research and training to integrate investigations across structural levels and timescales from molecules to organisms and nanoseconds to generations. The IMSI collaborative network will train scientists in interdisciplinary teamwork, mathematical modeling, data analysis, and open data sharing. IMSI activities will drive innovation in biophysics, physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience, and engineering. Understanding the muscular control of agile movement has wide-reaching applications in bio-technology and the bio-economy through design of movement therapies, rehabilitation programs and mobility assistance devices.<br/><br/>Dynamic muscle function forms a critical foundation for an integrative understanding of movement, yet it remains a fundamental challenge to predict muscle force output in fast and unsteady conditions. IMSI will integrate muscular control of movement across scales by critically examining assumptions of current approaches, developing new experiments and models to bridge ?bottom-up? and ?top-down? perspectives, and constructing a dynamic muscle movement paradigm to transform basic science, clinical and technical applications. Cross-cutting themes include unsteady and perturbed movements, multiscale modeling, and unifying invertebrate, vertebrate, and human studies. Research Cores include: (1) intrinsic muscle dynamics with rheological and X-ray diffraction experiments at nanometer to organismal scales; (2) embedded neuromechanical control to investigate how intrinsic mechanics and sensorimotor networks shape unsteady movement; (3) resilience and versatility to determine how variation in musculoskeletal properties and capacity drive whole-body movement; (4) risk-reward and learning, to determine how experience leads to movement optimization when navigating environmental risks and rewards; and (5) diversity and convergence in motor systems to characterize evolution of dynamic muscle function. IMSI faculty have expertise ranging from molecular biophysics of muscle proteins to animal ecology and human-machine interaction. The team-based science, near-peer mentorship and co-supervisory structure will foster community and provide trainees with a wide mentor network from a range of institutions from primarily undergraduate institutions to research intensive institutions, creating a training pipeline from undergraduates to faculty. IMSI will transform movement sciences by building a new foundation for dynamic muscle function and neuromuscular control of movement that integrates across disciplines, organisms, and structural scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this collaborative project researchers examine the emergence of one such imperial formation at an archaeological site that saw the transformation from an independent city-state into a tributary city. The expansion of ancient territorial empires has historically resulted in profound changes to the material culture and daily life of such settlements, regardless of their resistance to imperial incorporation. Existing research has predominantly focused on the evidence from the pre- and post-imperial control periods in such locations. However, pre-imperial traces of socio-political organization were often purposely erased or altered with the arrival of new ideologies and strategies of empire building. This makes it difficult to understand how societies adapted or resisted to imperial incorporation. Archaeology can provide insight by looking at contexts of continuous cultural practices like places of worship, rituals, and public activities that remained undisrupted, and thus, see variations on cultural traditions and learn how people responded to imposing external ideologies and governing in the past. This research provides insights into how local ethnicities maintained, modified, or altered their traditions in the service of new political systems are pertinent for comprehending how indigenous communities respond to contemporary foreign global expansions.

These novel materials, termed dual-atom alloys, consist of an energetically stable pair of different metal atoms embedded in the surface of a host metal. Compared to single-atom alloys, a similar class of materials with well-defined active sites, dual-atom alloy active sites are anticipated to be more reactive and enable more challenging reactions including targeted bond scission.  However, accelerating the discovery of novel alloys requires addressing numerous challenges including identifying promising combinations of metals from the large materials space of potential pairings, understanding their structure/function relationships, and creating an effective feedback loop between experiment and computation. Dr. Montemore and his students will use machine learning combined with density functional theory (DFT) to identify candidate structures based on surface stability and low energy barriers for specific chemical reactions. Dr. Sykes and his students will experimentally synthesize, characterize, and test the predicted structures. Their discoveries could lead to the development of an entirely new class of catalysts where well-defined metal atomic structures can be combined with predictive models to accelerate a range of multistep reaction mechanisms. In addition to these broad scientific impacts, this project will also support a virtual reality K-12 outreach workshop, provide mentorship for Hispanic scientists and engineers, and inspire students from underserved high schools by facilitating a Reverse Science Fair.<br/><br/>Dual-atom alloys leverage several of the advantages of single-atom alloys: a well-defined active site that allows clear correspondence across computation, surface science, and reactor studies; opportunities to deviate from linear correlations in reaction energetics; and unique electronic structure. Just as with single-atom alloys, in which surface science experiments and computation preceded catalyst synthesis and testing, Montemore and Sykes will couple theory and surface science experiments to explore dual-atom alloy structure-reactivity space. This research is expected to lead to the development of structure-function relationships on a broad set of well-defined active sites, which would then serve as a guide to the larger heterogenous catalysis community. Furthermore, these studies have the potential to uncover new classes of materials with high catalytic performance, a particular need for reactions that are challenging with traditional heterogeneous catalysts, such as selective cross-couplings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The NSF Engine will increase the competitiveness of Paso del Norte small and medium manufacturers (SMMs) in A&D markets by creating an innovation platform that combines an emerging digital engineering paradigm, skilled workforce development, and other resources to reduce costs for startups and SMMs while increasing access to cutting-edge design and testing tools needed to spur growth. The NSF Engine re-imagines the Paso del Norte region as an advanced manufacturing and knowledge-based economy that increases the share of jobs in advanced industries in the region from 3.2% to 25%. This can be accomplished by redeploying local manufacturing capabilities to support U.S. A&D industries and upskilling the local talent workforce and expanding access for K-12 students to next-generation STEM skills so that more people in the region have a path to the middle class.<br/><br/>SMMs remain extraordinarily critical to maintaining a vibrant and secure U.S. A&D supply chain, but fewer and fewer SMMs are participating in the defense industrial base. Because they often have a smaller workforce, limited resources, and no budget or infrastructure for research and development, SMMs are increasingly excluded from the highly stratified U.S. innovation ecosystem. The NSF Engine is tackling the national challenge of reinvigorating the once vital manufacturing base of the U.S. economy and increasing economic mobility and workforce participation in the Paso del Norte region through the creation of innovation sector jobs. Five of 14 defense critical technologies identified by the U.S. Department of Defense are included in the ecosystem: advanced materials; trusted AI and autonomy; space technology; renewable energy generation and storage; and hypersonics.<br/><br/>Paso del Norte is an eight-county region that sits on the U.S.-Mexico border in the American Southwest. It includes six counties in West Texas and two in Southern New Mexico. The cities of El Paso and Las Cruces are the largest metropolitan areas in the region of service. The U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) designates six of the eight counties (Culberson, Doa Ana, El Paso, Hudspeth, Presidio, and Sierra) as Persistent Poverty Counties, meaning that poverty rates have stayed above 20 percent for at least 30 years. The median income for families in this region is well below the national average and this gap has widened since 1997.<br/><br/>One reason for low incomes is the lack of high-paying STEM jobs in the region, relative to other markets. To revitalize the US A&D industrial base and propel the Paso del Norte region toward more economic parity and increased competitiveness, the NSF Engine will help SMMs to develop more innovation in their approaches and gain affordable access to defense-critical research and development. Some of the key components of the NSF Engine are new open-access physical and technical support infrastructures based at universities and facilities in the region that SMMs can utilize to build their innovation capacity and workforce talent.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine?s Public Innovation Architecture will be an ecosystem that fosters engineering and manufacturing innovation to speed the development of capabilities among regional SMMs to access use-inspired R&D. This Public Innovation Architecture is a way to disrupt the traditional R&D process by ensuring broad and affordable access to innovation processes. The Public Innovation Infrastructure will be a combination of resources to develop hard and soft infrastructure, which includes expanding the available local skilled workforce, physical infrastructure in El Paso for SMMs, digital infrastructure that can be accessed throughout the region, and capacity building for innovation in translation and commercialization. This public infrastructure will reduce costs for startups and SMMs to enter and compete in the A&D market.<br/><br/>The Talent Infrastructure supports the region?s innovation industry through upskilling of local workforce talent and K-12 outreach to build interest in careers in the A&D industry. Project lead organizations, The Aerospace Center and the W.M. Keck Center for 3D Innovation at The University of Texas at El Paso have developed new approaches to solving the STEM talent crisis facing the nation with a unique student-centered research model. Skill development strategies have produced graduates who are in high demand because of their abilities to immediately provide value to employers. This research model excels at opening new pathways into the A&D sector for groups traditionally underrepresented in the workforce. The Centers? students are 80% Latino, two-thirds come from families who make less than $37,000, and half are first-generation college students. The two centers are national leaders in training female engineers ? 29% of their students are women, which is much higher than peer institutions in the same fields.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine will expand this model with a technician training program called Aerospace and Defense Technologies and Manufacturing Training Centers (ADTech). A&D manufacturers often complain that new graduates of engineering and technician programs often lack the skills needed to be immediately productive and require expensive additional on-site training to be ready for the demands of their new job. The ADTech skills development platform, which expands on the success of programs at UTEP, will use proven skills-focused strategies to train a technician workforce that can meet the demands of A&D and advanced manufacturing employers. This agile training platform will integrate best practices in vocational training including supporting an open talent ecosystem, digital learning opportunities, and comprehensive partnership coordination that meets the needs of local SMMs.<br/><br/>The NSF Engine builds from significant investments and partnerships that have been developed over the two decades to fuel growth in this sector. This growth will lift the region?s median income to the national average and increase the region?s corporate footprint. The capital influx will spill over into other regional industries, creating broad and inclusive wealth building in this historically poor region where a majority of residents identify as Latino.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The production of concrete, the most widely used manufactured material, is a contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The production of cement results in 4-8% of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  There is a need to reduce the CO2 emissions both during construction and throughout the life of the concrete.  The Concrete Advancement Network (CAN), an Industry-University Cooperative Research Phase I Center (IUCRC) established by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Oregon State University, focuses on reducing the global warming potential (GWP) of concrete while improving the long-term durability of concrete thereby enabling significant economic and societal benefits. CAN focuses on implementing nanotechnology advancements, recyclability, digital manufacturing, multi-scale modeling, artificial intelligence, and advanced testing techniques will be used to fast-track the implementation of cutting-edge concepts into this key industrial sector, which frequently relies on older technology. Breakthroughs in the concrete field can be achieved using model-based prediction and verification combined with experimental methods, thereby advancing the pace of technology transfer from concept to implementation.  The CAN center aims to develop innovative concrete mixtures with reduced GWP while establishing methods to quantify the GWP and performance for member companies while training a diverse and skilled science and engineering workforce for the industry at large.  Thus, CAN activities are strategically important to the U.S. economy because they will provide long-term solutions for the nation?s deteriorating infrastructure and meet the demand for transportation and buildings.<br/><br/>The CAN Oregon State site is focused on the development of approaches to improve concrete performance predictions specifically as it relates to durability, by-product utilization, and a reduced carbon footprint. Novel experimental measurement techniques and computational tools will be showcased that can provide value to the industry. Oregon State will focus primarily on four primary research thrust areas: 1) the increased use of ?off-spec?, natural, and ?industrial by-product? supplementary cementitious materials to reduce the global warming potential of concrete, 2) carbon reduction, sequestration, and use of carbonatable binders, 3) molecular and thermodynamic modeling and 4) concrete durability, longevity, and service life modeling.  It is anticipated that work will focus on the development of mixture proportioning tools that result in mixtures with low GWP as well as approaches that better consider the service life emissions of concrete.  Advanced experimental techniques like neutron radiography are planned to assess the influence of fluid transport and carbonation on concrete development and performance.  Additionally, work will be performed to quantify the durability of concrete which will likely include updates to the service life prediction of concrete exposed to acid and the role of commercial additives in reducing transport and acid damage.  Finally, training programs are planned to help prepare the next generation of engineers while also providing information updates for practitioners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the intensities of these events continue to increase worldwide due to climate change, the need for their early monitoring and tracking has also increased. A UAS, consisting of a team of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and one or more ground stations, can provide real-time monitoring and tracking of unfolding disaster events, as well as help with relief operations to avoid large scale losses of lives and property. This project brings together US and Indian experts working on autonomous UAS operations in the presence of environmental uncertainties and hazards. In particular, it seeks to understand how teams of autonomous UAVs could be used to maximize the data gathered and predict the intensity and spread of forest fires and floods. Through its outreach activities, this project team will also encourage students to participate in research on autonomous vehicles and inform the general public about the value of such research in addressing societal challenges. <br/><br/>Key research goals are to design and use nonlinearly stable and robust motion estimation and control schemes that enable a multi-UAV team to collaboratively follow desired trajectories for loitering, monitoring and tracking in the presence of disturbances like wind and air currents. Each UAV in the UAS is modeled as an actuated rigid body, making the UAS a multi-agent rigid body system (MARBS). Geometric controller and observer designs will be developed that are computationally light and can be implemented with commercially available sensors onboard rotorcraft UAVs. Sensor data from inertial sensors and point cloud sensors like depth cameras, will be combined using a continuous and finite-time stable extended state observer (ESO). This ESO will provide estimates of UAV motion states, relative pose of other UAVs within the range of point cloud sensors, and disturbance estimates. These estimates will be used by feedback tracking controllers that are designed to track desired trajectories in a stable manner while rejecting the disturbances, thereby providing active disturbance rejection control (ADRC).

Many hypotheses regarding the origin of hominin bipedalism (walking on two legs), one of the earliest defining features of the human lineage, involve a phase of plasticity. This doctoral dissertation project examines the role of plasticity in primate locomotor specializations to advance knowledge about human bipedalism by placing humans within a broader primate context. This research highlights the potential early stages of the evolution of bipedalism, and findings from this research can inform future interpretations of the human fossil record. This research supports STEM training and mentorship of underrepresented high school and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The project has two main objectives. The first objective is to investigate the relationship between plasticity and evolvability of limb bones in reference to the locomotor repertoire of 15 primate species. The investigators collect and analyze 3D landmark data from limb bones across humans, apes, and monkeys with varying degrees of specialization. For the second objective, a robotic simulation approach is used to model how plasticity of locomotor repertoire can result in the origin of novel behaviors, as well as impact fitness and extinction risk. Robotic models based on six modern primate species and four hominin fossil species are run through a series of simulated environments. The algorithm for these simulations links two different forms of robotic modeling ? evolutionary and developmental ? which can be applied to other instances of adaptive plasticity in primates and made available for other researchers to use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support this key ability, the brain needs to reorganize its activity patterns depending on the current behavioral context, but we still understand little about how this functional reorganization is accomplished. This project will investigate this fundamental question by asking how multiple mouse brain regions act in concert to support task switching, a common type of flexible cognitive behavior. Beyond leading to better understanding of basic brain mechanisms, this research could inform future work that aims to treat cognitive inflexibility, which is pervasive in brain disorders like autism, schizophrenia, and dementia. The project will also have other broader societal impacts. First, it will provide numerous opportunities for undergraduate and graduate education in neuroscience. Second, it will include outreach to schoolteachers and children to raise awareness about the detriments of excessive task switching, which has vastly increased with pervasive digital technologies like smartphones and particularly affects learning in school-aged children. <br/><br/>The central goal of this proposal is to contrast two competing models of how the brain reorganizes its activity patterns task dependently: in the intracortical model, task-specific activity is fully generated within the cerebral cortex. In the external input model, extra-cortical input is required to actively reorganize cortical activity, enabling new cognitive computations. Based on preliminary studies, the hypothesis is that a loop between the prefrontal cortex, the cholinergic basal forebrain and the rest of the cortex is a key multi-region circuit that enables the generation of cortex-wide activity patterns depending on cognitive demands, compatible with the external input model. The project will use mice as the model organism due to their unique combination of sufficiently complex cognitive behavior and availability of experimental tools. It will leverage a new behavioral paradigm for head-fixed mice making navigational decisions in virtual reality, in which they switch between a simple and a complex task dozens of times within a behavioral session. This paradigm will be combined with cutting-edge genetic and optical tools to record and perturb different nodes of the hypothesized circuit loop, with cell-type and projection specificity. Further, statistical and mechanistic modeling will be employed to link neural activity patterns to task-specific behavior and extract generalizable computational principles from this specific circuit. Thus, this project will bring together recent developments in behavioral, computational, and circuit-dissection technologies to gain mechanistic insight into task switching, a canonical form of flexible cognitive behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Altered activity of these proteins can lead to poor glucose absorption and nutrient deficiency. Unfortunately, cellular events that regulate SGLT activity are poorly understood. This is particularly true for tyrosine phosphorylation, a form of modification that can change protein structure and function, that has not yet been studied in relation to SGLT activity. Therefore, the long-term goal of this NSF CAREER research project is to improve the understanding of how SGLT tyrosine phosphorylation, or tyrosine kinase proteins that activate this form of modification, regulate changes in glucose movement into cells. The project also includes several strategies for educational improvements that include highlighting the biological importance of SGLTs, as well as the training and recruitment of junior scientists who will lead future science, technology, engineering, and mathematic efforts. Collectively, this research project is expected to impact many scientific disciplines, including molecular, cellular, and systems biology, through educational insight and novel scientific discoveries involving glucose transporters.<br/><br/>The research objective of this NSF CAREER project is to identify a novel post-translational event that regulates variability in SGLT activity and glucose absorption. Solute carrier transporters, including SGLTs, have been associated as passive pores that move substrates across cell membranes alone or with electrochemical gradients. However, the hypothesis to be tested as part of the current project is that SGLTs are tyrosine phosphorylated by specific kinases at the cell surface, and that these phosphorylation events are associated with transport function. To address this hypothesis, the project will 1) evaluate the phosphorylation status of SGLTs in different cellular compartments using cell fractionation and mass spectrometry; 2) identify the role of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in regulating SGLT activity using site-directed mutagenesis, kinase inhibitors, and SGLT activity assays; and 3) identify tyrosine kinases that mediate SGLT activity using phosphoproteomic analysis and kinase interaction assays. Additionally, the strategies and outcomes from the proposed research objectives will be used to improve basic scientific knowledge, generate a passion for research, and improve leadership capabilities in the field of biological sciences. This will be done by establishing an annual summer research position for high school students, working with middle school educators to increase recognition of reproducible and high-quality science, and developing online content that will increase familiarity with transporter proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Boron has only three valence electrons compared to four in carbon and is thus considered to be electron deficient. The electron deficiency of boron results in complicated structures and unique chemical bonds in boron-containing molecules, which are challenging to investigate.

However, implementing memory consistency correctly is notoriously non-intuitive and complex. Memory consistency is a significant source of hardware design bugs. As such, the ability to formally verify the correctness of implementations before manufacture and distribution is desirable. Unfortunately, comprehensive verification to rule out these subtle bugs is difficult. Consequently, real-world products often exhibit buggy behavior in the field. In spite of its importance, the intractability of formal verification at meaningful scales has thus far resulted in either (1) less-than-complete  approaches based on collections of tests, which are by no means comprehensive, or (2) comprehensive  verification of simple cores that are not representative of modern out-of-order processors. To address this problem, this project develops a formal verification framework -- QED -- to verify that an RTL (register-transfer-level) implementation of a modern, out-of-order processor with a cache hierarchy is compliant with a given memory consistency model (MCM). The project?s novelties are (1) a divide-and-conquer approach to isolate and focus on memory consistency violations separately from other verification tasks (such as pipeline verification) that are well-studied, (2) novel ways to  provably reduce the number of instructions to be considered, (3) an automatic way to scalably consider all possible reorderings by ignoring reorderings that are provably unobservable, and (4) reducing the RTL verification burden to that of checking specific, narrow predicates (binary questions) on the RTL implementation.  The project?s impacts are (1) tackling the grand-challenge MCM verification problem that is of high importance to the computer hardware industry, and (2) training graduate researchers in the field of MCM verification.<br/><br/>The key insights and observations behind the project?s innovations are as follows. QED reduces the memory ordering problem from having to consider arbitrary instruction sequence ordering (which is intractably large) to having to consider only pairwise instruction ordering (which is in the hundreds-thousands range) to achieve the same ordering guarantees. QED is able to further reduce the number of instruction reorderings to consider by leveraging  the notion of ?unobservable? reorderings -- instruction reorderings that produce the same values as the original order, which can thus be ignored safely in the verification effort. The team of investigators will develop formal un-reordering rules that will enable automatic verification of arbitrary implementations. Combining the above innovations, it is possible to consider all possible interleavings of pairs of memory accesses (and arbitrary external events) and develop a decision-tree-based verification framework that is scalable to any number of cores and any number of instructions. The nodes of the decision tree are effectively predicates about the implementation, which can also be automatically checked by QED's proposed automatic RTL predicate checkers. In combination, the techniques enable QED to feasibly verify the consistency behavior of modern, out-of-order processors with cache hierarchies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research findings will be communicated to the scientific community through presentations at local, national, and international meetings and by publications in peer-reviewed journals.   <br/><br/>It has been assumed that the enzyme peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) is essential for bacteria because of its ability to recycle transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules from peptide-tRNA complexes that dissociate from the ribosome during abortive cycles of translation. Recently, it has come to light that Pth is capable of cleaving peptidyl-tRNAs on ribosomes that have stopped making proteins with problematic sequences. This newly discovered involvement of Pth in translation quality control reveals that the reasons for the essentiality of this enzyme are yet to be fully understood. In this project, ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq), an approach that reveals the positions of ribosomes genome-wide, will help identify the gene sites in two model bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) where Pth acts as a rescue factor for ribosomes struggling to translate specific sequences. In addition, biochemical and structural approaches will be used to reveal the mechanistic principles underlying Pth-driven ribosome rescue. The project will advance our understanding of strategies for protein synthesis quality control. The findings of the project may guide future research to design novel antibiotics and treatments for diseases associated with defective protein synthesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To reduce excessive vibrations of architectural structures, engineers can either increase the structural stiffness or mass, mainly at the floor levels. Both these options substantially increase overall construction costs. These options also result in sustainability issues; According to the United Nations Global Alliance for Building and Construction Program, 39% of all global greenhouse gas emissions are due to building construction. The floor construction can generate a staggering 10% of greenhouse emissions, which is five times more than what is produced by the entire aviation industry each year. PTMDs can substantially reduce construction costs and help with the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions produced by excess floor construction materials. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of Portable Tuned Mass Dampers (PTMD) to control vibrations in architectural structures. The changing landscape of architecture, including the use of higher strength building materials such as steel and concrete, the tendency of architects to design more elegant, slender, open-plan and long-span structures, and the more common use of highly sensitive equipment in hospitals and research facilities, has resulted in a growing problem of vibration serviceability of architectural structures. A PTMD is made of weight plates, springs, and steel plates with a fraction of the structure?s total weight which can substantially reduce excessive vibrations by moving in the opposite direction of the structure. The PTMD device is portable and can be placed directly on a floor or installed within a floor plenum. Additionally, PTMD can be tuned using a smartphone application without the need for highly technical personnel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will examine how emergent bilinguals and others participate in language and literacy use in and outside of school and use that knowledge to inform the development of computer science curricula. One component of the project extends existing curriculum development and learning research as emergent bilinguals learn computational thinking in courses designed to leverage their language use. The second component engages New York City educators, community groups, and adults in understanding how computing can be integrated into larger multilingual education initiatives in and outside of schools.<br/><br/>The research builds on a theory of social language use, known as translanguaging, to frame the design of curriculum and professional development materials. The central research question asks how translanguaging pedagogy can be used to integrate the literacy practices of multiple human languages, computer code, and school disciplines (e.g., science, language arts) in meaningful ways. Iterations of the curriculum and professional development design will study the ways that students use language to talk about computing in and outside of schools and how teachers learn with the professional development materials. Case studies of students and teachers working in and out of schools will be collected to illustrate the instructional units, how they involve computational thinking, and how language use unfolds as students work. The research will result in new models for 1) how translanguaging approaches can support emergent bilinguals and other students to learn computational literacies, 2) how computational literacy use outside of school can be connected to school-based practices, and 3) how professional development can be designed for teachers to infuse computational literacies into middle school curricula that support students with diverse language backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It enables applications across various fields and has garnered significant attention from both industry and academia. However, the limited resources on edge platforms, such as edge servers and Internet of Things devices, hinder the ability to deliver fast and accurate responses to queries from deep learning prediction tasks. As a result, only some deep learning tasks and smaller DNN models suitable for edge deployment are feasible. To overcome this limitation, this project explores a new adaptive approach in building deep learning systems. The systems will make real-time adjustments to the DNNs executed for prediction tasks based on the varying resource demands arising from three critical dimensions -- variable task complexity, fluctuating inference workloads, and resource contention in multi-tenant edge environments. The goal is to optimize both system efficiency and accuracy. Realizing the envisioned adaptiveness will facilitate the effective deployment of deep learning techniques across diverse applications and environments. <br/><br/>This research has the potential to open new possibilities for the development of novel edge applications that were previously limited by resource constraints. It will enable a broader range of deep learning tasks to be executed on edge platforms, along with more powerful DNN models, a capability critical in fully unleashing the potential of edge intelligence. The practical impact of the project will be demonstrated in a variety of applications, and in particular, applications that enhance elder care through collaboration with the Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer?s Disease.

One project is concerned with the rate of transfer of energy in the excited molecule to another molecule, where theory will be developed that describes the process in terms of electrons excited in the donor molecule that transfer their energy to electrons in the acceptor molecule. By using a special model of interactions of electronic states of the molecules, the theory makes it possible to incorporate the influence of other nearby molecules or nanoparticles on the energy transfer process, and in some cases leading to enhanced rates or increased range of transfer, as is important in many kinds of optical devices. Another component of the research is concerned with the influence of quantum light in the form of entangled photons on the light absorption. Here time-dependent quantum theory is used to study the evolution of entanglement as energy transfers from light to electrons (i.e., converting quantum light to quantum electrons).  Also being studied are the properties of molecules that are in the entangled states to understand how their properties are different from those in unentangled states. This work is fundamental to technologies involved in photon-based quantum computers and in devices for secure communications. The students and postdocs who work on this project, including a significant number of women and minorities, will be trained in theory development and computational applications that they can use for both academic and industrial jobs related to new device technologies.  In addition, there will be outreach to K-12 groups, undergraduate training, numerous seminars and workshops, and communication with the public.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor George Schatz and his team will develop theories and computational methods for (1) describing single photon resonant energy transfer between molecules using real-time electronic structure methods, (2) characterizing the entanglement properties of molecular electronic (and vibronic) states, with emphasis on states that are excited by two-photon absorption, and (3) developing a time-domain description of the excitation of molecules by two-entangled photons that couples quantum electrodynamics to electronic structure theory to study the evolution of entanglement from photons to electrons as characterized using measures of the entanglement known as entanglement witness. The proposed research addresses several knowledge gaps that relate to the interaction of both classical and quantum light with molecules in complex environments.  The use of real-time electronic structure methods for energy transfer provides the opportunity to describe energy transfer mediated by nearby molecules or nanoparticles. For quantum light that involves entangled photons, it has recently been demonstrated that photon entanglement can for some problems be converted into electronic entanglement, but the underlying rules for this are not known. The proposed research will use concepts from quantum information science to characterize the electronic entanglement properties of molecules that are important in two photon absorption, including collectivity/Schmidt numbers and Shannon entropy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project, named FIERCE, will lay the groundwork for this climate-smart ecosystem in the CRB states of Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. Through a two-tiered system, FIERCE will develop the scaffolding for the following underlying program focus areas: Use-inspired Research and Development, Translation of Innovations to Practice, Workforce Development, Ecosystem Partnerships, and Indigenous Innovations. Use-inspired research projects within FIERCE will be used to develop solutions and tools for measuring and verifying their effectiveness to ensure they reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases. FIERCE will engage with all citizens to strengthen existing and create new distributed workforce development programs, especially in Indigenous communities who, as holders of large tracts of sovereign lands in the West, are essential partners to a climate-smart future beginning in the region. Finally, FIERCE will translate innovations to practice through strategic partnerships with regional economic development organizations, entrepreneurs, state agencies, and climate-smart incubators.<br/><br/>Increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases from a fossil-fuel-based economy have caused a dangerous increase in global temperatures causing megafires and megadroughts that have impacted community infrastructure, food and fiber availability, water quality and quantity, and human health. Climate-smart solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon, and increase regional climate adaptation while maintaining or increasing economic output are required to solve these destructive problems. The FIERCE engine will research, develop, identify, and translate climate-smart solutions and products through a unique ecosystem of agricultural, forestry, energy, educational, and business development partners in the region. In the development phase, FIERCE will strengthen existing partnerships and build new relationships with direct funding sources that can infuse capital and invest long-term in the FIERCE Engine. Working groups for each of the FIERCE focal areas will convene to identify, synthesize, and prioritize regional projects and ideas for FIERCE to support in the growth phase. Outcomes of this work will generate publications and reports that will be used to guide further Engine development, strengthened partnerships committed to the climate change and societal goals underlying the FIERCE vision, and the foundation for a resilient ecosystem that fosters creativity, inclusion, and economically-viable solutions to climate change.

They are sophisticated ways of organizing data so that a user can efficiently retrieve certain information about the data. Some applications have data gradually evolving over time, hence, data structures also need to be quickly reorganizable to reflect the data updates for such applications. A notable class of data structures are streaming algorithms, which process input data in the sequential order while using very small memory. A streaming algorithm maintains a data structure and keeps updating it as the input is being processed, without having to remember all the input data. This situation occurs wherever large amounts of data just move through, without being stored, and certain types of summary information have to be generated, as, e.g., in internet switches. This project aims to deepen the understanding of what efficient data structures and small space streaming algorithms can and cannot do. The project also creates opportunities for students to learn about small-space algorithms in a new graduate course and undergraduate seminars.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is the tradeoffs between memory consumption, running time and accuracy for data structures and streaming algorithms. This project studies both upper and lower bound questions in several directions, including the static dictionary problem, polynomial lower bounds for dynamic data structures, stronger lower bounds for dynamic data structures under space restrictions, as well as graph problems in multi-pass streaming, and algorithms for insertion-only streams. While studying these specific questions, the more essential objective of the project is to develop generic techniques for achieving low costs and high accuracy data structures and techniques for reasoning about their limitations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers currently imagine that most RNA molecules wiggle and shift shapes to carry out their functions, but experimentally visualizing the many conformations of any RNA has been difficult. The broader impacts of the proposed research include establishing standardized data sets and methods disseminated through challenges, publications, public data, and code to the broad community of scientists who are now focusing on RNA, including experts, biotechnology companies, academic trainees from underrepresented backgrounds, and citizen scientists who engage in RNA research through a long-standing video game called Eterna. If successful, this work will drive the development of methods that could be applied to visualize and dissect many RNA-based machines of biological or biotechnological interest.  <br/><br/>The proposed research has two aims: (1) to design, model, and experimentally probe RNA systems with discrete conformational states whose populations can be intentionally tuned, and (2) to characterize and challenge the broader artificial intelligence and computational communities to predict the continuous conformational ensembles of ribozymes, riboswitches, and synthetic RNAs. In both aims, the research will evaluate accuracy through double-blind studies in which predictions from one set of personnel ? including independent labs, Eterna citizen scientists, and predictors in the biennial Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction ? will be tested through experimental data collected by an independent set of personnel. The research will advance innovative interdisciplinary approaches, bringing together high-throughput RNA biochemistry, crowdsourcing, computer modeling, and cutting-edge cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in the labs of the principal investigators, as well as the state of the art in deep learning research, molecular dynamics simulations, and sociology through collaborators and community-wide open science challenges.

Effective tracking of these inflammatory processes in real time is challenging because the chemical environment in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is difficult to access and sample. Moreover, many key mediators of inflammatory diseases are extremely short-lived in the body. Profiling these short-lived biomolecules that mediate disease and response to medicine would enhance our ability to diagnose, monitor, treat, and prevent GI disorders. The current gold standard for monitoring the GI tract relies on invasive endoscopic biospies or non-real-time stool analysis. Commercial diagnostic pills such as the video capsule endoscopy provide a non-invasive real-time alternative as a powerful technology. However, electronic-only systems are functionally limited since they cannot directly monitor the gut chemical environment. This project aims to develop inexpensive and non-invasive miniaturized ingestible sensors that tap into the biochemical in-body domain to surpass the limited accuracy of existing methods. The proposed secure hybrid bio-electronic sensors will enable real-time and accurate tracking of disease progression in a home setting while protecting confidential medical information. Beyond healthcare, this platform technology has transformative potential for addressing broader societal challenges. It can provide an unprecedented tool for gaining insights into internal bodily events, facilitating early detection of water contamination crises, and supporting sustainable manufacturing practices. Furthermore, the program integrates education into its core mission. Students from K-12 to graduate levels will be exposed and trained to develop semiconductor-enabled platforms that interface with other diverse fields, such as Biomedical Engineering. By transcending traditional Electrical Engineering disciplines and fostering interdisciplinary learning, the program aims to cultivate a diverse and globally competitive semiconductor workforce. <br/><br/>This project will create the first-of-its-kind secure hybrid bio-electronic sensors, thereby establishing the field of Cyber-Secure Biological Systems (CSBS), for accurate, reliable, and safe real-time in-body monitoring. CSBS platforms will use genetically engineered biological systems augmented with secure integrated circuits for biochemical sensing, providing reliable data generation and communication abilities. Engineered living systems of CSBS, such as bacterial cells made to sense different analytes, achieve high specificity and sensitivity in harsh environments, e.g., human gut. The core intellectual contributions of this program are to: 1) create a novel secure miniaturized ingestible capsule that measures extremely short-lived disease biomarkers in the GI tract, 2) design effective information transfer mechanisms to couple bacterial-cell sensors with integrated electronics under tight constraints of power and size, 3) develop an ultra-low-power multi-modal sensor integrated circuit for cross-validation of biomarker detection to achieve high accuracy, 4) self-power these hybrid bio-electronic sensors by harvesting energy in the GI environment, and 5) develop a physical-layer security design and evaluation framework for the resource-constrained sensors, including the first open-source library of analog/radio-frequency (RF) security primitives and a dynamically-adaptive security protocol to minimize the security overhead. The new field of CSBS, tightly coupling semiconductor-enabled platforms with synthetic biology for accurate real-time monitoring and control, has the potential for significantly transforming research in medicine and environmental science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the integration of renewables through power electronic inverters introduces uncertainties to grid planning and operations due to their intermittent and variable nature. While battery-based energy storage systems can mitigate the impacts from renewables, they are also integrated through power electronic inverters. All these factors are shaping today?s power grid into an inverter-dense grid, posing a considerable challenge in the computer simulation of its tremendously complex, multi-timescale dynamics, ranging from microseconds to hours. This project aims to establish a unified multi-timescale modeling and solution framework addressing this challenge, and will bring transformative changes to the field of power system simulation. The intellectual merits of the project include assimilating heterogeneous multiscale methods and semi-analytical solution methods for highly accurate and efficient simulations. The broader impacts of the project include an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of inverter-dense grids, the establishment of a high-performance multi-timescale simulator paradigm, the fostering of interdisciplinary education and the facilitation of power grid decarbonization. <br/><br/>Power system simulation is crucial for assessing grid stability and reliability under disturbances. The multi-timescale behaviors of an inverter-dense grid may involve electromagnetic transient, electromechanical and quasi-steady-state dynamics. Accurate simulation of such a system requires solving numerous nonlinear and stiff differential and algebraic equations at a small time step over an extended period. The heterogeneous multiscale methods developed by the project will allow case-specific model reduction and solver parameterization to enable automatic zoom-in and -out of the simulation resolution between macroscopic and microscopic timescales on the fly of simulation. Variable-step and -order mechanisms will be employed in each timescale through semi-analytical solvers. The validation studies will encompass sub-synchronous oscillation, transient stability, and black-start scenarios in realistic grid models with a penetration of inverter-based resources ranging from 50% to 100%. The results from the project have the potential to advance knowledge in efficient simulation methodologies, which are also applicable to other multi-timescale networked systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These devices rely on carefully arranging particles under flowing conditions, a process often requiring the controlled movement of particles across the flow. Typically, this movement is achieved by using external fields like electricity, magnetism, acoustics, or optics, but this method has limitations and depends on specific particle properties. An alternative approach known as elasto-inertial focusing, instead balances natural forces within the flow to concentrate particles along the centerline of the device. While this approach promises a noninvasive way to achieve the desired particle movement, it has challenges. When dealing with certain types of fluids (polymeric or non-Newtonian), there is a limit to how fast particles can be processed due to the onset of elastic instabilities. To address these challenges, the research will develop novel experimental methods and numerical simulations that go beyond the limitations of microfluidic devices. Experiments and simulations together should provide a more thorough understanding of the distribution of velocity and particle patterns in both the fluid and particle phases. In addition to advancing scientific knowledge, this research has a broader impact on education. The team is committed to providing unique opportunities for interdisciplinary STEM education and training. The goal is to equip a diverse group of students and researchers to emerge as the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers. The planned outreach activities include creating hands-on activities for K-12 programs, with a focus on underrepresented students.<br/><br/>This project aims to uncover new and essential understandings of the physics involved in fluid flows carrying non-Brownian particles within complex solvents. The proposed effort combines highly resolved numerical simulations with the experiments, which include time-resolved and highly resolved planar particle image velocimetry (PIV), particle tracking velocimetry (PTV), and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), focused specifically on suspensions of spherical particles in complex fluids. Using a comprehensive approach that integrates both numerical and experimental studies, the project explores specific conditions defined by considerations of particle concentrations and fluid rheological properties. The primary goal is to provide a better physical understanding of both the flow characteristics and instabilities in the presence of particles and complex fluids. A better understanding of these flows has implications for various industries, including inkjet printing, biomedical devices, and even enhanced oil recovery. This study has the potential to benefit society by providing valuable insights and tools for effectively managing particle-laden flows in practical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On one hand, there has been tremendous progress in the past decade in our understanding of the algebraic structures underlying quantum field theory as expressed in terms of the geometry and topology of low-dimensional manifolds. On the other hand, the arithmetic topology dictionary provides a sturdy bridge between the topology of manifolds and the arithmetic of number fields. Thus, one can now port over quantum field theoretic ideas to number theory. The program will bring together a wide range of mathematicians and physicists working on adjacent areas to explore the emerging notion of arithmetic quantum field theory as a tool to bring quantum physics to bear on questions of interest for the theory of automorphic forms, harmonic analysis and L-functions, and conversely to explore potential geometric and physical consequences of arithmetic ideas.<br/>The conference website is https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event/aqftconf/ where recordings of the talks and notes from lectures will be made widely available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although ENSO is climatically forced in the Pacific Ocean, there are strong environmental teleconnections with the Atlantic Ocean.<br/><br/>Gaining a historical perspective on ENSO frequency and intensity is integral to understanding the threat from future ENSO events. Currently, modeling predictions of how ENSO would respond in a warmed world do not provide a clear scientific understanding.<br/><br/>The researchers aim to develop a composite record of ENSO history based on eight highly resolved sedimentary records that will produce records of ENSO variability spanning the last 5000 years from northern South America.  These records will be added to other records to provide a composite record of ENSO from six mainland lakes, including one record from the Galapagos Islands and one from a nearshore marine setting in Peru. Through this analysis, the research team aims to reduce idiosyncrasies induced by reliance on a single site to provide the history of ENSO.<br/><br/>This is a potentially high-risk and high-reward project as it breaks new ground in Intellectual Merit by developing new ENSO records.  The project has excellent potential Broader Impacts because challenging scientific orthodoxy and seeking to better understand fundamental atmospheric physics that governs atmospheric dynamics is critical to addressing a range of atmospheric phenomena.

Both landslides initiated on steep, forested slopes; the 11-Mile Slide killed six people and cut off power, telephone landlines, and access to about 75 homes, while the Middle Ridge Slide initiated at a switchback of a gravel road. The team of investigators on this RAPID project hypothesize that 1) the high winds combined with moderate rainfall of the November 2023 storm triggered the Wrangell landslides, and 2) the presence of a gravel road affected the extent and trajectory of the Middle Ridge Slide. The team's primary objective is to capture the ephemeral data from these landslides to determine their initiation mechanisms and processes, soil thickness, and the role that trees and infrastructure played.  What is learned from analysis of the data will inform the development of early warning systems for communities throughout Southeast Alaska. A post-data collection workshop will provide the Wrangell community with a greater understanding of local geology and landslide mechanisms, and an opportunity to guide the direction of future early warning systems and/or landslide event response.<br/><br/>The investigators will capture field data that can be incorporated into landslide models, thereby constraining input parameters with on-the-ground measurements to allow for back analysis of these landslide events. While previous research has established correlations among landslides, forest cover, slope angle, and weather events, the work was done at lower spatial resolution; this RAPID research will collect site-specific data (including surficial and bedrock geology, forest characteristics, landslide geometry, and storm characteristics) necessary to: evaluate existing landslide models; understand initiation mechanisms; and determine if wind variables should be incorporated with precipitation and hydrologic observations for landslide prediction models. Results from field work will be incorporated into a statewide landslide inventory, and provide high-resolution data on local surficial and bedrock geology. Cost data on the response to these landslides will be combined with similar data obtained during the December 2020 landslides in Haines, Alaska, providing necessary information for emergency managers in small communities throughout Southeast Alaska.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Located in the Piedmont Triad region of central North Carolina, the Engine will provide the resources to accelerate transition of use-inspired RM technologies into commercial products, creating an economic driver for the region and its diverse communities. This growth in the RM industry helps to address long-term regional challenges related to retraining and upskilling of an underemployed local workforce left behind by the loss of tobacco, textiles and furniture jobs throughout the region of service. The project prioritizes building a technical infrastructure for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the region to reduce disparities for underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Regenerative medicine promises to offer permanent cures rather than relief from symptoms, which is an important advance given rising healthcare costs. The goal is to break the cycle of dependence on lifelong maintenance drugs and therapies. Areas of technical focus include standardized materials and processes for the production of RM products that can be brought to market. Industry partners and community stakeholders will drive the direction of the technology development, while allowing for creative innovation through the academic research environment. Technologies born from the Piedmont Triad Engine will be commercialized through a robust business development system, giving rise to new companies and increased workforce demand that will be met by the Piedmont Triad Engine?s partners including two-year community and technical colleges.<br/><br/>This NSF Engine will be built upon industry use-inspired and guided research spanning product ideation and development, translational science, biomanufacturing, and next generation strategies, including In-Space RM technologies. An Innovation, Translation, & Education Core system will be developed across partnering academic institutions, including at HBCUs and technical colleges in the region of service, that combines multiple areas of scientific expertise to address challenges in the multidisciplinary field of RM. The resources provided by the Piedmont Triad Engine will increase the region?s competitive advantage and leverage its national reputation as a hub for the RM industry, attracting more capital and new companies to the region.<br/><br/>The Piedmont Triad Engine will have transformative impact on the region by creating a new trained RM workforce that will give the U.S. a competitive edge in the development and manufacture of next-generation RM therapies with potential to impact millions of individuals worldwide. RM businesses that emerge from technical innovations will be economic drivers, attracting investment from stakeholders across the nation. Creation of new RM products and businesses will create self-sustaining regional prosperity with economic impact for many communities in the region, including historically disadvantaged Black communities in the Piedmont Triad region.<br/><br/>This NSF Engine project is built on a strong research and development portfolio at WFIRM and emphasizes the translation to practice and commercialization steps of building an innovation ecosystem in partnership with strong workforce development organizations already in the region of service.

This megadrought is an ongoing climate crisis that is severely impacting natural ecosystems, managed forests, agricultural systems, and human water resources. Despite such serious consequences, our understanding of the megadrought is quite limited. Specifically, the research community lacks a comprehensive understanding of how the megadrought has impacted soil moisture, particularly the deeper moisture pools that are critical for vegetation health. There is also a limited understanding of how carbon and water cycling have changed over the last 23 years; an important indicator of ecosystem function that mediates global climate feedbacks. This research enhances our ecological understanding of how drylands have been impacted by the megadrought, which sets the stage for a more predictive understanding of future climate change impacts. This knowledge is transferable to other dryland and non-dryland biomes, as such megadroughts are projected to increase in frequency and severity globally in the coming decades. <br/><br/>To accomplish these aims, the research combines hundreds of long-running soil moisture depth profiles with remotely-sensed estimates of shallow soil moisture, deep water availability, and groundwater. These data allow us to assess the impacts of the megadrought on plant-available water, and serve as a crucial validation of these remotely-sensed products for drought monitoring. Data from 21 eddy covariance towers are paired with a new gridded dataset of empirically-modeled ecosystem fluxes to uncover the drivers of dryland ecosystem function, and quantify the impact of the megadrought on carbon-water fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolutions. By synthesizing these data sources their unique strengths are leveraged; addressing detailed mechanistic questions with in situ data, and examining broad trends in carbon-water cycling using modeled and remotely-sensed data. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Ecosystem Science and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Found in bacteria, plants, parasites, and mammals, EV-RNAs play pivotal roles in gene regulation across various organisms. The Ascano and Weaver laboratories aim to elucidate the complex processes governing EV-RNA assembly and uptake in cells. Recently, the Weaver laboratory identified a unique class of EVs enriched with a diverse set of RNAs. By utilizing the Ascano lab's innovative photochemical biology method to crosslink labeled RNAs to proteins, the team will explore how these RNAs are secreted out of the cell into EVs and then received by a different set of cells where they can influence the gene regulatory program. The research will yield deeper understanding of cellular communication and introduce groundbreaking methodologies, shedding light on shared pathways between viruses and EVs. The broader impacts of this research extend beyond the scientific realm, with potential biotechnology applications for improving agricultural output, environmental monitoring capabilities, and human health. Furthermore, the project will enable training of the next generation of scientists and generate new technologies and knowledge to benefit the scientific community and the general public.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance understanding of EV-RNAs and their role in intercellular communication.

As a result, conservation programs have sought to minimize human impact on the landscape through land management programs and resettlement of people who called national parks home. One such national park is located in one of the most biodiverse regions on earth. In the belief that humans may be negatively impacting this biodiversity, the livelihoods of long-term residents have been significantly altered. They have been discouraged from carrying out farming, herding animals, gathering wood for fire or building houses and are also no longer allowed to hunt. The terraces on which they once lived are being actively reforested as part of a national conservation program. In addition, the location of their traditional settlements are being shifted from high altitude terraces to valley bottoms: a process that may expose the parks inhabitants to geomorphological hazards such as landslides. However, archaeological evidence suggests that the concern that people are negatively impacting the environment may be misplaced and shows that people have occupied this landscape for thousands of years. <br/><br/>An interdisciplinary team conducts excavations and employs archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological, geomorphological and isotopic evidence at a key site to answer how humans managed forests, planted crops, managed their animals and managed erosional processes over deep time. As the original community members of the valley are being resettled, traditional knowledge associated with how landscapes, plants and animals were managed is being eroded.

MOFs are useful for a wide range of applications, from charge and ion transport, separations, gas- and solution-based sensing, catalysis, environmental remediation, and more. The formation of large-area separation membranes is especially significant for a range of gas separations, such as for CO2 removal from air or flue gas. Small-scale (1 cm2) MOF-based membranes have shown utility for a range of high-value separation applications. However, a lack of fundamental knowledge exists to develop easily scalable, advanced manufacturing process for large areas of MOF membranes that still preserve lab-scale performance. This award supports research using a combination of x-ray probes, modeling, and experimental techniques to fully understand how MOF thin films form. This fundamental knowledge is used to develop a continuous, roll-to-roll coating technique that can create large-area MOF thin films with outstanding separation performance. Students are engaged to contribute to the development of new MOF crystallization theories and modeling tools that can be used in research as well as industrial environments. The project endeavors to train students, particularly from underrepresented minority backgrounds, to become successful chemical engineers and material scientists. <br/><br/>Large area, scalable thin-film MOF formation required for low-resistance, low-cost separations is difficult to achieve due to limited know-how on controlling solution chemistry for precision synthesis of MOF thin films using a scalable solution coating process. This project uses an integrated approach involving in-situ experimentation, modeling, and separation measurements to perform fundamental manufacturing research on MOF thin film formation using scalable coating techniques, such as flow coating, or the recently developed percolation-assisted coating (PAC) method. Rapid timescale, in-situ x-ray scattering measurements coupled with microkinetic modeling are used to understand thin film MOF nucleation and growth mechanisms under evaporative/pervaporation conditions. The microkinetic model simulates billions of oligomerization reactions to predict nucleation rate, growth rate, and size distribution. The microkinetic model helps in selecting a range of operating conditions for high throughput (HT) PAC experiments for the optimization of MOF thin film structure and maximizing performance. By connecting it to a gas chromatograph, the HT setup is also used to obtain gas separation factors for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 mixtures. The ensuing process-structure-property relationships guide the scaling of the PAC method to grow 50 cm2  MOF films, followed by a model-based design of a roll-to-roll coating system for large-scale manufacturing of MOF films.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main hypothesis to be tested in this proposed work is that while reactive bromine still dominates ozone depletion chemistry for most of the Arctic, chemical synergies with reactive iodine may accelerate the process, particularly in some regions. Success in this project is likely to have a strong positive impact on the Arctic atmospheric chemistry community, the broader climate research community, and the public.<br/><br/>In the previous NSF-funded project, which focused primarily on bromine chemistry, the research team utilized multiple-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations from free-floating buoys as a part of the NSF Arctic Observing Network and determined that bromine is the dominant ozone depleting reactive halogen in the Arctic. New research indicates that iodine may have a more critical role than previously assumed. These existing measurements will now be reanalyzed with a focus on iodine chemistry and compared to recent observations of halogens within the Arctic. Seasonal and regional distributions of iodine and bromine amounts will be quantified and validated with collaborative ground-level measurements and a 1-D chemical model will be used to determine the relative role of iodine and bromine in ozone depletion chemistry at buoy locations. A postdoctoral researcher and an undergraduate student will be supported during this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Engineered varieties of soil bacteria may help protect our soils by detecting and removing pollutants, or reducing the nitrogen needed to fertilize farmlands. To engineer soil bacteria efficiently and with minimal risk to the environment, a better understanding of how important genes are turned on and off is needed. This CAREER research focuses on epigenetic regulation ? gene expression that is controlled by chemical modifications to the DNA-and its role in the survival and performance of native and engineered strains of soil bacteria. This work will be the source of projects for a research-oriented upper-level undergraduate course and for interactive educational resources that teach the principles of bioengineering to undergraduates. <br/><br/>Epigenetic regulation of gene expression via genome methylation in prokaryotes has been vastly understudied. Differences in genome methylation have been observed under changing growth conditions, such as between exponential and stationary phase growth, which suggests that the growth environment significantly influences epigenetic regulation. However, understanding of epigenetic regulation in synthetic biology chassis organisms beyond E. coli, and in real-world environmental contexts, is extremely limited. Pseudomonas putida is a versatile Gram-negative organism that is native to soil, and is being developed as a chassis for numerous industrial and environmental applications. Yet, no comprehensive study of epigenetic regulation, nor any investigation of epigenetic effects on synthetic gene circuit function, has yet been reported in P. putida. This CAREER program will examine how genome methylation affects gene expression changes that are essential for the transition of P. putida from laboratory to soil conditions. These epigenetic changes may similarly affect the function of integrated synthetic gene circuits. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact of genome methylation on gene expression and synthetic gene circuit function in P. putida within its native soil environment. To achieve the overall objective, two specific objectives will be pursued: 1) Determine the effect of genome methylation on endogenous gene expression of P. putida in soil. 2) Control synthetic gene circuit expression in P. putida by modulation of DNA methylation. The proposed research will be complemented by educational activities that create new open-access higher education resources for teaching the core principles of synthetic biology. The research proposed in this CAREER program will uncover important epigenetic principles that permit engineered organisms to thrive within a complex environment. The knowledge will be broadly translatable to the optimization of genetically engineered microbes for a range of environmental and industrial applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the power of the internet, there's a fast-growing global interest in forming distributive gas sensing networks that could enable us to continuous monitor gas threat broadly. This has led to a rising demand for the next generation of small, lightweight, low-power, and low-cost gas sensing devices with high sensing performance. Despite the remarkable sensing capabilities offered by mid-wave infrared gas sensing methods, substantial challenges persist in reducing device size, power consumption, and production costs, limiting their application in modern sensor network scenarios. This research project thus aims to explore innovative mid-wave infrared photonic engineering methods to advance gas sensing technologies, striving for efficiency, compactness, and cost-effectiveness. Beyond the research focus, the project also fosters a STEM-competent workforce in photonics. Photonics is foundational to many cutting-edge technologies, impacting a significant portion of the economy and enabling future advanced manufacturing processes. To stimulate the future generation?s interest in light and photonics, the PI will create an education outreach program to help rural STEM teachers to develop new photonic teaching modules, and to promote student participation in afterschool education events. The PI will also engage undergraduate students in research activities to support their STEM career path.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive understanding of quantum-inspired new states of light within the mid-wave infrared range, spanning 3-5 microns. The obtained knowledge will facilitate the control of their non-trivial light-matter interaction properties to enhance the performance of three critical optical components in mid-wave infrared gas sensing systems: the light source, photodetector, and light-gas interaction waveguide. The intellectual merit lies in the marriage of quantum-inspired parity-time-symmetry and topological photonic principles with the mid-wave infrared photonic engineering research. Specifically, this project will pursue three research objectives: 1) enabling parity-time-symmetry control in active resonant gratings to overcome the low extraction efficiency and multimodal broadband emission constraints and facilitate the development of bright and cost-effective mid-wave infrared light emitters; 2) employing a novel low-cost, self-oriented wet chemical synthesis method to prepare high-quality PbSe thin films for boosting the performance of uncooled mid-wave infrared photodetectors; and 3) engineering topological sensing waveguides to overcome the inherent limitations of on-chip gas sensing, such as intrinsic structural disorder and fabrication resolution. Overall, the project's outcomes will broaden the portfolio of mid-wave infrared photonic engineering strategies, elevating their technological impact to revolutionize gas sensing technologies while adhering to size, weight, power, and cost requirements.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems division(ECCS), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical vapor polymerization is a process where gas phase chemical species are reacted on surfaces to create thin polymer films. Although chemical vapor polymerization has been widely adopted by industry to create polymer coatings, e.g., for the microelectronics industry, the polymer coatings have been limited to flat films. This award supports fundamental research needed to expand the capabilities of chemical vapor polymerization to large-scale manufacturing of surface coatings with tailored nanoscopic structures, including end-attached nanofiber arrays or ?nanograsses?, quasi-two-dimensional networks of interconnected nanofibers or ?nanosheets?, and rigid end-attached nanofibers or ?bed-of-nanonails?. Potential applications for this next generation of nanostructured coatings include improved adhesives, biomedical sensors, biomaterials for growing replacement organs, and water filtration membranes. This collaborative project provides an outstanding context for the multidisciplinary training of graduate students in next-generation manufacturing processes. The project also integrates an initiative that is focused on the engagement of veteran students in advanced manufacturing research. <br/><br/>The scientific approach underlying this project is based on a convergence of ideas from two largely disconnected fields ? liquid crystals and chemical vapor polymerization. Specifically, thin films of liquid crystals supported on surfaces are used as dynamic molecular templates to guide the formation of polymeric nanostructures via chemical vapor polymerization. The latter process is achieved by thermal sublimation and pyrolysis of [2.2]paracyclophanes, which subsequently polymerize into shape-controlled nanostructures templated by the liquid crystal films. The research elucidates the chemical and physical processes that control the formation of newly discovered polymeric morphologies, e.g., nanofiber sheets, that can be accessed at scale by chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystal films. Fundamental questions regarding the role of topological defects in liquid crystal-templated chemical vapor polymerization are investigated by using multiphase liquid crystal films containing dispersions of microparticles and immiscible oil droplets. Post-synthesis processes are also explored as an approach to achieving an expanded palette of nanostructures and functional properties, e.g., the synthesis of electrically conductive and morphologically tunable nanofiber arrays prepared via post-deposition pyrolysis. Other key aspects of the research revolve around the manufacturing of functional thin films with emergent photoluminescent, electrical, and transport properties. A unifying fundamental challenge underlying the approach is understanding how the information encoded in the atomic-scale structure, e.g., chirality, of reactive monomers is amplified across spatial scales by the liquid crystal during chemical vapor polymerization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lakes are widely regarded as sentinels of climate change and, among these, polar lakes are the most sensitive. Beneath meters of permanent ice and liquid water, many Antarctic lakes contain complex microbial communities that are already being transformed by climate change. The structurally complex spatial patterns that these microbes create provide the opportunity to pursue research questions about spatial ecology that cannot be addressed elsewhere. This project focuses on research that will advance understanding of the spatial structure of benthic communities in Antarctic lakes, their relationships with environmental conditions, and predictions for likely changes in the future. This project will also advance methods in integrating the morphology and spatial patterning of modern microbial communities in relationship to their biophysical and biochemical environments. The quantitative framework being developed has potential to refine understanding of controls on microbial community patterning and thus interpretation of both the effects of climate change and ancient fossil microbial communities in the geologic record. Such understanding will address key questions about Earth?s evolutionary and environmental history and future.<br/><br/>Lake Vanda in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctic, has modern microbial pinnacles covering its lake floor. Using existing datasets on spatial structure of benthic communities from 37 sites on the floor of Lake Vanda, the project team will apply recent theories from Spatial Ecology to investigate the mechanisms that give rise to spatial patterns of pinnacles formed by benthic microbes. The work addresses two questions: (1) What are the morphological and spatial patterns of pinnacles and how do they vary over developmental stages, along environment gradients, and from 2013 to 2023? And (2) what mechanisms give rise to the geometry of individual pinnacles and their spatial distribution? Lake Vanda provides an exceptional opportunity to address these questions. It features well characterized gradients in sedimentation, nutrients, irradiance, transport mechanism, and colonization history. Benthic communities at different locations in the lake manifest distinct spatial patterns, as they experience distinct conditions. Lake level has increased  >10 m in the past few decades, creating additional opportunities for a ?natural experiment? on pattern development by comparing relatively newly flooded substrates (pinnacles of 1 to 15 years old) with deeper, well-developed mats (> 70 years old). Since microbial communities respond to environmental change rapidly, analyses can characterize changes in patterns in pinnacle spatial data collected 9 years apart (Dec 2013 and Jan 2023), providing the opportunity to directly assess responses of spatially self-organized ecosystems to environmental change. As such, Lake Vanda is a natural laboratory that allows research (1) to effectively sort out mechanisms of pattern formation affecting benthic microbial communities residing there; and (2) to test the theory of spatial self-organization: mechanisms of pattern formation and responses to perturbations, applicable to ecosystems worldwide. Research questions will be addressed by integrating existing datasets, spatial pattern analyses, Bayesian statistical models, and process-based numerical models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, more than 2 billion people are iron deficient because their plant-based diets are not a rich source of iron, making iron deficiency the most prevalent nutritional problem in the world today. Clearly, understanding iron metabolism in plants is crucial, both from the point of view of improving plant growth and crop yields, as well as improving human nutrition.  Despite progress in tracing how iron moves throughout the plant, scientists still do not understand how plants integrate information about iron supply and light conditions. This project will help to explain how a protein called URI receives and then conveys information about both the iron status of a cell and light quality.  In partnership with the New Hampshire Academy of Science, students in grades 6-12 will be offered research experiences that will raise their appreciation for all that plants do and teach them how to leverage the power of plants to ensure long term sustainability and health. NHAS runs summer and after school discovery-based scientific research programs for students from a wide geographic section of NH and VT. Their outreach covers rural areas where students generally have few opportunities to experience authentic scientific research.  Broader impacts will also include training the next generation of scientists. Undergraduates from several different mentoring programs will participate in the proposed work.<br/><br/>Iron is an essential nutrient for plants, yet too much iron can be toxic.  Therefore, plants only take up iron when needed. The essential bHLH transcription factor, URI/bHLH121, is required for mounting the iron deficiency response.  A phosphorylated form of URI accumulates under iron deficiency, forms heterodimers with subgroup bHLH IVc transcription factors and induces transcription of another class of transcription factors, the sub-group Ib bHLH. These Ib bHLH in turn heterodimerize with FIT/bHLH29, and drive the transcription of the genes encoding the iron transporter IRT1 and the ferric chelate reductase FRO2, to increase iron uptake. Although the mechanisms controlling iron uptake from the soil are now relatively well understood, little is known about how URI may integrate information about iron supply and light conditions.  Light is required for URI phosphorylation, suggesting that a light-regulated kinase is involved.  Genetic experiments were designed to determine whether URI phosphorylation is a red light or blue light response, and whether members of the photoregulatory kinase (PPK) family are involved.  Experiments will also address a second point in the iron deficiency pathway where light information is required, namely the induction of the FIT transcription factor. The long-term goal is to understand the entire network of genes responsible for orchestrating a coordinated response to iron deficiency at the whole plant level. Such an understanding will transform efforts towards sustainable improvements of crop yields, in terms of plant productivity and nutrient content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They represent a key link in the polar food web as they are prey for penguins, seals and toothed whales. These fish have evolved in the constant, extreme cold for millions of years and therefore, are very sensitive to the increasing water temperatures associated with global warming. These studies will investigate the impacts of incremental heat exposure on the biology of these fishes by examining their ability to respond, or inability to respond, to elevated temperatures. The project will employ cutting-edge technology to examine responses at the cellular level that may help these environmentally sensitive fishes adapt to the challenges of global warming. The primary goal is to increase our collective understanding of how polar ecosystems are likely to be impacted in the coming decades.<br/><br/>Part 2:  The proposed research is designed to use an existing bank of frozen tissues from a species of cold-adapted Antarctic fish to investigate protein-level responses to heat stress. These samples were collected earlier in the PI's career during fieldwork at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Four tissues (control as well as heat- stressed) will be analyzed via mass spectrometry to characterize their proteome, defined as the entire complement of proteins in a sample. This includes both identification and quantification of these proteins. The goal is to determine what mechanisms of response to elevated temperature are available to the extremely cold-adapted, stenothermic fishes of Antarctica. Follow-up analyses will use immunoblotting (Western blotting) with antibodies specific to a sub-set of proteins revealed to be heat-responsive in the proteomic analyses. As this is a Mid-Career Advancement Award, training and mentorship in proteomic analyses for the PI will be supported, with time spent at the partner institution, the University of California, Davis. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>While there has been an increase in the use of genomic technologies to probe gene expression profiles in Antarctic species, few studies exist looking at protein level changes during exposure to heat stress in these organisms. Therefore, the proposed studies would represent a large leap forward in our understanding of how these environmentally sensitive species can, or cannot, respond at the cellular level as the Earth continues to warm and water temperatures rise. As proteins do the ""work"" in the cell, it's vital to understand which proteins are present and in what quantity and how dynamic this ""proteome"" is during stress. The proposed studies would provide this information for thousands of proteins, using already existing samples. The findings would be entirely novel and would allow us a much better picture of how animals that evolved in the cold for millions of years are likely to respond to climate change. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The PI has established relationships with several regional K-12 institutions and will continue to provide outreach in the form of classroom visits and the creation of classroom curricula. The PI has an on-going collaboration with the Oregon Coast Aquarium (Newport, OR) to create novel teaching materials for grades 6-8. The Aquarium has partners in surrounding school districts and will help disseminate videos about marine biology and climate change. Modules concerning polar species will be created under this proposal. An interactive website will be created demonstrating the Antarctic food web.

The model contributes to the science of group decision-making by investigating how stress (biology) and resources (the environment) impact how groups make decisions. The model seeks to explain why some groups of diverse people coalesce and effectively manage shared resources in uncertain environments, while others fail. The results of the project inform decision-makers faced with complex challenges related to climate variability, public health, and defense by building tools for diverse teams to cultivate systems thinking, manage shared resources, and improve cooperation over time. The project also broadens participation in online education and systems thinking skills.<br/><br/>This project develops and tests an embedded Model of Adaptive Capacity (eACM). The eACM proposes that the capacity of groups to continually solve complex problems depends on the ability of individuals to cognize key challenges in a resource system and to converge on joint solutions to those challenges. The eACM couples resource dynamics with individual variation in mind-body systems through the process of group sensemaking. Sensemaking occurs when groups create an understanding of their environment and form joint plans of action for cooperation. The project tests the eACM through behavioral experiments and manipulation of stress. Formal models of the systems dynamics of group decision-making aid in generalizing the results of the experiments. The project pushes the boundaries of theory by converging the study of cognition with the study of stress arousal in strategic decision-making, generating a more integrated explanation for the biological and cognitive foundations of adaptive teams.

The U.S. produces over 100 million metric tons of coal fly ash each year through burning coal for power and has more than two billion metric tons in storage ponds across the country, estimated to contain up to 100 years? worth of U.S. demand of REEs. What is missing is a sustainable, scalable, and economic method of separation. REEs play critical roles in many different technologies, ranging from national defense applications to manufacturing and consumer electronics, to healthcare treatments, and much more. One particularly important industry is clean tech, where REEs are used in high-performance wind turbines and electric vehicles. Currently, the U.S. lacks a stable domestic supply of REEs and is reliant on mining efforts in foreign nations that lack similar labor and environmental protections. This dependence is a strategic vulnerability. Harvesting REEs from coal ash would build a sustainable, diverse, and resilient supply chain of materials needed to support the clean energy transition, as well as create new jobs and provide utilities with an economic pathway to better utilize ash and empty existing ash ponds.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project will optimize a novel ionic-liquid-based recovery process to harvest rare earth elements (REEs) from coal fly ash. The ionic liquid in question has a high binding affinity for REEs and additionally displays unique thermomorphic behavior: upon heating, water and the ionic liquid form a single liquid phase, and REEs are leached from coal fly ash via a proton-exchange mechanism. Upon cooling, the water and IL separate, and leached elements partition between the two phases. The recovery strategy exploits this behavior in a new method that represents a breakthrough technology: the ionic liquid can extract the REEs directly from the solid ash without the need for digestion and separate the REEs from bulk elements. This dramatically lowers chemical consumption and waste generation and simplifies costly downstream processing. In Phase I of the project, efforts are focused on improving REE concentration in the IL phase, developing new processes for purifying REEs from ionic liquid concentrate, and validating the process for a variety of coal ash samples. The output of this project is expected to be comprehensively tested and validated recovery process ready for scaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will investigate completely new light-matter interactions, theoretical and computational approaches, novel polymer semiconductors with tailored electronic structures, and devices to enable optical to electrical transduction of IR light, a fundamentally new capability for organic materials. These materials and devices will satisfy the functional and economic requirements for technologies that can address critical national needs with global societal impacts in climate change, manufacturing, energy, healthcare, information science, consumer applications, future aerospace and defense-wide applications, and many others.

The technology supports a wide range of commercial applications across multiple fields, including semiconductor manufacturing, biomedicine, and healthcare. Although there have been multiple efforts to push the limits of current additive manufacturing technologies, one of the major challenges is how to print and control the surface properties of deposited materials on flexible and porous substrates. The technology addresses this issue by enabling selective sintering of nanomaterials on different types of substrates, such as paper, gauze and even human skin, which enables its commercial application in flexible electronics, medical devices, and personalized healthcare. The technology can be used to print a radio frequency antenna on gauze or human skin to monitor the vital parameters of an individual. The technology can also be used to deposit complex electronic circuits on a flexible polymer film, which can be mounted on a drone to reduce the load weight and attain energy efficiency.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a low-temperature, atmospheric plasma sintering method to deposit nanomaterials on flexible surfaces.

The activation energy provided by the atmospheric plasma and subsequent annealing of nanoparticles by the downstream plasma leads to the formation of a uniform thin film. This technique has been tested for the deposition of gold, silver, and graphene oxide thin films on silicon, glass, and polyimide, as well as screen printed paper electrodes for improving the response of biosensors.

This need is accentuated by the fact that after decades of aggressive miniaturization, electronic devices are currently reaching the end of the road for traditional materials as we ?run out of atoms?. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, a relatively new class of materials consisting of few-atom-thick sheets, provide a platform to address these challenges. Particularly interesting are 2D transition metal carbides, known as MXenes, composed of two to four atomic layers of transition metals separated by an atomic layer of carbon. MXenes are studied for various applications, including energy storage and generation, blocking electromagnetic waves, and antenna. Despite significant progress, room temperature magnetism, important for quantum computation, computer memories, and spintronics, has remained elusive. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, Professor Babak Anasori at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis and Professor Alejandro Strachan at Purdue University and their research groups will design and fabricate novel 2D MXenes that contain rare-earth elements, such as neodymium and gadolinium, and develop a fundamental understanding of how such elements can be used to control the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of these materials. Computational modeling is used to guide the experimental design of these new materials and reduce the number of experiments to the most promising candidates. The team hypothesizes that the use of rare-earth elements in MXenes can lead to the first room-temperature 2D magnets. To accelerate innovation, all experimental and theoretical results produced and models developed will be made accessible for the researchers and educators for online computing. The microscopic images of nanomaterials and 2D materials have been used in many nanoart visualizations, such as NanoArtography, to promote STEM. The nanoart images will be integrated into local nanoscience outreach activities, such as Purdue?s NanoDays, to motivate art-enthusiastic children to have a chance to learn about the science and engineering behind nanoart images.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>2D transition metal carbide MXenes have become one of the largest 2D material families over the past decade. MXenes have metallic electrical conductivities, are hydrophilic, and capable of intercalating a host of ions and organic molecules, leading to outstanding performance in applications such as energy storage, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, wireless communications, catalysis, and biomedicine. Double-transition metal MXenes are a subfamily of MXenes that enable significant tunability in properties by changing the MXenes transition metal compositions. The research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, aims to design, synthesize, and characterize a new family of 2D double-transition metal carbides: rare-earth (RE) f-element 2D MXenes opening the possibility of magnetic properties. This will be accomplished via a synergistic combination of theory and experiments. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of how different rare-earth elements can be incorporated into MXenes and use it to control the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of these novel phases. The limiting factor hindering f-element MXenes is their synthesis that requires the design of novel f-element MAX phase precursors among the large compositional space. This project uses high-throughput first principles and thermodynamic calculations to identify stable precursors and their MXenes and use data science tools to guide experimental efforts. Rare-earth f-element MXenes can have radically different properties that have never been measured in regular MXenes and are absent in other 2D and bulk materials. Rare-earth MXenes can have potential applications from EMI shielding, optoelectronics, and catalysis to quantum computation, spintronics, and magnetoelectronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will explore a particular class of high-performance alloys (printable refractory alloys) that are strong and durable at elevated temperatures and amenable to fabrication using 3D printing. This is important because 3D printing allows for more complex part design, bolsters energy efficiency, and reduces emissions in next-generation systems. The new framework for the accelerated discovery of printable refractory alloys will also ensure that the materials discovered and components fabricated are resilient to global supply chain disruptions, meaning they can be readily acquired even in the case of unexpected supply chain shocks originating from economic, societal, or geo-political risks. The project combines advanced experimental techniques, simulations, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to accelerate alloy and process co-discovery, aligning with the Materials Genome Initiative.<br/><br/>This project addresses a significant limitation in Bayesian optimization for materials discovery: the static nature of the problem formulation??i.e., what quantities to optimize, what quantities to keep above or below a threshold value, and what inputs to change once the iterative process begins.

This flexibility makes them essential for developing the next generation of battery technology, enabling additive manufacturing processes, and mimicking the performance of biological materials. In most gels, however, the solid-like and liquid-like properties are dependent on each other, drastically limiting their utility in industrial and scientific applications. To address this critical knowledge gap, this award aims to design gels with independent elasticity and viscosity by using polymer additives. These specific polymers possess endgroups that bind to dispersed colloids to generate stiff solid-like materials that readily break down during processing to create low viscosity fluids. This approach will result in efficient and cost-effective materials comprised primarily of solvent but with mechanical properties comparable to high performance engineering materials. The properties of these polymer-linked gels will be tuned and optimized by manipulating polymer chemistry and characterized using optical microscopy and novel rheological procedures. Additionally, this project will engage in targeted outreach efforts focused on recruiting and retaining LGBTQ+ youth in STEM fields to offset persistently low participation rates. Outreach efforts will include hands-on experiential workshops conducted in collaboration with local community organizations, role model introductions and mentorship, and the development of a STEM-focused support network for LGBTQ+ students at the University of Rhode Island.  <br/><br/>Colloidal gels are complex soft materials encountered throughout scientific and industrial applications ranging from slurries for battery production to synthetic scaffolds for tissue engineering and to inks for 3D printing. The performance of these materials depends critically on the interplay between structural and dynamical effects that underlie their emergent properties. Although many applications require competing design constraints such as robust mechanical stiffness but rapid mass transfer, the properties of most existing colloidal systems remain coupled, reducing synthetic flexibility and limiting their design. This experimental investigation of a novel class of rheological modifiers ? telechelic triblock copolymers ? aims to decouple the linear and nonlinear mechanical properties of colloidal gels. The chemistry of the triblock copolymers will be manipulated to generate extended conformations that promote bridge formation and drive colloidal self-assembly. Additionally, the resulting structural and dynamic heterogeneity in the polymer-linked gels will be characterized and these hierarchical properties related to nanoscale transport. Finally, the linear and nonlinear rheology of polymer-linked colloidal suspensions will be characterized using novel rheological protocols to identify high-performance yield stress fluids.

Many flower organs grow very quickly for a brief period as flowers open.  For successful reproduction, such growth must be coordinated so as to place male and female organs appropriately for pollination, and pollen release needs to occur at an optimal time.  This project is to study how plant hormones stimulate rapid growth in stamens, the male flower organs that produce pollen.  In many self-pollinating plants, stamen filaments elongate as flowers open to place pollen-bearing anthers near the female stigma.  The timing and extent of filament growth thus determines the efficiency of fertilization and seed production, and is important for crop breeding and yield.  The project will examine cellular and molecular events during stamen filament elongation in a model plant, to reveal in detail how stamens grow quickly without buckling, how hormones control this growth, and how filament growth is coordinated with pollen release.  Genetic tools generated in the work may enable targeted modification of growth in flower organs, for example to modulate the location and timing of pollen release in crop plants.

The loss of hand function can dramatically change a person?s daily life, forcing them to rely on caregivers to provide assistance. This project aims to develop sensor-embedded garments designed to monitor muscle activity in individuals with tetraplegia resulting from spinal cord injuries. This sensorized garment detects muscle activity in the upper body, even for many people with spinal cord injuries who have lost hand mobility. By decoding and translating these muscle activities, the garment empowers individuals to take control of an assistive robot to perform a variety of household and self-care tasks, such as preparing and eating meals independently and conducting household chores. This research is poised to impact society by restoring a degree of autonomy and agency to individuals with spinal cord injury, promoting open-source development in wearable sensing, integrating research findings into classroom materials, and fostering inclusive education and mentorship for high school students from communities underserved in STEM.<br/><br/>This collaborative project between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh will introduce a high-density electromyography (HDEMG) wearable to capture neuromuscular signals and enable individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) to embody a physically assistive mobile manipulator. Towards this goal, the research project will make key foundational contributions along three thrusts: (1) The design of a sensorized upper-body garment embedded with HDEMG arrays, allowing the capture of residual myoelectric activity and recognition of gesture intent in individuals with SCI. The research team will develop learning-based pattern recognition techniques to interpret the myoelectric activity patterns of attempted arm, wrist, and hand gestures and predict the underlying motor function intent. (2) Development of an interface that enables individuals with SCI to embody an assistive robot by mapping myoelectric signals and inferred gestures to actuator control. The sensorized garment is designed to be comfortable and wearable throughout an entire day, which also necessitates the development of real-time calibration algorithms that allow for accurate myoelectric activity sensing over extended periods of time. (3) The team will conduct a series of in-lab evaluations with stakeholders in collaboration with our community partners. Individuals with SCI will use the wearable to teleoperate an assistive mobile manipulator and perform a range of physical household and self-care activities. These studies will quantify technology performance and efficacy, assess safety, and support iterative refinement and improvements to the key technology components with stakeholder feedback.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many flower organs grow very quickly for a brief period as flowers open.  For successful reproduction, such growth must be coordinated so as to place male and female organs appropriately for pollination, and pollen release needs to occur at an optimal time.  This project is to study how plant hormones stimulate rapid growth in stamens, the male flower organs that produce pollen.  In many self-pollinating plants, stamen filaments elongate as flowers open to place pollen-bearing anthers near the female stigma.  The timing and extent of filament growth thus determines the efficiency of fertilization and seed production, and is important for crop breeding and yield.  The project will examine cellular and molecular events during stamen filament elongation in a model plant, to reveal in detail how stamens grow quickly without buckling, how hormones control this growth, and how filament growth is coordinated with pollen release.  Genetic tools generated in the work may enable targeted modification of growth in flower organs, for example to modulate the location and timing of pollen release in crop plants.  The mechanisms discovered will also be relevant to modulating growth in other organs such as leaves or fruits.

The primary method of tracking and estimating the intensities of these storms is through viewing satellite images of the thick circular deck of high cirrus clouds that surround the center (or ?eye?) of the storm, also known as the cirrus shield. This project will examine the sources and budgets of the moisture and condensate (ice and snow) in the cirrus shield and how this relates to the overall structure and intensity of the storm. It will also investigate to what extent the strongest thunderstorms in and around tropical cyclones are transporting ice to even higher altitudes, which may represent a source of water vapor molecules that play important roles in the chemistry of the stratosphere, with implications for the ozone layer and Earth?s climate. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the dynamical processes and moist physics of the upper-level outflow that lies above all tropical cyclones (TCs). This outflow contains the central cirrus cloud shield seen by satellites that provide the vast majority of intensity estimates for all TCs around the globe. Occasional in-situ observations, airborne Doppler radar analyses, and increasingly realistic numerical simulations suggest that both the primary outflow, and also compensating inflow layers above and below, can have highly asymmetric structures, and are embedded with waves, dynamical instabilities, and overshooting cloud tops from strong updrafts. These overshooting updrafts may also be injecting moisture irreversibly into the stratosphere, possibly playing a non-trivial role in the water budget of the stratosphere. Airborne Doppler radar observations, dropsonde measurements, satellite images, and very high-resolution computer simulations will be used to better understand the three-dimensional structure of the outflow, including the adjacent inflow layers above and below the outflow.

Much of the research on market integration and health has emphasized the shift away from infectious diseases to chronic, non-communicable ones. However, rapid changes in land use that co-occur with shifts to commercial agriculture position rural/low-resource communities at the frontlines of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. It is thus vital to build knowledge of how economic markets connect rural communities with more central towns, potentially facilitating the spread of a local outbreak to a regional (or even global) scale. This doctoral dissertation research contributes to fundamental knowledge on the interactions between market integration, human movement patterns, and infectious disease transmission in local and regional contexts. This research can be shared with key stakeholders and public health decision makers and help build local research capacity through the training of students in network analysis methods. <br/><br/>Human movement patterns are complex among the rural/low-resource settings where novel infectious diseases are most likely to emerge. This project uses leading-edge computational and serological methods to develop a richer understanding of how social change transforms disease ecology. The investigators use detailed survey data on individual-level travel behavior to construct a regional network of villages and towns connected by mobility patterns. This network provides a foundation for conducting computer simulations to understand how changes in market-related activities affect the regional spread of infectious diseases. The investigators also use serological assays to quantify individual-level exposure to a diverse range of viruses, which provides insight into how market integration influences the types of viruses people are exposed to and how they spread among communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The accuracy of the model outputs has progressively increased with time as a result of several important factors, such as the availability of more powerful computers, and the continuous ingestion of experimental data during runtime. Nonetheless, there remain significant weaknesses in the representation of some of the characteristic physical processes. One of these is the representation of land-atmosphere interactions, which capture the way the air exchanges heat, moisture, and drag with the Earth?s surface. Traditionally, these processes have been represented using a formulation that was originally developed for canonical flow and surface conditions, and which is known to not perform well under realistic surface configurations (e.g. mountainous terrain, over forests, heterogeneous surfaces, etc.). Nonetheless it remains the workhorse in all numerical weather prediction and climate models given the lack of better alternatives. In this research project a new approach will be developed that facilitate the extension of the existing land-atmosphere interaction formulation to be applicable to all realistic flow and surface configurations. Results from this work will represent a paradigm change in the way near surface processes are represented in numerical weather prediction and climate models, leading to the next leap forward in weather and climate prediction accuracy. This research has the potential to impact everyone, from the local farmer in rural U.S.A, to investors planning for the next offshore wind farm, as well as the regular family that is just checking the weather forecast to plan for the upcoming weekend.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will leverage the generalized Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) that includes the metric of turbulence anisotropy as an additional non-dimensional term. As the first step, a Lagrangian averaging scheme will be implemented in a turbulence resolving Earth System Model such that it is possible to compute turbulence anisotropy on the fly, with the goal of instantaneously correcting MOST scaling relations. As the second step, the robustness of this new framework will be tested by running different Large-Eddy Simulations of different realistic complex flow configurations and comparing the results with existing experimental datasets. In addition, this new framework will also be tested with respect to its dependence with spatial resolution. The goal here is to understand how spatial resolution affects the computation of turbulence anisotropy and its corresponding effect in correcting the momentum, mass, and energy exchanges near the surface. This project represents a very much needed first step, before the anisotropy-based generalized Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) can be implemented in non-resolving turbulence Earth System Models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems ensure that large-scale services (e.g., search, social networking) and critical services (e.g., e-commerce, healthcare) can reliably access essential data, even in the face of failures. However, a pressing concern when designing fault-tolerant storage systems is that their strong fault-tolerance guarantees come at the cost of performance. For instance, a fault-tolerant key-value store built using existing approaches can perform up to 20x worse than a stand-alone version of the store (that does not tolerate failures). This project aims to build fault-tolerant storage systems that closely approximate the performance of fault-intolerant (non-replicated) storage servers. The project will achieve this goal by systematically rethinking widely used fault-tolerance paradigms. This project will develop novel fault-tolerance protocols and abstractions and build new practical systems. In particular, it will first develop a new replication protocol optimized for modern storage devices. Second, it will explore a novel CPU-free replication approach that unlocks the full potential of remote direct memory access (RDMA). Third, it will realize a new fault-tolerance architecture tailored for emerging disaggregated datacenters. Finally, it will develop a new shared log abstraction for storage applications.<br/> <br/>The solutions developed in this project will enable the development of reliable and performant systems, eliminating the need to make compromises that threaten the data safety of critical applications. The effort will significantly contribute to education and outreach through new course offerings to introduce students to distributed systems research and hands-on labs to equip students to use modern hardware.

Science inherently involves a level of uncertainty ? new information and data can change theories, predictions often come up short, and measurements can be imprecise. Introducing students to scientific uncertainty in science classes is expected to enhance students? scientific literacy and ability to understand the uncertainties associated with scientific research and knowledge. The project will be an important opportunity to develop insights about how to teach scientific uncertainty at the undergraduate level?for which there is not yet any established research. The project will culminate in a guide designed to help faculty members at institutions across the country implement similar concepts in their own courses. Not only will enhanced understanding of scientific uncertainty help students to better understand the nature of science, but it will also help them communicate scientific findings more effectively with the broader public. The project thereby supports the NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science.<br/><br/>There are two research goals of the project: exploring how the integration of scientific uncertainty within the context of existing STEM courses impacts (1) understanding of scientific uncertainty and (2) students? ability to communicate about scientific uncertainty. It is expected that the integration of scientific uncertainty in STEM courses will positively impact both measures. The project will begin with a workshop offered to current faculty members at Morningside University which trains them in methods in teaching scientific uncertainty. Participating faculty members will design an uncertainty module to integrate into their courses which highlights scientific uncertainty in the context of the course material. The project team will conduct pre- and post-module implementation surveys and interviews (based on established measures of scientific literacy and uncertainty) to assess the changes in student perception and understanding of uncertainty as well as their ability to communicate what they have learned. The effectiveness of the modules will be evaluated by comparing the experimental group to control classes, where there is no added module about scientific uncertainty. Both within-group and between-group effects will be considered while controlling for outside factors, including instructor, major, rurality, and student gender.

Particle nucleation provides a substantial fraction of the seed particles for forming marine clouds that reflect incoming solar radiation while simultaneously obscuring radiation-absorbing oceans. Since the formation and rate at which particles nucleate influence the brightness and lifetimes of clouds, quantifying marine nucleation rates is important for accurately predicting the role of clouds in climate change.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to: (1) Verify that the Nucleation Potential Model can quantify the nucleation potential of laboratory-generated complex mixtures; (2) Measure the nucleation reactions, nucleation potentials, and emission profiles produced from tank-grown marine phytoplankton during various stages of growth; (3) Predict the seasonal and spatial variation in emission profiles, nucleation reactions, and nucleation potentials from natural marine planktonic communities collected from Gulf of Maine; and (4) Evaluate spring and late summer/fall marine emissions and atmospheric nucleation at the Gulf of Maine and compare with those observed in Objective 3.<br/><br/>The ultimate impact of this research is to dramatically expand nucleation measurements in difficult-to-access regions worldwide and provide a computationally simple method for predicting nucleation rates in diverse environments and points in time. In the future, climate change may cause regions of the oceans that were not previously significant sources of aerosol particles to play more critical roles in determining Earth's radiative budget and climate.<br/><br/>The PIs plan to work with two high school science teachers from underfunded neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, PA to develop a student-centered, atmospheric chemistry and climate curriculum that can be incorporated into a semester-long chemistry class.

Weather prediction models were originally designed to operate at about 10-km grid resolution. At about 1-km grid resolution, atmospheric models enter the so-called ?gray zone,? where traditional physics parameterizations no longer hold, leading to errors in weather prediction. This project will create a new scale-aware framework to improve these parameterizations in the gray zone, with broad impacts for weather and regional climate forecasts, which increasingly use models in the gray zone for practical applications. The researchers will collaborate with scientists at NCAR and NOAA to guide this process and to make sure that the scale-aware approach is thoroughly tested and ready to implement in operational codes. Ultimately, this will further enable a vast array of applications at gray-zone and finer resolutions, such as weather prediction, wind energy forecasting, wildfire smoke modeling, and air quality modeling in urban environments. This project will also provide connections with the environmental justice community of concern in Stockton, California, where two teachers will be provided with summer research opportunities to develop a hands-on air pollution curriculum which will reach 700 high school students in the first two years. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to extend scale-aware turbulence parameterizations into the gray zone to allow a consistent representation of turbulent and resolved motions as grid resolutions increase. The scale-aware turbulence framework will be tested in the WRF model with a variety of physically and mathematically consistent closure models, with a focus on the dynamic reconstruction model (DRM) and simpler ?mixed models?. Mixed models combine a scale-similarity component with an eddy-viscosity model; mixed models are scale aware and have been shown to allow mesoscale models to better operate in the gray zone. This project will extend and thoroughly evaluate mixed models across the gray zone. New strategies for grid nesting will also be tested, including adjusting grid nesting ratios and using the FastEddy GPU code with very large domains to explore skipping the gray zone. Simulations will be performed over the Southern Great Plains, an area of interest for wind resources, and over Northern California, including inland locations with poor air quality and offshore regions being considered for wind energy development. Long-term simulations will be performed to assess improvement in model skill.

The shape and muscular attachments to this bone are important for tongue movements, chewing, swallowing, and vocalization. This doctoral dissertation research investigates the relationship between shape, position, and muscular attachment of the hyoid to determine the role of this bone in feeding across primates. This work informs researchers about the function of the hyoid, which may result in the formation of novel treatments for  speech and swallowing disorders in humans. This work also builds STEM talent by supporting undergraduate and graduate training and creating an openly available dataset of microCT scans that can be used in scientific outreach projects aimed at K-12 students and the public. Overall, this work is poised to educate the public on scientific and evolutionary concepts, build and encourage future researchers, and add to the current understanding of head and neck anatomy and function, which has important biomedical implications.  <br/><br/>The hyoid and the muscles that connect it to the skull (i.e., the suprahyoid muscles), are central to chewing, swallowing, tongue manipulation, and vocalization. How these behaviors, specifically those involved in feeding, affect hyoid anatomy is not well known as previous work has focused on vocalization as a driving factor for hyoid shape. The hyoid is in near-constant motion during feeding and is pulled toward the oral cavity during swallowing by the suprahyoid muscles. The goal of this research is to quantify the impact of swallowing by evaluating variation in hyoid shape and position and their relationship to the suprahyoid muscles and skull in primates. This project utilizes microCT scans and iodine staining methods to visualize the hyoid apparatus along with 3D shape analyses to investigate the relationships between the hyoid, skull, and musculature. Additionally, this work analyzes how these relationships change throughout growth and development in two closely related species of primates with notable differences in diet. In doing so, this work can provide valuable insights into the evolution of human hyoid shape and function and put human hyoid anatomy into the broader context of primate hyoid variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The specific transitions being explored may yield new capabilities for bioimaging techniques that use EPR transitions. The research project spans the interface of inorganic and physical chemistries with synthetic and spectroscopic analyses as a key part of the work. The broader outreach goals for the program will be to create an easy-to-access lesson for synthetic chemists to approach the selection rules of EPR.

The singlet-to-triplet transition of two-spin systems is a promising way to realize such an EPR transition, because of its unique field dependence. Yet, the transition is forbidden and therefore weak hence, chemical design strategies for molecules to override the EPR selection rule and increase signal intensity are needed. Dinuclear metal complexes have a plethora of magnetic interactions that could potentially violate the EPR selection rule, but experimental tests of the efficacy of these violations have yet to be performed.

The investigator aims to develop a general method to overcome high dimensionality of these PDEs via developing an iterative solver that combines the advantages of tensor-network, Monte Carlo, and convex optimization methods. The main idea is to solve for only a small number of descriptors of the solution (e.g., the statistical moments of the solution) and then recover a compressed representation of the solution through these descriptors. An improved solution procedure will contribute to the Material Genome Initiative by developing new computational tools for physical and chemical simulations. The proposed education plan aims to train graduate students for quantitative research at the intersection of mathematical and physical sciences, fostering a new generation of researchers well-equipped to tackle problems of national interest in scientific computing, machine learning, and quantum computing. Through research advising, a summer mentoring program, and the development of a summer school for quantum mechanics, the proposal aims to encourage the participation of underrepresented students in scientific research and higher education. <br/> <br/>Currently, Monte Carlo methods have been widely successful in many practical physical and chemical simulation tools due to their flexibility, despite potential drawbacks such as slow mixing time and high variance. An alternative approach to characterizing chemical/physical systems is to deterministically solve for the solution of a PDE over the entire space, which can work only for small (and consequently low-dimensional) problems. The proposed research attempts to address the limitations of sampling-based and PDE approaches through the development of an iterative solver. It involves fast iterations achieved by alternating between short-time Monte Carlo simulations and estimating a tensor-network ansatz. It relies on the initialization strategy underpinned by convex optimization in order to reduce the number of iterations. Monte Carlo variance of traditional sampling methods is significantly reduced since only a small number of tensor-network parameters need to be estimated. On the other hand, it significantly extends the flexibility of tensor-network methods by allowing stochastic operations. To this end, a novel tensor-network-based generative model is proposed where density can be learned from empirical samples without the use of any optimization. It would impact statistics by providing new density estimators and analysis without the curse of dimensionality. Further, a new moment method based on convex optimization is proposed for solving high-dimensional PDEs. This would develop mathematical programming, a tool traditionally used in operations research, into an effective tool for physics simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The integrated educational component of the project includes training undergraduate and doctoral students in infrastructure algorithms, curriculum development, and outreach to engage high school students and inspire them to explore careers in math and computing.<br/><br/>This project has two major thrusts.  The first concerns the scheduling of precedence-constrained jobs and computation graphs in distributed networks and reconfigurable machines.  This is motivated by the fact that as computational workloads get larger and more complex, it is often necessary to distribute many communicating jobs across a large network of devices. These devices may have different speeds, different computing capabilities, and restrictions on which jobs they can execute due to resource and security concerns.  The second thrust concerns the online migration of computations and servers in a distributed system in response to dynamic requests. One motivation comes from data intensive applications that generate significant network traffic; to enable efficient communication among processes dispersed across many clusters, distributed systems are increasingly reconfigurable and strategically migrate processes to reduce communication. The presented problems include communication-aware scheduling of precedence-constrained jobs in networks with general delays, scheduling of split table jobs in reconfigurable machines, minimum-stretch embedding of graphs, heterogeneous variants of the classic online k-server problem, and online balanced graph partitioning. The technical approaches include new linear-programming based techniques that address communication and topological constraints, and new methods in online algorithms. This project also explores new frameworks for studying these problems, including learning-augmented algorithms through predictions of processing times and communication needs, reconfigurable architectures, and mobile ad hoc networks with heterogeneous devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there are no large-scale or nationwide professional development opportunities focused on reforming chemistry laboratory curricula. This comprehensive year-long professional development program will empower chemistry educators to enhance student learning in chemistry laboratories by promoting scientific practices and fostering a sense of belonging. Moreover, as part of the professional development program, participants will create and disseminate more than 40 new inquiry-based laboratory projects, which have been shown to be more effective for student learning than traditional ?cookbook? style laboratory experiences. Data will be collected and analyzed to broaden understanding of the extent to which such professional development affects teaching beliefs and instructional practices of laboratory curricula developers. This new knowledge will have the potential to impact the success of future faculty professional development initiatives. Overall, this project will lead to direct instructional support that can benefit thousands of undergraduate chemistry students and may lead to long-term changes in the instructional practices of up to 126 laboratory curriculum developers. This Institutional and Community Transformation Level 2 project aligns with NSF's mission to advance science education, serving the national interest by improving student success.<br/><br/>Chemistry educators have long been dissatisfied with traditional laboratory approaches, but many face barriers that prevent them from adopting new frameworks and evidence-based practices. This project aims to establish a nationwide community of chemistry laboratory curriculum developers equipped with the knowledge, skills, and resources to implement effective instructional reforms. Three bodies of work comprise the theory of change guiding this project: (1) Clarke and Hollingsworth?s Model of Teacher Professional Growth; (2) Wenger?s Communities of Practice framework; and (3) AAC&U?s Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM logic model. Four cohorts containing 42 institutional teams from varying contexts and institutional settings (including minority-serving and 2-year institutions) will collaborate to create and disseminate more than 40 inquiry-based laboratory projects. The teams will participate in a comprehensive yearlong professional development during which they will learn about evidence-based practices, including (1) curriculum reform through backward design with a specific focus on pedagogical aspects unique to chemistry (e.g., Johnstone?s triangle); (2) reducing equity gaps through fostering a sense of belonging; and (3) building scientific practices through inquiry (NGSS framework). By establishing this nationwide community of laboratory curriculum developers with training in evidence-based practices (84-126 instructors and 42 TAs), this program will have a transformative impact on chemistry laboratory instruction practices. Additionally, through triangulation of student and instructor surveys, instructors? reflections and interviews, and laboratory artifacts, the project will generate new knowledge about the landscape of instructional thinking and practices of the laboratory curriculum developers and will evaluate the extent to which professional development impacts progressions in the thinking and practices of the laboratory curriculum developers. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this award is to investigate how micro-texture and softness of polymeric substrates synergistically affect wetting behavior of various liquids, including both simple liquids and liquids containing surfactants. A series of studies will be performed using textured surfaces and porous substrates with different micro-textures and different softness to uncover key factors governing the interactions between liquids and soft textured surfaces. A host of educational activities are integrated with the proposed project to provide interdisciplinary learning experiences to pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students. The proposed science kit-based public engagement activity, which involves development of the ?Magic of Soft Surfaces? science kit, will engage K-12 students in fun science experiments, and provide training opportunities to the science teachers.<br/><br/>In contrast to the well-established knowledge of wetting on rigid surfaces, the fundamental mechanisms regulating soft wetting are much less explored. There is a lack of understanding of how the interplay between morphology, viscoelasticity, and surface-active agents regulates soft wetting. The overarching goal of this award is to advance the fundamental understanding of soft wetting phenomena by closing these knowledge gaps. This goal will be achieved by performing interdisciplinary research to: (1) define the structure-property-performance relationships characterizing wetting behaviors of soft textured surfaces, (2) unveil the governing mechanisms of liquid imbibition, droplet absorption, and wetting resistance in soft porous substrates, and (3) probe how surface-active agents alter wetting ridge and soft wetting behavior. The findings of this project will result in original and transformative knowledge, which has the potential to pave the way for discovering novel functionalities of soft materials.

The research team will implement new approaches, which are needed because traditional electromagnetic (radio-frequency) spectrum monitoring approaches are losing effectiveness. The continuing growth of wireless communications requires the limited available spectrum to be used ever more efficiently. To pack wireless systems more tightly, transmitters and receivers are evolving to use directional antennas that can steer away from interference. Directional transmissions mean a sensor at a single location can no longer rely on detecting all nearby transmissions, and when the sensor does observe an incoming signal, it cannot easily predict what other devices or locations are impacted. SweepSpace seeks to overcome these limitations and provide new spatial and directional information that enables safely increasing communications and sensing capacity without increasing spectrum cost. This project evaluates the new methods and the SweepSpace prototype through analysis, laboratory tests and limited field experiments. The project will provide training for the next-generation workforce for wireless communications and spectrum science by engaging graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, including students from underrepresented groups. SweepSpace sensor kits, based on a low-cost software defined radio, will be created for use in workshops, demonstrations, and classrooms. <br/><br/>SweepSpace is a generalized spectrum sensing architecture designed to report all spatio-temporal activity in a spatial-frequency volume. Complete knowledge of transmissions requires the deployment of a dense network of sensors; it requires each sensor to detect all incoming signals across a wide range of frequencies; and it requires each sensor to identify the direction of all incoming signals. Rapid sweeping across 3D space over a wide band enables a low-cost sensor with a single moderate-bandwidth receiver to frequently sample every channel in a wide range and to frequently sample all incident directions via a sweeping phased array antenna. The team will investigate the use of off-the-shelf components to develop a prototype low-cost SweepSpace node. They will investigate 1) reconstruction of a full spatio-temporal activity map from samples that are sparse across space, time, frequency, and incident direction; 2) enhancing the directional precision of individual sensors; 3) optimizing the placement and parameterization of the; and 4) identifying spatio-temporal holes for safe insertion of new activity. They will also investigate single-sensor questions, such as minimum detectability bounds, risk of missed detections and false positives, and optimal scheduling policies, and they will characterize the probability of missed detections by a network of sensors. The project includes development of risk mitigation tools that can be used by others to tailor SweepSpace for their use cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the average menstruator spends $20 on feminine hygiene products per cycle, but often experiences unnecessary discomfort or embarrassment when using pads and tampons. In addition, these commonly used products put them at a higher risk for developing endometriosis, toxic shock syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Although menstrual cups are available on the market, many menstruators won't convert from their current solutions due to the product's intimidating size and difficulty with insertion and removal. This technology addresses these concerns and may bridge the gap between the convenience of tampons and the benefits of menstrual cups.  Women have reported that menstrual cups may provide increased comfort, less interference with activities, less irritation, decreased odor, and the ability to wear a cup for longer periods of time than a pad or tampon.  The technology may offer a sustainable and easy-to-use menstrual cup that provides users a safe solution with long-lasting comfort and function.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translational potential of the technology. The technology is based on the prior development of an intravaginal menstrual cup and applicator to collect menstrual fluid. The technology uses a bell-shaped cup and loop tab design in combination with a tampon-like applicator. The product?s bell-shape provides optimal capacity for collecting menstrual fluid and is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably within the vaginal canal. For insertion, the device uses a common folding technique, known as the C-fold. The flexible silicone device is inserted into the polycarbonate plunger-applicator to be deployed into the vaginal canal. For removal, a loop at the base of the cup provides an attachment point for a biocompatible and adjustable cord. This design allows for mess-free and easy extraction. The cup has been shown to have a longer wear time, reducing the need for frequent changes.  In addition, the solution has an eco-friendly, reusable design that may result in a significant reduction in environmental waste.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will leverage an idea called ""proof-carrying code"" where code suggestions are packaged together with a mathematical proof of their safety, allowing programmers to be confident that the program is safe to deploy. This project will develop tools, techniques, and empirical results for using LLMs to generate trustworthy code together with mathematical proofs. Project outcomes, including code, data sets and course materials, will be developed in the open and made available online to researchers working on LLMs, end users of LLM-based code generation, and early industry and open source adopters.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, researchers in the programming languages community recognized a powerful idea known as proof-carrying code (PCC): they showed how code can be shipped together with a proof of its safety that could be vetted ? efficiently ? by an end user. LLMs can be viewed as high-resource computations, and LLM users as low-resource entities. Seen through this lens, PCC maps naturally to the safety problem for LLM-generated code. The technical aims of this project are divided into four thrusts: (1) Gather empirical data on code that is currently generated by LLMs, and to determine core safety risks, to enable building of a dataset that will be useful to other researchers; (2) Develop a framework for PCC, including enumeration of safety properties of interest and showing how to instantiate the framework with existing program verification, proof languages, and proof frameworks; (3) Implement new tools for verification condition generation from source code for popular programming languages and for specific safety properties; and (4) Evaluate the use of LLMs for generating proofs in this context, including developing new algorithms and proof sampling techniques to improve model effectiveness. The research will lead to new insights into the current capabilities of LLMs, to new relevant safety properties for code generation in a black-box setting, and to new techniques to generate verification conditions -- to bridge the gap in formal verification technology from special-purpose languages like Coq and Dafny to general-purpose programming languages in popular use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While many antimicrobial agents have optimal bactericidal activity at a neutral pH, the unusual acidic pH can impair the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of pharmaceutical drugs and promote bacterial resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as an alternative solution to conventional antibiotics to address the global problem of infectious diseases due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and less tendency for bacteria to develop resistance. Although AMPs are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics, their widespread use and translation into clinical application is hampered by several intrinsic limitations, including their susceptibility to proteases and moderate to severe toxicity towards host cells. It is generally believed that new design and engineering strategy is needed to overcome the intrinsic limitation of traditional AMPs for targeted antimicrobial therapy. The PI?s group recently developed a technology platform of self-assembling antimicrobial nanofibers (SAANs) to circumvent the shortcomings of both traditional antibiotics and AMPs. SAANs are supramolecular assemblies of multidomain peptides (MDPs) that can undergo programmed self-assembly into nanostructured filaments. While killing broad-spectrum antibiotic-resistant bacteria, SAANs offer key advantages over traditional single chain AMPs in terms of improved stability, precisely controlled AMP loading capacity, minimal cytotoxicity and greatly improved hemocompatibility. More recently, the PI?s group advance the fundamental design principles to develop a novel acid-activatable SAANs using pH-responsive MDPs as the molecular building block. The long-term goal is to apply SAANs as stable systemic nanocarriers for targeted AMP delivery. The research objectives of the present proposal are to expand the family of SAANs containing pH-responsive non-natural amino acids to further modulate materials stability and activity, and to develop more potent pH-dependent multicomponent SAANs with synergistic antimicrobial effect to eradicate bacteria at their preferred acidic environment without affecting healthy tissues and cells. At the University of Texas at Arlington which is a Hispanic-serving institution, the PI contributes to education of increased diversity in STEM fields, particularly encouraging research participation from underrepresented students with weakly performing academic record along with her other outreach and education efforts. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The NSF project is focused on the synthesis and self-assembly of pH-responsive peptides with non-natural amino acids that show triggered antimicrobial activity in the weakly acidic pH range.  The project is driven by our recent discovery of Acid-Activatable Self-Assembled Antimicrobial Nanofibers (AA-SAANs), which is generated through the self-assembly of pH-responsive multidomain peptides (MDPs). The MDPs are assembled into nanofibers at the physiological condition and being inactive. At the acidic infection site where the local pH decreases, AA-SAANs are triggered to dissemble and release the activated MDPs to interact with the bacterial cell membrane and kill bacteria. In this proposal we will validate and advance the fundamental design principle by using MDPs with expanded chemistry to develop more potent AA-SAANs. The research objectives of this proposal are: 1) Establish AA-SAANs using new pH-responsive MDPs containing non-natural ionic amino acids; 2) Fabrication and evaluation of multicomponent AA-SAANs with synergistic antimicrobial activity; 3) Evaluate the pH-dependent biological activity of these materials in vitro. These efforts will provide critical insight into the fundamental molecular and supramolecular chemistry that govern the structure and antimicrobial activity of AA-SAANs. Further, this strategy is highly transformative for the rational design and synthesis of functional materials with built-in pH-responsive properties to probe various complex biological processes in which pH gradient plays an important role.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this work, supported by the Ceramics Program within the Division of Materials Research, is to develop fluoride-based materials that are more robust against these detrimental side reactions. While fluorides have been explored as solid electrolytes in the past, very few phases with fast ionic conductivity at room temperature have been discovered.

All this has stressed the capability of the Internet core?s routers and router chips, especially with additional power constraints.<br/><br/><br/>This grant seeks to take first steps towards creating a new approach to designing Network Algorithms (sometimes called Network Algorithmics) using a new model of router processors called the CRAM model. In the CRAM model, fine-grained Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) and random-access memory (RAM) can be dynamically allocated to a set of programmable processors. This model is an abstraction of newer network processors such as Intel?s Tofino-1 and 2 (used by the Arista 7170 and Cisco Nexus 34180YC) and is apparent in many other new processors in the market such as AMD?s Pensando.  Intellectually, the CRAM model is a new abstraction of these processors (like famous earlier models of complexity like the RAM and parallel random-access machine (PRAM) models) that allows quickly designing and evaluating scalable algorithms for all router processing tasks. Practically, we show early results that using CAM and RAM strategically can greatly improve router scalability.  For example, our new viewpoint allows us to create new algorithms that enable the Tofino-2 to scale to 5 million IPv4 prefixes while a pure CAM implementation only allows at most 250,000 prefixes, 28% of the current wide area database. Similarly, a second new algorithm allows Tofino-2 to scale to 700,000 IPv6 prefixes, 5.8 times larger than a pure CAM solution.  Our grant seeks to further develop the intellectual foundations of the CRAM model, build compilers from higher level CRAM descriptions to actual implementations, and generalize beyond IP lookups to find new scalable algorithms for packet classification, machine learning and security tasks, that can help sustain the amazing growth of the Internet and its accompanying services.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The advancements in genomics and computing have refined this timescale, resulting in the publication of thousands of evolutionary trees scaled to time, known as timetrees. This project supports the development and expansion of TimeTree, an open-source and unified database that synthesizes these data into a global timetree of life. Users can obtain the divergence time of any two species, a timeline showing all evolutionary splits back in time, and exportable timetrees of any group or from a custom list of species. Events in geological and astronomical history, such as asteroid impacts, oxygen levels, and solar luminosity, are integrated into the same timescale with species timetrees and timelines, facilitating interdisciplinary research and applications in areas like molecular biology, conservation, and medicine. The new TimeTree resource will implement new algorithms, tools, and application programming interfaces to speed, improve, and increase the efficiency of timetree curation and data mining. It will have a new online educational component designed for K-12 and college students, including assignments that demonstrate the principles, models, and methods for building timetrees. Its new graphical interface will be enhanced specifically for use by non-scientists and will include training tools to engage stakeholder communities, allowing for more user feedback. This expanded TimeTree resource aims to stimulate and accelerate research and discovery across diverse scientific disciplines while also serving as a simple-to-use tool for education and outreach. <br/><br/>The enhancements in TimeTree will enable researchers worldwide to query, retrieve, visualize, and explore evolutionary patterns, thus aiding hypothesis formulation and augmenting both scientific and societal returns on investments in basic biological research. The newly developed approaches and computational infrastructure will have greater efficiency that will result in the largest timetree of life ever assembled. The incorporation of a novel super-timetree estimation method will yield a more rapid and precise synthesis, affording greater and frequent automated assembly of the super-timetree and updates of the database. For example, a deep-learning approach will be employed to identify and incorporate newly published timetree studies quickly into the database. Beyond these core functionalities, TimeTree aims to bridge scientific disciplines by developing and integrating new tools for data analytics and mining, streamlining the use of complex timetree data. A specialized tool will allow users to access all associated study data for the node of interest, perform analyses on those data, and retrieve the data and results for further offline analyses. Advances in the application programming interface will offer a broader array of functionalities, such as serving commonly used biodiversity metrics. Innovative widgets will interface with other databases to provide them with divergence times and derivative metrics. TimeTree also will also include analytical utilities, such as lineages-through-time and diversification plots, so researchers may immediately see the results for any group. To ensure long-term sustainability while limiting maintenance costs, automated tools for processing and curating published timetrees will be integrated. TimeTree will remain fully open access, with the super-timetree, associated study data, and source code being readily downloadable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the world is increasingly becoming more diverse and the need for children to learn multiple languages is growing. The technology may allow children to learn how to speak in their native language and also learn how to speak English, Spanish, French, as well as other languages.  The technology uses audio recordings of family members, which are then edited and crafted into fun and interactive language-learning experiences for kids.  The use of family members? voices may also provide a more personal and engaging experience for children, allowing them to feel more connected to their culture. In addition, children can make their own stories, giving them a sense of pride and ownership of their language learning. The technology may benefit natural language processing scientists and researchers who conduct race related research in universities and institutes, parents of children with ethnic backgrounds looking to use inclusive assisted technologies for speech, school districts and teachers who use edtech to assist students with the language learning process, and speech language pathologists and their practices looking to incorporate the use of language learning products from a culturally-responsive pedagogical framework.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the proposed technology. The technology is based on the prior development of diverse, equitable, and inclusive natural language processing (NLP) for the purpose of assisting young diverse learners with speech challenges. The use of natural language processing as assistive technology embedded in language learning products is becoming increasingly important for children during their language learning process.  Natural language processing is used to interpret and understand spoken language, while speech recognition software is used to recognize the spoken words and convert them into text.  In addition, a user interface and data storage will be used to store the recordings and play them back to compare the child?s own voice to the recorded voice of family members.

The objectives of this project are to design, synthesize and characterize core-shell structured organic molecules, to gain a fundamental understanding of the structure-property-performance correlation of synthesized organic molecules, and to leverage this understanding for designing a transformative hybrid flow battery for future energy storage applications. The project offers several broader impacts, including fundamental knowledge of organic molecules, novel battery technology development, training of the future science and technology workforce at undergraduate and graduate levels, and an outreach program that can engage high school students including students from groups traditionally underrepresented in chemistry and chemical engineering.<br/> <br/>To unleash the potential of hybrid magnesium-organic flow batteries, new organic molecular structure design is proposed.  The design consists of core-shell structured organic molecules with an aromatic core, a redox-active shell, and a polyether chain connecting them. Such core-shell structured molecules have the potential to enable fast electron-transfer reactions to the redox-active moieties located in the shell, and provides multiple design freedoms to tune the solubility, capacity, potential, and stability of organic molecules. Thus, this approach has great potential to achieve transformative energy storage performance compared to the state-of-the-art hybrid flow batteries. A systematic experimental study is proposed, including design and synthesis of core-shell structured organic molecules, chemical and electrochemical characterization of the synthesized molecules, a device-level study of flow battery performance of synthesized molecules, as well as in situ/ex situ studies to understand reaction mechanisms and performance limiting factors. The overall long term aim is to achieve a comprehensive fundamental understanding of the structure-property-performance correlation of core-shell structured organic molecules for magnesium-organic flow batteries. The goal is to eventually provide rational structure/design guidelines of organic materials for high-voltage, high-capacity and stable non-aqueous magnesium-organic flow batteries.  Such tunable organic molecules in the longer term have potential application areas that include supporting redox-flow batteries, CO2 capture, electrochemical sensing, organic electronics, and separations science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign makes observations of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), the layer of the atmosphere from roughly 14km to 18km between the tropical troposphere and stratosphere, using balloons designed to float at a constant altitude for flights of up to 3 months.  The balloons are launched from the Seychelles and float around the equator at the top of the TTL (near 18km) or in the lower stratosphere at an altitude close to 20km.  Strateole-2 was planned as a set of three deployments, a preliminary engineering deployment with 8 balloon flights followed by two science deployments with 20 flights each. The first two deployments took place in 2019 and 2021 and funds for the PIs' participation in these deployments were provided through AGS-1643022.  Funds provided here support participation in the third campaign, scheduled to begin in October 2025.<br/><br/>The primary task under this award is the production of balloon-borne instruments to observe temperature, moisture, aerosols, and cirrus cloud ice particles.  One instrument is the LASP Particle Counter (LPC), named for the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.  The LPC flies on the balloon gondola and detects aerosols and ice particles using laser backscatter. It can determine the concentration of particles of sizes ranging from 0.3 to 30 microns in 32 size bins.  The LPC is accompanied by a moisture and temperature sensor developed for use in weather balloons, the Vaisala RS41, which can detect moisture at the low humidities found in the TTL and lower stratosphere.  Five LPCs will be flown in the 2025 deployment, three at 18km and two at 20km.<br/><br/>A second instrument is the Reeldown Aerosol, Cloud, Humidity and Temperature Sensor (RACHuTS), a 2kg package which is reeled up and down on a cord to generate soundings extending 2km below the balloon.  RACHuTS integrates the Thermodynamic SENsor (TSEN, developed by a French team) with a smaller version of the LPC called the ROPC (RACHuTS Optical Particle Counter, with 8 size bins from 0.3 to 10 microns), along with an RS41 and the Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) moisture sensor developed under AGS-2233136.  TDL is an improvement over the FLASH-B moisture sensor used in the previous deployments since it is not sensitive to ambient light and can thus be used during the day, doubling the opportunities for profiling.  RACHuTS makes profiles with one meter vertical resolution, with one profile as it descends and another as it returns to the gondola.  Three RACHuTS profilers will be flown in the 2025 deployment, all at 18km.<br/><br/>As in the earlier deployments the measurements taken using LPC and RACHuTS will be used to address three issues in TTL science.  The first is the extent to which supersaturation is an important factor in determining humidity in the stratosphere.  Stratospheric humidity is thought to be limited by the saturation vapor pressure at the coldest temperature air encounters as it rises through the TTL to enter the stratosphere, under the assumption that water vapor condensation or deposition occurs when relative humidity reaches 100%.  But data from previous deployments shows relative humidities above 150%, suggesting that the cold point saturation vapor pressure may not be as strict a limit as previously supposed.  A related issue is the role of atmospheric waves in the formation of cirrus clouds in the TTL, as previous RACHuTS deployments and other evidence suggests that the majority of ice particle layers within the TTL are generated by cooling associated with rising motions in waves.  The layers can be quite thin, perhaps only 10 meters, thus the one meter resolution of RACHuTS profiles is necessary to observe the layers.  The third issue to be addressed in the project is the finding of layers of large particles, in the size range from 2 to 20 microns, at relative humidities too low to allow ice formation. The nature of these particles has yet to be determined.  One strategy for studying them is to fly the LPC on two balloons at the 20km level, which is above the TTL and typically too warm and dry to support ice clouds.  The detection of super-micron particles at that level would be a strong argument that the particles are not composed of ordinary ice.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts due to the unique dataset to be collected, in particular the long sampling time, high vertical resolution, and high quality of the observations. RACHuTS and LPC observations will be made freely available to the research community so that they can be used in ways not anticipated here. In addition, the project develops novel technologies for meteorological observations that could have a wide array of scientific applications. Beyond these considerations, the project supports a postdoctoral research associate, thereby developing the future scientific workforce in this research area.  The project develops a substantial international collaboration and also provides support and training to a research scientist and an undergraduate student at the University of Colorado.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The endosperm of the maize kernel is a primary reservoir of nutrients. It is composed of several functionally unique cell layers that support kernel development. This project investigates molecular and physiological processes of development in one such layer, the basal endosperm transfer cells (BETCs). In particular, experiments will characterize the role of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites, as well as their byproducts, as important determinants of chromatin structure and gene expression. Packaging into euchromatin (open chromatin) often leads to increased gene expression, whereas packaging into heterochromatin (closed chromatin) is generally a marker of gene silencing, and the direct role for metabolites in regulating this packaging is a novel finding. The project will also organize Corn Summer Internships in Gene Silencing (CornSInGS) for hands-on laboratory and field exercises for local high school students to learn the inheritance of crop traits. Plant phenotypes will be used to demonstrate gene silencing switches. This project will also collaborate with faculty and undergraduates from Virginia State University for undergraduate summer internships overlapping with the CornSInGS workshop. Findings will provide knowledge of the biological processes in the nucleus that are required for the development of endosperm and a healthy maize kernel. <br/><br/>Basal endosperm transfer cells lie at the interface of phloem termini connecting the source of photosynthates (leaves) with the storage cells (sink) of starchy endosperm. At the heart of early kernel developmental events are cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, and RNA splicing. Mis-regulation of any of these basic processes causes defects in cell differentiation, growth, and development. Maize ufo1 (Zmufo1; unstable factor for orange1) mutants have BETC defects that were found to be associated with aberrant expression of TCA cycle genes, metabolites, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and basic regulatory processes. Zmufo1 mutants therefore provide a varied set of kernel defects and plant phenotypes to help characterize cellular differentiation. This proposal will characterize metabolic and epigenetic regulatory events that are required to maintain cellular homeostasis during early basal endosperm development. Specific aims are: 1. Characterize redox-dependent, spatiotemporal chromatin remodeling during BETC differentiation as modulated by Zmufo1. 2. Characterize ZmUFO1-associated, protein-protein interactions. 3. Confirm functionality of the  predicted ASF1-histone chaperone domain of ZmUFO1. The knowledge gained from this project can be applied to understand the development of other specialized cells supporting the embryo and endosperm of other cereal grains of economic importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While sunlight and carbon dioxide are usually plentiful, water and mineral nutrients are often limiting factors for plant growth, making irrigation and fertilizers the two most costly inputs for crop production and sustainable agriculture. However, reliance on fertilizers is not a long-term solution because both production and application of fertilizers cause pollution and threaten the sustainability of our environment. An alternative strategy is to breed crops with high nutrient use efficiency, but this requires understanding how plants acquire and utilize each nutrient, which is the subject of this research project. Discoveries from the project will be applied to crop improvement through ongoing collaborations with international and USDA labs associated with the PI?s laboratory. The research will have an additional impact on undergraduate and graduate education through courses the PI teaches at UC Berkeley and through independent research programs in the PI?s laboratory. The project will also enhance the outreach efforts that focus on local high schools to encourage students to become interested in biology. <br/><br/>Membrane transport is important for mineral nutrient homeostasis at the cell and whole plant level. To thrive, plants have evolved intricate mechanisms that maintain mineral homeostasis at the cellular and whole-plant level despite constantly changing nutrient status in soil. The PI?s lab discovered the calcium response modules (CBL-CIPK) that form a signaling network for nutrient sensing. New results indicate that plants also utilize a conserved nutrient sensor, TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR), to integrate the high potassium (K) nutrient status to initiate ?growth mode? and suppress the low-K response by degrading the CBL-CIPK modules. In a reciprocal manner, low-K-induced activation of CBL-CIPK network represses TOR activity and switch plants to ?adaptation mode?, establishing a conceptual framework on how plants adapt to the changing nutrient status in the soil. The same CBL-CIPK network activates sequestration of magnesium (Mg) into vacuole in response to high-Mg, providing a possible mechanism for integrating different nutrients cues. The recent discovery of Mg-transporters responsible for Mg-sequestration into (and remobilization out of) the vacuole set the stage for connecting the CBL-CIPK modules to the Mg-transporters, constructing a molecular relay from high Mg status in the serpentine soils (the signal), to the activation of CBL-CIPK modules (the signaling), and Mg sequestration into the vacuole (the response). The specific objectives of this project are: 1. To identify the mechanisms by which the dual CBL-CIPK pathways are activated by low-K status; 2. To identify the events leading to K-induced activation of TOR and inactivation of CBL-CIPK network; and 3. To dissect the CBL-CIPK pathway that governs Mg fluxes across the tonoplast. The research will benefit from the unique expertise of PI?s group in the model plant systems that are amenable to patch-clamp and cell biology analysis in combination with genetic and biochemical approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to improve postsecondary students' academic success and retention within STEM disciplines using the Success through Self-Regulated Learning (StSRL) framework. In self-regulated learning, students manage their behavior before, during, and after a learning task to allow them to master the task or concept at hand.  Theoretically and empirically grounded, the StSRL framework will target five related components of self-regulated learning: strategy use, metacognition, motivation, management, and content practice. The framework will provide a platform for instructors to generate dynamic, bidirectional prompts that students respond to through an app or a course learning management system (LMS), thereby embedding effective self-regulated learning practices within scientific course contexts. Prompts will vary by format (e.g., multiple choice, open-ended response, slider), as well as by intended learning function (i.e., metacognition, strategy, motivation, content, management). Preliminary data suggest the StSRL framework holds promise to increase students? learning and retention in STEM pipelines. This project plans to first focus on students enrolled in biology courses and then will scale to additional STEM contexts. Data collected from this project will allow the project team to study how to maximize the intervention and will inform faculty professional development to support students? self-regulated learning. <br/><br/>The project team plans to test the efficacy of the Success through Self-Regulated Learning (StSRL) framework and systematic interventions designed to increase successful learning outcomes, student achievement, and retention in post-secondary STEM coursework. This project intends to address four overarching objectives: 1) Further test the impact of instructor and student use of the StSRL framework on SRL, self-efficacy, and achievement outcomes, 2) Examine how differences in instructors? use of the framework inform intervention success, 3) Test StSRL generalizability and scale up across STEM domains and learning contexts, and 4) Iteratively design and provide faculty professional development for SRL STEM interventions. Quantitative methods will be employed to study whether such objectives have been met. This project plans to measure the impact of the framework and interventions on student achievement and retention in STEM through rich data sources. Project data will include students? demographics, course performance, and StSRL prompt performance, as well as SRL outcomes, such as metacognition, motivational variables, and learning strategy use. In addition, data analytics from the bidirectional, real-time interventions will contribute to understanding the implementation of large-scale, technology-supported interventions. Rigorous study of instructors? use of the framework will inform and improve faculty professional development to serve as a model for scaling interventions. An interdisciplinary team of learning researchers and science faculty will offer a combination of education theory expertise with discipline-based education research knowledge to contribute broadly to scholarly communities. This project hopes to not only directly impact students? self-regulated learning, learning outcomes, and retention, but also provide a roadmap for deep collaborations among learning experts and science-content experts to drive advancement of evidence-based pedagogies in STEM contexts. Results from previous work in biology and physics settings will be scaled to include other disciplines and, importantly, other populations, including learners enrolled in regional colleges, adult STEM learners in online settings, and underrepresented minority students participating in summer bridge programs.  The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on the development of a smartphone application for agricultural crop disease detection. Early detection of pests and diseases helps contain the spread of the disease. While crop diseases can have a significant impact on crop yields, leading to economic losses for farmers and potentially affecting food security, there are no reliable computer vision-based solutions to help researchers and farmers achieve reliable disease scoring in the field. This technology is a mobile application for plant disease detection that automates crop pest and disease recognition in the field and goes beyond what may be achieved with manual field scouting. The use of this technology may improve crop yield and empower more efficient management and decision making in agricultural production.<br/><br/>The technology is based on the prior development of agricultural crop disease detection using a smartphone application. Plants infected by pests or diseases typically have marks or lesions on the leaves, stems, flowers, or fruits. The technology is designed to be deployed in the cloud for real-time disease detection and uses advanced, lightweight deep learning models and large image sets collected directly from agricultural fields covering all scenarios to achieve accurate disease detection results.  In addition, the technology is designed to provide detection results in multiple modalities based on users? needs including disease score and images with segmentation for visualization and measurements of the size or count of diseased areas. The application may be used to collect and record the appropriate crop images to the cloud. This application may significantly speed up pest and disease detection efficiency while reducing labor use and eliminating expertise from human professionals as compared to the traditional scores-in-notes manual method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology has the potential to reduce testing time by over 50% on average, across a large number of code changes. The integration of the technology into already existing workflows will introduce minimal disruptions and remain hidden from most software developers, increasing the chance for adoption. This research will bring: (a) a reduction in testing time and faster feedback to developers, (b) a reduction in required resources to run tests which will reduce overall cost and maintenance cost, and (c) an alignment with green computing efforts and carbon neutrality.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a regression test selection tool (RTS) that reduces testing cost by skipping tests that are not impacted by code changes. This technology has the potential to be integrated in most common development workflows. The tool can capture dependencies for each test (or a group of similar tests) on fine-grained code level (e.g., classes, methods, and functions). Once a user changes one of the code elements, the test tool will automatically identify a set of tests to run, and those to skip as they are not impacted by changes.

However, they also pose several challenges due to their ever-growing size and dynamic nature. Often, these data sets are processed as data streams or distributed across multiple machines. Sketching and streaming algorithms have been successful in tackling many problems in these settings, ranging from data analysis, network algorithms, to optimization. One research objective of this project is to further improve these algorithms, in terms of time and memory efficiency, with the aid of machine learning predictions. This project will also apply sketching techniques to develop federated machine learning algorithms where data is distributed across machines or devices, offering privacy advantages due to their decentralized nature. The project also aims to improve the foundation of data science and computer science education at San Diego State University and in the community at large through collaboration with the TRIPODS EnCore Institute at UC San Diego.<br/><br/>Unlike traditional worst-case analysis, by incorporating machine learning to unravel the underlying structure of the data, it becomes possible in many cases to design better algorithms. The investigator plans to improve the efficiency of existing sketching and streaming algorithms using machine learning. These improvements are in terms of space and time complexity as well as approximation quality. A wide range of problems in this paradigm including data summarization, graph theory, and combinatorial optimization will be considered. Additionally, the investigator plans to utilize sketching to aid the design of machine learning algorithms in distributed and federated settings. Data sketches offer several advantages for this task. They have a small memory footprint and can be merged to form a sketch of the combined data. Additionally, they reveal minimal information about local data, benefiting privacy. The investigator aims to employ sketching algorithms on various problems such as building boosted decision trees for classification and regression, and learning a Bayesian network to explain the data.

This project focuses on developing and implementing strategies for improving STEM mentoring specifically within the Research Experience in Mentoring (REM) programs. While the REM programs have been very successful at providing research opportunities for participants from unique demographics, the Research Experience in Mentoring (REM) PIs are asked to develop and implement a mentoring plan without any training or support in how to be effective mentors. To support effective mentoring within REM programs, the Mentoring Catalyst was established. The overarching mission of the Mentoring Catalyst is to catalyze a programmatic change that positively impacts the mentors and the student/teacher mentees by establishing a community of practice around strong mentorship, student support and research success. The REM model of sustained mentoring was used to guide the development of the initiative.<br/><br/>The four overarching components of the Mentoring Catalyst 3.0 project are to 1) Provide REM mentor training; 2) Build and maintain the REM community of practice; 3) Develop REM mini-conferences at discipline-specific professional meetings; and 4) Develop post-programmatic mentoring resources. To achieve these goals, the REM Catalyst Initiative 3.0 will continue to implement an 8-hr online Entering Mentoring workshop, host annual REM PI meetings, while also building additional programming centered around effective post-programmatic mentorship. During the online workshops, mentors will gather to discuss mentoring topics, while also establishing a strong community of REM mentors. At the culmination of the virtual workshop mentors will develop a mentoring philosophy and a post-program mentoring plan. These philosophies and plans will be shared with the REM community through online platforms and more broadly through presentations at national meetings and peer reviewed publications. REM mentors will also be invited to participate in the annual two-day REM Mentoring Conference that will include training on how to implement mentor training at their home institutions and sharing of best-practices utilized by each unique REM program. These activities facilitate the continued establishment of a strong community of practice that brings together long-standing programs with newly established REMs to increase the commitment towards strong mentorship, student support and research success. Additionally, Catalyst 3.0 will integrate post-program mentoring discussions throughout all their programming, and also provide support for mini-conferences at professional disciplinary-specific societies during the academic year to promote participant engagement after the culmination of REM summer research programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, humans are not the only primates to experience obstetric difficulties. Birth complications as severe as maternal or infant death have been recorded in some small-bodied monkey species, whose babies have relatively large bodies during birth. This doctoral dissertation research tests the hypothesis that infant cranial narrowness is an evolutionary adaptation to mitigate obstetric constraint in these small-bodied monkeys. By deepening our understanding of obstetric constraint in nonhuman primates, and how these species cope with it, we may also better understand the evolutionary roots of the human obstetric dilemma. This project supports the research and training of an early-career female scientist and development of educational modules on the evolution of obstetric constraint and the necessity of obstetric and reproductive healthcare. <br/><br/>Many small-bodied new-world monkeys exhibit a long and narrow skull shape, in contrast to the globular shape observed in humans and apes. Previous research suggests that cranial narrowness allows these species to give birth to large-brained infants while minimizing the risk of obstructed labor, drawing parallels to the human obstetric dilemma. Conversely, small-bodied old-world monkeys do not exhibit cranial narrowness as adults, a disparity that could be explained by variation in obstetric constraints or by interspecies differences in how cranial shape changes after birth. This project analyzes the correlation between obstetric constraint and cranial narrowness in nonhuman primates and uses geometric morphometrics to track cranial shape change from infant to adult life stages in representative species of small-bodied new-world and old-world monkeys. The investigators synthesize methods from prior research in the fields of obstetrics and developmental morphology to create 3D reconstructions of the primate birth canal and generate infant primate CT scan data valuable to future anthropological research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The potential for drought and forest degradation to break this forest-sustaining recycling system, pushing the Amazon rainforest past a point of collapse into a degraded or even savanna state, has received much recent attention in the media and scientific literature. However, exactly how the so-called ?tipping point? occurs in any given forest site is unclear. This project investigates two possible causes of tipping points, both of which are predicted to become more common in the future: severe drought linked to El Nio climate conditions, and forest degradation caused by increasingly frequent strong storms and winds. This award capitalizes on a fleeting opportunity to observe how the ongoing drought, amplified by previous forest degradation, shuts down the capacity of trees to transfer water from the soil to the atmosphere, and thereby breaks the water pump that sustains rainfall recycling throughout the Amazon. The knowledge produced will help scientists predict when and how Amazon-wide tipping points might occur, which would importantly affect weather patterns, water resources, and economic stability in South America, as well as global climate. This study has broad impacts on education, through training of graduate students at public universities and through a custom-designed high school educational program that connects U.S. students with Amazon researchers and real scientific data from trees of the world?s most famous tropical forest.<br/><br/>This study focuses on whole-forest and leaf-level observations of transpiration?the transport of water by trees from soil to atmosphere during photosynthesis?through drought and initial recovery. It tests three key hypotheses at the heart of the Amazon forest tipping-point paradigm. H1) Whole-forest drought sensitivity is heightened by the legacy of previous droughts. H1 is tested by comparing eddy-flux-tower measured 2023/24 drought response to those of previous droughts, notably the extreme El Nio of 2015/16. H2) Whole-forest drought sensitivity emerges from individual trees? differing ecophysiological strategies for drought response. These strategies contribute to ecosystem-scale drought sensitivity and structure the tipping point onset. H2 is tested by observing responses across six dominant species, providing a foundation for individual-to-ecosystem trait-based scaling. H3) Forest drought sensitivity is heightened by disturbance-induced forest degradation. H3, widely postulated but never directly tested, explores the tipping point mechanisms relating increased drought sensitivity to altered energy balance from forest cover loss. H3 is tested by comparing tree ecohydrology and microenvironments between forest interior and large windthrow gaps. This research will provide new, hard-to-observe datasets that will allow critical tests (and subsequent improvement) of models of forest drought response and ecohydrologic tipping points<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, we know little about the early life stages of seafloor invertebrates - embryos, larvae, and juveniles ? which are vital for the health of marine ecosystems but are especially vulnerable to environmental stressors. This dissertation research will focus on documenting the life cycles of seafloor invertebrate animals to understand how seafloor communities are impacted by a warming climate. While current research has shown that seafloor community changes over space and depth in Arctic glacial fjords, it is currently unknown how dispersal and mortality in the early life stages of these animals shape these gradients. This research will identify when and where young organisms settle to the seafloor and characterize mortality rates throughout a glacial fjord. The research will demonstrate how environmental stressors, such as warming temperatures or the introduction of invasive species, can impact animals? life cycles and drive the gradients in their communities. <br/><br/>This study will address three critical questions in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard: (1) How do the distributions of benthic invertebrate larvae vary across temporal and spatial scales? (2) How does settlement (e.g., rate and species composition) vary across a glacially dominated fjord? (3) What are the patterns of post-settlement mortality in an Arctic hard bottom system? A newly-invented camera system will be deployed in Kongsfjorden to continuously and autonomously observe settlement and post-settlement mortality in benthic invertebrates for the first time. Larval samples will be collected using plankton nets and identified using integrative morphological and molecular taxonomy to understand dispersal patterns for both local species and those moving north from lower latitudes.

Although hydrogen offers zero exhaust emissions, it poses challenges due to its higher flame temperature and reactivity with alloys compared to natural gas. This project focuses on developing a high-temperature alloy system, fabricated through additive manufacturing, ensuring longevity and reliability in hydrogen combustion environments. Through scaling a patent-pending thermal treatment, the project aims to enhance the alloy's material properties for durable aftermarket parts like vanes, blades, shrouds, and panel segments. These components can surpass the properties of existing precision investment castings and are essential for converting industrial gas turbines to efficiently burn hydrogen, currently powering a significant portion of US combined heat and power and global electricity generation. The carbon abatement potential is substantial, with the conversion of one targeted segment capable of reducing over 1 GT of CO2 emissions. The innovation extends to manufacturing advanced, high-value components for aerospace jet engine repair and overhaul, presenting a potential Year 3 production revenue of $20 million and providing critical supply base resiliency for hard-to-source components in gas turbines. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to advance additively manufactured, high-temperature alloy research, focusing on applications in hydrogen combustion within industrial gas turbines. The project will fabricate mechanical and environmental test specimens using an alloy composition containing oxide dispersion-strengthening constituents designed specifically to withstand reactive hydrogen conditions. Testing will encompass critical properties like creep resistance, low cycle fatigue, and hydrogen embrittlement. A pivotal aspect involves post-processing the alloy through directional heat treatment and modifying the grain structure to enhance creep resistance, which is critical in the high-temperature operation of vane segments, shrouds, blades, and gas turbine components. Studies show superior properties compared to existing additively manufactured superalloys and precision investment cast equivalents. The project's objectives include optimizing the alloy, refining manufacturing conditions, and obtaining key performance data for service conditions. Preliminary design curve data will be established, facilitating the fabrication of components for hot-fire testing and retrofitting into real gas turbine engines.

New biomolecular methods complement archaeological approaches to address timely biocultural questions regarding the status, health, and wellbeing of tropical agriculturalists living in urban societies in the past. Understanding the biological consequences of the strategies that communities and individuals employ to meet their nutritional needs while constrained by institutional inequality is a highly relevant topic today. Most of the world?s population is directly or indirectly impacted by social inequalities that influence the types, quality, and quantity of foods consumed. Archaeology is well suited to provide insight into these complex relationships in the past by linking environmental and social variables to individual decision making and the consequent health related outcomes. This study focuses on three questions: (1) within a system of structural inequality what strategies did people use to procure food; (2) how do these strategies relate to the social and environmental constraints they faced; and (3) What were the health-related outcomes of individuals of differing statuses?<br/><br/>This study explores how variation in social and environmental conditions can be observed in the biological remains of individuals and how they construct niches in response to socially driven selective pressures. Multiple types of stable isotope analyses grounded in human and plant physiology are applied to archaeological skeletal remains and to a sample of modern neotropical plants to assess physiological status and link plant categories to individual and community level diets. The samples were recovered from three political centers occupied about fifteen hundred years ago. The doctoral student is trained in novel applications of carbon and nitrogen compound specific isotope analysis of amino acids. These are applied to both humans and plants and coupled with studies of bulk carbon from bone bioapatite to reconstruct human diet in more detail than bulk tissue isotope analysis alone. This methodology is applied to a population of tropical farmers allowing the researchers to explore the complex relationships between social and environmental pressures, the strategies that communities use to mitigate those pressures, and the potential biological impacts on those living within systems of institutional inequality. Additionally, this research provides a roadmap for future archaeological studies focusing on individual diet and health during the last decade or so of life that is also applicable to fragmented and incomplete skeletal collections that can confound osteological based methods and allows researchers to ask more nuanced questions about physiology in archaeological populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The different kinds of auroras have different generation mechanisms with the discreet appearing as ?curtains? or well defined ?ribbons or lines? in the sky, while the latter are visible as ?fuzzy? structures from the ground. TECHNO (Thermospheric Estimation and Characterization with Nitric Oxide) aims at improving the modeling of aurora and probing in detail how the circulation in the upper atmosphere responds during magnetic storms. The methodology involves incorporating the physics and chemistry associated with discrete aurora in the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) model, as it currently is limited to diffuse aurora. TECHNO will investigate how the circulation of the upper atmosphere changes during magnetic storms by looking at how key chemical components of the atmosphere, Nitric Oxide (NO) varies seasonally and how it is related to changes in the aurora and the polar vortex. Investigating these issues is crucial to improving forecasts of the aurora that directly impact HF radio communication and GPS/GNSS satellite navigation, as well as changes in the density of the upper atmosphere that affect the orbits of satellites and space debris in Low Earth Orbit. This inter-disciplinary work advances scientific knowledge and will support training of an early-career scientist.<br/><br/>NO plays a significant role in the overall heat budget of the thermosphere due to its role in radiative cooling via infrared emissions. Thus, it is one of the processes that govern the distribution of energy and momentum in the ionosphere-thermosphere system. The other factors include intensification of (a) discreet aurora during increased particle precipitation and (b) meridional winds due to increased pressure gradients. The main objective of the work is to investigate the changes in NO concentrations caused by the polar vortex variability and discreet aurora. The second goal is to quantify the model uncertainties in temperature and densities as it relates to NO. The methodology comprises use of various ionospheric models (GITM, MAGNIT), simulations of storms using GITM, validation with the satellite data sets. The project will conclude with a study of how the uncertainties in auroral energy and increased downward flux affect variations in the resulting neutral density and temperature.

This is how genetically similar individuals may develop different traits when exposed to different environments during their developmental period. In primates, and other social animals, the social environment is believed to be an especially important developmental influence. Male primates are particularly interesting subjects for developmental plasticity research due to their long developmental periods, the high variance in how many offspring they produce, and the variety of tactics they use to compete for mating opportunities. In many primate species, however, even basic male developmental patterns are not well understood. In this research project, the investigators explore if and how social environments affect the behavioral, hormonal, and physical development in males of an ape species. The diversity of social environments along with the extreme physical characteristics of these male apes makes them an excellent species in which to conduct this research. In addition to contributing to our understanding of the role that social environments play in determining adult characteristics in a close human relative, this project will make significant contributions to capacity building, education, and training.  <br/><br/>Limited information is currently available regarding how male primate developmental patterns are shaped by developmental conditions. This research project explores how social environments influence the behavioral, physiological, and morphological trajectories of male gorillas.

This project collects non-invasive behavioral and photogrammetry data, along with testosterone and DHEA-S metabolites obtained from urine and fecal samples, on ~120 habituated male gorillas living in social groups of varying demographic compositions. Newly obtained information is combined with available longitudinal data to generate hormonal, physical, and behavioral profiles from infancy through adulthood.

In recent years, weed control costs have been growing due to the rise of herbicide-resistant weeds and the increase in costs of agricultural labor. Additionally, increased demand for fruits and vegetables leaves these specialty crop farmers struggling to find options to increase productivity while keeping expenses manageable. Several companies offer automated weed control in vegetables; however, these large platforms struggle not to damage fruit in berry orchards. This project aims to develop swarms of robotic devices that can operate underneath the plant canopy to provide mechanical weed control for berries throughout the year without impacting plant growth. This technological development will enable domestic fruit production to meet the growing consumer demand and allow for less chemical use in fruit production, reducing herbicide-associated health risks to farm workers and consumers. Long term, these devices can augment weed control strategies in other crops and perform different agricultural tasks such as fungicide treatments and plant health monitoring, with the goal of automating agriculture to be more efficient and sustainable. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer project aims to develop rugged, low-to-the-ground, multi-legged robots that can locomote in various agricultural fields. This technology builds off of recent works demonstrating the effectiveness of centipedes and centipede-like robots when traveling over diverse terrains. When properly coordinated, these mechanically redundant legged systems demonstrate robust locomotion in complex terrain without the need for sensory feedback. This project will leverage this platform and perform systematic robot experimentation and theoretical modeling to develop coordination schemes for various maneuvers in agricultural terrain analogues. These strategies will then be implemented on a hardened robot to reliably locomote beneath the canopy in crop fields and identify weeds using an onboard camera and computer vision techniques. This device will make use of low-cost components and principles of mobility in complex environments to deliver guaranteed locomotion in these unpredictable terrains. Eventually, swarms of these devices will be deployed on various crop fields to provide autonomous weed management throughout the growing season, decreasing the costs of production for farmers and consumers.

ENSO causes shifts in precipitation in arid coastal areas which can cause flash flooding and severe damage. This study emphasizes how changing floodplain morphology can make it more difficult for people to reduce their exposure to these floods. Flood events can alter the landscape to the extent that peoples? capabilities to adapt to future events are limited. Consequently, knowledge about how to adapt to these events must be updated to deal with future potential hazards. Communities must continuously experience, observe, and communicate as they adjust over centuries and millennia to evolving floodplain conditions. Archaeology is well-suited to examine these processes of adapting to the evolution of river hazards. Attention to ancient settlement patterns and their respective floodplain environments reveals how societies mitigated potential flooding by finding elevated areas and generating flood-adapted infrastructure. Interpretations of this data inform modern mitigation efforts as flooding is an ongoing, dynamic risk experienced increasingly by populations worldwide. <br/><br/>The interdisciplinary project consists of two parts: integrated hydrologic modeling to predict river behavior and a geological study of sediment sampled from past floods. The model uses historic stream flows, geospatial data, paleoclimatic reconstructions, and ethnohistoric accounts to determine ENSO flood hotspots. Additionally, paleochannels and remnant riverbeds are significant conduits of and contributors to overland flooding. Given their longevity in floodplain geomorphology, they serve as critical indicators for where past and future flooding might occur. Researchers study 650 previously surveyed archaeological sites in a single river valley to determine their exposure to increasing ENSO flood magnitudes in the floodplain and alluvial fan. The team utilizes geophysical and geochemical methods to evaluate soil characteristics in paleochannels to ascertain the impacts of flooding on the long-term stability and primary productivity of bankside landscapes. Leveraging multiple approaches to investigating flooding, this project contributes to archaeological methods and theories regarding flood risk, water resource management, and land use to explore past human-environment interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) has improved the lighting efficiency, but still more than 50% of the electrical energy is dissipated as heat (emitted phonons). Improving energy conversion and demonstrating timely and significant impact of phonon engineering using gallium-nitride GaN LED is the goal of this proposed EAGER. This will be done by adding a heterobarrier (HB) layer to the LED structure for a net absorption and recycling of phonon emissions that will provide improved power efficiency. The objectives are to theoretically predict the improvements and to fabricate and test the optimal design, aiming to demonstrate the proof-of-concept and make it available for technological implementations. Through collaboration with an GaN LED and display expert, the proposed improvement verifications can be implemented at commercial level resulting in significant national energy savings and enhanced device thermal management. Fundamental understanding and insightful use of the phonon-electron-photon interactions advance the heat transfer physics and engineering.  <br/><br/>The proposed research would be the first attempt at in-situ spectral-phonon recycling in LED using a graded HB. The research combines simulations of the phonon transport and recycling behavior to understand and advance the novel idea of phonon recycling, and also includes an experimental verification of the new concept. The one-year EAGER effort is therefore focused on demonstrating the new concept of phonon-recycling for LEDs, and if successful can provide significant paybacks in terms of energy savings. The proposed research advances the premise that the benefits of phonon-recycling via the HB is achieved through three distinct pathways: (a) reduced heat load resulting in a temperature decrease for LEDs (b) increased power efficiency, where the electric current in the LED harvests phonon energy, creating a net potential gain, and (c) enhanced photon emission spectra due to the net potential gain in the HB layer. The predictions in the proposed research use mesoscale (Boltzmann transport) interactions, which involves phonons, electrons and holes, and photons. The fabrication and testing/characterization of the optimal HB GaN LED will provide the first ever experimental demonstration of improvements in LED performance and energy savings via the use of a HB. The proposed research aligns with the Department of Energy solid-state lighting R&D goals for 2035 which would enable national energy savings equivalent to 3% of US energy consumption in 2022.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

OSA affects over 1 billion people globally, including 54 million in the U.S. Untreated, CCCp leads to debilitating daytime sleepiness, neurocognitive dysfunction, accidents, and doubles the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes, costing the US healthcare system $88 billion annually. Notably, 30% of all OSA patients, or 16 million Americans, suffer from CCCp, a particularly challenging form of sleep apnea to treat. Over half of the patients fail the first-line treatment of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and many avoid costly surgeries, leaving 6 million untreated yearly. This solution offers a non-invasive, clinically effective treatment for OSA patients, focusing on CCCp and poorly treated palatal collapse. This technology seeks to transform sleep apnea care by providing an accessible treatment option with significant societal and commercial impact.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a neurostimulation platform addressing the need for non-invasive, clinically effective treatment of palatal collapse in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Unlike traditional neurostimulation methods with limited applicability and invasive implantation, this approach takes a non-invasive approach by targeting stimulation to the palate and pharynx. The device may be fit and titrated in-clinic and deployed by patients each night at-home. The technology involves a removable oral appliance that activates stimulation during sleep, timing therapy delivery to patient inspiration. The device set, comprising the oral appliance and a wireless charging case, enables easy control of stimulation parameters. The case also records and uploads usage and disease parameters, offering data for clinician-guided therapy optimization. Validation through research, including benchtop, ex-vivo and in-vivo porcine and cadaver studies, has poised this technology for clinical trials and eventual Food and Drug Administration approval. These studies confirm the ability to elicit clinically significant muscle responses using non-invasive neurostimulation, creating a solution that addresses the root cause of collapse in OSA patients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as the delivery of a baby before 37 weeks of gestation. PTB is the number one cause of infant death worldwide and it also the number one cause of infant neurological disorders and long-term cognitive impairment.  PTB leads to health issues, including problems with hearing, vision, digestion, and breathing. To decrease preterm births, it is important to identify at-risk pregnancies to initiate preventive interventions. Unfortunately, numerous studies indicate that current methods are insufficient and ineffective in predicting preterm birth. The strength of the cervix collagen fiber network is integral to maintaining gestation, and loss of collagen architecture is intrinsic to many preterm labor occurrences. Using the technology developed in this project, the Portable Preterm Imaging System (PRIMM) to monitor collagen architecture, the team can non-invasively assess the risk of pre-term labor at early stages. The risk assessment of PTB could be used to formulate a therapeutic strategy, including using medications or bedrest to delay birth. Affording the infant a few additional weeks of gestation could improve health outcomes for both mother and child as well as reduce healthcare costs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a method for scanning, imaging, and screening cervical dysplasia, infections, and cancer. The Portable Preterm Imaging System (PPRIM) introduced in this research is a proprietary technology comprising a specialized imaging system enclosed within a flexible insertable sheath. This imaging system is equipped with a camera featuring integrated polarizers, accompanied by a custom-made LED ring illuminator. The novel design approach employed in this system enables the generation of a matrix dataset capable of forming voxel per sample. Notably, the PPRIM is unique due to its wide field of view which ensures the entire cervix can be captured in a single image. Furthermore, its fast acquisition time facilitates quick and efficient examinations. The PPRIM has been designed to prioritize ease of use and provide comfort during the procedure. Its simplicity is a key feature, as the device offers comprehensive coverage of the cervical area, delivering valuable information to healthcare providers and patients alike.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on developing and implementing strategies for improving STEM mentoring specifically within the Research Experience in Mentoring (REM) programs. While the REM programs have been very successful at providing research opportunities for participants from unique demographics, the Research Experience in Mentoring (REM) PIs are asked to develop and implement a mentoring plan without any training or support in how to be effective mentors. To support effective mentoring within REM programs, the Mentoring Catalyst was established. The overarching mission of the Mentoring Catalyst is to catalyze a programmatic change that positively impacts the mentors and the student/teacher mentees by establishing a community of practice around strong mentorship, student support and research success. The REM model of sustained mentoring was used to guide the development of the initiative.<br/><br/>The four overarching components of the Mentoring Catalyst 3.0 project are to 1) Provide REM mentor training; 2) Build and maintain the REM community of practice; 3) Develop REM mini-conferences at discipline-specific professional meetings; and 4) Develop post-programmatic mentoring resources. To achieve these goals, the REM Catalyst Initiative 3.0 will continue to implement an 8-hr online Entering Mentoring workshop, host annual REM PI meetings, while also building additional programming centered around effective post-programmatic mentorship. During the online workshops, mentors will gather to discuss mentoring topics, while also establishing a strong community of REM mentors. At the culmination of the virtual workshop mentors will develop a mentoring philosophy and a post-program mentoring plan. These philosophies and plans will be shared with the REM community through online platforms and more broadly through presentations at national meetings and peer reviewed publications. REM mentors will also be invited to participate in the annual two-day REM Mentoring Conference that will include training on how to implement mentor training at their home institutions and sharing of best-practices utilized by each unique REM program. These activities facilitate the continued establishment of a strong community of practice that brings together long-standing programs with newly established REMs to increase the commitment towards strong mentorship, student support and research success. Additionally, Catalyst 3.0 will integrate post-program mentoring discussions throughout all their programming, and also provide support for mini-conferences at professional disciplinary-specific societies during the academic year to promote participant engagement after the culmination of REM summer research programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there are no large-scale or nationwide professional development opportunities focused on reforming chemistry laboratory curricula. This comprehensive year-long professional development program will empower chemistry educators to enhance student learning in chemistry laboratories by promoting scientific practices and fostering a sense of belonging. Moreover, as part of the professional development program, participants will create and disseminate more than 40 new inquiry-based laboratory projects, which have been shown to be more effective for student learning than traditional ?cookbook? style laboratory experiences. Data will be collected and analyzed to broaden understanding of the extent to which such professional development affects teaching beliefs and instructional practices of laboratory curricula developers. This new knowledge will have the potential to impact the success of future faculty professional development initiatives. Overall, this project will lead to direct instructional support that can benefit thousands of undergraduate chemistry students and may lead to long-term changes in the instructional practices of up to 126 laboratory curriculum developers. This Institutional and Community Transformation Level 2 project aligns with NSF's mission to advance science education, serving the national interest by improving student success.<br/><br/>Chemistry educators have long been dissatisfied with traditional laboratory approaches, but many face barriers that prevent them from adopting new frameworks and evidence-based practices. This project aims to establish a nationwide community of chemistry laboratory curriculum developers equipped with the knowledge, skills, and resources to implement effective instructional reforms. Three bodies of work comprise the theory of change guiding this project: (1) Clarke and Hollingsworth?s Model of Teacher Professional Growth; (2) Wenger?s Communities of Practice framework; and (3) AAC&U?s Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM logic model. Four cohorts containing 42 institutional teams from varying contexts and institutional settings (including minority-serving and 2-year institutions) will collaborate to create and disseminate more than 40 inquiry-based laboratory projects. The teams will participate in a comprehensive yearlong professional development during which they will learn about evidence-based practices, including (1) curriculum reform through backward design with a specific focus on pedagogical aspects unique to chemistry (e.g., Johnstone?s triangle); (2) reducing equity gaps through fostering a sense of belonging; and (3) building scientific practices through inquiry (NGSS framework). By establishing this nationwide community of laboratory curriculum developers with training in evidence-based practices (84-126 instructors and 42 TAs), this program will have a transformative impact on chemistry laboratory instruction practices. Additionally, through triangulation of student and instructor surveys, instructors? reflections and interviews, and laboratory artifacts, the project will generate new knowledge about the landscape of instructional thinking and practices of the laboratory curriculum developers and will evaluate the extent to which professional development impacts progressions in the thinking and practices of the laboratory curriculum developers.

Concerns about emergent HABs in the region have surged and coincide with reports on toxins present in water and seafood. Major knowledge gaps currently exist on environmental drivers that lead to the development of these blooms and the production of toxins, and associated human health risks. With growing threats to ecosystem and human health, with the increasing frequency, intensity, and range of cyanobacterial blooms, attributable to eutrophication and likely exacerbated by climate change, NC-CAPE will provide data to guide efforts to implement effective monitoring approaches, inform guideline values for safe consumption of water and seafood, deliver predictive tools to assess emergent and future toxin exposure risk, and leverage community engagement initiatives to fill data gaps and improve oceans and human health. NC C-CAPE will provide investigators at all career stages valuable opportunities for collaboration, leadership, cross-training, as well as the foundational support to expand their research programs across disciplinary boundaries. The Center?s Community Engagement Core will use principles central to understanding and addressing HAB exposure and prevention so as to empower community members to conduct critical and systemic inquiry. The Center is committed to thoughtfully recruiting students, postdocs, and staff, and will convene an External Advisory Committee that reflects stakeholders.

However, compared to lithium reactions, sodium chemistry poses a considerable mechanical deformation to the electrodes and creates more stress and degradation that compromise battery performance. This project, supported by the Ceramics Program within the Division of Materials Research, seeks to create a fundamental understanding of battery degradation via a close integration of novel experiments, data analysis, and modeling approaches. Such knowledge is crucial to elucidating the aging mechanisms of sodium-based batteries, which synergistically contribute to the development of materials of enhanced reliability for the same applications. The multifaceted collaboration between Purdue and Virginia Tech provides unique training opportunities for developing workforce for STEM related careers, with particular relevance to meeting the demand of the clean energy industries, which is expected to grow significantly in the coming decades. The research also provides a platform to continue the recruitment and engagement of the underrepresented groups and to educate future scientists on convergent research skills and entrepreneurial training.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The project aims to achieve a holistic understanding of chemomechanics in phase-changing electroceramic electrodes through mechanistic studies of defects-charge coupling at the lattice scale, phase-stress coupling in single particles, and statistics of the particle network in the composite electrodes of sodium-ion batteries. The research is based on the hypothesis that: (i) the breakdown of the local structural symmetry not only induces lattice distortion and stress gradient at the nanoscale but also impacts the charge distribution in the lattice, (ii) the stochastic nature of material defects is coupled with the phase inhomogeneity in the single particles that gives rise to a stress/strain profile largely deviated from the conventional core-shell pattern; and (iii) in composite electrodes, the charge heterogeneity, mechanical damage, and electrochemical activities co-evolve, resulting in a dynamic ionic/electronic network in the cell. Following the hypothesis, the project includes the following research tasks. (i) Quantify the defect characteristics and map the defects-charging-composition at the nanoscale using controlled synthesis, synchrotron analytical techniques, and computational modeling. (ii) Understand the phase-stress coupling in the single electroceramic particles using the designs of grain engineering and surface coating. (iii) Identify the characteristic metrics of particle network in composite electrodes using machine learning, understand the dynamic evolution of particle network under operating conditions, and interpret the impact of mechanical degradation on battery performance.

Experimental research, however, rarely identifies specific, transferable STEM instructional practices, because STEM education research has typically implemented student-level randomization far more than it has implemented teacher-level randomization. A major barrier limiting scientific progress is the lack of a large-scale trialing infrastructure that can support teacher-level randomization and experimentation, given the logistical constraints of recruiting multiple sites and successfully randomizing at the teacher or classroom level. Challenges in three major areas need to be addressed before such a teacher-level trialing infrastructure could be built. These are: (1) optimal research-practice partnerships that maintain standing research agreements; (2) research design issues such as statistical power and contamination; and (3) data sharing, merging, analysis, and reporting in a large network of participating schools and teachers. A cross-cutting set of challenges, relevant to all three areas, involves training of experimenters to conduct relevant and ethical field experiments, addressing diversity and inclusion in the researchers and participants, and maintaining a fair and equitable governance structure. <br/><br/>This Midscale Research Infrastructure Incubator will launch a two-year, accelerated process to address these challenges and develop a consensus plan for a STEM-teacher-focused trialing platform. Stakeholders will be from diverse communities, including STEM educators and administrators; teacher professional learning organizations; pre-service teacher training programs; statistics and data science; and the social and behavioral sciences. Through large-group meetings and focused task forces, plans for an infrastructure will be developed by addressing each of the three major areas, as well as the cross-cutting issues.

Andrews Experimental Forest is an internationally known center for forest and stream ecosystem research in central Oregon and is part of multiple research networks, including the Long-Term Ecological Research network where scientists and NSF have invested in long-term research programs about environmental change. In the fall of 2023, a major wildfire burned over much of this forest, threatening adjacent communities and destroying existing research plans and projects. The scientific community must immediately reimagine their research at the same time that the local community has to reimagine its preparation for future wildfires. This moment provides a short window of time to gain important insights into public engagement with science. With declining trust in science, it is critical to better understand approaches to involve the community in scientific research agenda setting. Public engagement with science researchers and practitioners are making important advancements in this area of work, including strengthening approaches that emphasize reciprocity and relational objectives, and creating opportunities for scientists and publics to listen to each other and feel heard in the co-production of knowledge. However, recent research about co-production of knowledge identifies a gap in evidence about how co-production for actionable knowledge related to complex environmental challenges actually happens, and how best to address tensions and challenges that can accompany such a process. To address each of the needs detailed above, this RAPID project will 1) facilitate local community public engagement with the scientific research community; 2) facilitate consideration of local community interests and priorities in the development of the new long-term research program; and 3) study the impact of a community engagement process on the scientists, the participating publics, and the long-term research plan itself. The knowledge generated from this project will immediately inform and help align H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest?s research agenda with the local rural and economically disadvantaged communities? priorities, a change that will reverberate for decades to come. It will also provide an evidence-based example for others that, given the influential thought leadership in these research communities, will likely be emulated by other long-term ecological research programs, Experimental Forests, and other STEM research organizations, particularly the environmental research networks, field stations, and marine laboratories of the U.S. <br/><br/>This project is a collaboration between Oregon State University and McKenzie Watershed Council comprised of ~25 partners representing local residents, commercial recreational interests, rural schools, conservation organizations, utilities, and local, state, and federal government entities. Additional leadership comes from the Director of H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest. The facilitation and research components of this project employ the SCRREE framework developed through research and practice in the field of Public Engagement with Science. According to the SCRREE framework, effective public engagement with science is: Strategic, Cumulative, Reciprocal, Reflexive, Equitable, and Evidence-based. A series of approximately five community conversations, and interviews with approximately 30 scientists, staff and leaders, and community members will be immediately analyzed, summarized, and discussed with the larger research team to inform the research agenda development process. The study will use a single-case case study design with five elements: 1) community mapping, 2) community conversations, 3) interviews 4) observations of the research planning process, and 5) document analysis. Interview, observation and document data will be analyzed using thematic coding with pre-determined coding rubrics also grounded in the SCRREE framework, while allowing for additional emergent themes. Results will be shared back to the local community and H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest staff, research community, and networks. For additional national dissemination, the project will submit two peer-reviewed articles to open-source journals. <br/><br/>This RAPID project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which supports projects that: (a) contribute to research and practice that considers informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) promote personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advance public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) foster interest in STEM careers; (e) create and enhance the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improve community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhance science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Together, these activities are designed to help aspiring PIs develop compelling and comprehensive research plans. The workshop's broader significance and importance are the impact these activities will have on better equipping aspiring PIs from a range of institutions and backgrounds to write competitive SaTC proposals, better reflecting the breadth of the nation's researchers and their ideas.<br/><br/>Writing a successful funding proposal often requires substantial implicit knowledge about community expectations and norms. Experienced PIs (i.e., those who have previously been funded) and their colleagues draw on past experiences having proposals reviewed, as well as ""folk knowledge"" from discussions with their peers. Aspiring PIs who lack this experience typically experience lower levels of success in the competitive funding process even though their intellectual ideas might match or exceed those of experienced PIs. Notably, experienced PIs are more likely to work at large universities that already receive generous NSF support, be part of existing professional networks, and come from the same academic lineages.

T cells can be modified with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). These are synthetic molecules that provide T cells with a renewed ability to sense and destroy cancer cells. CAR engineered T cells are clinically effective at fighting some blood cancers. Unfortunately, our understanding of parameters that tune how a T cell responds to a cancer cell is severely lacking. This project aims to gain a fundamental understanding of the parameters of CARs that tune T cell responses, and to characterize how these parameters affect CAR engineered T cell function and fate. This research program is integrated with an education plan that aims to support students in the community college system in the Tampa Bay area, providing mentorship and guided research experiences for students as they navigate the STEM pathway.<br/><br/>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic T cell receptors that mimic T cell receptor activation and co-stimulation. These empirically designed receptors provide a potent but unoptimized signaling response.  As a result, engineered T cells are susceptible to overactivation or suppression, two common but distinct challenges to cell therapy. The influence of important parameters such as dephosphorylation kinetics and downstream adapter preferences on CAR signaling remains essentially unstudied. Optimizing receptor function to support robust T cell activation remains a trial-and-error exercise. This project will combine protein engineering, cell biology, and omics experiments to establish a fundamental understanding of how the signaling components of CARs can be tuned to yield improved responses under activating and suppressive conditions. These experiments will provide fundamental advances through 1) surveying motif landscapes for phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and adapter binding in synthetic T cell activation; 2) quantitatively understanding how dephosphorylation kinetics influence CAR signaling; 3) mapping synthetic signaling in T cells with adapter bias.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

After a neuromuscular injury, patients often struggle with handling and manipulating fragile objects due to motor and sensory deficits of the hand. While existing occupational-therapy and physical-therapy devices focus primarily on gross upper-limb function, this project introduces a device capable of monitoring fine sensorimotor function of the hand, as would be used when gently grabbing a fragile object. The device is simple, portable, and inexpensive, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing facilities, and home-health workflows. The occupational and physical therapy market is expected to grow from $53.08 billion in 2023 to $92.38 billion by 2030 as the US population ages and the prevalence of neuromuscular injuries increases. Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the US, and this project offers a solution to assess and rehabilitate the fine sensorimotor function of stroke survivors.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a handheld device with embedded sensors and artificial intelligence to quantify fine sensorimotor hand function. Patients can use this device to simulate gently grasping a fragile object without breaking it. The embedded sensors allow for automated assessments and rehabilitation sessions, thereby reducing the demand on therapists. Task difficulty can also be automatically updated in real-time to maximize patient engagement and clinical outcomes. Quantitative health metrics are calculated and displayed in real-time to improve diagnostic accuracy and interrater reliability.

They recognize foreign infectious agents. Their molecular recognition capabilities make them ideal to sense and to treat diseases. They are, however, not useful in binding to and blocking the action of proteases. This is important because protease activity can trigger the development of cancers. Key proteases involved in cancer development, called matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), are overproduced during the development of cancer and during diabetes, for example. The objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of modifying antibodies with unique amino acids on the regulation of MMP activity. The education component of this proposal seeks to enhance the Tufts STEM Ambassadors program and strengthen a partnership with the biotechnology program of an area vocational/technical high school.<br/><br/>Extracellular proteases and peptidases play key roles in human health and disease. The specific disruption of these enzymes remains a fundamental challenge. For example, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play key roles in development, inflammation, cancer, and infectious disease.

The overall goal is to establish principles of ?chemically diversified? antibodies that enable next-generation protease inhibitor discovery. This project will evaluate integration of noncanonical amino acids and yeast display technology to exploit covalent (irreversible) binding and metal binding functionalities within antibodies. The investigators hope to discover chemistries capable of interfering with enzyme functions.

This insight will advance the understanding of living systems and has enormous potential in understanding diseases like cancer, where the stickiness and mechanical properties of cells play key roles. Beyond its scientific merit, the research's impact will stretch beyond the laboratory. An innovative, hands-on course that immerses undergraduate students in Biological Physics research, fostering the next wave of scientists, will be designed.

At the heart of this project is the Multi-Axial Entropic Spring Tweezers along Ring-shaped Origami (MAESTRO), a low-cost, high-throughput technology for applying controlled mechanical tensions to individual integrins from multiple directions. MAESTRO leverages the entropic elasticity of single-stranded DNA to generate mechanical tension, the exquisite positional control of DNA origami to control the directions of applied tensions, and device miniaturization to reduce cost and increase throughput. To validate the performance of MAESTRO, the tension-inducing tool will be benchmarked by assessing the kinetics of Holliday junctions under mechanical tension. Measurements will be compared with published data from optical tweezer experiments and theoretical predictions derived from the Boltzmann distribution. Advanced single-molecule methods, including confocal single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) and total internal reflection microscopy, will be used to dissect the intricate signaling of integrins in response to these multi-directional mechanical stimuli.

Cancer immunotherapies have shown great promise and efficacy in clinical trial studies, with seven being approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); However, manufacturing these cells remains a limiting factor in widespread adoption. Current FDA-approved therapies require up to 250 million immune cells per infusion, with costs for a single dose nearing $500,000. The current manufacturing limitations underscore the urgent need for innovation in cell manufacturing. Prior research with an animal model shows this solution can reduce the manufacturing time for cell therapies by 30% in comparison to the fastest technology on the market. Using this technology, manufacturing directors at biopharmaceutical companies may be able to save space in their facilities and save money on labor and cell culture resources while clinicians at cancer centers are able to treat patients at a faster rate. By addressing time and resource limitations, the technology has the potential to reduce the financial barrier to lifesaving cell therapies, increasing adoption by cancer patients. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a centrifugal fluidized expansion perfusion bioreactor prototype. The bioreactor streamlines the cell expansion process by balancing centrifugal forces with a continuous feed of fresh medium to remove inhibitory waste products and retain cells unlike current solutions. Early research has shown that immune cells from cattle can be expanded, and that the prototype can sustain high cell population densities over 100 million cells/mL, reducing manufacturing time from 7-14 days to 5 days, and maintaining cell growth at 95% of the maximum rate. Moreover, unlike current manufacturing equipment, the bioreactor fits easily on a standard lab bench and is entirely self-contained, with its housing acting as a standalone unit with air filters and ultraviolet-c sterilization?eliminating the need for multi-million dollar cleanrooms.

Satellites are a crucial provider of Earth observational data to various end users across defense, agriculture, energy, and other broad markets. Fundamentally, the frequency and latency of this data depends on the rate of downlink availability of the satellites. This means satellites in lower orbits, or many more satellites in higher orbits, can provide more frequent ?new? data to end users. CubeSats, or satellites about the size of a shoebox, could provide more coverage and better data frequency than larger satellites for lower cost if they are able to maintain their orbits for long durations (greater than 1 year). This longevity requires a propulsion-equipped CubeSat bus to be developed for use in orbital remote sensing. The potential impacts of this technology are targeted towards the global satellite market and the downstream end-users of satellite data though there may be additional applications in biomedical and microfluidic markets as well.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an entirely solid-state, flow-controlled, electric thruster system for use in CubeSats.

The core technology is a solid-state flow control device developed to offer the same level of fluid control and precision as is available on much larger, pressure-driven mechanical propulsion systems currently used on many much larger commercial satellites. A digital microfluidic device has been researched, developed, and tested in a lab environment to confirm feasibility.

The glass under development will darken its tint when needed to avoid uncomfortable glare while maintaining the view. Sunlight also brings energy in the form of heat into buildings and cars, especially through sunroofs. While solar heating can improve energy performance on cold days, the smart glass under development can also block unwanted heating to reduce energy required for air conditioning. To achieve significant gains in energy efficiency, the smart glass technology must be broadly deployed, which requires manufacturing at low-cost. Scalable, low-cost processing will be achieved by coating the active materials from inks over large areas of glass or plastic. By controlling both light and heat, and enabling low-cost manufacturing, the project will reshape the functionality and performance of windows by enhancing comfort and reducing unnecessary energy consumption.<br/><br/>The proposed project will address performance limitations of existing smart windows by separately controlling solar heat gain and daylighting on demand with a low-voltage controller. The project will further enable a dramatic reduction in manufacturing cost of smart windows by allowing solution-based coatings with no high energy processing steps. Nanocrystals of niobium oxide will be coated onto glass and plastic films to develop and validate the performance of rigid and flexible electrochromic devices. These prototypes will demonstrate feasibility for building skylights and windows, and automotive glass applications to improve energy performance and comfort. To overcome barriers to technology development and deployment, the project team will develop a polymer electrolyte formulation that provides sufficient mechanical stability during bending to avoid electrical short circuits while also maintaining rapid optical switching and on-off cycling stability. Transparent conducting substrates will be selected and validated that support uniform coloration during switching, allow access to a high infrared transmissive state, and remain well-conducting during film processing and device assembly.

Conflict and organized criminal activity sometimes continue after terms to end civil wars are negotiated and agreed. This research investigates the postconflict preferences of militant and criminal organizations, and the strategies they use to achieve their objectives. The research involves interviews with imprisoned leaders who are participating in a peace agreement process. These leaders possess a deep and detailed knowledge of the dynamics of crime and violence including the logics of recruitment, arming, financing, and community relations. This research will use data collected from these interviews to test hypotheses about postconflict conflict and criminal activity. It promises to yield important findings and strategies for reducing violence in postconflict societies, including those that are partners of the United States. The research team will produce scholarly research and policy documents that could contribute to policy formulation in postconflict countries as well as those affected by significant levels of armed groups. The project can also be expected to help scholars, policing organizations, and others better understand the nature of criminal governance and how armed organizations prey on communities as well as provide security and dispute resolution.<br/><br/>Part 2. Scholars have investigated the conditions that lead parties to civil conflicts negotiate peace agreements, and the degree to which such agreements contribute to the end of large-scale hostilities. This literature has devoted less attention to how militant involvement in criminal activities influence these processes. We lack knowledge of the postconflict preferences and strategies of criminal groups, and how these contribute to the negotiation of peace agreements and subsequent levels of crime, violence, and gang activity. The project addresses this gap by collecting data in the form of semi-structured interviews with leaders who have been assembled in a single prison to reach a peace agreement. The data generated from these interviews will be analyzed to understand the nature of criminal governance, how criminal organizations approach peace negotiations, and generate insights that reduce crime, violence, and gang activity.<br/><br/>Part 3:<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional Na-S and K-S batteries are attractive for LDES due to their low cost and the use of earth-abundant elements. However, their deployment is severely hindered by their high operational temperature of 300-350oC and associated degradation and safety issues. This project will use materials design and simulation-driven approaches to develop innovative electrolytes to dissolve insoluble reaction products in Na-S and K-S batteries and advance knowledge on underlying dissolution mechanisms. Such novel electrolytes will enhance reaction kinetics so the operation temperature can be reduced to 60-120oC, which not only enhances thermal stability but also decreases operational costs. The new material systems from this project have the potential to be deployed for LDES, which enhances the economic competitiveness and sustainability of U.S. The project activities will integrate research and education, targeting students from K-12 to graduate school and promoting underrepresented communities' education through hands-on experiences, advising, and research integration across all levels. <br/><br/>The primary challenge in traditional alkaline metal sulfur (AMS) batteries arises from the formation of solid M2S2 and M2S compounds during discharge (M = Na, K), which exhibit poor electrochemical kinetics. This limits the reversible redox range mainly to S/M2S3 reactions, reducing specific capacity and energy density. The goal of this project is to identify and develop new solvents that can dissolve M2S2/M2S readily to replace conventional ether electrolytes, which will in turn make M2S2/M2S electrochemically active. This will double the specific capacity of sulfur from 500 mAh/g in ether electrolytes to 1000-1500 mAh/g, along with a long cycle life. The project will utilize a simulation-driven approach to design electrolytes, such as combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML). MD simulations calculate solvation free energy, and ML enables high-throughput screening for solvents with superior M2S2 and M2S solubilities. Promising candidates will be experimentally validated. After experimentally confirming the high-performance solvents, multi-scale/multi-modal characterizations will be used to understand the fundamental dissolution mechanisms, electrochemistry and transport in the proposed system comprehensively. An Ah-level prototype will be constructed and tested, and the cost of developed materials and devices will be analyzed for large-scale deployment. The advances in knowledge and research tools together will help develop next-generation batteries for long-duration energy storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its five-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 200 unique students: pre-transfer A.A. life sciences students at MDC; post-transfer B.S. Microbiology and Cell Science (MCS) majors at UF; or students who are seeking an M.S. in MCS at UF. Although the individual timelines may vary, students who enroll full-time will usually receive scholarships of up to 2 years at each level (i.e., while pursuing associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees). Miami Dade College enrolls a large diverse population of undergraduates, and transfer students are more likely to be from groups historically underrepresented in STEM, including women, veterans, and first-generation college students. Consequently, this project has the potential to significantly broaden participation in the STEM enterprise and to identify key factors that affect retention and success of low-income transfer students. This project will also increase access by offering online options for scholars pursuing B.S. and M.S. degrees through MCS. Online education further extends opportunities to nontraditional students including adult learners, student parents, and individuals from underserved areas. By leveraging a statewide network of research facilities and existing online course-based undergraduate research experiences, both in-person and online scholars will be able to participate in faculty-mentored undergraduate research. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. This project is informed by the lessons learned from a prior S-STEM project at MDC and UF that has awarded over 400 scholarships to students pursuing associate and bachelor's degrees. Project research will use focus groups, student surveys, institutional data, and existing S-STEM data from 2018 to investigate how changes to the FAFSA in 2024 impact eligibility and awards amounts for scholarship recipients. The research plan will also explore the longer-term impacts of scholarships on transfer, graduation, and persistence in STEM and identify barriers and successful interventions in the A.A. to B.S. transfer process. The project will be assessed by a qualified independent evaluator to ensure progress toward project goals and identify elements of the project that most effectively drive student success. Results of this project will be made available through presentations at STEM education conferences, informational webinars, and publications in peer-reviewed journals. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers wish to understand the processes that drive change in small-scale societies and how socially complex societies emerge over time. A central question is if these processes have a universal pattern, or if they vary from place to place and across different social types. Researchers have documented conditions under which persistent institutionalized social and economic inequalities develop among small-scale hunter-gatherer societies. These include the control of ritual practices, including monument building, as a way to create and sustain inter-generational transmission of wealth and rights to political power. Because controlling people to make things is a commonly recognized measure of political power, building massive earthen mounds often is used as a measure of social and political complexity. Complicated and energetically costly constructions are assumed to reflect greater social and political complexity, hierarchy, and economic integration. Scholars debate the historical processes that give rise to these inequalities; many researchers assert that social change and increasing inequality is an inevitable outcome of material accumulation and defense that enhances social prestige and reproductive success. Native American philosophy, however, interprets increasing complexity as the outcome of interactions among human and non-human agents in an infinitely complicated relational world. In this world, humans have moral responsibility to maintain order and balance realized through ritual actions such as monument building at charged places on the landscape. <br/><br/>The project considers both a widely adopted archaeological assumption that hierarchical control leads to the development of large archaeological sites and compare it to a Native American approach which focuses not on hierarchy but rather community collaboration. The site is perhaps the largest hunter-gatherer site in the world with exceptionally large earthen mounds and ridges, and therefore is an ideal location to investigate if changing hunter-gatherer sociopolitical variation results from the accumulation of economic and labor control over hundreds of years as is claimed, or if building earthworks is a communal activity rapidly undertaken and given freely because Native people have a moral obligation to perform rituals at certain places that ensure balance, harmony, and order. To answer these questions, a multi-disciplinary team will use advanced quantitative and qualitative methods from archaeology, geology, and geotechnical engineering to investigate the history of site use, the pace and duration of earthwork construction, and earthwork building methods. Multi-method analyses allow assessment of whether hunter-gatherer complexity at the site an outgrowth of mutigenerational practices where unequal control of wealth was accumulated slowly encouraging the emergence of institutionalized political and economic complexity. This project provides educational opportunities and professional training to early career Native American scholars, U.S. and international students, school children and site visitors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central goal of this CAREER project is to promote 4- to 6-year-old children?s scientific learning through parent-child conversations during book reading interactions. The project will focus specifically on the use of scientific process language in science books and on conversation surrounding those books in supporting children?s scientific reasoning. First, the investigators will analyze a sample of science books currently available to the public using automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) to characterize the general use of scientific process language in them. The investigators will then determine, in a series of experimental manipulations, whether children?s books that have science process language increase science learning by scaffolding parent-child conversation about science. This line of work will derive principles to guide the writing of science books for children as well as insights about how parents can foster science learning.  The research activities will be conducted with rural families ? who are traditionally underrepresented in research and often have limited access to scientific resources ? and will be complemented with an integrative education plan to train undergraduate research interns in early science learning and family engagement in partnership with a school district in rural North Carolina.<br/><br/>This project is structured around three research objectives that combine natural language processing (NLP), direct observations of parent-child reading interactions, and community engagement methodologies. To characterize how scientific language is integrated into existing educational materials, Objective 1 will use NLP to quantify references to scientific processes (e.g., causal relationships, explanations, predictions) within a large corpus of children's science books. Objective 2 involves a series of controlled experiments to examine how variations in science process language books affect scientific conversations and children?s learning. Objective 3 is a pilot study that will leverage findings from Objectives 1 and 2 to develop a science picture book based on rural caregiver?s feedback and test its effectiveness in enhancing parent-child scientific conversation. Expected findings include the development of a multi-level theory of factors that influence early science engagement (e.g., parent-child interactions, features of books, science capital) to be used by researchers as targets for future interventions aimed at fostering children?s scientific learning and engagement. The findings will be disseminated to researchers across disciplines whose work focuses on family processes, early childhood, and science education.

The discovery and manufacture of medicines, textiles, plastics, food products, and perfumes depend heavily on chemical dehydrations. These processes combine simpler precursors to make useful products by removing a molecule of water, but they overwhelmingly generate a significant amount of unnecessary and potentially wasteful chemical byproduct to achieve this seemingly simple outcome. Electrical energy is being leveraged to power catalysts that achieve these dehydration reactions in a conceptually new manner that mitigates chemical byproduct formation. Dr. Nacsa is also studying a new teaching method that aims to improve learning outcomes and equity in the context of undergraduate organic chemistry. This course is a prerequisite for physicians, dentists, veterinarians, and a range of engineers, but it often presents a stumbling block to these careers that is seen as intimidating and inequitable. These issues are being addressed through the development of new types of assessments as alternatives to exam-intensive evaluation approaches.<br/><br/>Efficient dehydration catalysts have traditionally been challenging to develop because of countervailing electronic demands throughout catalytic cycles. This challenge is being addressed by the Nacsa research team by using electrochemistry to modulate the oxidation state of sulfur-based organocatalysts. The catalysts are expected to enable nucleophilic substitutions of acids to afford esters and amides, and nucleophilic additions of alcohols to afford ethers, alkyl halides, and amines using electrochemistry to promote catalyst activation and turnover. By avoiding the generation of stoichiometric byproducts usually associated with dehydration reactions, the environmental footprint impact of these types of reactions is expected to be reduced, and the derivatization process is expected to be streamlined in support of a broad array of both discovery and process chemistries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This innovative controller is designed to enhance the integration of intermittent renewable energy resources into the electric power grid, including microgrids and smart grids. By enabling voltage source converters to operate over wider ranges, the controller allows for a more effective utilization of energy resources, which is crucial for achieving the U.S. goals of 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. The introduction of this controller will reduce the need for high capital investments in power system reinforcements, thereby accelerating the transition to a sustainable, zero-carbon energy future. The application benefits various stakeholders, including manufacturers of grid-interfaced voltage source converters, renewable energy producers, and power utility companies, all of which are pivotal in advancing the nation's clean energy objectives.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a blended integral proportional and proportional integral controller, which exhibits distinct advantages in stability margin and transient response when compared to existing voltage and current source controllers for voltage source converters renewable energy systems. The technology combines the advanced features of both proportional integral-based and integral proportional-based controllers resulting in improved system safety, security and reliability. The research underlying this project includes the creation of versatile two-degrees-of-freedom voltage source converter controllers with plug-and-play capabilities, enhancing power system flexibility for higher renewable energy resources integration. The simulation results demonstrate that the controller not only widens the operating ranges of power systems, accommodating greater penetration, but also maintains cost-effectiveness comparable to conventional controllers. The potential for widespread application in both residential and industrial settings, as well as its utility in research, underscores the significance of this innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Three cohorts of teachers will be recruited over the course of 3 years from January 2024 ? 2027. The Cary BIORETS program aims to engage diverse cohorts of teachers serving a variety of students. Participating schools will span across mid-sized urban districts with significant minority populations, to rural districts serving low-income and immigrant communities, two communities that often lack access to high-quality professional learning experiences. Through collaborative research projects and professional development activities that promote reflection, teamwork, and teacher leadership, the Cary BIORETS program aims to enhance teacher capacity to build the ecological knowledge of their students and increase their proficiency with science practices. This program will cultivate and support teacher leadership that extends its impact beyond the immediate confines of participating teachers' classrooms. Each teacher will produce instructional materials and contribute to an education publication based on their research and experiences. They will have the opportunity to attend regional or national conferences and be supported in conducting workshops within their schools to share their innovative curricula and other knowledge generated from their RET experience. Although the formal program lasts for one year, this BIORETS program will establish a lasting connection between teachers and scientists committed to promoting ecological literacy locally and nationwide. <br/><br/>There is a pressing need for increased ecological literacy in our rapidly changing world. Secondary education serves as a crucial arena for advancing ecological and environmental teaching, as it represents the last place in our nation?s system where all students engage in science learning. To ensure exposure to key ecological phenomena, the program focuses on training and supporting teachers in research experiences that will aid in their adoption of global change curriculum to improve ecological literacy. Specifically, teachers will engage in projects with an array of Cary scientists that address (1) Ecosystem Change, Transformation and Resilience, the (2) Ecology of Human Well-being, and/or (3) Functions of Biodiversity. Participating instructors will conduct scientific research, co-author publications, develop curriculum and will have opportunities for professional development. All participants (e.g., mentors and teachers) will be trained in responsible conduct for research. Collaboration with a program evaluator will help reach programmatic goals and ensure successful participant experiences. Funding to teachers include a stipend, conference travel for teachers to present, and classroom funds to implement their newly designed curriculum.

The project will lead to compact, quick, accurate, and user-friendly devices for genetic material detection. These devices operate by measuring the electrical responses of genetic materials when they vibrate in an external electric field. Such innovation holds the potential to revolutionize bioengineering, enabling more efficient testing of genetic materials, especially in regions without advanced laboratory facilities. Consequently, it promises to enhance pandemic management and global healthcare. A key aspect of this project is its educational outreach. The plan aims to engage students across all levels, from kindergarten through college, placing special emphasis on the inclusion of women and groups typically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The project envisions collaboration among academic institutions, industry, and other key organizations. Such partnerships are essential for further advancing the field and ensuring the widespread application and impact of the proposed research.<br/><br/>Amplification-free electronic detection of low-abundance nucleic-acid oligomers holds significant promise for advancing point-of-care diagnostics of various diseases. However, known all-electrical methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity and rapid detection. The objective of this proposed research is to develop a nanomechanoelectrical transduction approach and integrate it with electrophoresis running transversal to the longitudinal axis of a microfluidic channel, to enhance both the sensitivity and time efficiency of nucleic acid detection by two orders of magnitude. To attain the overall objective, the following specific aims will be met: 1) Determine the nanomechanoelectrical transduction principle of nucleic-acid nanostructures tethered to a graphene transistor and oscillating in an alternating electric field, 2) Achieve rapid, high-sensitivity nucleic-acid detection by integrating the nanomechanoelectrical transduction with transversal electrophoresis. The research project is highly innovative because it departs from the status quo of electrical nucleic-acid sensors, which directly convert the occurrence of probe-target nucleic-acid hybridization into electrical response, by implementing a new nanomechanoelectrical transduction pathway relying on the intrinsic difference in pliability, an intrinsic mechanical property, between unpaired and paired DNA strands. The expected outcomes of this project include a comprehensive understanding of the nanomechanoelectrical transduction principle for maximizing the multiplexity, selectivity, and sensitivity in nucleic-acid detection (specific aim 1) and accomplishing ultra-high sensitivity and time-efficient nucleic-acid detection based on a micro setup (specific aim 2).

These very small pieces of matter are called nanoparticles, and these nanoparticles are useful to people. For example, home pregnancy tests use nanoparticles, Covid-19 vaccines use nanoparticles, and state-of-the-art televisions use nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can also be used to deliver materials (e.g., drugs or genetic material) to cells. One challenge with nanoparticles is that they are often very unstable and clump together, and these clumps of nanoparticles do not have the same properties as individual nanoparticles. Thus, this research will create new ways of controlling how nanoparticles clump together. The research is based on prior work showing that tiny pieces of protein can cause nanoparticles to assemble in a reversible way. Thus, the nano-scale properties of the material can be turned on and off based on the presence of the protein. This research will first study different kinds of protein to determine how the clumping and de-clumping occur. The research will then study different kinds of nanoparticles to understand the range of nanoparticle types that can be used. Activities include both laboratory-based research and computational modeling.  A final phase of the research will focus on fungal cells and the interactions of these nanoparticles with fungal cells.  Fungi are important because they can cause disease, be consumed as food, or be used for biomanufacturing. The outcome of this research will be new knowledge about how to store and stabilize nanoparticles as well as new knowledge about how to control the properties of fungal cells with nanoparticles. <br/><br/>Nanoparticles are colloidally stable when the repulsive electrostatic and steric forces are balanced by the attractive Van der Waals forces. Prior work showed that a di-arginine peptide could induce reversible nanoparticle aggregation (and thus plasmonic coupling) by modulating these surface forces. This research will derive a coherent mechanistic understanding of how the peptide length, amino acid sequence, and nanoparticle surface impact this reversible aggregation. Objective 1 will study the structure/function relationship of peptide length and charge: The research will monitor nanoparticle aggregation and resuspension via plasmonic coupling including in biological and environmental media (e.g., saliva and seawater). Objective 2 will change the nanoparticle size to confirm the role of Van der Waals forces and optimize the color change during assembly/disassembly. Objectives 1 and 2 will combine computational modeling and laboratory assays. Objective 3 will use these lessons learned to measure the interaction and transport of aggregated and free nanoparticles across fungal cell walls as a function of protease expression. This work will create new knowledge in different domains: 1) how plasmonic materials assemble and disassemble; 2) how to store nanoparticles in a dry and aggregated state; 3) how to redisperse nanoparticles in biological and environmental media; and 4) how aggregated and free nanoparticles interact with fungal cells and fungal proteases. PI Jokerst and Co-I Miller will create ?plasmonic pride flags? via different plasmonic nanoparticles and teach the underlying science to a Hispanic Serving Institution in SanDiego as well as LGBT+ advocacy groups.

This has been the gold standard for over three decades and has been an effective technique to acquire two-dimensional flow information.  Tomographic PIV emerged as a flow measurement technique to obtain three-dimensional (3D) flow information in complex fluid flow scenarios.  However, this method is costly as it requires a multiple camera setup (typically 4 to 6 expensive cameras), a complex flow image reconstruction technique and the results are typically limited to the camera alignment which often results in poor axial resolution.  Recent work has shown that it is possible to obtain 3D PIV measurements using a single light field camera setup.  However, the axial resolution remains limited.  As a result, this research project aims to address these limitations by developing and validating a novel 3D PIV technique that incorporates a single light field color camera, a high energy pulsed rainbow illumination beam for generating color coded and particle depth information, and an in-house developed particle and flow reconstruction algorithm.  This method will improve limitations in axial resolution and will significantly advance capabilities of fluid flow measurement systems in academia, industry, and national laboratories. The particle and flow algorithms and validations will be disseminated to a wide range of potential users.  The educational component of this research will translate engineering analysis research to the classroom and enhance engineering recruitment and retention by targeting students from community colleges and university undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research project aims to develop a novel technique for 3D PIV that incorporates a single light-field camera, a high-energy pulse color-depth encoded beam, an alternating direction of multipliers (ADMM) and modified Horn-Schunck optical flow algorithm for particle position and flow reconstruction. Fundamentally, the light field camera will capture two-dimensional (2D) angular, spatial, and color-depth encoded information of particles illuminated by the high-energy beam, providing higher resolution particle reconstruction compared to current 3D PIV approaches. This research effort will address issues related to system development, system calibration, validation of measurements, and examining the technique?s ability to achieve 3D flow measurements in complex flow experiments with improved axial resolution. If successful, this novel technique will provide high 3D axial resolution measurement capabilities to researchers and engineers in all areas ranging from aeronautics to biomedical, thus having an indirect yet very broad impact on the nation?s industrial and research infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is increasing hydrological variability and water stress in many regions, leading water planners to invest in expensive new water supply infrastructure. However, many low-income households currently struggle to pay their water bills. Therefore, costly investments in water supply infrastructure may counterintuitively harm water security by making water unaffordable for a larger number of people. This NSF grant addresses this problem by, first, developing a new approach to assess the impact of climate change on water affordability that considers the environmental, social, and infrastructure factors that combine to determine water affordability. Second, it designs infrastructure and policy solutions to enable water supply systems to be both reliable in a changing climate and affordable for low-income populations. Through partnership with external stakeholders, this research will develop knowledge that local water planners and policymakers can use to improve the effectiveness of water affordability programs. <br/><br/>This project will develop an approach to comprehensively assess the impact of climate change on household water affordability and design solutions. To achieve this, the project will advance theory for operationalizing distributional equity in systems models and methods for multi-scale urban water systems modeling. First, the project will advance understanding of the drivers of household water affordability through a novel systems-modeling framework that integrates environmental, human, and infrastructure dynamics across state, city, and household scales. Second, the research team will project climate change impacts on water supply and demand, using an approach that targets projections to the scales relevant for water system outcomes. Third, the project will leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning to design infrastructure and policy solutions to meet water affordability and reliability targets. To ensure the findings translate to practice, the research team will partner with two cities and develop an external advisory board. Additionally, the project will advance education on water equity and affordability for students, water managers, and local communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental phenomenon in complexity theory is that intractable problems can have efficiently verifiable solutions, especially when the verification process (or ""proof"") is allowed to be interactive. Interactive proof protocols already play a central role in the theory of classical computing today, and have applications ranging from algorithms and optimization to cryptography. This project seeks to explore the power of interactive proofs in the presence of quantum computers, building on a line of recent work showing that quantum interactive proof protocols can exploit entanglement to be much more efficient than their classical counterparts. Areas of investigation of the project include methods to test untrusted quantum computers, studying the complexity of optimization problems arising in quantum physics and chemistry; as well as connections to the mathematics of quantum entanglement and operator algebras. The project will also support the training of graduate students and integration of ideas from the research into new courses at the undergraduate and graduate level aimed at computer scientists, physicists, and engineers.<br/><br/>Technically, the starting point of the project is the recent complexity-theoretical result that the class MIP* of multiprover interactive proofs is equal to the class RE of recursively enumerable languages (a class including undecidable problems such as the halting problem). The investigator will undertake three major directions of work. The first will simplify and generalize the techniques of the MIP* = RE result into a general suite of tools for constructing and analyzing quantum protocols in the multiprover setting. It is hoped that this research will lead to new quantum generalizations of important ideas from classical interactive proofs, such as direct product testing and the combinatorial proof of the PCP theorem. There are also connections to questions in operator algebras and group theory, such as the existence of non-hyperlinear groups. The second major direction is to use techniques from quantum cryptography to design new protocols to enable a classical client to delegate quantum computations in the single-device setting. Previous approaches to this problem are highly tailored to a specific, strong cryptographic assumption. The investigator?s goal is to build tools that enable multiprover protocols to be converted in a black-box way to single-device protocols, under more generic cryptographic assumptions. The third major direction is to investigate Hamiltonian complexity: the complexity of computing properties of low-energy states of a many-body quantum system. Mathematically, both Hamiltonian complexity and MIP* proof systems can be viewed as different generalizations of combinatorial optimization problems, such as MAX-CUT, to noncommuting matrix-valued variables. A major goal here is to make progress towards the quantum PCP conjecture, the major open problem in this area, drawing on ideas from MIP*=RE or elsewhere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those capabilities will be enabled by recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs). This approach affords many advantages over the current state of the art, including early identification of potential errors in manufacturing plans and fast, step-by-step debugging of code, thereby reducing errors and delays.

Because of its multi-faceted utility, it is expected that manufacturers will widely adopt G-Forge, incentivizing them to participate in creating a shared G-code database. G-Forge will lay the foundations of a larger ecosystem akin to 'Google for Manufacturing,' enabling users to perform numerous downstream tasks such as design retrieval and recommendation and automated shape generation. This vision incorporates the following specific objectives: G-Code Verification and Debugging: the core component of G-Forge will be an LLM-powered tool that can assess whether the part specified in a given G-Code file is valid for a particular machine tool; A Community-Driven G-Code Database: Users interacting with G-Forge will aid in the creation of a large library of verified G-Code; G-Code Analysis as a Service: With increasing community usage, the G-Forge database will grow over time, eventually serving as a valuable source of training data for a multimodal foundation model specifically tuned for G-code.

The anticipated outcomes of the project will be the following artifacts: (1) Methods for seamless migration of containerized services across autonomous fog systems; (2) Methods for latency-aware partitioning of micro-service workflows across WFF; (3) A serverless framework for declarative and reliable workflow development (workflow as a code) on WFF; (4) Methods for robust and latency-aware distributed DL inference atop uncertain WFF; (5) Methods using approximate inference for on-premises execution of sensitive DL services. <br/><br/>This project will provide a unique opportunity for U.S. students to gain international cross-disciplinary experience at a world-class research institute. Every year, graduate and undergraduate students will be selected via a well-defined procedure to visit the Global Computing research group at IMDEA for 8 summer weeks. The project will expose the students to both analytical and practical challenges of the communication-computing systems at a reputed research institution, and train them to become a globally-engaged and cultured workforce with world-class skills. The project outcomes will be evaluated annually by a professional evaluator, and enhanced during the subsequent years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An example of such surfaces is the small, flexible wings on flapping-wing robots that are beginning to approach the scale of natural insects. Removing liquid contaminants from these surfaces using vibration presents an opportunity for autonomous cleaning and drying. However, at these scales, the motion of the sloshing liquid contaminants and the flexible surfaces on which they rest are coupled?the deformation of one influences the other. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to provide a deep understanding of how the motion of a surface impacts the motion and ejection of a liquid drop. This project will provide a foundation by which to adapt self-decontamination strategies to other surfaces vulnerable to droplets, such as those in food preparation and healthcare. This project also encompasses outreach activities to local high school students via science fair project mentoring and research opportunities in the PIs? labs. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to reveal the physics of sloshing liquid contaminates and ejection from surfaces in which the fluid and surface motions are highly coupled. This tightly integrated experimental, theoretical, and numerical study will answer questions in highly interdependent fluid-structure interaction. This project mates two elementary systems?a cantilever and a fluid drop ? to form a dynamically complex system.  Driving the cantilever base causes it to bend and the drop to slosh and/or slide, and the substrate dynamically responds in turn to drop motion. High-speed videography and precisely controlled vibratory input will enable the characterization of drop motion and ejection events in which the solid substrate can exhibit a range of curvatures and accelerations throughout the vibration cycle. Conventional cantilever and elastica dynamics will be augmented with inertia-related non-conservative fluid forces to quantify dissipation, drop coherence, and fluid removal in these non-stationary processes. Numerics will permit the synthesis of coupled fluid- and solid-governing equations to determine the most effective excitation strategy for substrate decontamination. The ability to self-decontaminate adds a new dimension to the multi-functionality provided by flexible wings and will be critical to the functionality of surfaces vulnerable to chemicals, moisture, and biofilms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the chemical forms of copper in seawater is therefore important to understanding its effect in ocean ecosystems. Results from the principal investigator?s previous research investigating copper in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans indicated that most dissolved copper (Cu) in the ocean is inert and likely does not undergo chemical exchange with other compounds in seawater.  It appears that Cu is only released from the inert form in surface waters, where it is decomposed by light-mediated reactions. In this project, the team will determine the rates and processes of exchange between inert and labile forms of copper in seawater in samples from the Pacific Ocean and Columbia River. The project also aims to understand how dissolved organic matter in seawater will react with copper over the timescales of ocean circulation. The project includes summer research opportunities for high school students in the South Central Los Angeles Area through a program known as USC Young Researchers Program that provides students with a mentor throughout the summer. Research opportunities will be provided to undergraduate students to work on laboratory-based exchange kinetics work. <br/><br/>This research project challenges the current paradigm that copper speciation and distribution in seawater is dominated by strong, labile organic complexes that can be characterized by thermodynamic equilibria. The objectives of this project include: 1) determining rates of exchange of Cu between inert and labile pools, 2) characterizing the stable isotope composition of labile and inert Cu from samples collected from the Pacific Ocean and Columbia River, and 3) understanding the relationship between inert Cu and dissolved organic matter. The team will work to reassess the understanding of the chemistry of copper in seawater and determine the processes and mechanisms that control its cycling and biological availability. The work will expand the methodology utilized previously to isolation of inert Cu on reverse phase columns coupled with chromatographic separation. The results will provide a basis for more detailed structural characterization and provide a basis for including speciation-based natural isotope abundance data into models of Cu biogeochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to determine how changes in DNA structure impact expression of synthetic gene circuits and gene expression in general. The results of this project will have a broad impact on the design of gene circuits for applications such as gene and cell therapies.  Integrated into this research, there is a plan for diverse educational initiatives that will engage, inspire, and train the next generation of mammalian synthetic biologists. <br/><br/>While significant efforts have been devoted to the logical design of synthetic circuitry, far less is understood regarding the impact of the emergent three-dimensional structure of genetic elements on circuit behavior. Synthetic gene circuits may serve as model microgenomic systems to explore the biophysical basis of gene regulation. As simplified models of gene networks, synthetic circuits provide a tool for examining the causal relationship between structure, function, and biophysical feedback in transcriptional networks. Synthetic biology aims to integrate synthetic genetic control systems within native control networks to direct cell behaviors. However, limited ability to prescribe transgene expression and to actuate changes in native gene expression constrains genetic programming of mammalian cells. In particular, the stochastic nature of transcription makes coordinating expression across multiple genetic elements challenging. Transcription induces a wave of DNA supercoiling, altering the binding affinity of RNA polymerases and reshaping the biochemical landscape of gene regulation. As supercoiling rapidly diffuses, transcription dynamically reshapes the regulation of proximal genes, forming a complex feedback loop. By harnessing biophysical regulation, the researchers have identified a mechanism for biasing the stochastic nature of transcription and changing the population behavior. This CAREER will use synthetic gene circuits to examine the generality of DNA supercoiling-mediated feedback to couple and tune transcription. By varying promoter identity, gene length, inter-gene spacing and syntax, this project will explore how each of these features impact expression profiles. Profiles of expression will be measured by RNA and protein levels in single cells using a combination of microscopy and flow cytometry-based techniques. To connect gene activity and syntax directly to structure, this project will map DNA structure at high resolution using a combination of genomic tools that will build a causal connection between syntax, transcriptional activity, and local genome structure. Understanding the design principles of supercoiling-mediated feedback will allow the researchers to define an essential and overlooked mechanism by which cells orchestrate complex tasks. With this understanding, the research will reshape our perspective on gene regulation and provide novel tools for illuminating mechanically fragile points within the genome that may be exploited by disease. This work will revolutionize our understanding of genome regulation while establishing an entirely new and orthogonal mode of gene expression control that can be harnessed to engineer novel functions, tailor existing circuits, and enable robust cell engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most current endoscope designs are larger than their target body region and must be forced through a narrow passage before imaging begins. The small footprint of the proposed Meta-Optical Fiber Endoscope (MOFE) device allows significantly less invasive treatment, reducing the likelihood of complications and the need for anesthesia during the procedure. The MOFE platform also targets other untapped biomedical imaging markets, such as cardiac, deep brain, and simultaneous multi-functional imaging. Additionally, these all-on-fiber structures offer greater potential for large scale and low-cost fabrication than current designs. Rather than requiring the assembly of many individual components, a complete MOFE probe can be realized in a single standard nanofabrication process, representing a substantial reduction in cost per device. The method employed to produce these probes can also be performed on a planarized fiber bundle, allowing hundreds or thousands of devices to be made in parallel. <br/><br/>The proposed project will produce Meta-Optical Fiber Endoscope devices. By using flat optical metasurfaces, i.e. artificial sheet materials with sub-wavelength thickness, no wider than the fiber tip itself, it is possible to replace bulky glass optical imaging components (lenses, mirrors, prisms, etc.) with a device aspect ratio defined by the ultra-thin fiber components. This project will represent the first unification of optical metasurfaces?fabricated directly on-fiber?with other advanced imaging techniques, such as wavefront shaping in multimode fiber, optical coherence tomography, and multifunctional brain imaging, including beta testing of these novel devices. The titanium dioxide nanocylinder metasurfaces used in this project are highly efficient, i.e. over 90% transmission in the visible range, and able to tune the transmitted phase to have full wavefront control.

Transitional flow causes significant fluctuations in flow parameters such as pressure and wall shear stress, which can precipitate major practical consequences. For example, these fluctuations can accelerate the progression of vascular diseases including heart disease, stenoses, etc.; additionally, they can weaken materials to failure, i.e., expediting the rupture of aneurysms. Thus, to accurately evaluate these biomedical conditions, it is important to consider and quantify the role of transitional flow effects. Unfortunately, transition to turbulence in pulsatile flows remains a poorly understood flow regime. As a result, current studies most often ignore the effects of transitional flow. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to provide a fundamental understanding of the pulsatile transitional flow regime as well as build universal tools capable of estimating its functional effects. This project will also focus on expanding training and educational resources related to experimental fluid dynamic methodologies. Additionally, the vast amount of experimental data collected through this project will be made publicly available and used to establish a globally accessible repository of difficult-to-obtain experimental transitional and turbulent flow data.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish fundamental knowledge regarding the mechanisms that drive transition in pulsatile pipe flow as well as develop first-of-their-kind tools capable of estimating intermittency and transition progression. To date, studies exploring this flow regime have been limited to one-off contributions and produced contradictory findings. The lack of consensus and understanding of this flow regime has increasingly led to biomedical studies controversially asserting flows with mean Reynolds numbers as low as 250 as being transitional in nature. This punctuates the urgency of addressing the critical knowledge gap in this domain. This project delivers on this need using a rigorous series of experimental particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) studies. The project will focus on three specific aims: (i) Investigate the role of axial flow factors including frequency of pulsation and input pulsatile waveform shape on transition to turbulence; (ii) Assess how the onset and development of transition to turbulence is sensitive to radial-flow instabilities such as pipe curvature or cross-sectional area occlusions or expansions; (iii) Develop analysis tools to estimate intermittency, transition progression, and expected fluctuation levels of key flow parameters (e.g., pressure) for any arbitrary flow. This effort will represent the first comprehensive suite of experimental studies in this domain as well as the first experimental studies to jointly and parametrically evaluate axial and radial flow factors that affect pulsatile transition. This project is expected to dramatically advance the current understanding of pulsatile transitional flow as well as establish translatable tools to enable future studies to quantify the presence and effects of this flow regime in any application area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computer simulations suggest that this rapid recovery may be due to a spring-like force from the air displaced by the sudden motion of the moth?s body. These forces were not previously thought to be important in hawkmoth flight.

Yet our understanding of how this single cell divides and differentiates into all of the specialized cells that make up different tissues within an organism is quite limited. The goal of this proposal is to understand how signaling cues arising from the spatial location of a cell within a tissue and its epigenetic state regulate gene expression during early human development. The function of a cell is tightly controlled by the cells location within a tissue and its intrinsic epigenetic landscape. While single-cell sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of mammalian systems by measuring the transcriptome and epigenome landscape within single cells, spatial information is lost using current methods. To better understand how spatial organization regulates gene expression in individual cells, the PI proposes to use photo-sensitive oligonucleotides to optically stamp the spatial positions of cells during development. This spatial information will be combined with single-cell mRNA sequencing and single-cell epigenetic features. Collectively, these techniques will map how spatial and epigenetic determinants control the specification of human primordial germ cells during early development. The data generated by the research aims will be used for a multi-layered and integrated educational program that includes a computational genomics bootcamp for high school students, a summer wet lab internship for undergraduates, and a mobile app game that introduces gene regulation concepts and targets high school students.<br/><br/>To comprehensively study how spatial organization regulates gene expression of individual cells, the PI will design cholesterol-tagged photo-sensitive oligonucleotides (PSO) that incorporate into cell membranes, enabling an optical ?stamp? of the position of each cell prior to tissue dissociation and single-cell mRNA sequencing. Quantifying both mRNA and the relative degradation of the PSOs in individual cells will enable mapping spatial single-cell transcriptomes at high-resolution. Further, the PI will develop spatially-resolved single-cell multiomics technologies to simultaneously sequence the transcriptome together with different epigenetic features from the same cell to directly relate how DNA methylation, DNA accessibility and histone marks tune gene expression in varied spatial contexts. Furthermore, by employing iterative rounds of optical labeling, they will capture cell migration with end-point single-cell multiomics sequencing to gain insights into how tissue morphogenesis impacts cellular phenotypes. These transformative methods will be used to specifically study how morphogen gradients, cell-cell interactions, and epigenetic reprogramming play a role in the specification of primordial germ cells (PGC), the precursors to egg or sperm, during human gastrulation. While the emergence of PGCs has been studied in detail in mice, lack of access to human embryos makes similar studies impossible. Therefore, 2D/3D in vitro gastruloid models of human development will be used to address the following: What is the identity of the progenitors that give rise to PGCs, what combination of morphogen gradients and epigenetic remodeling drive PGC specification, and the role of defined niches in giving rise to PGCs. Overall, the development of these spatially-resolved single-cell methods will provide key opportunities in the future to modulate cell identity for varied applications.

Rigorous theoretical analysis of such network interactions is fundamental to support planners and policy makers in designing better socio-technical infrastructure and regulations, improving for example security, efficiency and welfare. The increasing size of modern multi-agent systems and their dynamic nature, however, introduces novel challenges for analysis and control. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by developing a theoretical framework that can tractably and robustly capture heterogeneous interactions in large network systems via the use of graph limits. Such framework will result in the development of certifiable algorithms for analysis, learning and control of large multi-agent systems, addressing main challenges such as the presence of dynamic populations, dynamic interconnections and issues of computational tractability. The novel perspective introduced in this project will enable both theoretical and practical advances in application areas including online markets, decision-dependent learning, robotics, and security of network systems. Research activities will be complemented with teaching and outreach efforts, providing exposure to exciting challenges in the area of complex network systems to elementary, high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The key innovation of this project will be to show how the theory of graph limits can be used in combination with game theory, dynamical systems theory and network optimization to devise a novel framework for tractable analysis of large but finite multi-agent dynamical processes in time-varying network settings.

Second, insights and control policies derived for such infinite population models will be applied to large but finite networks, with formal performance guarantees in terms of the network size. This project will illustrate the benefit of this graph limit approach for broad classes of network processes including: i) strategic interactions, ii) multi-agent learning and iii) nonlinear pairwise interaction dynamics. In all these settings the use of low-dimensional graph limit representations instead of unstructured finite networks will result in solutions that are guaranteed to be computationally tractable, asymptotically optimal, and robust in the presence of fast-changing and growing networks.

In this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, two expansions for the capabilities of current solvothermal synthesis are the development of sustainable activated selenium precursor to perform reaction at near room temperature, and pressurized silica ampoules and molten salts for the high temperature range. A rational combination of the developed synthetic techniques allows for the synthesis of various chalcogenide materials, including chiral hybrid compounds and metastable doped and substituted all-inorganic chalcogenides. Systematic investigations of the reaction mechanisms and structure-property relationships for the produced compounds are carried out to reveal the factors controlling magnetic, thermoelectric, and superconducting properties in these compounds. The new approach produces metastable functional materials with unique properties. Educational efforts are focused on communicating science and chemistry to the public and also educating students to be effective in such communication, in addition to providing a comprehensive materials chemistry education for the students involved in the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, compared to lithium reactions, sodium chemistry poses a considerable mechanical deformation to the electrodes and creates more stress and degradation that compromise battery performance. This project, supported by the Ceramics Program within the Division of Materials Research, seeks to create a fundamental understanding of battery degradation via a close integration of novel experiments, data analysis, and modeling approaches. Such knowledge is crucial to elucidating the aging mechanisms of sodium-based batteries, which synergistically contribute to the development of materials of enhanced reliability for the same applications. The multifaceted collaboration between Purdue and Virginia Tech provides unique training opportunities for developing workforce for STEM related careers, with particular relevance to meeting the demand of the clean energy industries, which is expected to grow significantly in the coming decades. The research also provides a platform to continue the recruitment and engagement of the underrepresented groups and to educate future scientists on convergent research skills and entrepreneurial training.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The project aims to achieve a holistic understanding of chemomechanics in phase-changing electroceramic electrodes through mechanistic studies of defects-charge coupling at the lattice scale, phase-stress coupling in single particles, and statistics of the particle network in the composite electrodes of sodium-ion batteries. The research is based on the hypothesis that: (i) the breakdown of the local structural symmetry not only induces lattice distortion and stress gradient at the nanoscale but also impacts the charge distribution in the lattice, (ii) the stochastic nature of material defects is coupled with the phase inhomogeneity in the single particles that gives rise to a stress/strain profile largely deviated from the conventional core-shell pattern; and (iii) in composite electrodes, the charge heterogeneity, mechanical damage, and electrochemical activities co-evolve, resulting in a dynamic ionic/electronic network in the cell. Following the hypothesis, the project includes the following research tasks. (i) Quantify the defect characteristics and map the defects-charging-composition at the nanoscale using controlled synthesis, synchrotron analytical techniques, and computational modeling. (ii) Understand the phase-stress coupling in the single electroceramic particles using the designs of grain engineering and surface coating. (iii) Identify the characteristic metrics of particle network in composite electrodes using machine learning, understand the dynamic evolution of particle network under operating conditions, and interpret the impact of mechanical degradation on battery performance. Overall, the research spans the basic understanding from the lattice scale up to the composite electrode and lays a foundation of mechanistic understanding of chemomechanical degradation in energy storage materia<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such plastic upcycling is especially valuable when it can be achieved at moderate temperatures in energy efficient processes. Catalysts offer a route to that end by lowering reaction temperature and selectively directing conversion of plastic to products that serve as building blocks for a broad range of fuels, consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, and building materials, to name a few. Zeolites are a class of porous crystalline catalysts that are especially suitable for waste plastic deconstruction, but further research and development is needed to improve their efficiency, product selectivity, and durability. Thus, this project investigates key design factors that affect the overall effectiveness of zeolite catalysts for the breakdown of a prevalent class of waste plastic, polyolefins. The project is supported by integrated educational and outreach activities aimed primarily at undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>While catalysts are ubiquitous in the production of fuels and important chemical intermediates, the design of advanced catalysts that possess high reactivity, selectivity, and stability remains paramount for efficiently and sustainably abating pollution while lowering energy demands and decreasing carbon emissions. Here, this rational design is employed in the hydrocracking of polyolefins using bifunctional metal/zeolite catalysts, where zeolitic voids simultaneously provide high reactivity and tailored selectivity, but limit catalyst efficiency and stability due to diffusional constraints of bulky products. Hierarchical zeolites with hybrid pore structures can be utilized to address this inaccessibility of bulky polymer molecules, but the direct effect on reaction and deactivation mechanisms, especially of these complex multiphase systems is not well-established. The project thus aims to engineer hierarchical (bifunctional) zeolites in selective hydrocracking of waste polyolefins, based on hypotheses that enhancements of hierarchical structuring affect reaction and deactivation rates for polyolefin cracking beyond simple diffusional impacts and include effects of pore structure (i.e., zeolite framework), connectivity, communication (metal:acid balance/proximity) and reactions occurring within the mesoporous regions and surface protons. By combining synthetic protocols with detailed reaction pathway and deactivation analysis, the project will reveal new insights on how shape-selectivity and transport phenomena affect the performance of these hierarchical, bifunctional catalysts for transformation of waste polyolefins into useful products. Those insights will aid in understanding the entire catalytic lifecycle, including specific mechanistic details that can be extended to improve catalyst efficiency for reactions of various feedstocks related to hydrocarbon and oxygenate processing (i.e., biomass, renewable alcohols, or CO2) and different zeolite or zeotype architectures. Research results from this award will be proactively incorporated into an undergraduate elective entitled Green and Catalytic Chemistry that will incorporate interactive components like hands-on catalysis (plastic upcycling and aqueous pollutant degradation) and separation (CO2 capture) experiments, and ?Sustainability Spotlights? based on media articles covering energy and climate related topics. The project will also strengthen the broader catalysis community through ?CatChats? for younger graduate students in catalysis labs at various universities. These meetups will create a supportive network of peers, via initial virtual connections that will be expanded at conferences, workshops, and other in-person venues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These pipes are buried under cities, are elevated across continents, and snake across factories, refineries, and treatment facilities -- transporting millions of tons of materials each day. But these pipes are difficult to inspect and thus prone to catastrophic failure, leading to hundreds of deaths, thousands of injuries, profound environmental impact, and $7.5 billion in damages in the U.S. oil and gas industry alone from 1986 to 2013. The global market for in-pipe inspection robots is projected to exceed $2 billion in the next several years, despite the significant limitations of current products, which cannot traverse complex and tortuous pipe systems or long distances between access points. This project will result in novel Vine Robots for nondestructive access to the interior of pipes for inspection, repair, and clog removal. The science and technology of soft robot propulsion, steering, and payload carrying will be developed to address navigation challenges that have thus far limited the effectiveness and adoption of robotic inspection.<br/><br/>The proposed project will make key scientific discoveries and solve practical engineering challenges required to bring soft robotics out of the research lab to solve the unmet needs of a critical real-world application, pipe inspection. Research objectives include: (1) improving Vine Robot navigation via pressure-driven eversion using workspace analysis and modeling, base station design, materials selection, and tip-steering mechanisms; (2) enabling data collection and usability during pipe navigation, by employing teleoperated and autonomous control strategies and acquisition and visualization of video and other sensor data; (3) enabling debris sampling and removal through enhanced pushing/pulling forces and payload carrying abilities; and (4) designing, fabricating, and evaluating physical Vine Robots in achieving specific performance metrics for navigating long, tortuous, and branching pipes while operated by novices and continuously acquiring in-pipe video. Advances in soft robots will be made in material selection and design, modeling and analysis and their interaction with the environment. Novel mechanisms will be developed to create a robust and effective tip mount for a class of robot whose material at the tip is constantly changing.

Removing liquid contaminants from these surfaces using vibration presents an opportunity for autonomous cleaning and drying. However, at these scales, the motion of the sloshing liquid contaminants and the flexible surfaces on which they rest are coupled?the deformation of one influences the other. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to provide a deep understanding of how the motion of a surface impacts the motion and ejection of a liquid drop.

This tightly integrated experimental, theoretical, and numerical study will answer questions in highly interdependent fluid-structure interaction. This project mates two elementary systems?a cantilever and a fluid drop ? to form a dynamically complex system.  Driving the cantilever base causes it to bend and the drop to slosh and/or slide, and the substrate dynamically responds in turn to drop motion. High-speed videography and precisely controlled vibratory input will enable the characterization of drop motion and ejection events in which the solid substrate can exhibit a range of curvatures and accelerations throughout the vibration cycle. Conventional cantilever and elastica dynamics will be augmented with inertia-related non-conservative fluid forces to quantify dissipation, drop coherence, and fluid removal in these non-stationary processes. Numerics will permit the synthesis of coupled fluid- and solid-governing equations to determine the most effective excitation strategy for substrate decontamination. The ability to self-decontaminate adds a new dimension to the multi-functionality provided by flexible wings and will be critical to the functionality of surfaces vulnerable to chemicals, moisture, and biofilms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project targets advancing plasma-assisted combustion (PAC) technology, focusing on enhancing lean-flame stability and reducing pollutants in real-world scenarios. Current understanding of PAC, including its impact on emissions and its scalability, is incomplete. Prior work has demonstrated that nanosecond repetitively pulsed plasmas can extend the lean blowout limit of hydrocarbon and ammonia flames and mitigate instabilities. However, the impact on NOx emissions remains unclear, especially considering the competing effects of lean-burning and emission production by the plasma itself. A significant gap exists between fundamental chemical kinetic studies and practical applications, with research on industry-relevant platforms often resorting to trial-and-error approaches. This project aims to bridge this divide, connecting knowledge from 1D laminar systems to industrial parameters, including lean blowout limit, combustion dynamics onset, and emissions. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to deepen our understanding of plasma-assisted lean flame stabilization and NOx production and apply this knowledge to CO2-free fuels, including hydrogen and ammonia. More specifically the project will evaluate the hypothesis that the efficacy of plasma strategies for ensuring the static and dynamic stability of turbulent flames is intrinsically linked to the impact of plasma on fundamental flame parameters, such as the laminar flame speed and the extinction strain rate. The project will develop numerical models for plasma-assisted flamelets, and correlate experimental data on lean blowout extension and suppression of combustion dynamics of plasma-actuated swirl-stabilized burners to fundamental flame parameters, for a range of fuels (NH3, H2 and CH4 blends) and operational conditions. The second goal focuses on optimizing NOx emissions in these systems. Rather than simply extending the lean blow-out limit, the project proposes direct emissions optimization, using the 1D flamelet platforms. A parametric exploration will identify optimal regions for emissions reduction using plasma. A third goal complements the 1D picture by considering higher-dimensional effects.

These changes can affect the extent of boreal wetlands as well as their ability to sequester and transform C and other nutrients. In 2005, the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) was created to examine the role of changing soil climate and vegetation on peatland C cycling. Over the past fifteen years, core data has been collected on soil moisture and temperature, plant composition and amount, and the fluxes of important atmospheric gases emitted (as methane and carbon dioxide) from water table treatments that simulate floods and droughts. A key result from this group's prior investigations was that C emissions from this experimental site appeared to be high, regardless of water table position, revealing that interactions among changes in plant species composition in response to the treatments were strongly controlling the ability of this ecosystem to retain C.  This is a five-year renewal of a Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) project, DEB-1354370. The study is examining the interactions among changes in hydrology, plant species composition and changes in climate (particularly flooding and drought) in controlling C storage in this peatland complex; this work is necessary for understanding the consequences of an altered climate for C cycle processes.  Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will all be trained and in field and laboratory techniques. Results from the research will also be incorporated into new high school curricula for use in the Fostering Science summer camp.<br/><br/>The current view of peatland carbon cycling is that the majority of soil carbon mineralization occurs in the relatively shallow aerated peat layer above the water table (acrotelm), and that deeper peat carbon occurring in anoxic layers (catotelm) undergoes minimal decomposition. As such, the position of the water table (and the associated thickness of the acrotelm) is used as a predictor of overall decomposition rates and long-term peat accumulation rates. However, findings from this team's fifteen-year manipulation of water table position in an Alaskan fen (Alaska Peatland Experiment, APEX) challenge this view, and in particular suggest that carbon mineralization in saturated peat is faster than previously expected, leading to high fluxes of anaerobic CO2 production. Prior analyses indicated no significant effect of water table position on ecosystem respiration, but it is possible that this result was due at least partially to changes in vegetation that have occurred both under lower (drier) and higher (wetter) water table positions. The initial experimental design could not disentangle the effects of changes in vegetation from hydrology on peat redox and C fluxes. As such, understanding the interactive effects of altered hydrology and vegetation on anaerobic decomposition processes, and how this governs the turnover of deep soil C pools in peatlands, was the prime objective of the first phase of LTREB funding. Results during that initial LTREB funding period showed that sedge and Equisetum (horsetail) rhizospheres indeed had oxidizing effects on peat and dissolved organic matter. However, persistent flooding over this period of research has presented key gaps in mechanistic understanding of controls on trace gas production in this system, and revealed that plant community structure and the dominance of algae likely have unique controls on soil redox processes and C fluxes. Flooding history also exerted strong control over the relative activity of algae vs. heterotrophic microorganisms, depending on changes in C substrates from different plants. Exactly how changes in plant community interact with altered water tables in governing the supply of electron donors and acceptors, and how this controls anaerobic metabolism in low- and high-water table years, are key questions this collaborative team will examine in the next five years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These images and comparisons raise fundamental questions regarding the accuracy of the images as well as how to interpret them in the context of the compositional and thermal structure and dynamics of the Earth. This project addresses three facets of this problem. First, it will use seismic wavefield simulations to generate the simulated seismograms needed for comparison with the recorded seismograms. This will enable the most accurate physics to be deployed within the imaging problem. Second, it will apply wavefield simulations to a reference data set to directly and fairly compare previously derived tomographic models. Third, it will formalize these procedures and offer them to others by hosting a virtual workshop featuring how to access tomographic models from the Earth Model Collaboration and how to perform seismic wavefield simulations in the open-source software package Specfem3D. The focus of these efforts in on Alaska, which has had exceptional coverage of EarthScope seismic stations since 2017 and exhibits extreme subsurface tectonic complexity caused by collision at the eastern margin of the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone. The availability of earthquakes, the quality of station coverage, the complexity of subsurface structure, and the complexity of subsurface geodynamics all provide motivation for using Alaska as a focus for the broader effort of validating and improving tomographic models. The efforts will consider a more complex representation of Earth structure, in the form of tilted transverse isotropy, which is present in minerals and rocks (for example, shale) but which is challenging to determine at larger scales, such as the crust and uppermost mantle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compared to traditional solar cells, this proposed technology enables continuous electricity production in a cost-effective manner, operates around the clock, demonstrates compactness, scalability, and portability, and, most importantly, exhibits significantly higher efficiency compared to traditional solar photovoltaic systems. In addition, the portable nature of this technology makes it particularly suitable for deployment in underdeveloped regions and areas where establishing conventional power plants is challenging. The scalability allows for integration into existing power grids, presenting a green solution for facilitating electricity generation in concentrated solar energy power plants. The proposed technology may be beneficial to the safe operation of solar energy power plants and the energy security of the US. With the nonreciprocal functionality, the efficiency of solar power plants can be improved significantly. Such improvement may translate to more clean energy and, therefore, increase national energy security. Overall, the adoption of this technology represents a significant stride towards transitioning away from oil and gas as the primary fuel for power plants and embracing cleaner sources of energy for electricity generation. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a nonreciprocal photonic device that may be used in solar thermophotovoltaics to improve conversion efficiency. Using this proposed technology, the undesired back emission from the intermediate layer at elevated temperatures may be significantly suppressed. Recent theoretical analysis shows that the efficiency of solar energy harvesting may be pushed to the theoretical upper limit with nonreciprocal photonic functionality.  Regarding dispatchability and compactness, the nonreciprocal solar thermophotovoltaic technology is designed to couple with thermal storage components and provide on-demand electric power and the system that may be scaled up or down based on the power demand.  In addition, the proposed technology is designed to be integrated into traditional solar thermophotovoltaic systems by upgrading the intermediate layer. All other parts in the upper and lower stream of the intermediate layer should have no need to be changed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research exploits the excellent electrical conductivity of graphene, an emerging two-dimensional (2D) carbon nanomaterial, within a pure copper matrix. Fundamental multiscale and multi-physics studies will be performed in order to understand the fabrication and properties of graphene-copper composites critical to the achievement of scientific and technological advancements in high conductivity materials. The availability of ultrahigh conductivity materials meets the ever-increasing demand for high performance electrical conductors in electric vehicles, portable devices, and power grids, which impacts various industries and, hence, the U.S. economy. New experimental methods will be developed for controlling the continuity of graphene networks within a copper matrix to achieve electrical conductivities significantly higher than that of pure copper. The manufacturing approach is generalizable to other carbon-metal composites consisting of low dimensional constituents within metal matrices for improved electrical and structural applications. This project provides interdisciplinary research, education, and training opportunities for high school students to postdoctoral researchers, ensuring participation from women and under-represented minority groups. Educational and research integration activities include developing modular demonstrations and laboratory tours for interactive teaching and learning experiences and offering new interdisciplinary courses and research programs. <br/><br/>Carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotube and graphene, have excellent electrical properties far exceeding those of pure metal conductors such as copper. To exploit these attractive properties, carbon nanomaterials are often dispersed in a copper matrix to fabricate carbon-copper composite conductors. However, these conductors suffer from low electrical performance due to the discontinuous interfaces between the dispersed nanocarbon materials and the copper matrix. This research project seeks to address these technical challenges by developing an innovative manufacturing technique involving chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and growth of continuous graphene films in a pre-compacted copper foam followed by a ?gentle? compression step. The ?gentle? compression ensures that the final densification of the graphene-coated copper foam occurs without damaging the continuous graphene films. This research aims to resolve fundamental questions about (1) the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced electrical properties of graphene-copper composites; (2) the role of the continuity of graphene networks in the composite on their overall material properties; and (3) size-dependent material behavior of the composite besides the direct effect of different graphene-to-copper volume ratios. Overcoming these technical challenges is essential for designing and manufacturing graphene-copper composite conductors with significantly enhanced electrical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When researchers have considered veterans transitioning back into civilian life, the focus has tended to be on their health and how they fit back into society. However, one aspect that is often overlooked is the strong bonds they formed with their fellow service members. How do these relationships affect their memories of their time in the service, and how might they shape their lives after the military? The project trains a graduate student in anthropology, himself a Marine combat veteran with unique access and perspective into this transition. The project has significant Broader Impacts for veteran communities, particularly with respect to the transitioning processes of future Marine corps veterans. The findings from this study will not only be valuable to this particular group of veterans and researchers studying anthropology but will also be shared with the wider Marine Corps community, the National Museum of the Marine Corps, the Veterans Affairs (VA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).<br/><br/>In taking a broader and more detailed look at veterans' social milieu and post military life experiences, this project asks specifically whether the experiences that veterans report differ among those who participate in veteran group events and those that do not. Methods include both individual and collective methods of data collection: in-depth interviews with a representative sample of veterans, and participation in group events where shared military experiences are revisited. Through this, the research aims to understand how the different life paths and occupations of veterans affect how they remember and interpret their time in the military. The project analyzes data to ascertain how common certain health issues are in the group, how their experiences after leaving the military change their memories of service, and how ongoing connections with their military comrades influence their transition to civilian life. The project advances theories of affect, memory, and belonging in psychological anthropology, particularly with regard to the relationship between ritualized experience and subjectivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These points are thought to be closely related to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), but the balance of contributions to North Atlantic carbon accumulation from air-sea fluxes and ocean transports is not well constrained. There is significant uncertainty about what the future holds, both for AMOC strength and carbon uptake as they respond to the effects of climate change and other changing forcings. This project will utilize long-term and ongoing observations across the North Atlantic basin to quantify carbon uptake and carbon transport and the variability in these parameters on the time scale of decades. This work will support a variety of efforts to educate and promote underrepresented groups in ocean science. The project investigators will partner with a variety of institutions in Georgia, Florida and in the Caribbean to educate students at a range of levels. They will promote a carbon cycle education website that includes interactive K-12 education materials. This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>The ROCCA project aims to redefine our understanding of the North Atlantic carbon system, one of the world?s most important regions for carbon sequestration on climatically-important timescales. The team will use new estimates of anthropogenic carbon transports across both subtropical and subpolar domains to determine the contributions of air-sea fluxes and ocean circulation to regional carbon accumulation, a fundamental knowledge gap. This analysis will enable evaluation of their combined effects on future carbon uptake as overturning strength is projected to weaken. New observations in Florida Straits will fully characterize the chemical variability in water mass structure on seasonal timescales for the first time, and in combination with air-sea anthropogenic CO2 fluxes derived from transport-divergence/accumulation budgets, the team will validate existing numerical simulations and improve the representation of carbon cycle processes in the next generation of climate models.

Aerosols influence climate as they form the basis of clouds and are engaged in both the scattering and the absorption of sunlight. Aerosols can also negatively affect air quality and provide a vehicle for the spread of airborne disease. The specific environmental impact associated with aerosols depends upon the chemical composition and phase state of the aerosol particles. Inadequate knowledge of the phase state of organic-inorganic aerosols, such as those found in the environment, represents a source of uncertainty in climate and air quality models. Mixed organic-inorganic particles can form a range of phase states depending on environmental conditions; these include liquid and solid phases, and amorphous phases, such as viscous liquids, glasses, and gels. This project will explore the formation of amorphous phase states in aerosol particles and characterizes the properties that determine their impacts in the environment. This collaboration between UC Riverside and Trinity University will facilitate undergraduate and graduate research across both institutions and seeks to provide for an improved understanding of aerosol chemistry across a range of scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>To enhance knowledge of aerosol particles in the environment, this project is a collaborative study between teams at an R1 public university, UC-Riverside--the James Davies research group--and at a predominantly undergraduate liberal arts and sciences university, Trinity University--the Ryan Davis research group--will examine the role of temperature and relative humidity on the phase state and associated properties of internally mixed organic-inorganic aerosol particles. Aerosol particles containing mixtures of organic and inorganic compounds exhibit complex phase behavior in response to changes in relative humidity (RH) and temperature due to hygroscopic interactions. The phase morphology of aerosol particles influences their interactions with light, their response to chemical processing due to changes in viscosity, and their ice and cloud nucleating potential. This proposal will investigate the phase morphology and associated rheological properties of internally mixed organic-inorganic aerosol particles exposed to controlled RH and temperature conditions. The main objectives are: (1) systematically characterize the hygroscopicity and viscosity of particles containing atmospherically-relevant salts and oxygenated organics; (2) determine the temperature and humidity conditions for the onset of phase separation and correlate with molecular composition; and (3) explore the consequences of viscosity and phase separation on the rate of molecular diffusion. To achieve these goals, single particles of aqueous oxygenated organic compounds and atmospherically-relevant mono- and divalent salts will be levitated using an electrodynamic balance. Optical spectroscopy, microscopy and light scattering methods will be used to identify phase separation while new and established characterization methods will be applied to measure hygroscopic growth, viscosity, and diffusive transport.  The research will help to motivate the next generation of scientists by exposing undergraduate and graduate researchers to the physically rigorous study and characterization of aerosols in a project that relates more generally to climate science research, an area of great societal interest and importance today.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although some biodegradable polymers have been developed as replacements for petrochemical ones, their synthesis requires different catalysts than those used for petrochemicals that are not well understood. The goal of the Comito research program is to develop a new platform of catalysts for biodegradable polymer synthesis by focusing on the cooperation between multiple metal sites. These studies are focused on finding new catalysts that can be tuned to prepare biodegradable polymers with novel structures, new physical properties, and improved performance. These activities are further being used to train a diverse group of students in organometallic chemistry, catalysis, and polymer synthesis with emphasis on the inclusion of undergraduates, first-generation scholars, and underrepresented groups in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines. Moreover, the technical knowledge generated through this research program is being converted into publicly available educational materials for teaching mechanistic analysis to graduate students and reaction mechanisms to undergraduates.<br/><br/>Under this award, Robert Comito and his research team are developing ligands for the proximal coordination of two main group metals for cooperative catalysis toward the controllable synthesis of biodegradable polymers. The hypothesis underlying this research program is that the catalytic polymerization of esters and carbonates by main group metals inevitably involves multi-metallic mechanisms. Considering that metal-bridging coordination of an alkoxide chain end and bifunctional insertion of the monomer feedstock are essential features of chain growth during polymerization, Comito and his group are evaluating the orientation, distance, and substitution of adjacent catalytic metal sites to identify the controlling mechanistic features of main-group catalyzed polymerization that produce unique polymer structures. Applying these skills in mechanistic analysis toward teaching, Dr. Comito is generating drag-and-drop teaching materials that will improve the instruction of reaction mechanisms in a digital format. He is also generating pedagogical materials on control experiments, a class of experiments essential toward understanding mechanisms in science but which are rarely taught in the classroom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials can serve as essential building blocks for high-strength nanofiber composites and textiles. Despite the remarkable promise of aligned nanofibers, there is an absence of commercial-scale roll-to-roll aligned polymer nanofiber manufacturing due to diverse technical hurdles. This project connects an academic research team and an established nanofiber manufacturing company to translate technologies that will overcome these hurdles. Beyond its commercial impacts, this project will lead to the development of a new hands-on educational program and provide students with valuable experience and training opportunities in entrepreneurship, technology translation, and innovation.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to enhance the efficiency, throughput, and consistency of parallel track roll-to-roll electrospinning for aligned nanofiber manufacturing. It is hypothesized that computational electrical field models can predict production efficiency. Computational electrical field models will be generated based on manufacturing process parameters. The production efficiency will be measured as the mass of aligned nanofiber output on a roll, divided by the mass of polymer feed into the system. A convolutional neural network (CNN) machine learning model will also be utilized to correlate electrical field model images with experimentally measured production efficiency. Computational electrical field models can be generated for hundreds of different parameter combinations at the same time instead of testing only a few parameter combinations experimentally. Therefore, this approach allows for efficient in silico screening of the extensive parameter space associated with this complex manufacturing process to maximize the device efficiency. Optimized devices will be scaled, prototyped, and evaluated, demonstrating the capability of parallel track roll-to-roll aligned nanofiber electrospinning manufacture in a commercial context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

No single funding assistance program can address the myriad needs at scale. Navigating duplicative home assessments confuses households, frustrates provider organizations, and misses decarbonization opportunities. Decarbonization of energy systems has rapidly emerged as a central goal to address climate change. Many cities and states have set high carbon reduction goals as part of their climate policies and corresponding initiatives. While Detroit?s housing crisis created its sense of urgency, numerous cities around the country are grappling with the desire to braid financial resources and coordinate services to support housing stability and accelerate net-zero goals. In response to these needs and opportunities, a team of academic and community-based researchers and civic partners have come together to co-design and pilot a decarbonization-readiness module for integration with a common, comprehensive home assessment protocol emerging in Detroit, MI. This resource will be field-tested, and retrofits will be completed for a study cohort of low-income homes. Qualitative social science data will be collected with providers, clients, and stakeholders to complement quantitative energy use and air quality data. Simplified digital home models will be used to simulate supportive rate structures, demand response programs, grid-interactive appliance programs, and associated controls. <br/><br/>The intent of this effort is three-fold. First, the project will support and accelerate collaborative efforts already underway to braid financial resources and coordinate services aimed at addressing home hazards, weatherization, and energy efficiency.

Finally, to address economic barriers to adoption and opportunities to reduce the effective cost of decarbonization by leveraging technology and new value streams. Specific objectives include: a field-tested decarbonization-readiness home assessment module; increased adoption of a comprehensive home assessment protocol in Detroit; a case study of decarbonization strategies enabled through braiding of funding streams; a formative evaluation report characterizing perceived and actual benefit to providers and clients and the feasibility of bringing a pilot effort to scale; and an engineering report describing technology gaps, solution pathways and enabling utility rate programs. <br/><br/>This project is in response to Track B - CIVIC Innovation Challenge - Bridging the gap between essential resources and services & community needs.<br/><br/>The CIVIC Innovation Challenge is a collaboration with Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During their erosional decay, these diminishing mountains are subject to modification by changing conditions, including climate, basin dynamics, and renewed tectonics, resulting in complex signals. Another factor that controls the evolution of these landscapes is the material properties of the eroding bedrock, which change through time as rocks are exhumed. Correlations exist between topography and rock type in many ancient mountain ranges, including in the Appalachian Mountains, the type locality of this phenomenon. In sedimentary rocks of the Appalachians, the role of bedrock properties is at least qualitatively clear, but in metamorphic rocks the relationships are murkier. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the degree to which metamorphic rocks of the high Blue Ridge control the landscape and to quantify specifically what makes them durable. This will contribute to understanding of the origin of the Appalachian landscape, as well as to the processes that control erodibility along ancient passive margins. This project also supports a program for developing and adding a field experience as a required element for eighth grade Earth Science classes in a rural Appalachian middle school (~350 students/year), where currently no field trips are included in the curriculum. <br/> <br/>The specific goals of this project are to measure bedrock properties of complex metamorphic rock of the Virginia and North Carolina Blue Ridge, including rock strength (e.g., point-load testing), discontinuities (e.g., fracture scanlines), mineralogy, and sensitivity to chemical and physical surface processes via laboratory testing (freezing/thawing, heating/cooling, microwave acid digestion, and slake testing). A large data collection effort (~150 locations, >500 samples) will fill a major data gap for the material properties of complex Blue Ridge rock types. Samples will be acquired from both natural and anthropogenic exposures and will be compared to relative topographic position (i.e., ridges and peaks vs. valley bottoms) as well as a host of other geomorphic metrics. Data will be synthesized to test the degree to which bedrock controls topography and ultimately be integrated into a model of what controls long-term erodibility in this setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional Na-S and K-S batteries are attractive for LDES due to their low cost and the use of earth-abundant elements. However, their deployment is severely hindered by their high operational temperature of 300-350oC and associated degradation and safety issues. This project will use materials design and simulation-driven approaches to develop innovative electrolytes to dissolve insoluble reaction products in Na-S and K-S batteries and advance knowledge on underlying dissolution mechanisms. Such novel electrolytes will enhance reaction kinetics so the operation temperature can be reduced to 60-120oC, which not only enhances thermal stability but also decreases operational costs. The new material systems from this project have the potential to be deployed for LDES, which enhances the economic competitiveness and sustainability of U.S. The project activities will integrate research and education, targeting students from K-12 to graduate school and promoting underrepresented communities' education through hands-on experiences, advising, and research integration across all levels. <br/><br/>The primary challenge in traditional alkaline metal sulfur (AMS) batteries arises from the formation of solid M2S2 and M2S compounds during discharge (M = Na, K), which exhibit poor electrochemical kinetics. This limits the reversible redox range mainly to S/M2S3 reactions, reducing specific capacity and energy density. The goal of this project is to identify and develop new solvents that can dissolve M2S2/M2S readily to replace conventional ether electrolytes, which will in turn make M2S2/M2S electrochemically active. This will double the specific capacity of sulfur from 500 mAh/g in ether electrolytes to 1000-1500 mAh/g, along with a long cycle life. The project will utilize a simulation-driven approach to design electrolytes, such as combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML). MD simulations calculate solvation free energy, and ML enables high-throughput screening for solvents with superior M2S2 and M2S solubilities. Promising candidates will be experimentally validated. After experimentally confirming the high-performance solvents, multi-scale/multi-modal characterizations will be used to understand the fundamental dissolution mechanisms, electrochemistry and transport in the proposed system comprehensively. An Ah-level prototype will be constructed and tested, and the cost of developed materials and devices will be analyzed for large-scale deployment. The advances in knowledge and research tools together will help develop next-generation batteries for long-duration energy storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The number of ransomware attacks launched globally has grown substantially over the years. To exploit previously undiscovered weaknesses and conduct more effective attacks, cybercriminals take advantage of the rising number of workers accessing business networks from home through a virtual private network (VPN) while working remotely. Current ransomware countermeasure solutions are not comprehensive and generally fail in tackling sustained and persistent attacks. Moreover, the current solutions track threats only at the operating system level and can be disabled. This solution features universal awareness based on a combination of characteristics related to user, ransomware, non-specific environment indicators, and non-ransomware metrics. The comprehensive ransomware detection, remediation, eradication, and data recovery solution enable unmatched protection from cyberattacks and allow timely detection and shutdown of cyberattacks thus, significantly reducing the amount of compromised data. This enhanced protection will have security benefits for a wide range of critical infrastructures, ranging from energy and finances to the protection of medical data.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop an advanced ransomware countermeasure (ARC) platform which will represent the most advanced and effective protection against ransomware attacks.  The technology will enforce four synergistic actions: (1) precondition observation and characterization, (2) incoming interactions validation, (3) internal contents observation and characterization, and (4) outgoing interactions validation. In this project, the research and development efforts will be dedicated towards the (1) the development of the framework of communication between the inoculator and watch-dog and its deployment for effective countermeasure, (2) design and development of user-friendly interface providing simple user experience, (3) seamless integration of the ARC platform with existing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, (4) implementation of artificial intelligence/machine learning models in the ARC platform for the effective defense against zero-day ransomware exploits, and 5) validation of the ARC platform against known ransomware to ensure the proper function of all the modules. The successful completion of the SBIR Phase II activities will deliver a fully functional, commercially viable product with general availability that can seamlessly run/work along with existing SIEM tools and successfully defend against known ransomware attacks and zero-day exploits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this nutrient source is only biologically accessible to a subset of microbes that can reduce it into ammonium NH4+. The biological capacity to fix N2 is a critical step in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and essential to life on Earth. The enzyme responsible for this reaction is nitrogenase and its activity relies on its associated metallocofactors. This project aims to elucidate initial reaction steps involving the synthesis of nitrogenase metallocofactors that are promoted by proteins NifU and NifS. Previous studies have established the involvement of these proteins in supporting the synthesis of initial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) building blocks for nitrogenase metallocofactors. The research supported by this award will explore how NifU and NifS assemble these Fe-S units in the model bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. The interdisciplinary, collaborative international project will engage undergraduate and graduate students through research experiences and professional development opportunities. A German and an American PI partnership will support two synergistic research and professional development efforts: (a) collaborative research experiences abroad for graduate students and (b) mentored research fellowships for local undergraduate students. These efforts are relevant for preparing the next generation of STEM leaders for a diverse and globalized workforce. <br/><br/>The project is aimed at investigating the mechanistic and chemical steps of Fe-S cluster synthesis in the context of a native environment and the presence of physiological reductants by establishing 1) the location and spectroscopic features of novel cluster species associated with NifU, 2) the involvement additional factors in this process, and 3) the reactivity of newly identified cluster species as building blocks for the synthesis of nitrogenase metalloclusters. Uncovering molecular and mechanistic details that enable nitrogen fixation has intrinsic intellectual merit in understanding their sustained and conserved requirement throughout evolution. These principles can also guide foundational studies on Fe-S clusters on more complex systems that utilize metallocofactors participating in other cellular processes.

CARDAMOM is led by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in partnership with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, and the University of Alabama. Metal additive manufacturing (AM), also known as metal 3D printing, is transforming manufacturing within the United States and around the world. This new disruptive technology has already resulted in several success stories, primarily within the aerospace and biomedical sectors. However, further expansion to the greater manufacturing community is impeded by limitations in powder feedstocks, a lack of access to flexible and comprehensive metal AM research and production facilities, and a workforce with limited AM design experience. CARDAMOM proposes to address these research needs by assisting industry members along the entire ?powder-to-part? development cycle to address fundamental research questions with a view toward final engineering applications. In addition, the team will address societal impacts of education and workforce development which will have a significant impact on the training of students from diverse backgrounds and educational institutions. Eventually, CARDAMOM aims to be a steady provider of high-quality engineers and technicians to manufacturers and government research laboratories. <br/><br/>The mission of CARDAMOM is to transform the manufacturing of high-performance, quality metallic components created with AM via active engagement with Center industry members. With respect to the technological impacts, CARDAMOM will pursue multiple thrusts in order to: develop methods for production of AM feedstocks for new alloys; develop new methods and techniques to understand and interpret in situ measurement data; use advanced characterization to provide 3D microstructural and nanostructural information that connects processing methods to component performance; develop new computational methods to predict and understand microstructural development, leading to better ways to design new materials and processes; develop innovative measurements to quantify laser-metal interactions; use advanced metrology and NDE to enhance AM build quality; develop new data analytical (machine learning) approaches for data interpretation and scientific insight. CARDAMOM will engage potential members across the full supply chain, including equipment manufacturers, aerospace and defense companies, tool and die producers, materials development companies, process optimization designers, and government laboratories. The specific research thrusts at UNL will utilize the Nebraska Engineering Additive Technologies Laboratory (with three laser-based hybrid metal AM systems) and the advanced characterization instrumentation within the Nano-Engineering Research Core Facility. The UNL thrusts include: hybrid metal AM which defines the synergistic integration of secondary processing steps (e.g., milling, laser peening, ultrasonic peening) with the additive steps; the fundamentals of laser-metal interactions which are integral to laser-based processes; small-batch laser powder bed fusion for new alloy development; NDE of AM samples, both in situ and ex situ, and their microstructures; computational models of AM microstructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NMR is a widely used tool for characterizing the composition and dynamics of chemical systems.  It is, for example, the technical basis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), an important medical diagnostic tool.  Dr. Han and her group are devising new probes and new experimental protocols to substantially improve the resolution and sensitivity of NMR analysis of samples containing species and of properties currently not amenable to NMR analysis.  The research offers interdisciplinary training opportunities to graduate students by providing hands-on experience in technology and hardware development. The educational impact is enhanced through a structured undergraduate research program, Hands-On-Spin (hSPIN), engaging undergraduate students in instrument development.<br/> <br/>Dr. Han's research focusses on development of innovative methods for spin manipulations and novel instrumental capabilities, targeting improved understanding and a wider scope of applicability for high-field solid-state Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP). Specifically, her group is using a novel sensitizer scheme to reveal DNP from high-spin systems that would otherwise be invisible to DNP.   In the course of these studies, they are clarifying the mechanism behind the Overhauser effect (OE) in insulating solids, unraveling the competition between electron spin exchange (J) and dipolar couplings (D) in DNP under Magic Angle Spinning (MAS), and improving understanding of the potential and range of hyperfine DNP spectroscopy to measure transition metal ? nuclear spin distances. The studies are uncovering new DNP mechanisms and novel experimental approaches to extend DNP to spin systems beyond S=1/2. These aims are enabled by developing innovative instrumental capabilities for concurrent electron (e) and nuclear (n) spin resonance excitation and detection; arbitrary waveform generated (AWG) pulse shaping to achieve coherent and/or spin dynamics-assisted e-n polarization transfer; and two-frequency pump-probe 2D Electron DOuble Resonance (ELDOR), under static and MAS conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First-year students will receive four-year scholarships and transfer students will receive two-year scholarships. The project team will further support these students? academic success, career readiness, and STEM career placement through bi-weekly STEM seminars, building on the Pedagogy of Real-Talk (PRT). PRT is an evidence-based pedagogy focused on engaging, teaching, and connecting with students through shared personal narratives (Real Talks) and guided activities that build on students? lived experiences (Alternative Lessons). Peer, faculty, and professional mentors will utilize PRT principles. This approach helps create an inclusive and student-centered learning environment that allows all students to feel safe, known, and valued within their chosen academic and career pathway. As one of the only 4-year institutions to have adopted PRT training for both faculty and support staff, FSU is well-positioned to yield valuable insights into the effective application of PRT-guided interventions. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project will increase support for STEM Scholars by offering: (a) scholarships for domestic, low-income, academically talented students with demonstrated financial need pursuing STEM programs (b) bi-weekly STEM seminars that build on a First Year Experience (FYE) course using PRT practices to create a community of scholars; (c) summer internships and undergraduate research experiences; and (d) a PRT-informed mentorship ladder model that utilizes faculty, peer, and professional mentors for each participant throughout the program. These interventions have been developed to support 3 project goals: 1) Improve student recruitment, retention, graduation and progression into STEM careers and/or advanced study 2) Support student sense of belonging, academic success, and career development within their selected STEM discipline 3) Build institutional capacity to establish this PRT-guided STEM career development program for all students.

Some hosts combat such parasitism by actively defending their nests from adult parasites. Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia) produce unique ""seet"" calls to warn about the presence of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). In response to seet calls, female warblers return to sit tightly on the nest to prevent cowbird parasitism. This means that, much like words in human languages, seet calls symbolize cowbird parasitism for the warblers. The project?s aim is to understand how hosts perceive and process the acoustic and functional meaning of these symbolic signals by studying the behavioral responses (in the field) and neurophysiological patterns (using fMRI) of warblers to the cowbird?s own calls, seet calls, and other sounds typical of the warbler?s habitat. The grant will train a postdoctoral fellow, three PhD students, one Master's student, and at least eight undergraduate researchers, including students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The researchers will write and share case studies based on their research as open online educational resources for undergraduate courses in organismal biology. Additional broader impacts will include bird banding workshops for the general public, especially during the vibrant migratory seasons in central Illinois and Michigan. Finally, a short 3D virtual reality film-feature will be produced entitled ""A Day in the Life of the Cowbird"", featuring characteristic daily activities of parasitic birds and their interactions with hosts, as seen from the parasite's own eyes' perspective.<br/><br/>Current and past research on alarm calling in animals has often focused on the detailed discovery and characterization of the meaning of referential communication signals. However, the sensory-perceptual abilities of animals to recognize referential calls and the potentially high-level neural processing that ultimately leads to a specific behavioral response have not yet been fully explored. Through integrating field and laboratory experiments and levels of analyses, this research aims to test the overarching hypothesis that referential signaling requires high-level cognitive abilities. Using Yellow Warblers? anti-brood parasitic alarm calls to Brown-headed Cowbirds as a study system, four specific predictions will be assessed regarding that referential calling (i) involves perceptual equivalency of alarm calls and their referents, (ii) is socially acquired but may be modified by personal experience with cowbirds, (iii) involves mental imagery, episodic-like memory, and mental time travel, modifying future behavior so as to decrease risks to fitness, and (iv) is a functionally specific response to obligate brood parasitism. The project couples behavioral and population-level predictions of Yellow Warblers' responses to seet calls with probing of developmental trajectories and neural substrates of referential communication in wild birds via in vivo imaging (fMRI) to repeatedly collect data across development. This integrative research will provide new perspectives on the cognitive ecology and mechanisms of referential communication, including potentially transformative understanding of the neural substrates underlying the perception of symbolic calls, the existence of mental time travel in novel contexts, and the functional substrates of referential signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The GSMATH Conference will be held at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, TX on February 23 - 25, 2024. The conference is organized by GSMATH, which is the regional mathematics alliance covering the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. GSMATH includes an active and strong network of faculty mentors in over 25 HSIs (Hispanic Serving Institutions), HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), and other institutions that serve a diverse population of students. Building from seven prior GSMATH conferences, it is anticipated that over 100 students and 50 faculty will attend the conference. Student sessions will center on demystifying pathways through undergraduate degree programs in the mathematical sciences. Keynote speakers, panel discussions, a student poster session, and a graduate school fair will provide multiple opportunities for students to network, ask questions, and receive mentoring. The faculty workshop will focus on supporting students as they transition from 2-year and 4-year colleges into graduate education or the workforce.<br/><br/>The GSMATH conference will directly contribute to efforts to broaden participation and promote equity in the mathematical sciences. This, in turn, has potential to improve STEM education and academic outcomes for students across disciplines. Panels like ?What I wish I knew Before Graduate School?, ?Math Careers"", and an undergraduate-graduate student dialogue, will allow participating students to get advice from faculty and experienced peers. The involvement of community college mathematics faculty and students is a critical element of the GSMATH conference, as 2-year colleges are a starting point for many students pursuing bachelor?s and graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences. The faculty development workshop will not only enable faculty to collaboratively mentor those students throughout the year but will also address critical transition points from CCs to four-year institutions and from undergraduate to graduate studies. Faculty development will also strengthen connections between participating institutions, supporting the growth of a responsive community of mentors across the discipline.

Oysters are an example of such resources and are a vital keystone species directly related to healthy ecosystems, fisheries, and economies. This project provides long-term perspectives on the actions, goals, and institutions that guided oyster management systems in the past while generating data relevant to modern oyster management and restoration efforts. Collaborating with the Tampa Bay Estuary Program and Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, this project provides archaeological baselines from Florida?s largest open-water estuary that can refine habitat suitability models used in management and restoration?a framework that can be applied to estuaries worldwide. <br/><br/>The focus of the project is to examine the evidence of oyster management systems used by Native American societies of Tampa Bay, Florida, and to contrast them with contemporary oyster regulations. By integrating concepts from collective action theory and historical ecology, this study assesses the resilience of the institutions governing oyster reefs across time and space. Envisioning management systems as a combination of selective harvesting practices, tenure systems, and enhancement strategies provides a framework of testable hypotheses. The research draws on previously excavated materials and ongoing excavations at three Woodland period shell-bearing island sites in the lower reaches of the Tampa Bay Estuary. Oyster morphology, stable isotope and trace element geochemistry, and zooarchaeological methods from well-dated contexts are enlisted to provide insights into oyster management systems by estimating the season and environment of oyster harvest, selective preferences, and harvesting rates. Oysters from domestic and public spaces are compared to elucidate potential differences in tenure systems. Archaeological datasets are contextualized by robust datasets of modern oysters from a variety of habitats.

As an example, given a description of a quantum mechanical system, can one efficiently compute the energy of the system? Problems such as this one have become increasingly important since the advent of quantum computing, the area of computer science which uses the strange properties of quantum mechanics to design computers which are potentially faster than the computers we have today. The study of these problems has revealed deep and unexpected connections between theoretical computer science and physics, and the goal of this research project is to further explore and strengthen these connections. As a part of this project, the investigator will mentor graduate students, write and disseminate new educational materials including course notes and a textbook, and design new graduate-level coursework on these topics.<br/><br/>This project has four sets of broad goals. The first set of goals seeks to determine the difficulty of computing various properties of nonlocal games, which are simple cooperative games important to the foundations of quantum mechanics. The second set of goals seeks to understand to what extent one can compute various properties of physical systems described by local Hamiltonians, such as their ground state energies; specifically, the interest here is in understanding how well classical optimization techniques such as semidefinite programming perform at these tasks. The third set of goals is to determine the difficulty of computing the most general of quantum tasks, such as implementing a generic unitary operation, and whether these tasks can be shown to be harder than any classical computation. Finally, the last set of goals pertains to understanding how well one can learn properties of quantum states by measuring identical copies of the states, and whether one can improve on state-of-the-art algorithms in this area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are composed of special repetitive DNA, proteins, and the RNA version of the DNA. Telomeric DNA can fold into structures called G-quadruplexes, form lariat structures called telomere loops, and form R-loops when it is transcribed into RNA. Solving the unknown structural dynamics during telomere looping and transcription will provide new insights to how telomeres carry out their function of protecting chromosomes, and how aging happens at the cellular level. This project will use a recently developed model telomere DNA system to study DNA structure in real-time, and how DNA structures control telomere looping and transcription. This project will also develop a continuous program that allows high school teachers and students to work in research and teaching laboratories. The inclusion of high school teachers and students is expected to improve the science education on the fundamentals about DNA and RNA. Overall, this project will advance the knowledge of how DNA and RNA works in telomere and propagate basic knowledge of DNA and RNA functions to high school teachers and students. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to understand how the slow folding process of non-canonical secondary structures affects telomere maintenance. This project seeks to characterize the conformational dynamics of telomeric DNA, RNA, and DNA-RNA hybrid complexes by combining single-molecular Frster resonance energy transfer microscopy (smFRET), calorimetry, and CD spectroscopy. This research will advance mechanism-based understanding of (a) how conformational dynamics in the telomeric DNA and RNA affect the formation of telomere loop and end protection, and (b) how telomeric and non-telomeric sequences self-regulate their transcription. The research goals of this project will be addressed by the following specific objectives: (1) Quantify the sequence dependence of G-quadruplex (G4) refolding kinetics; (2) Characterize the structural and conformational dynamics induced by telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2); and (3) Measure the correlation between telomere transcription and TRF2-induced structural changes. The preliminary data from the PI?s laboratory leads to a hypothesis that the slow process of forming a stable G4 in telomeric G-rich ssDNA serves as a biological timer.

Nonlinear optical spectroscopy, which is widely used to explore light-matter interactions, requires high light intensities due to fundamental limitations in classical optical detection. Unfortunately, this often introduces significant ambiguity in the derived photophysical models. This research project seeks to overcome this limitation by harnessing the superior signal-to-noise ratio provided by quantum-optical methods. Dr. Srimath Kandada and his students will use this enhanced experimental capability to investigate the unique exciton physics of two-dimensional derivatives of metal halide perovskites. Improved comprehension of perovskite photophysics is expected to drive the optimization of their optoelectronic properties, with potential benefits for a variety of applications. The education and outreach program, centered on the optics and spectroscopy components of the research program, will build a synergistic partnership between the students and faculty at Wake Forest University and the local high schools to motivate greater participation of students from diverse backgrounds in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education and research.<br/><br/>This research project aims to measure the dynamics of exciton-lattice correlations and the fluctuations that drive them, to accurately estimate the intrinsic dephasing rate of excitons and inter-exciton interactions and to measure the dynamics of carrier thermalization and exciton formation without many-body contributions.

The experiment involves the measurement of noise in the amplitude and phase of the transient optical response in the presence of an impulsively generated population of coherent phonons. This will enable the estimation of contributions from stochastic lattice fluctuations to the phonon anharmonicity and polaronic dressing of excitons.

Tardigrades can survive many environmental extremes, including desiccation, high and low temperatures, radiation, osmotic shock, and pressure. Although the survival mechanisms of tardigrades are poorly understood, evidence points towards accumulation of bioprotectant proteins as a key element to their survival. This research project looks at the structure of several bioprotectant proteins identified in tardigrades and how they protect other proteins when the environment becomes unsuitable for life. Carefully controlled experiments conducted in test tubes and in cultured cells will assist with the interpretation of measurements made directly in living tardigrades. Dr. Davis will advance the state of climate change education in Connecticut and nurture the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and teachers through a scaffold of education initiatives supported by Yale?s Pathways to Science program. This work will target communities that are underprivileged and most vulnerable to climate impacts. In addition, this proposal will support the training of high school, undergraduate, postgraduate, and graduate researchers on state-of-the-art instrumentation, producing climate scientists prepared to help the nation obtain new knowledge that can lead to a more sustainable planet. <br/><br/>The research under this award aims to develop a detailed physiochemical understanding of the structure and function of tardigrade disordered proteins.  These families of proteins and other intrinsically disordered proteins assist organisms with rapidly adapting to environmental extremes and the goal of this work is to unravel the mechanisms that allow for this. The broad hypothesis is that tardigrade disordered proteins protect other proteins, i.e. prevent aggregation and unfolding, through distinct mechanisms that enable tardigrades to survive extreme stress. In situ infrared and fluorescence imaging techniques are being developed to accomplish two separate but related projects. Optical photothermal infrared imaging will reveal differences in the secondary structure of tardigrade disordered proteins under basal and stress conditions. To determine whether the same structures form in situ, measurements will be made in vitro, in cell, and in living tardigrades. Complementary fast relaxation imaging measurements will examine how tardigrade disordered proteins change the structure and stability of other proteins in vitro and in living tardigrades.

Those capabilities will be enabled by recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs). This approach affords many advantages over the current state of the art, including early identification of potential errors in manufacturing plans and fast, step-by-step debugging of code, thereby reducing errors and delays. It is expected that G-Forge, once demonstrated for 3D printing, can be extended to other numerically controlled machine tools to redefine traditional workflows, significantly reducing errors and costs. The project's multidisciplinary components will be integrated into a broader educational effort to offer students a solid foundation in the critical interdisciplinary area of cyber manufacturing and will ultimately support economic competitiveness, national security, and workforce development.<br/> <br/>G-Forge is a multimodal LLM for additive manufacturing that will be trained using computer-aided design (CAD) models and G-code. The LLM can be considered an information encoder that compiles the information from input data of various modalities into an embedding.

Because of its multi-faceted utility, it is expected that manufacturers will widely adopt G-Forge, incentivizing them to participate in creating a shared G-code database. G-Forge will lay the foundations of a larger ecosystem akin to 'Google for Manufacturing,' enabling users to perform numerous downstream tasks such as design retrieval and recommendation and automated shape generation.

The conference will bring 26 internationally-recognized mathematicians to each give a 50-minute talk and participate throughout the week. It will also support the participation of a number of early career researchers. All participants will have the opportunity to present their research in a poster session running throughout the week, and an open problem session will focus on future directions of research. The Spring School will take place during the second week, May 19-23, 2024. It will be led by two young experts, Drs. Durcik and Roos, with 10 to 15 participants at the graduate student or postdoctoral level. The participants will prepare presentations from a list of important papers in the field in advance and during the Spring School, they will study the papers together under the guidance of Drs. Durcik and Roos which will introduce these junior researchers to important recent developments in the field and gain a broad understanding of this every active area of mathematics. These two events are connected for synergistic purposes; junior researchers will be invited to the conference to learn more from more senior researchers, where they can present their own work in a poster session, and they can stay for the summer school for a more in-depth study. Thus, organizing the two events consecutively will provide enhanced opportunities for junior researchers to network, share their results, and learn from their peers and more senior researchers. The organizers have dedicated a substantial portion of the conference budget to the participation of early-career mathematicians. They will make special efforts to invite and encourage the participation of women and members of other underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>The topics to be discussed at the conference will include, but will not be limited to, the following important developments in harmonic analysis in recent years: the Fourier restriction and Bochner?Riesz problems; decoupling inequalities and local smoothing problems in Fourier analysis and their applications, applications to geometric measure theory; inequalities of Brascamp-Lieb type; sparse domination inequalities and their application to weighted norm theory; analysis problems for the Hamming cube; subelliptic partial differential equations and generalized pseudo-differential operators.

High-speed images of a free-flying hawkmoth showed the insect -- after being impulsively accelerated to a spin rate of 5,000 degrees per second -- returning to normal flight in only a few wing beats. Computer simulations suggest that this rapid recovery may be due to a spring-like force from the air displaced by the sudden motion of the moth?s body. These forces were not previously thought to be important in hawkmoth flight. This project will use mathematical analyses and high-fidelity computer simulations to fully explore and explain this surprising result. The knowledge gained from this work will help safeguard future aircraft; the observed behavior is beyond the capability of current flight control technology.   <br/><br/>Preliminary analysis suggests that the body-added mass effect plays a central role in the observed ability of the hawkmoth to recover from impulsive acceleration to high pitch rates. This study will apply a combination of theoretical and computational methods to understand the interplay between body flight dynamics and unsteady flow, at timescales significantly faster than the wing beat period. Specific tasks include (i) dynamic analysis of body added mass effects and comparison to existing insect flight disturbance response data; (ii) high-fidelity computational fluid dynamic simulations of added mass effects, and (iii) analysis of added mass effects in the presence of vortical flow.

But do we really know how we make these decisions? This project proposes a new method for exploring decision makers? knowledge of how they make decisions ? which psychologists refer to as metacognitive knowledge. This method is specifically designed to assess decision makers? metacognitive knowledge when they are making subjective decisions in which they must make tradeoffs between different factors. The method is used to explore a range of questions about how people think about the decisions that they make. Developing and testing this method is important because it allows us to better understand how people make not only personal decisions, such as buying a car or house, but also policy-relevant decisions, such as which candidate to vote for or which policy to endorse. This knowledge can be useful in designing interventions and decision environments that help people make better decisions.<br/><br/>The project presents a novel paradigm for assessing metacognitive knowledge in subjective, multi-attribute choice decisions. In this paradigm, participants are asked to complete a Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) task, then self-report the influence (i.e., weight) they believe each attribute had on their decision-making process. These self-reported weights are compared to revealed weights estimated via Hierarchical Bayes Estimation from the CBC task, with higher correspondence indicating greater metacognitive knowledge. The proposed studies seek to validate the paradigm, implement the paradigm to isolate various metacognitive mechanisms (e.g., metacognitive control, metacognitive monitoring), and use the paradigm to explore the role that metacognitive knowledge may play in classic decision phenomena (e.g., framing effects). The primary contribution of this project is to expand the meta-reasoning (i.e., metacognition in reasoning) literature ? which has primarily focused on objective decisions ? into subjective decisions, which are highly important and often have significant impacts on individuals? well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology is a simple, yet more sustainable and multifunctional structure that can be applied to individual structures, community-based structures, and shoreline environments to minimize erosion, infiltration, and treatment of runoff water. The configuration and geometry of a biologically active pervious structure can be adapted to address individual and site-specific requirements for areas prone to runoff. Biochar can mitigate climate change by reducing soil emissions of greenhouse gases, where one ton of biochar can sequester three tons of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, introducing biochar in concrete block manufacturing can decrease carbon dioxide emissions as compared to producing concrete using 100% Portland type-I cement. The biologically active pervious structure has the potential to control erosion and improve runoff water quality through adsorption, biotransformation, and biodegradation which can prevent contamination of aquifers, waterways, and the environment.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a biologically active pervious structure. The biologically active pervious structure presents a viable solution to address several issues associated with runoff, including flow volume, erosional effects, contaminant deactivation, and greenhouse gas emissions. Multifunctional biochar (derived from invasive plants and waste agriculture biomass impregnated on a biologically active pervious structure) captures a wide range of nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, dyes, antibiotics, volatile organic compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The highly efficient and robust synergistic bacterial consortium immobilized on a biologically active pervious structure can bio-transform or biodegrade a wide range of parent and intermediate compounds sorbed on biochar, and bacterial exopolysaccharides. The biologically active pervious structure can be implemented for runoff treatment in individual buildings, urban communities, and coastal areas. Additionally, this technology can facilitate the capture and control of runoff volume before reaching surface water bodies, making it a viable option for the worldwide runoff capture/control industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Barratt Park of Texas Tech University is developing broadband microwave spectroscopy-based tools for the automated assignment and structure determination of clusters in complex mixtures. The microwave structures will be combined with isomer-resolved IR measurements to obtain detailed information about small hydrohalic acid-water clusters. Microwave spectroscopy is a powerful method for determining the precise three-dimensional structure of a molecule or cluster of molecules, but spectra obtained from mixtures of unknown molecular species are extremely challenging to interpret because of their sheer complexity.  Dr. Park and his students will use automated microwave and infrared spectroscopy techniques to unravel the complicated patterns and learn about the structure and vibrational dynamics of the world?s tiniest drops of acid, consisting of a single acid molecule dissolved by a handful of water molecules. Their studies could provide crucial benchmarks for the theoretical description of aqueous clusters and could lead to significant advances in chemical structure determination from microwave spectra of mixtures. The Park group will develop a microwave spectrometer to provide hands-on instruction for undergraduate students and will perform community outreach with future-scientist middle school girls. <br/><br/>Technological advances in frequency-flexible broadband microwave spectroscopy enable entirely new approaches to microwave structure determination in complex mixtures. The current capabilities of automated assignment algorithms will be extended to more complex, non-rigid Hamiltonians. The primary target of this investigation will be hydrohalic acid-water clusters with a single HX molecule and 3-10 water molecules. To date, existing spectroscopic approaches have only enabled microwave structures and unambiguous, undisputed IR assignment of very small clusters with fewer than three water molecules. A key goal of this investigation will be to obtain high-resolution measurements of the structure and vibrational dynamics of the smallest clusters that lead to dissociation. The isotopic substitution of the clusters will be varied in a controlled way, facilitating the assignment of a complete set of substitution structures, which will allow the determination of the microwave structure. Isomer-resolved IR spectra of neutral clusters will be obtained by IR-microwave double resonance. Advances in methodology that will be enabled by the proposed work could make progress towards the elusive goal of allowing chemical structures to be determined from microwave spectra of mixtures in an efficient way by a non-expert.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several of such processes are known to the community as sprites, blue and gigantic jets etc. These have attracted the attention of several citizen scientists all over the globe. One such phenomenon, which is still not completely understood is referred to as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes or TGFs. During these events, bursts of X-rays with high energy are generated. The main goal of this research is to develop theoretical work that will shed light on the sources of TGFs. This inter-disciplinary work combines concepts of plasma physics as well as atmospheric processes. It may be relevant to the development of new X-ray sources with possible implications on medical imaging processes. The proposed work will result in the training of a graduate student and will be part of the doctorate thesis. <br/><br/>The main motivation for the proposed work results from some recent observations of TGF?s and exploring the underlying physical processes responsible for these events. The core physical process leading is avalanche multiplication of electrons accelerated by force exerted by electric field. In geophysical context the field is generated either as ambient field due to thundercloud electrification or produced by lightning leaders. These electrons gain energy from the electric field and experience quick multiplication in ionizing collisions. In relativistic regime these electrons can radiate energetic photons (X-rays) as they scatter by nuclei of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in air. The radiation is referred to as braking or bremsstrahlung radiation. These X-rays are radiated in all directions and some fraction is radiated backwards with respect to electron motion. These X-rays can produce seed electrons due to photoelectric effect and this leads to strong amplification of the original avalanche.  This process is referred to as feedback process. It was discovered recently that these effects occur on very small spatial scales in good agreement with existing observations. This project investigates the exact physical regimes which lead to observed phenomena. The education and transfer of knowledge will benefit from the proposed activity through the mentoring of students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carbon blocks and coatings are widely used to control friction and wear of sliding interfaces in manufacturing processes or manufactured goods. This project focuses on understanding and improving tribochemical properties of thermally-synthesized carbon (TSC) materials for the application where low friction is beneficial. Polycrystalline graphite powders and other TSC materials show relatively high friction, although superlubricity is readily observed on the basal plane of graphite and for hydrogenated diamond-like carbon produced via plasma enhanced deposition process. This raises an important question ? what controls superlubricous behaviors of different types of carbon materials? Addressing this question can lead to a better design of carbon materials that can be used as carbon brushes for electrical motors or generators and/or mechanical seals in which oil or grease lubrication cannot be employed. Reduction of friction and wear of these components will greatly improve energy efficiency in manufacturing processes. These issues are important in new energy applications and hence US competitiveness. Morgan Advanced Materials is participating as the GOALI partner and will provide commercial and custom-designed carbon materials for the study. The project will provide research opportunities to undergraduate students in the Penn State Commonwealth system. The surface analysis results of this project will be integrated with graduate-level education. <br/><br/>Two hypotheses will be studied: (i) Friction of carbon materials depends on the distribution of sp2 and sp3 hybridizations and how they are connected to form the amorphous network, which varies with synthesis method. (ii) The chemical activity of reactive sites exposed at the sliding interface also varies depending on how carbon materials are synthesized. Studying these hypotheses requires the analysis of shear-induced structural transforms and chemical reactions occurring at the frictional interface; but that interface is not readily accessible for in-situ characterization. Alternately, relevant information can be deduced from the ex-situ analysis of the transfer film on the counter-surface formed from different carbon materials. This is because friction is a non-equilibrium process, and the final state of the transfer film will be a function of the initial state and the condition during friction. Various spectroscopic techniques will be employed to analyze the transfer film to identify tribochemical parameters governing friction and wear behaviors of thermally-synthesized carbon materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AI tools like ChatGPT have been adapted to several industries, from real estate to journalism, and related AI technologies are predicted to have a profound impact on nearly every industry. This unprecedented adoption brings a myriad of concerns, including the impact of using AI tools to replace and thus devalue human interactions. This project will explore how AI text generation tools like ChatGPT portray stress and mental health in engineering. By examining how engineering is portrayed and comparing results to previously recorded interviews, the project will identify how these AI tools can be leveraged for qualitative research studies. Understanding engineering cultural norms and expectations, particularly around stress and mental health, is critical in addressing longstanding challenges in engineering related to chronic underrepresentation of groups and low student retention. The project is a fit with the EAGER program due to its exploratory nature, as AI text generation tools have not been used for data generation, despite their increasing use in data analysis. Further, the project is potentially transformational with its potential to introduce new research methodologies. Finally, the project will provide training and resources to the larger engineering education community to use AI tools.<br/><br/>This project will explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate qualitative datasets. The project is exploratory in its goal to use LLMs as a research tool to understand engineering cultural norms related to stress and mental health and will be informed by the Engineering Culture framework. Results generated from LLMs will be compared with themes derived from qualitative datasets generated from student interviews about engineering culture. With the rapidly increasing availability of open source LLMs, researchers have, and will increasingly continue, to use LLMs and other AI tools for research. This has created a critical and urgent need to determine best practices to yield high quality data and analyses. To address this, our project asks the overall research question: How can LLMs be used to generate data for qualitative engineering education research studying engineering culture? The study will develop guidelines for how LLMs can be leveraged to produce quality datasets for cultural studies that enrich existing qualitative methods and overcome limitations of these methods. The project will specifically examine cultural understandings of mental health in engineering culture and compare LLM-generated datasets to student interviews about stress and mental health in engineering culture. Research to understand the knowledge distilled by LLMs will contribute to research on understanding perceived norms and assumptions about stress and mental health in engineering education and careers. Leveraging LLMs in qualitative research has the potential to enable new and synergistic methods for qualitative research. The project will develop resources for the engineering education research community to use AI in qualitative research. Ultimately, the proposed work will lay the groundwork to understand how LLMs can be best used in qualitative EER and engage engineering education researchers in the AI Revolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, seawater is becoming more acidic waters and lower in oxygen levels, affecting many sea creatures. These changes can harm fish, and thus the fishing industry, but threatens ocean biodiversity more generally. Additionally, harmful algal blooms, which can be toxic, are occurring more frequently, presenting risks to both sea life and human health. It is important to understand better the physical and chemical processes that are involved in these changes. This project aims to precisely do that by using advanced computer models and real-world data while training young ocean scientists.<br/><br/>Contemporary global ocean biogeochemical models have limitations in computational power and are unable to capture small-scale ocean phenomena, such as small scales currents (of size 100m to 1km) and the influence of surface waves. Yet, emerging research indicates that these small-scale processes have a significant impact on ocean chemistry and life. Notably, the role of surface gravity waves appears to modify small-scale motions. Including wave effects could substantially improve simulations of the ocean's chemistry, but direct measurements of these fine-scale ocean characteristics are rare and difficult to obtain. The difficulty makes numerical models an indispensable tool for exploring these small scale features. This project focuses on the California Current System and will resolve some of the very small features and wave dynamics. The results from these simulations will inform future measurement and sampling plans, help to evaluate the impact of waves on marine chemical cycles, and refine how these effects can be represented in broader climate models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flood hazards are the most prominent stressors for communities in the U.S. and across the world, causing dire physical, social, and economic hardships. Currently, city managers, planners, infrastructure owners and operators, emergency managers, and local and state public agencies are missing critical insights and foresights needed to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from flood hazards. This innovation may form the basis of data products and analytics solutions to inform various flood resilience plans and actions at city, regional, and state levels. In addition, this technology may transform the ability of decision-makers, emergency managers, and flood managers to tailor their strategies and technologies to enhance intelligent resilience in dealing with flood hazards.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven software system to reliably and accurately estimate spatial flood risk and property damage caused by flooding in a rapid and automated way. The technology augments the flood analytics capabilities of local/public agencies to enhance flood risk mapping, expedite flood claim processing, and enhance resource allocation. In addition, the system is designed to automatically map the lowest flood elevation of properties from street view imagery and provide high-resolution and reliable flood risk maps based on examining various hydrological, land use, and built environment features and their interactions.  This technology may improve the reliability and availability of flood risk mapping and also improve the speed and accuracy of damage assessment, enabling local and public agencies, emergency managers, flood managers, and insurance companies to make more informed decisions in their flood resilience efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zeolites are a class of nanoporous solid-acid catalysts that are particularly well suited to reactions of hydrocarbons derived from natural gas and petroleum resources.  The transition from fossil-based resources to bio-renewable feedstocks in recent years has triggered interest in modifying zeolites and other microporous catalysts to increase their effectiveness for reacting raw biomass molecules to higher-value fuels and chemicals.  The project investigates a novel approach for modifying acid catalysts that involves promoting reaction rates through confinement in tight spaces while facilitating diffusion of bulky product molecules away from the active sites.  The approach utilizes a molecular imprinting atomic layer deposition method to create microporous silica structures near the active sites to induce confinement effects without imposing transport constraints. These solid acids catalysts with tunable porous structures will be tested for their effectiveness and stability in aromatic alkylation and aldol condensation reactions, chosen because of their widespread application in industrial chemistry and in upgrading biomass-derived molecules. The project will involve strong coupling between research and education by integrating the research results into classroom materials, providing research opportunities for students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM, showcasing the investigator?s laboratories to local K-12 female students, and creating and broadcasting educational videos via social media channels for researchers who are new to heterogeneous catalysis research.<br/><br/>Over the last two decades, the field has made significant progress in understanding the effects of reaction network, kinetics, and transport on observed rates, selectivities, and stabilities, on chemistries occurring on confined spaces such as microporous acidic zeolites. Yet, the three-dimensional network of microporous structures in zeolitic materials often introduces unwanted transport effects that can lead to undesired side reactions and catalyst deactivation caused by pore blockage. This project aims to add another dimension in rationally designing porous materials by developing and implementing molecular imprinting atomic layer deposition methods to create microporous SiO2 architecture near active sites in mesoporous aluminosilicates to induce confinement effects without imposing transport constraints. These solid acids with tunable porous structures will be used to assess their detailed role on observed rates, selectivities, and stabilities by combining kinetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical methods. In doing so, this proposal aims to provide comprehensive catalyst design principles for active site manipulation that match the specific requirements of C-C coupling chemistries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, they are widely used in heat transfer applications such as plastic heat exchangers, electronic cooling, and electric vehicle thermal management due to their mechanical flexibility and low cost. However, the development of thermally conductive amorphous polymers has been exceptionally challenging due to the lack of physical guidance. This project aims to combine molecular simulations, machine learning (ML), and experiments to develop amorphous polymers with high TC (>1.5 W/mK) and understand the underlying molecular features dictating thermal transport. The methodology developed and the physics understood from this project will significantly speed up and increase the success rate of developing high TC polymers. These new materials will contribute to tackling the challenges in many heat transfer applications. This project will also provide multi-disciplinary education opportunities to students and researchers from diverse backgrounds and scientific fields. The topics of this project will cultivate future workforce for the U.S. industry. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to significantly speed up the development of thermally conductive polymer and understand the underlying structure-property relationships governing amorphous polymer TC. To reach this goal, the objectives of this project are: (1) establish a standardized polymer database using high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, complemented by data from existing database (e.g., PolyInfo) and open literature; (2) employ a unique ML training technique, semi-supervised framework for graph imbalanced regression (SGIR), to develop accurate surrogate models that map out structure-property relations for polymer chemistry, structure and TC, and use our Graph Rationalization with Environment-based Augmentations (GREA) technique to identify the influential molecular features impacting TC; (3) use the established model to predict ~100 polymers with varying TC and perform detailed MD simulations to calculate the TC to verify the prediction and understand the ML-identified structure-property relationship; (4) down-select 10 polymers with the expert opinion from collaborating polymer chemists on the synthesizability of the predicted polymers, synthesize them and measure their TC. The data-driven approach to be established in this project will provide an impactful example in the field concerning thermally conductive polymers.

The Arctic landscape, particularly permafrost (frozen ground), stores a massive amount of carbon ? nearly twice as much as the atmosphere. As air temperatures in the Arctic increase, the permafrost thaws and carbon-rich organic matter can be released. Once released, this carbon can be transformed into carbon dioxide and methane ? greenhouse gases. The carbon released from permafrost may also be transported to the ocean where it can be buried for many years, keeping it out of the atmosphere. The primary goals of this research are to find hotspots of permafrost thaw in the Arctic landscape and to understand what happens to carbon after it is released from the permafrost. This project supports one postdoctoral scholar and provides funding to analyze samples collected from a river in Arctic Alaska. This work will result in a mathematical model that simulates the flow of carbon across the Arctic landscape. The PI will also create an educational tool to teach students about carbon-climate feedbacks.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a mechanistic understanding of the feedbacks between physical erosion, oxidative weathering, and organic carbon (OC) transformation in Arctic landscapes. This project uses a ?source-to-sink? approach to study the physical and chemical effects of permafrost thaw at the landscape-scale and assess the transformation of OC upon mobilization and downstream transport. Focusing on the Canning River in northern Alaska, the PI will compare modern river OC fluxes with long-term catchment-average OC export derived from cosmogenic radionuclide geochemistry. To determine whether permafrost-derived OC is oxidized to CO2 during transport across the Arctic landscape, this project applies novel geochemical methods, including ramped pyrolysis oxidation-14C and dissolved rhenium analyses. The results will constrain decomposition rates of OC mobilized from thawing permafrost, which are largely unknown but needed to predict future CO2 emissions from the Arctic. Using data generated from this project, the PI will construct a model of coupled erosion, weathering, and carbon cycling in Arctic river catchments. Further application of this coupled model will reveal the feedbacks among climate, erosion, sediment routing, and OC cycling that will advance our understanding of Arctic landscape response to future climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this importance, how cells coordinate probing their environment with forward movement remains unknown.  This project examines actin cytoskeletal networks and adhesion receptors as integral yet distinct subsystems ? akin to an airplane?s wings and tail, which are critical for lift, stability, and steering. Just as both the ailerons and rudder are necessary for an airplane?s maneuvering yet are ineffective in isolation, this project will explore the interdependence of actin network subsystems in steering and powering cell migration. Using nanofabricated matrices designed to direct cellular behavior towards single migration behaviors, the study will identify the parts within each subsystem and how they interact to create matrix-guided migration.  The broader impacts include engaging high school students in cell motility challenge experiments using student-designed nanofabricated matrices and establishing ?The A-mazing Cell Races? website to present the results and engage the public with the dynamics of cell biology.  The project?s innovative strategy of forcing a single cellular function and identifying the parts that create the function is a transformative approach to studying complex systems that cannot be separated using traditional biochemical or molecular approaches.<br/>	<br/>Cells use actin-based protrusions to probe the ECM for places to bind and form anchors to pull themselves forward.  Extensive studies have revealed that protrusions contain multiple actin networks with different structures.  However, understanding each network?s role in probing and forward movement has been limited.  The networks cannot be isolated without inducing compensatory effects, and they cannot probe or bind ECM without receptors. Yet, the networks are not thought to connect to receptors until the receptors bind to ECM. This proposal targets these significant gaps by considering actin networks and ECM receptors as complex systems, an assembly of parts that produces more functionality than its components.  However, as many of us learned as children who took something apart to figure out how it worked and ended up with a box of parts that could not be put back together, some hidden randomness, hierarchy, or collective dynamic essential for functionality disappears when pieces are removed.  This project will study ECM-guided cell migration as a complex system composed of non-separable, hierarchical, interactive, dynamic ECM receptor?actin network subsystems that regulate probing and forward migration.

Since spheres are the fundamental building blocks of topological spaces, the stable stems, which encode the possible relations between high-dimensional spheres up to continuous deformation, are a central object of study. Beyond topology, the stable stems have surprisingly broad applications throughout mathematics, ranging from geometric problems, such as classifying differentiable structures on spheres, to algebraic problems, such as classifying projective modules over rings. This project will explore further applications of stable homotopy theory in algebra, topology, and geometry. Broader impacts center on online community building. The PI will continue co-organizing the Electronic Computational Homotopy Theory Online Research Community, which aims to increase inclusion at the undergraduate, graduate, and senior levels by organizing undergraduate research opportunities, graduate courses, online seminars, mini-courses, and networking events. To address inequality at the K-12 level, the PI will develop and manage a program pairing undergraduates from his home institution with students from local after-school programs for online tutoring. This program would circumvent certain barriers to participation, such as lack of access to transportation and facilities, which are common in traditional outreach.<br/><br/>Specific research projects include the study of the stable stems and their applications in geometric topology, algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems and their connections to number theory, and equivariant analogues of algebraic K-theory and their applications in algebra and geometry. More specifically, building on previous work, the PI will study the stable stems using topological modular forms and the Mahowald invariant, aiming to deduce the existence of exotic spheres in new dimensions. In a related direction, the PI will use the kq-resolution introduced in previous work to study the motivic stable stems, an algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems. The main goal is to apply the kq-resolution to relate the motivic stable stems to arithmetic invariants like Hermitian K-theory. Real algebraic K-theory, which encodes classical invariants like algebraic K-theory, Hermitian K-theory, and L-theory, will also be studied using the trace methods developed in previous work. The overarching goal is extending results from algebraic K-theory to real algebraic K-theory, thereby obtaining results for Hermitian K-theory and L-theory that will have applications in algebra and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many governmental and private institutions are adopting Open Data Principles that state that the shared data is complete, accurate, and timely.  These properties make this data of great value to data scientists, journalists, and the public.  When Open Data is used effectively, data scientists can explore and analyze open resources, which in turn allows them to investigate public policy, create new scientific knowledge, and discover new (hidden) value useful for social, scientific, or economic initiatives.  Though the open data movement has succeeded in its ambition of making data accessible, it has not succeed in making this valuable data easy to use. The overarching goal of this project is to address this shortcoming.<br/><br/>In this project, we present a vision for Open Data Curation - data curation that is open, transparent, and explainable.  Open Data Curation uses an on-demand integration paradigm that spans data discovery, data cleaning and linking, and data integration.  Our vision is to enable users to query heterogeneous data stored in a data repository with minimal up-front effort.  Users can reference concepts and attributes in their queries that do not exist in the data.  An on-demand integration system (ODIS) responds to such requests by automatically determining what data could be transformed and integrated to provide data for a requested concept.  In terms of societal impact, the project will provide the algorithmic innovations to make effective, intuitive on-demand integration over open data lakes a reality.  Our solutions will use real open data and will be robust to the sometimes quirky, and always diverse, characteristics of open data.  We believe a profound shift in how people think about data integration and curation is needed to fuel the data science revolution which is being held back by incoherent data curation - a task that is still considered one of the most time consuming, annoying, and error-prone in data science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical approach of representing data as blocks of information bits falls short of addressing diverse requirements, including scalability, efficiency, and reliability, of the next generation storage, computation, and communication systems. This project develops an alternative paradigm for transmission of data across massively connected wireless networks by proposing methods to embed the information into mathematical constructs called subspaces (i.e., linear-algebraic objects in a vector space), via a technique called subspace coding. While these structures capture the essence of gathered data in a wide range of signal processing applications, fundamental limits of compression as well as practical and universal techniques to attain these limits are not understood. This project characterizes a natural duality between error correction and compression in the subspace domain and proposes to leverage this connection in order to develop explicit and efficient compression mechanisms for massive data sets that exhibit certain properties. This interdisciplinary project is tied with an education plan and provides a stimulating and innovative research environment for students at all levels. Furthermore, workshops are developed as part of an active outreach program in order to introduce high school students to concepts in fields related to data science and communications, exposing them to careers essential to tomorrow?s workforce.<br/><br/>Wireless networks are rapidly growing in size, are becoming more hierarchical, and are becoming increasingly distributed. Conventional methods including channel estimation of point-to-point links and block coding do not properly scale with the size of such massive networks. This project proposes that subspace coding in the analog domain becomes relevant for conveying information across networks in such a scenario. Furthermore, the dual problem in the compression domain is central to a wide range of applications involving large-scale raw data, often exhibiting low-dimensional structures, which require techniques for low-dimensional subspace recovery and dimensionality reduction. The specific objectives of this project are summarized as follows: (1) Provide a comprehensive framework, including a certain metric space and an analog operator channel, to study coding for wireless networks in a non-coherent fashion; (2) Construct subspace codes for analog operator channels and characterize their performance; (3) Develop techniques for low-rank subspace recovery given constrained observations; (4) Characterize fundamental limits on compression of low-rank matrices and leverage the duality with subspace codes to design explicit compression mechanisms; (5) Develop schemes for subspace-coded distributed computation to efficiently compute the outcome of algorithms operating over matrices and subspaces while minimizing the delay.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic devices, directly convert sunlight into electricity. Dramatic efficiency improvements and cost reductions have led to widespread adoption of solar power. There are still problems that limit further adoption. These include incorporation of expensive or toxic raw materials as well as the need for energy intensive, high temperature production processes. This project will investigate an emerging solar technology based on low dimensional chalcogenides as light absorbers. These materials are earth abundant, non-toxic and stable upon exposure to sunlight under ambient conditions. They can also be processed at relatively low temperatures with fewer raw materials consumption and less carbon footprint, making this emerging solar technology potentially cost-competitive and sustainable. This project aims to significantly improve the efficiency of solar cells based on low-dimensional chalcognides through advanced device engineering. The aim is to pave the way to commercialize this newly developed solar technology to provide more affordable solar electricity. This project will impact the community through a long-term partnership with local elementary schools. The PI will reach out to young students to introduce and foster clean energy concepts and solar technologies. The PI will also participate in an on-campus material summer camp for the local secondary school teachers, giving introduction lectures and providing hands-on demonstrations of solar technologies. Teachers can then implement these lessons in their home schools to attract more students, especially those from minority and underrepresented groups, to pursue science and engineering careers.

Polycrystalline low dimensional chalcogenide absorbers possess anisotropic atomic chains and intrinsically benign grain boundaries, which provide unique anisotropic carrier transport behaviors and great grain boundary defect tolerance. Considerable fundamental material and device challenges will be addressed in this project to achieve high-performance low dimensional chalcogenides based PV devices. The following four tasks with a combination of device-level characterization will be carried out: (1) understand the anisotropic growth mechanisms of the low dimensional chalcogenide absorbers layer, and how they impact the carrier transport in the atomic chains and device performance; (2) tailor bandgap of low dimensional chalcogenide absorbers by the alloying approach to maximize the photovoltage with optimized bandgap and minimize the photocurrent loss; (3) engineer defects and interfaces in the low dimensional chalcogenides based PV devices to reduce the carrier recombination sites and increase carrier extraction with a guide of theoretical prediction using first-principle density functional theory calculation; (4) conduct extrinsic doping engineering to increase the photogenerated carrier density and carrier lifetime of the low dimensional chalcogenides based PV devices. Fundamentally, this project will elucidate the relationship between absorbers material microstructure, photogenerated carrier transport properties, and device performance in low dimensional chalcogenide-based PV devices. Eventually, this proposed project will pave the way for the future development of next-generation high-efficiency low-cost thin film PV technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will explore one genetic mechanism that could help explain those differences: the variation in the timing of DNA replication. This project will measure the progression of DNA replication across the chromosomes of many humans, chimpanzees, and other great apes.  Subsequently, the project will identify differences, reconstruct their evolutionary trajectory, and link DNA replication variation to mutation rates, gene expression and possibly, the evolution of new traits.

Transcranial ultrasound (i.e. ultrasound transmission through skull) has many applications including noninvasive surgeries and drug delivery. However, current transcranial ultrasound techniques are all based on sound waves with relatively low frequency and poor spatial resolution, and the energy transmission through the lossy skull is low even for such low frequency sound waves. Brain imaging and brain-machine interfaces require better spatial resolution, which can be realzied by enabling transmission of high frequency ultrasound through skulls, which is not achievable with existing technologies. Active non-Hermitian complementary acoustic metamaterials (NHCMM) are promising compensation media to complement with the strong transmission loss through skull for high frequency acoustic waves. This project explores the acoustic and material properties of PZT-hydrogel composites integrated with feedback control circuits for the experimental realization of NHCMM that can compensate the high frequency ultrasound transmission loss through a real skull. This experimental realization will set the foundation for high resolution ultrasound brain imaging and brain-machine interface.

The NHCMM has effective density and bulk modulus with negative values of that of the barrier to suppress the strong impedance mismatch and material gain that balances the intrinsic loss in the barrier. The NHCMM will be realized by integrating piezoelectric elements and hydrogel with electrical circuit components.

A major challenge in designing such systems is that their performance can change abruptly with small changes in design variables, creating discontinuous design responses. This grant will develop efficient surrogate modeling methods to predict design performance in the presence of such discontinuities which can then be exploited in design optimization. This work will facilitate the solution of complex engineering design problems and will be evaluated in the design of a smart manufacturing system for carbon nanotubes, and the design of automated material handling systems. The award will also contribute to the development of a data science-capable workforce by providing multidisciplinary research, training, and international collaboration opportunities for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. The research team will broadly disseminate their research findings and share data and the resulting software packages to the data science and systems engineering community. <br/><br/>This research will make substantial contributions to the areas of surrogate modeling, sequential design, active learning, system design, and advanced manufacturing. System performance is modeled as a piece-wise continuous function of design variables, motivating local Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling. The approach accommodates regime changes around a prediction location, segmenting local data based on the estimated partition(s). Only the local data belonging to the same regime as a prediction location affects the model prediction. Research activities will explore two ideas: (1) local GP modeling with local data selection; and (2) smoother alternatives that augment design variables with probabilistic regime estimates. A sequential design approach to optimize data acquisition plans for training the new surrogate models will also be investigated. The resulting new meta-models and sequential design scheme will be validated using design problems in carbon nanotube synthesis and smart material handling systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are particularly advantageous due to their simplicity and interpretability, making them well-suited for decision-making tasks, compared to complex neural networks that can be difficult to understand. However, despite their benefits, tree models are not immune to security and privacy concerns. Malicious actors can tamper with tree models or steal intellectual property, posing threats to the integrity and confidentiality of machine learning systems. Further, although there are studies of similar attacks on neural networks, differences between how neural networks and tree models work may affect how well those existing findings apply to tree models. Together, these issues mean there are a number of open questions around enhancing the security and trustworthiness of tree models. This project aims to develop novel strategies to address these questions and develop more robust and trustworthy AI-based systems, and develop both tools and educational opportunities through the work to make the findings widely available and impactful. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project addresses the need for robust model authentication, watermarking for intellectual property tracing, machine unlearning for data privacy, and defense against backdoor attacks for tree models. The technical aims are organized around four tasks: a) Pursuing model identification by embedding unique signatures to generate differently embedded models; b) Developing novel methodologies of robust watermarking for tree models, for the purpose of tracing intellectual property; c) Designing novel algorithms for machine unlearning in tree models by exploiting tree reconstruction, residual-stable split, and combination of tree techniques; and d) Investigating the implications of backdoor attacks against tree models by leveraging the insights from the above tasks on tweaking tree models without significantly impacting the accuracy. These research efforts will contribute to the advancement of tree model security and trustworthiness, ensuring that these models can be reliably deployed in real-world applications while mitigating the risk of malicious attacks, unauthorized access, and privacy breaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our society uses algorithms to solve problems ranging from making investment decisions in personal financial planning, to allocating resources in large-scale computing systems such as data centers. Often, these problems are difficult because of uncertainty about the future. In algorithmic theory, traditionally conservative approaches are used which provide relatively weak but highly robust guarantees that hold no matter how the future unfolds. In practice, a more promising alternative is the use of machine-learning techniques to make algorithmic choices for the future based on knowledge of past data. By implicitly assuming that the future will mirror the past, one can provide stronger guarantees and better empirical performance. However, the ""worst-case"" robustness of the previous approach is not available, which is important if the implicit assumption of 'past predicts the future' no longer holds true. This project seeks to combine the two approaches and get the best of both worlds by exploring the interface between algorithm design and machine learning. The end goal is a comprehensive toolbox for algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty that is both robust and has good performance. In addition to this research component, the project will train graduate and undergraduate researchers in theoretical computer science, with an emphasis on participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The investigators' approach is to rethink each of these individual toolboxes to take advantage of the other -- namely incorporating machine-learned advice in algorithm design, and conversely, training machine learning models for algorithmic objectives. The main intellectual thrust of this project is to use machine-learned predictions to improve the quality of algorithms, and conversely, to design learning models that can be specifically trained for optimization objectives. This will be explored in two main directions: the first part considers Machine Learning as a Black Box. Here, the optimization algorithm merely consumes the predictions from the learning model. This is often the case in practice, particularly when the predictions are generated by complex systems such as deep neural networks. In this case, the focus will be on ensuring that we do not over-fit the predictions, on deciding what input parameters to predict in the first place, and on choosing between multiple alternative prediction models based on their relative accuracy, reliability, and costs. In the second part (Machine Learning as a White Box), the focus is on a more integrated design, where the optimization algorithm interacts with the learning model at runtime and ask adaptives queries. More ambitiously, the project explores a significant redesign of the end-to-end system, including the learning models and the optimization algorithms, for specific optimization tasks. This work will rely on techniques from online algorithms, stochastic and robust optimization, and learning theory, and build connections between these fields to address the central questions of algorithmic decision making under uncertainty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is still very challenging to massively bring heterogeneous drones by many different manufacturers to real-world applications. One main reason is that, whenever a new drone is built, the planning and control algorithms for the drone usually have to be designed very carefully and the actions for the drone to take usually have to be laboriously programmed with considerable tuning effort. To remove, if not lessen, such limitations, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project establishes a novel learning-based framework that equips drones with new capabilities of ""learning from the experience"" of other drones despite their different dynamics and platforms. This approach to design of planning and control of drones will significantly reduce the design, test, evaluation and certification of drones, uniquely and efficiently customized for applications in their operating environment. The integrated research-and-education activities will provide students in the Western New York area with hands-on experience and internship opportunities on drone techniques, toward better preparing the future workforce for the unmanned aerial system industry in the United States.<br/><br/>This project will establish a novel learning-based feedforward control framework and equip drones with new capabilities for learning three particular skills, i.e., (1) how to generate a dynamically feasible trajectory, (2) how to sense and compensate external disturbances, and (3) how to learn from others' learned experience, called ""dynamic learning."" These three skills are crucial for drones to perform complex tasks, and the foundation for understanding of how one robot could efficiently learn from the experiences gathered by other robots with different dynamics. Key to this approach is an architecture that automatically adjusts the original outputs of the baseline planners and controllers by adding feedforward learning signals to improve drone's flight performance. This learning framework is neither to completely replace the existing planning and control methods nor to compete for the highest optimized performance possible but rather to provide an elegant learning mechanism that is highly adaptable and reasonably efficient involving minimal hardware modification and software reconfiguration for commodity drones.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, some structures on the fire path remained unscathed. Current models designed for wildfire spread in wildland-urban-interface (WUI) communities predominantly function at community or larger scales. They fall short in capturing the observations from the Lahaina wildfires, such as specific buildings remaining undamaged amidst extensively destroyed structures. Notably, there exists a group of tools that, in principle, have the capability to simulate fire spread on and between individual structures with high fidelity Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-based (CFD-based) fire models, e.g., the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) developed by NIST and FireFoam developed by FM Global. These tools can potentially be used to both analyze and predict fire spread inside WUI communities and provide deep insights into the resilience of particular structures. However, to date, their application to model fire spread on and between structures in a wildfire has been limited primarily due to the lack of data necessary to correctly set up and validate these high-fidelity models. This project aims to overcome these challenges, enabling more accurate modeling of structure burning and fire spread in WUI settings in the future. This project will also help in training a new generation of researchers in wildfire and WUI fire resilience. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to enhance the WUI fire assessment through compiling a comprehensive dataset that accurately documents how the wildfire spread and impacted the community of Lahaina. It will also assess the feasibility of using high-fidelity CFD-based models to simulate the burning of individual structures in a WUI fire scenario. The comprehensive dataset, pulling from diverse data sources and formats, will be systematically organized, offering a wealth of detailed information in an easily understandable manner. This dataset is crucial for refining WUI fire spread models across all scales, from community-wide fire spread to individual structure response. After the dataset is compiled, high-fidelity CFD models will be set up for two Lahaina structures, one damaged by fire and one undamaged despite being in the path of fire. The aim is to determine if these models can accurately simulate the damage that was observed. By doing so, the project can identify areas where our current understanding and modeling approaches may be lacking or incomplete, guiding the future development of modeling techniques. The dataset and the model feasibility study ultimately will enhance WUI fire risk assessment, driving more informed decision-making in wildfire mitigation strategies. Additionally, both the dataset and the model feasibility study are valuable for broader WUI fire research and practice, including the performance-based design of structures against wildfires using high-fidelity CFD-based models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The annual global loss on cacao due to diseases caused by P. palmivora is at least one billion U.S. dollars. As a very aggressive pathogen, P. palmivora is often capable of infecting almost all plant parts of a host, rendering its control extremely challenging. As a result, it has become an increasing threat to agricultural production and ecosystems. Diseases caused by P. palmivora are managed by frequent application of fungicides with limited success. The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel, effective and environmentally friendly strategies to control P. palmivora based on the fundamental understandings of its infection mechanisms. To this end, the specific objectives of this project are to identify the key pathogenicity factors of P. palmivora, how these factors act on plant cellular components to contribute to disease, and how their presence/absence in a P. palmivora isolate determines which plant species to infect. This project is expected to generate significant foundational knowledge essential for developing desirable disease control measures, thereby significantly contributing to food security, sustainability of natural ecosystems and the bioeconomy. In addition, the project will contribute to STEM workforce sustainability by providing training opportunities to graduate, undergraduate and high school students, and introducing plant pathology and gene-editing technology to middle/high-school teachers to attract a new generation into agriculture and life sciences. <br/><br/>Oomycetes form a distinct phylogenetic lineage of eukaryotes, with many causing devastating diseases of plants and animals. Phytophthora palmivora is a destructive broad-host-range oomycete plant pathogen with host specificity. P. palmivora delivers a diverse array of effectors to manipulate the host cellular processes to facilitate infection, including the superfamily of RxLR effectors that are defined by an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a canonical RxLR (or RxLR-EER) translocation motif that mediates entry into host cells. The P. palmivora RxLR effector designated PpalRxLR1 contains a functional nuclear localization signal with potential DNA-binding activities and was identified as a key pathogenicity factor on cacao. It is present in all examined P. palmivora isolates obtained from cacao infections, but exhibits presence/absence polymorphisms across the species, suggesting that it may be a determinant of host range and specificity. This project is to: 1) determine the mechanisms by which PpalRxLR1 confers pathogenicity on cacao by determining its nuclear-localized molecular interaction dynamics and the subverted host cellular processes during infection, 2) determine the role of PpalRxLR1 as a key component in host range evolution of P. palmivora by analyzing its evolution relative to the species and association with host range, 3) identify additional effectors with key roles in pathogenicity of P. palmivora on specific or a broad range of hosts using the natural variation of P. palmivora isolates. Integrating across specific aims is expected to transform understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity and host range evolution of P. palmivora, key aspects of plant-microbe interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predictive building energy modeling tools (i.e., models as scientific data) and game-based learning methods (i.e., models as play) offer opportunities for examining what-if scenarios at the intersection of building decarbonization and equity, but need to be transformed to this aim. To meet this need, the goal of this CAREER research is to investigate the environmental and equity impacts of building decarbonization retrofits using a novel predictive modeling framework. The education goal is to increase public energy literacy through game-based learning. The outcomes of this research will help accelerate building decarbonization while balancing its benefits and costs across the population. The education activities will improve energy and carbon literacy among a diverse population of youth and young adults.<br/><br/>This research has three specific objectives: (R1) Quantify the benefits and burdens of building decarbonization retrofits by climate and grid region using a novel equity-focused energy modeling approach; (R2) Analyze the interactions between decarbonization retrofits and underlying patterns of energy inequity at the urban scale using urban building energy modeling; and (R3) Determine the benefits and burdens of building decarbonization retrofits under future climate and grid scenarios. This research will advance fundamental understanding of building decarbonization and its impacts on underlying patterns of inequity in the built environment, as well as our capacity to model these impacts.

These unique properties can also be harnessed to develop new technologies that will help us in understanding how the brain works and in overcoming brain-related conditions such as Parkinson?s disease and epilepsy. Furthermore, nanomaterials are increasingly becoming common in everyday life. Although our body's defense system filters out many foreign substances, studies indicate that nanoparticles can still enter the central nervous system through various pathways.  How these tiny particles interact with nerve cells is not well understood; this is a big obstacle to using them widely for recording and stimulating neurons and assessing their impact on the central nervous system. This project has two main goals: (1) to understand how and why certain nanoparticles naturally bind to neurons as they grow and mature; and (2) to determine how this binding affects the electrical properties and activity of neurons. Understanding these interactions could lead to better-designed nanoparticles for studying the brain and new, less invasive technologies for treating nerve-related disorders. This project is an important step in filling in our knowledge gaps and could have a big impact on society by helping us deal with serious nerve-related conditions.  The PIs will continue their ongoing successful recruitment and training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields and will develop a Nano-Neuro Summer School program aimed at middle school students, targeting those from groups underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/><br/>Owing to their optimal dimensions and unique biophysicochemical properties, nanoparticles offer distinct advantages as neural sensors and stimulators. However, the lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms of nano-neuro interactions remains a critical bottleneck in the widespread use of functional nanostructures for recording and stimulating neurons. The primary objective of this project is two-fold: (i) to understand the mechanistic aspects of spontaneous and maturation-dependent binding of nanoparticles to neurons; and (ii) to determine the effect of nanoparticle binding on the electrophysiological properties and electrical activity of neurons. To achieve these goals, the PIs will: (1) investigate the effect of the magnitude of the nanoparticle charge on the maturation-dependent binding of nanoparticles to neurons; (2) explore the effect of the electrophysiological properties and electrical activity of neurons on nanoparticle binding; and (3) elucidate the effect of nanoparticle binding on the excitability of neurons. Successful completion of this project will advance scientific understanding of the nano-neuro interactions and can have a transformative impact on the design and synthesis of nanomaterials for neuroscience and minimally-invasive technologies for treating neuronal disorders. This project can have an important long-term societal benefit in overcoming the burden associated with these devastating neuropathological conditions. The PIs will continue their ongoing successful recruitment and training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields and will develop a Nano-Neuro Summer School program aimed at middle school students, targeting those from groups underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particle crushing occurs in railway ballast, granular fault gouge, high tailing dams, and is also relevant to pile installation and offshore foundation design. Crushing and grinding are essential in mining operations, as well as manufacturing processes in the pharmaceutical, agricultural and food sectors. However, these operations are still highly energy-inefficient. Through this research, the PIs will gain a fundamental understanding of the effect of mineral heterogeneity on particle breakage. Findings will contribute to optimizing particulate material handling in mining operations, deep foundation design and pharmaceutical and agricultural manufacturing techniques. Modeling the evolution of polymineralic aggregate microstructure and mechanical behavior will also serve the deployment of penetrometer devices for in-situ soil characterization and wheeled vehicles for terrestrial and extraterrestrial exploration. Besides their research tasks, the PIs will create multi-semester undergraduate research opportunities and international research experiences for students, and integrate diversity, equity and inclusion training into their scholarly activities in partnership with Georgia Tech organizations. Both PIs are committed to enhance public awareness on the critical role of geotechnical engineering in addressing energy and sustainability challenges.<br/><br/><br/>Most natural geomaterials are polymineralic, and yet, there is no known experimental method that can disentangle the effects of morphology and mineralogy on aggregate crushing. The goal of the project is to unveil the yet-unknown mechanisms of dry polymineralic grain crushing and to enable energy-efficient industrial applications by optimizing dry aggregate breakage. Towards this goal, the PIs will (1) Measure intra- and inter-mineral bonding properties in quartzitic and granitic aggregates; (2) Conduct single-particle crushing tests on monomineralic and polymineralic aggregates; (3) Model fragmentation processes during these tests with the Distinct Element Method (DEM); (4) Image aggregate assemblies during monotonic and cyclic loading by high-resolution X-ray computed tomography; (5) Simulate sequential breakage and fabric evolution in heterogeneous aggregate assemblies with the DEM; (6) Predict self-organization and ultimate fabric by Machine Learning. Several fundamental questions will be addressed, mainly: Can heterogeneous granular assemblies self-organize upon cyclic loading and particle breakage? Do fragments evolve towards an asymptotic size and/or shape upon sequential breakage?

Following a similar trend, the downscaling of photonic devices promises highly efficient photonic ICs. A crucial component in high-performance photonic ICs is an on-chip laser. Such a laser must simultaneously have high efficiency, low energy consumption, robust operation, and a small footprint to be compatible with the rest of the photonic circuitry and even electronic ICs. However, existing on-chip lasers, and photonic devices in general, are sensitive to structural imperfections, which become more prominent as the device becomes smaller. The proposed program will theoretically investigate and experimentally demonstrate compact on-chip III-V lasers that are robust, efficient, and whose single-mode operation range can be tailored. The superior performance of these lasers stems from the fact that the emission is protected by the bulk topology of the cavity. The devices developed in this program will lead to a family of topologically protected lasers that satisfies several requirements of the next-generation lasers for photonic ICs, which will advance electronic-photonic integration, as well as applications such as data communication, signal processing, sensing, and quantum photonics. The educational portion of the program aims to increase public awareness of photonics, pipeline qualified students to help advance the U.S. photonics industry and expand the American workforce in photonics.<br/><br/>Robust and efficient on-chip light generation and transport are at the heart of modern chip-scale optical communication and information processing technologies, leading to the search for the next generation of on-chip lasers. In this collaborative research, miniature on-chip lasers that overcome fundamental challenges in miniature lasers ? the simultaneous achievement of robust operation and a small footprint ? will be realized. These lasers feature 1) robust operation: the laser emission is protected by the topology of the bulk rather than the emitting site itself; 2) small footprint: the laser is realized in 1D rather than the typical 2D; 3) large and tailorable single-mode lasing range, and 4) compatibility with existing photonic IC technologies: a synthetic rather than an actual magnetic field is used to support the non-trivial bulk topology.<br/>The success of this research will determine a suitable light source candidate for densely packed photonic ICs, and lead to not only fully functional photonic ICs but also the connectivity between the photonic ?plane? and electronic ?plane? in multi-functional adaptive photonic/electronic integrated systems. From the fundamental perspective, the topologically protected lasers developed in this project not only can be used to probe the multi-dimensional topological phase diagram of non-Hermitian systems but will also allow the exploration of other exotic phases of topological photonic devices beyond photonic topological insulators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Technologies that are central to this - subsurface remediation, geothermal energy systems, batteries, fracking, etc. - are governed by complicated flow through porous media, which is not currently well understood. A porous medium has multiple, convoluted pathways of various sizes for fluid flow through an otherwise solid material. The flows can be single phase (liquid/gas) or multiphase, and can occur at constant temperature or with heat transfer. The flow can occur in a single direction, or oscillate. When all of these are combined, nonlinear effects can result, which could improve the behavior of a system or negatively impact performance, depending on how the effects are propagated and understood. The major objective of this work is to experimentally study oscillating and multiphase flows in porous media, and then develop a numerical approach that can be used to gain further insight into the fundamental behavior, thereby improving energy efficiency, and lowering both economic costs and environmental impacts. Although porous media flow sounds esoteric, it occurs in many daily applications (brewing coffee, etc.). Therefore, this project is well suited for pre-college outreach, and several topics related to it will be used to engage underrepresented students from K-12 classrooms. In addition, this project will promote STEM education via an inter-college educational collaboration for undergraduate design projects, and demonstration units about porous media flows will be created for pre-college classrooms.<br/><br/>This research will combine experimental and numerical techniques to describe the effects of the physical porous structure, the flow/heat transfer boundary layer (including a comparison between oscillation and non-oscillation) and the variations in wettability from materials and manufacturing process. Experimentally, naturally-occurring and engineered porous media will be scanned, analyzed, and catalogued in a database, and an experimental platform will also be designed and developed to study in situ oscillating and multiphase transport phenomena inside porous media using the Neutron Imaging Facility at Oak Ridge National Lab. This experimental work will be coupled with numerical simulations through parallel development of a multiphase discrete Boltzmann method model and a hybrid discrete/lattice Boltzmann method model to capture kinetic behaviors and multiscale interactions, in order to elucidate the fundamental behavior of oscillating multiphase thermofluidic phenomena and fluid-solid interactions. The knowledge developed in this project will, in turn, be used to improve the design of porous structures in a variety of energy applications, including thermal storage in concentrated solar power plants, carbon retention in rock structures, and fuel cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communication issues have been broadly recognized as a critical factor that impacts design outcomes in team decisions, because the information shared during communication can be incomplete and imperfect. Therefore, addressing such issues by understanding the role of information uncertainty on human design decisions in teams could lead to better coordination of team decisions, advancement in human-AI collaborations, and significant cost savings in large-scale engineering design projects. However, despite the significant progress in modeling design decision-making in teams, current literature neglects two fundamental aspects of the design process: human designers have bounded rationality, and most design activities happen under competition, whether consciously or unconsciously. This project is motivated to fill this gap by developing theoretical and experimental constructs to computationally model human designers? sequential decisions in a competitive environment and to experimentally measure their bounded rationality. The expected outcome is a suite of new knowledge, including metrics, models, algorithms, and testbeds, on human behavior in design teams under competition in the presence of uncertainties. Broader impacts will be generated by directly engaging diverse undergraduate students in research activities through the Freshman Introduction to Research in Engineering (FIRE) program at the University of Texas at Austin and the Pinnacle and Clark Scholars programs at Stevens Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>This project is driven by answering two research questions: 1) what are the effects of information uncertainty (e.g., when design information shared between team members is incomplete) on design rationality under competition among teams? 2) How would such effects differ across a wider range of team sizes? To answer the two questions, an interdisciplinary research approach is planned that combines descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics. In particular, we will develop game theoretic models to model sequential design decisions under competition, synergistically integrating two types of sequential learning models, i.e., theory-driven prescriptive models (e.g., Bayesian optimization) and data-driven predictive models (e.g., long-short term memory units). The new approach explicitly models designers? perceptions of their opponents? past performance and predicts the opponent?s future decisions, thereby providing a quantitative way to study the influence of uncertain information shared among designers in a team on their decisions in competition against other teams. Experiments will be conducted to collect behavioral data to study how human irrationality, benchmarking on rational behaviors predicted by the theoretical models, would change over time during the course of the design competition. The research findings will be validated in a real-world design challenge on solar system design, where multiple teams compete for awards. To benefit a broader research community, this project will build an open design infrastructure to share the project data and findings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will advance our current understanding of the combined role of social and hydrological dynamics on post-hurricane recovery of freshwater resources on small sub-tropical islands. A group of U.S. students from diverse backgrounds will work closely with mentors and students from the University of the Bahamas, Grand Bahama Utility Company, the Bahamian Forestry Unit, and faculty from four US Universities (California State University, Sacramento, University of Wyoming, Oberlin College, and Rutgers University), comprising a diverse, interdisciplinary team of social scientists, hydrologists, soil scientists, and plant experts. Students will learn how to study local, global, and intercultural issues, understand and appreciate different perspectives, and interact with individuals from different cultures and backgrounds. The experiences gained through this international collaboration will be key to student's future success in an increasingly global economy, and will further the development of a diverse, globally competitive workforce, able to address cross-cutting challenges in socio-hydrology. This project will also have a positive impact on students from the host Institution, gaining research experiences and training that they would otherwise not have access to. Beyond the impacts on students, local water management authorities will benefit from the generation of new data and modeling tools and the project will help inform local communities about climate and social challenges and their role on the sustainability and resilience of their water resources, which is anticipated to increase their involvement and level of adaptation to climate change mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>Despite the recognized importance of socio-hydrology in increasing our understanding of the interactions between water and human systems, interdisciplinary student training addressing the cross-cutting nature of socio-hydrology is not common. This project will investigate the importance of socio-hydrological dynamics on post-hurricane recovery of freshwater resources of small sub-tropical islands by collecting, integrating, and analyzing unique information on the social and hydrological processes that are identified as the main drivers of post-hurricane recovery of water resources in Grand Bahama. Our research will generate new data and knowledge on the relative importance and compound role of social and hydrological factors and will ultimately contribute to increased water resources sustainability and resilience of small islands under a changing climate. Students will participate in field campaigns to collect groundwater and soil salinity, groundwater levels and soil moisture data on various locations on the island. In addition, infiltration experiments will be conducted to assess salt build-up on the soil and its impact on the infiltration capacity of the soil. The above data will be used to improve the calibration and validation of an existing island scale model groundwater flow and salt transport modeling. This model will simulate FWL recovery under various recharge scenarios based on climatic projections. Soil salinity data will also be used to assess the loss in plant/forest biodiversity and changes in forest structure post-hurricane. Sociological investigations of community member?s perceptions on water management in Grand Bahama will also be conducted through focus groups and interviews. In addition to individual projects, the international research opportunity will culminate in an annual interdisciplinary research project that provides insights into the socio-hydrological dynamics of FWL recovery after storm induced salinization events. Students will present their research findings at an annual project Virtual Symposium, communicate their research beyond the program through outreach projects and scientific publications and gain important writing and presentation skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is widely recognized that current agricultural technologies, from crop genetic improvement to field crop production, will not meet future agricultural demands, due to their heavy reliance on expensive, time-consuming, trail and error field trials to develop improved plant breeds. Emerging mathematical optimization and machine learning methods for analyzing high-dimensional data provide opportunities to speed up plant breeding to achieve rapid and efficient adaptation of crops to changing environments. The approaches in this project will take advantage of engineering techniques that have been used to remarkably improve the efficiency and resiliency of communication, manufacturing, transportation and energy systems.

This award supports fundamental research to explore the mechanisms underlying transformation superplasticity and uncover new methods of manufacturing ESOs. These materials show promise as supercapacitors, battery cathodes, catalysts, and electrolytes, which impacts U.S. industry and economy.

ESOs display a reversible phase transformation behavior when heat treated within a particular temperature window. This phase transformation manifests as a controllable phase heterogeneity, giving unprecedented control over the microstructure of ESOs. Such a dramatic transformation could be leveraged to enhance ductility during high temperature deformation, allowing for efficient forming through transformation superplasticity and cyclic deformation. Transformation superplasticity allows for mechanical deformation of more than 100% due to the internal strain that arises from the mismatch between co-existing phases, which can accumulate during thermal cycling. The research involves the following tasks: 1) synthesis and consolidation of bulk ESO samples with different grain sizes; 2) heat treatment to achieve the desired phase state (amount and composition of the secondary phase(s)); 3) high temperature deformation and superplastic forming; and 4) evaluation of microstructure and properties. Experiments are complemented with theoretical modeling to analyze the influence of grain size, applied stress, pressure, strain rate and temperature on diffusion, and consequently deformation mechanisms and superplasticity.

Further, such microservices are managed by cloud-native systems automatically, liberating cloud users from onerous operations of their in-cloud applications. Unfortunately, systems software that underpins cloud-native systems, such as virtualization, faces critical challenges to meeting the stringent needs of emerging microservices-based cloud applications, such as strong-yet-lightweight isolation, fast inter-microservice communication, and fine-grained elasticity control.

Due to its large capacity and low energy footprint compared to traditional volatile memory, non-volatile memory has long been envisioned as an ideal solution for building large-scale, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and recoverable applications in many critical domains, including high-performance computing, machine learning, and embedded systems. Although non-volatile memory is available as commercial memory chips and offers numerous promises, it has not yet been widely adopted in production systems. The major obstacle is the difficulty to ensure that data is timely and correctly written to non-volatile memory, allowing it to be restored to a consistent state after a crash. Currently, application developers carry the burden of porting legacy applications to non-volatile memory, which is tedious and error-prone. This project seeks to establish a generic framework for user-transparent persistence and crash consistency that allows unmodified legacy applications to run efficiently and correctly with non-volatile memory. The success of this project will help unleash the full potential of non-volatile memory and make it easier to adopt. The research will also provide valuable insights into data management in future hybrid, disaggregated memory systems. In addition, this project involves mentoring Ph.D. students, engaging minority students, course development, and K12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project integrates non-volatile memory into the page/buffer cache in memory management ? i.e., an abstraction that bridges the view of byte-addressable memory and a backing memory device -- to provide persistence and crash consistency to user-space programs with no or little user involvement. The challenges lie in 1) how to intercept program updates and redirect them to non-volatile memory for persistence; 2) how to properly order the updates and ensure update atomicity to guarantee crash consistency; 3) how to efficiently integrate non-volatile memory into page/buffer cache management without incurring noticeable overhead or performance degradation. This project addresses these challenges by focusing on persisting three types of program data ? file-backed data, dynamically allocated application memory, and program metadata for virtual memory management, such as page tables, and exploring various software and hardware techniques, such as copy-on-write, undo logging, shadow paging, and extended page tables, for each data type to achieve efficient crash consistency. This project advances the understanding of hybrid memory management for volatile and non-volatile memories while simultaneously achieving high usability, good backward compatibility, and high efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to deepen understanding of these mathematical structures. The first part of the research concentrates on the study of three-manifolds obtained from links via the so-called ""Dehn surgery"" operation and the family of links appearing in algebraic geometry. Results are anticipated to advance the understanding of the complexity of three-manifolds and algebraic singularities in algebraic geometry. It will also provide topics that are suitable for undergraduate students' research. The second part of the research focuses on the topology, geometry, and dynamics of hyperbolic manifolds, which are important examples of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, negatively curved Hadamard manifolds, and symmetric spaces of non-compact type.<br/><br/>The research consists of four specific projects about links and hyperbolic manifolds. The first aims to understand the possible obstructions for surgeries on 2-component links in the three-sphere. It focuses on the possibility of finding an infinite family of integer homology spheres that cannot be obtained by surgeries on 2-component links in the three-sphere. The second project is to understand the link Floer chain complex of algebraic links coming from the singularities of algebraic curves in the complex plane and provide potential applications in low dimensional topology. The third project is to study discrete isometry subgroups acting on hyperbolic spaces with small critical exponents and generalize the structure theorem for hyperbolic manifolds to negatively curved Hadamard manifolds. The fourth project concerns a counting question in hyperbolic manifolds, with the goal of determining whether the classical Bowen-Margulis measure and the spectral gap converge for a strongly convergent sequence of hyperbolic manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The system developed will prevent cyber threats such as impersonation, fraud, social engineering attacks, and the submission of falsified evidence, thus safeguarding individuals, organizations, and the legal system. The proposed project has the potential to  protect against cyber harassment, privacy invasion, and prevent the dissemination of false information by identifying harmful or misleading audio and video deepfake content. It will have a significant impact in a number of areas, including the media, politics, business, and social networks, by maintaining the integrity of digital multimedia. If digital forgeries are left unchecked, trust in the courts, the media and the government will necessarily erode, and as deepfakes and other forged multimedia become more prevalent it will become imperative to have a trustworthy source of truth to assist these entities with the identification of fakes. Finally, the project has the potential to drive innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision, leading to the development of more robust deepfake detection methods.<br/><br/>The proposed project attacks the rising problem of forged multimedia in the legal system by offering the development of a trustworthy, AI-based, Deep Forgery Detector (DFD). It has a sound foundation in Neuro-symbolic AI, combining deep models with a symbolic approach in order to enable abstracting, reasoning, and explainability. The DFD will also enable single and multimodal data authenticity analysis to identify any tampering, or manipulation, such as fully or partially AI generated content. Additionally, the DFD?s hybrid nature, with its anomaly-detection and signature-based approach, will help to detect both known and unknown forgeries, further improving its generalizability.

This ability is critically important in order to learn and interact socially with others. In particular, visual attention to social stimuli (i.e., social attention) plays a vital role in guiding social behaviors. Impaired social attention underlies many psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as autism and ADHD. However, very little is known about human visual attention at the single-neuron level. The goal of this CAREER project is to understand the underlying neural processes involved in human social attention using technology that provides the highest degree of spatial resolution (location of brain activity) and temporal resolution (timing of brain activity) currently available. The investigators will collaborate with neurosurgeons and record directly from neurons in the human brain, as patients undergo treatment of epilepsy. These neurons reside in brain regions involved in attention, decision making, or processing of socially relevant images. The research will elucidate how single neurons, within specific brain regions, contribute to visual attention. Results will provide novel insight into how these processes differ in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This study will contribute to teaching materials and outreach to clinical communities. The data acquired and analysis tools developed will be made freely available to other researchers in order to advance science in the field of cognitive neuroscience research and human neural recordings.<br/><br/>The research team will investigate the neural circuits of social attention in humans for both goal-driven attention (Aim 1) and stimulus-driven attention (Aim 2). The research will: (1) characterize social attention signals in the medial temporal lobe (amygdala and hippocampus) and prefrontal cortex (in particular the orbitofrontal cortex); (2) analyze attention signals from different brain regions using comprehensive functional connectivity analysis; and (3) compare neural mechanisms for goal-driven vs. stimulus-driven attention. Together, with the unique human single-neuron recordings, the research will address important fundamental neuroscience questions by providing comprehensive analysis of the neural circuits underlying social attention in humans. The outcomes of this research are important to understand the neural mechanisms of impaired visual attention in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders and will be informative for development of future targeted intervention strategies. This research will also integrate undergraduate education and generate tools and methods to enable new research groups to conduct state-of-the-art human single-neuron recordings.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cognitive Neuroscience Program and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary studies indicate that groundwater may supply both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and iron in this region. In coastal ecosystems like the West Florida Shelf that have very low nitrate and ammonium concentrations, DON is the main form of nitrogen available to organisms. Nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by iron availability because iron is essential for both photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation. This study will investigate the sources and composition of DON and iron, and their influence on the coastal ecosystem. The team will sample offshore groundwater wells, river and estuarine waters, and conduct two expeditions across the West Florida Shelf in winter and summer. Investigators will participate in K-12 and outreach activities to increase awareness of the project and related science. The project will fund the work of six graduate and eight undergraduate students across five institutions, furthering NSF?s goals of education and training. <br/><br/>Motivated by preliminary observations of unexplained, tightly-correlated DON and dissolved iron concentrations across the West Florida Shelf (WFS), the proposed work will quantify the flux and isotopic signatures of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-derived DON and iron to the WFS, and evaluate the bioavailability of this temporally-variable source using four seasonal near-shore campaigns sampling offshore groundwater wells, estuarine, and riverine endmembers and two cross-shelf cruises. The work will evaluate whether SGD stimulates nitrogen fixation on the WFS, and the potential for the stimulated nitrogen fixation to further modify the chemistry of DON and dissolved iron in the region. The cross-shelf cruises will investigate hypothesized periods of maximum SGD and Trichodesmium abundance (June), and reduced river discharge and SGD (February), thus comparing two distinct biogeochemical regimes. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of DON and dissolved iron, molecular composition of DON, and the concentration and composition of iron-binding ligands will be characterized. Nitrogen fixation rates and Trichodesmium spp. abundance and expression of iron stress genes will be measured. Fluxes of DON and iron from SGD and rivers will be quantified with radium isotope mass balances. The impacts of SGD on nitrogen fixation and DON/ligand production will be constrained with incubations of natural phytoplankton communities with submarine groundwater amendments. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) SGD is the dominant source of bioavailable DON and dissolved iron on the WFS, and 2) SGD-alleviation of iron stress changes the dominant Trichodesmium species on the WFS, increases nitrogen fixation rates and modifies DON and iron composition. Overall, the work will establish connections between marine nitrogen and iron cycling and evaluate the potential for coastal inputs to modify water along the WFS before export to the Atlantic Ocean. This study will thus provide a framework to consider these boundary fluxes in oligotrophic coastal systems and the relative importance of rivers and SGD as sources of nitrogen and iron in other analogous locations, such as coastal systems in Australia, India, and Africa, where nitrogen fixation and SGD have also been documented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use the tools of mathematical logic (and computability theory in particular) to study the way that information can be coded into mathematical structures of the types that arise in all areas of mathematics. The general paradigm is that information is encoded into a mathematical structure if it can always be recovered in an intrinsic way from the structure, without artifacts from the way that the structure is presented. For the simplest kinds of information, like a string of 0's and 1's, the situation is well-understood. But for more complex kinds of information, the situation is much less well-understood and there are many interesting phenomena to explore. Understanding the coding of information will help us understand both the nature of information and the ability of structures of various kinds to code information. This, in turn, informs and guides the mathematical practice of other mathematicians. This project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students and outreach to high schools.<br/><br/>More formally, we say that a piece of information A is coded in a structure B if from every copy of the structure, we can recover in a computable way a copy of the information A. For example if B is a countably infinite group then a copy of B is a Cayley table for the group, noting that for an infinite group there are many different Cayley tables obtained by listing the elements of the group in different orders. By a piece of information we mean, in order of increasing complexity, a binary string (or subset of the natural numbers), an infinite family of binary strings, an infinite tree, or some other structure. For the first case of a binary string, there is a good structural characterisation of when a structure codes a binary string; one can interpret this as saying that there is always a good reason for a binary string to be coded by a structure. This is not the case for any more of the more complicated types of information; it seems that there are structures which happen to code information, but there is no good structural reason as to why. This project aims to explore these phenomena and push them to their limit with one aim being to give new tools to attack difficult open problems on degree spectra which have been resistant to current techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the day, plants and other photosynthetic organisms use solar energy to fix carbon dioxide and store excess carbon as carbon polymers such as starch or glycogen. At night, these storage carbons are broken down as the energy source for dark survival. The dark-to-light transition represents a universal environmental stress for photosynthetic lifeforms. For example, many metabolites necessary for photosynthetic reactions upon light exposure are limited or depleted due to metabolic reactions conducted in dark. It is important for photosynthetic organisms to have a mechanism in place to cope with this stress and ensure healthy photosynthetic performance upon exposure to light. How photosynthetic organisms achieve this dark-to-light transitions remains unclear. This research project applies cutting-edge biochemical and systems biology approaches to dissect the molecular mechanisms that allow this dark to light transition to occur in a model photosynthetic blue green alga. Knowledge gained from this research will how storage polymers like glycogen pave the way for carbon dioxide fixation to occur during the dark to light transition and eventually lead to ways to improve photosynthetic efficiency for crop productions. The research project also provides training opportunities for one postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student, and several undergraduate students. Components of this research are also integrated in a cluster education program as well as in the form of a special topics course on Synthetic Biology to broaden the training opportunity and strengthen scientific literacy for both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Cyanobacteria experience drastic metabolic changes under daily light/dark cycles. The smooth metabolic transition from dark to light is crucial for healthy photosynthetic performance and the overall fitness of phototrophs. It is known that glycogen metabolism is involved in supporting the initiation of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle reactions during dark-to-light transitions in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. However, the molecular mechanisms of how glycogen metabolism supports photosynthesis are not clear. This project applies proteomics, metabolomics, metabolic flux analysis, and photochemical analyses to characterize the coping mechanism of cyanobacteria for the dark-to-light transition stress. The research activities will illustrate the status of a stalled CBB cycle, and understand how glycogen metabolism helps replenish and restart carbon fixation reactions, as well as protecting Photosystem I from photoinhibition during dark-to-light transitions. Discoveries from the research will significantly advance the understanding on a fundamental mechanism employed by photosynthetic lifeforms to cope with the dark-to-light transition stress and further our knowledge on energy balance between photosynthetic light reactions and carbon fixation.

Despite recent advancements, today?s vision sensors remain quite primitive when compared to the superior ability of human visual perception. Moreover, the rapid development of deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has unleashed a new wave of machine vision, where increasing amounts of image data are generated and consumed, not by humans, but by edge devices to perform intelligent tasks such as classification, recognition, and perception. Inspired by the biological system and motivated by the huge demand of machine vision, this project investigates an integrated and holistic approach to building versatile vision systems that can be tailored for domain-specific tasks. It aims to create a vertically-integrated design stack for vision sensors across optics, image sensors, and vision processors. The project is expected to herald a new paradigm of AI-driven vision systems and demonstrate technology to address pivotal engineering challenges from real-time visual adaptivity in self-driving cars to near-zero energy efficiency in persistent environmental monitoring. In addition, the project?s education and workforce development activities foster an open-source hardware community to boost accessibility and deepen collaboration beyond the traditional discipline divides, as well as to build up the capacity of domestic talents in vision sensor industry, critical to national security and supply chain safety. <br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to create the scientific and engineering foundations for a novel machine vision system that explores the hybrid integration of nanophotonic metamaterials and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits and synergistically leverages the intrinsic computing capability of computational metasurface and analog-domain encoder embedded inside the image sensors. Our principled approach to abstracting design knobs and modeling interactions and tradeoffs across the system layers and physical domains will inform future ?More than Moore? multi-physics semiconductor device integration.

With the size of the systems of interacting particles or waves being large, a deterministic description of their behavior is not feasible, and it is necessary to resort, via a branch of mathematics called kinetic theory, to an averaging description.

This project will expand this program to include: the derivation and analysis of kinetic equations for phenomena not covered by Boltzmann equation, for instance multiple particle interactions in non-ideal gases or mixture of gases, the derivation of wave kinetic equations in the inhomogeneous setting, as well addressing the question of local and global well-posedness in wave turbulence theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the scientific community is proposing millions of scientific software prototypes to enable reproducibility of research results in almost every domain. Scientists may frequently introduce security and quality issues into existing scientific software via their code changes due to their limited experience in software quality and security and the lack of tools for quality and security assessments that can be easily used and integrated in programming environments. Thus, several existing scientific software projects are difficult to 1) extend by scientists due to their poor quality and 2) deploy by industry due to the likelihood of security vulnerabilities and the bad development practices used. Without a unified and easy-to-integrate framework for detecting, fixing, and documenting vulnerability and quality issues in scientific projects, the reusability, extendibility, safe deployment, and technology transfer of scientific projects will remain limited. This project builds a sustainable, community-driven software security and quality analysis framework. These tools enable more scientists to build better software and to transfer their prototypes to industry by following the best software development practices. Its integrated education plan will bring undergraduate and graduate computer science students more awareness and expertise in the evolution of software systems, including security and quality issues.<br/><br/>This project develops a framework for detecting, fixing, and documenting security and quality issues. It will continuously monitor the software repository to identify security vulnerabilities and quality issues based on static and dynamic analyses, and then find the best sequence of code changes to prioritize and fix them. The developers can review the recommendations and their impacts in a detailed report and select the code changes that they want to apply. The framework includes a visualization support of the quality and security changes over the evolution of the project. Furthermore, non-expert programmers from the scientific community can use the automatically generated documentation by the framework to understand the severity of the detected issues and necessary code changes to fix them. The project has the potential to revolutionize how developers monitor the evolution of their systems in continuous integration environments by unifying security and quality issues detection and correction and enabling their automated documentation.

Accordingly, the goal of this project is to design the Multimedia Streaming Cloud (MSC) platform with high-level management abstractions that can reap the benefits of the continuum while hiding the complexity of working with it. MSC promotes the Function-as-a-Service computing paradigm and offers the Object-as-a-Service (OaaS) abstraction as a first-class citizen to represent various streaming sources, hence, relieving the users and developers from both the resource and data management difficulties. OaaS enables flexible migration of the objects across the continuum and accelerates the development of streaming services too. Preserving the object's state facilitates seamless object migration, hence, elasticity and mobility of objects across the edge-to-cloud continuum are achieved. MSC offers cost-efficient and robust QoS to each streaming object via smart task management and resource allocation methods operating on heterogeneous cloud resources. An open-source prototype of the MSC platform is developed and tested via recording devices, a local edge computing system, and a public cloud to assess its usability and robustness. <br/><br/>The MSC platform democratizes multimedia streaming and lays the foundation for the next generation applications operating based on multimedia streaming. MSC will pave the way for stream providers to become solution-oriented and let them focus on developing advanced streaming services and integrate them to their applications. The project results will impact not only the forefront of scientific discovery, but also benefit the society by offering flexible and robust streaming services across various applications.

Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, generally favor a brittle behavior, which reduces mechanical stability of the electronics, photonics, and energy storage devices built with them. Two-dimensional high entropy materials are expected to possess substantially better fracture toughness owing to a greater asymmetry at the atomic level. Thus, this project supports fundamental research to synthesize monolayer and multiplayer two-dimensional high entropy materials, conduct experiments in electron microscopes to visualize fracture, and theoretically reproduce the experimentally observed behaviors. Insights from this study will broaden the family of two-dimensional materials and advance the understanding of the effect of defects and other factors on their mechanical properties and behaviors. With higher fracture toughness, two-dimensional high entropy materials could potentially replace or be integrated with existing materials to produce high lifecycle nanoscale devices. As part of the project, an integrated research and education program will strive for societal impacts through classroom/online education, knowledge dissemination, engineering training, and outreach activities. Research opportunities will be afforded to both graduate and undergraduate students, specially underrepresented minority students. Outreach activities will target K-12 students and, uniquely, homeschoolers to motivate them towards STEM education. <br/><br/>Confined to two-dimensional geometry, cracks generally lead to brittle behavior with minimum plasticity at room temperature, which forms the basis of the dilemma of mutually exclusive fracture toughness and mechanical strength performance in bulk materials. This research aims to investigate asymmetrical fracture of two-dimensional high entropy materials, where bifurcations, branches, and deflections emerge due to asymmetric edge elastic properties at the crack tip and edge swapping during crack propagation, thus, significantly increasing the fracture resistance. Various two-dimensional high entropy materials will be synthesized via solid state reaction and chemical vapor deposition methods. In situ tensile tests in SEM and TEM will be conducted to visualize the deformation and fracture evolution amid various microstructural defects and features, such as the competing ternary and quaternary phases. A multiscale modeling framework based on DFT calculations, data-driven MD simulations, and phase field modeling will be used to simulate fracture behavior with focus on crack initiation and propagation. Ultimately, the project will advance the understanding of the effect of lattice distortion, defects, strain rate, and crack geometry as well as composition on the mechanical behavior of two-dimensional high entropy materials.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The advantage of the technologies is the capability of manipulating an object in accordance with the task requirements and the perceived object properties including shapes and materials. This project has great potential to benefit numerous industries by improving productivity, deskilling robot programming, simplifying robot planning, and lowering the technical boundaries. This project will support the national strategy in bringing manufacturing back to the US while benefiting many industries and increasing their economic competitiveness. <br/><br/>The project will establish a holistic framework of Context-Aware Task-Oriented Manipulation (CATOM) to address three cornerstone challenges in dexterous manipulation: object affordance perception, dexterity modeling, and manipulation planning and learning. An object affordance refers to actions that match with the physical properties of an object, such as shapes, mass, and friction. The object affordances are obtained from object characteristics measured by multimodal sensors. For this purpose, a knowledge-driven model will be designed, which fuses heterogenous sensing and incorporates human experience. The object affordances will be represented by potential contacts under each grasp taxonomy. A topology-based modeling method will be used to align potential hand postures with the contacts for a proper grasp. With the topology-based modeling, a complex task will be represented as a spatial-temporal sequence of hand topologies and operations.

To do this, the project team will develop novel methods of simulating users' behavior based on large-scale historical datasets.  These methods will be used to better understand vulnerabilities that underlying biases in training datasets pose to commonly-used machine learning-based methods for building and testing recommender systems, as well as characterize the effectiveness of common evaluation metrics such as recommendation accuracy and diversity given different models of how people interact with recommender systems in practice.  The team will publicly release its datasets, software, and novel metrics for the benefit of other researchers and developers of recommender systems.

They will calibrate these simulations by comparing with existing data sets covering books, research papers, music, and movies.  These models and datasets will help drive the second main project around measuring the impact of feature distributions in training data on recommender algorithm accuracy and diversity, while developing bias-resistant algorithms.

This project will overcome this limitation by developing an instrument that will provide thick-sample imaging with high resolution. This project will integrate research and education to stimulate interest in Optical Engineering, providing students with a unique set of skills for succeeding in their professional careers. Optical Engineering is the field of study that focuses on the development and application of optics and photonics, including instrumentation. In this project, five educational activities are focused on transferring the knowledge of Optical Engineering. These educational activities include the following: (1) an online Optical Engineering Certificate; (2) a Summer Workshop in Advanced Optical Microscopic Techniques; (3) the creation of a STEM club in Lausanne Collegiate School so high-school students can develop science projects that are generally not possible in science classrooms; (4) a partnership with the Pink Palace Museum to expose the public to optics and microscopy; and (5) summer internships to undergraduate students, exposing them to research activities and new career paths. This project has several broader impacts. The most important broader impact is the enhancement of the imaging infrastructure for biological research and expanding our knowledge of cell behavior. Another significant broader impact is the increase in career opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. During this project, the PI will create research, education, and scientific outreach videos using the YouTube platform. These videos will provide hands-on demonstrations of building imaging systems and the use of optical tools to align them. Students involved in this project will participate in these videos, allowing them to develop a deeper understanding of the topic and improving their communication skills. The videos will be available in English and Spanish audio to support the educational growth of Hispanic students across the United States.<br/><br/>Available methods of light microscopy do not enable three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR) imaging of thick (>50 ?m) biological samples without staining. This limitation results in a significant gap in our understanding of dynamic changes occurring in the 3D cell-shape and behavior of unstained specimens. This project will enable biological investigators to advance their knowledge of a large number of biological questions relating to cell growth and dynamics as well as for investigating cell behavior in thick tissue slices. The intellectual merit of the proposed imaging system includes novel advances in hardware and computational methods. The evaluation of the proposed system will be performed using calibrated manufactured objects and relevant biological specimens including human neuroblastoma cells, primary murine stem cells, and murine blastocysts.

This project will implement an integrated experimental and modeling strategy to address this objective. The identification of the mechanisms governing plastic strain recovery will raise the possibility of designing metal components that may recover after being deformed or dented. This fundamental knowledge will be used to develop predictive tools, which will facilitate the accurate prognosis of life to mitigate premature failures. There is a wide range of applications such as gas turbines and tribological coatings among others that can benefit from these developments. In addition, the project will provide an integrated training platform for the future and diverse workforce via the education of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of computational mechanics and microscopy. A particularly interesting ativity in this regard is the partnership with a local community college, whose students will be able to apply for 8-week long research internships.<br/><br/>The deformation behavior of nanocrystalline metals substantially differs from that of coarse-grained metals. One such unique behavior is the ability of nanocrystalline metals to recover plastic strain. This phenomenon is quite unusual since plastic deformation in metals is considered permanent after unloading. The critical micromechanical driving forces are not clear however and remain a subject of conjecture. As a result, a microstructure-sensitive predictive modeling framework also remains elusive. Specific objectives of this work are to: (1) identify the influence of mismatch in elastic response of nano-sized grains on plastic strain recovery; (2) elucidate the influence of texture on the residual stresses; (3) identify the connection between grain boundary sliding and strain compatibility; and (4) identify the influence of grain boundary sliding on the residual stress gradients. An integrated experimental-modeling plan is put in place to achieve these objectives that includes extensive in-situ testing and characterization using advanced microscopy techniques, such as the scanning transmission electron microscopy, and sophisticated elastoplastic phase field modeling method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When life moved out of the ocean, surviving environments with limited water became a necessity. One approach to survive this new extreme, that is present across all kingdoms of life, is to dry out, or desiccate, while waiting for water to return. Tolerating desiccation requires coordination across cells, tissues, and organisms, but the details of how this happens are unknown. The Water and Life Interface Institute (WALII) Biology Integration Institute will fill in these gaps using fungi, plants, and animals with low and high desiccation tolerance. The long-term goals of this Institute are understanding how organisms tolerate desiccation, inventing technologies, and concepts for working in low-water environments, engineering proteins, cells, and organisms to increase desiccation tolerance, and building a national community of desiccation scientists. Research at WALII will impact society by finding new, desiccation-tolerance-based strategies for crop loss prevention, developing dry storage solutions for storing medicines currently stored cold, and mitigating ongoing decreases in species diversity. Establishing a national, integrated research community requires an expert, multidisciplinary workforce, and integration with the public. To that end, the WALII training programs will support career development for over 100 scientists from diverse backgrounds at all career stages, and its outreach initiatives will invite the public to join WALII?s scientists in desiccation tolerance experiments.<br/><br/>Concepts and tools in life sciences have been made primarily in the context of fully hydrated systems. WALII will study the interaction of life and water across timescales and hydration states in diverse organisms, using four intertwined themes: 1) Physical and molecular determinants of desiccation tolerance; 2) Molecular and cellular rehydration responses across the continuum of desiccation sensitivity; 3) The role(s) of intrinsically disordered proteins in conferring desiccation tolerance; and 4) Short- and long-term evolutionary histories of desiccation tolerance. The multiscale, transdisciplinary studies of anhydrobiosis at WALII aim to ignite a transformative new field of solid-state biology, focused first on modeling function and dysfunction of biomolecules, cells, tissues, and organisms under desiccation stress. New methods and approaches will be essential, including better protocols for seedbank preservation and stabilizing plant sexual reproduction, better water-resistant materials and water-retention strategies, and sensitive in vivo tools for sensing and manipulating cellular responses to desiccation. WALII combines the expertise of researchers from several disciplines such as biophysics, cell biology, computational biology, desiccation tolerance, evolutionary biology, ecology, genetics, and plant, animal, seed, fungal, and pollen physiology and diverse organizations such as non-profit research institutes, universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Primarily Undergraduate Institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By 2025, the total amount of digital data will reach 175 Zettabytes. It becomes a critical and increasing challenge to manage this huge amount of data. The demand for high-performance and large-capacity storage systems is rapidly increased to cover this big data environment; still, it is a critical challenge to satisfy both high performance and large capacity in a single storage device with a low cost. To achieve this goal, an emerging storage device named hybrid/convertible Solid-State Drive (SSD) provides unique properties compared to traditional storage devices and can satisfy the requirement in such an environment. However, the emerging device has not been fully investigated and cannot reach its full potential. This project aims to fully explore the abilities of hybrid/convertible SSDs. The completion of this project will initialize a paradigm shift in today?s storage systems to handle massive amounts of data more efficiently with high capacity and high-speed access. The research will also impact the burgeoning storage market, implement outreach to K-12, undergraduate, and minority students, and incorporate research results into courses, thus enhancing the student experience.<br/><br/><br/>This project intends to develop and enhance the capabilities of the emerging hybrid/convertible SSD through the following three thrusts: 1) A novel management scheme for hybrid/convertible SSDs is developed to balance the performance and capacity of the storage system. In particular, this thrust focuses on device management and advanced the zone named space technique. 2) A high-performance Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks system is built inside hybrid/convertible SSDs to efficiently protect data stored in these drives while retaining the same reliability. 3) An efficient key-value store system in the emerging storage devices is investigated to solve big data issues.

Semiconductor technology increasingly faces fundamental physical limits. New approaches to hardware/software co-design are now achieving higher performance at extreme scales. This project will explore two new approaches: configurability and integration. Configurability enables hardware to map better to applications. Integration enables system components that have generally been single function to gain additional functionality. An example is a network for the transport of data. Such a network might also operate on that data as it is being transported. Integration enables compute everywhere in the architecture and network. Configurability and integration will lead to much more efficient use of computing resources. Such resources include high-performance computers. Another focus of this project will be in the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs are a widely used type of integrated circuit. In FPGAs the hardware can be configured to match the application. FPGAs will allow the deployment of the research products into production systems.

First, this project will demonstrate that computation and communication should no longer comprise separate silos. Second, it will demonstrate that applications should no longer be mapped to fixed hardware. In their place, new hardware-software abstractions must necessarily be built around the idea of the application-centric system. This project will identify new computing modes -- computation distribution/offload and configurable hardware -- that will be application aware with tight mapping of applications to computer systems. This improved mapping, in turn, will require deploying a number of mechanisms, starting with improved compilers and high-quality application libraries but extending to lighter-weight yet intelligent middleware (for instance, improved Message Passing Interface middleware), automated application modification, dynamic autotuning, and machine learning assisting in all of these components.

Much work has been devoted to understanding how to express the efficiency of the process in terms of local turbulent parameters. Recent work though suggests that the physics of stratified mixing cannot be abstracted from the larger context in which it occurs. In this project, laboratory experiments will be conducted in a tank large enough, and suitably forced, that it may approximate more faithfully the conditions observed in the ocean, a Minimal Ocean Mixing System (MOMS). The laboratory measurements will provide a way to test theoretical and practical ways to represent mixing in computer models. Stratified turbulent mixing in a similar environment is also present in the atmosphere, and this research will therefore have a spill-over effect in atmospheric sciences. The present measurements and numerical simulations will also constitute a new dataset which can be used as a training set for Artificial Intelligence algorithms reduced order models and data-assimilation techniques which require a substantial knowledge of the flow for their validation. Finally, reducing uncertainties of irreversible mixing using the present research will improve the predictive power of general circulation models at climate scales. The PI will make every effort to advertise the postdoc position broadly so to reach candidates that traditionally have been marginalized. The PI will also work with the local chapter of SCIREN, an organization that connects STEM researchers with local teachers to improve the quality and scientific literacy of youths.<br/><br/><br/>It is clear that the recent work surveyed shows a shift in the focus from a purely local characterization of stratified mixing (e.g., the quest for parameterizations of mixing efficiency based on the buoyancy Reynolds number) to a view that sees mixing as the end product of a dynamic that starts at much larger scales and is (potentially) much more intertwined than previously recognized. Experimentally, this requires rethinking the problem of stratified mixing to include a more natural way to force the problem, and a domain sufficiently large to accommodate both the anisotropic and the isotropic part of the spectrum, a MOMS. The dataset collected in these experiments and numerical simulations will therefore, constitute a novel way to test and validate theoretical arguments to model the energy exchanges in stratified turbulent flows across the anisotropic / isotropic divide. In addition, this research aims to provide a link between vertically/horizontally towed instruments and planar / volume-resolved measurements. This project also intends to establish a link between near-ocean conditions combining theoretical with technical challenges at unprecedented scales for which the UNC Joint Fluids lab is designed. In addition, the Craya-Herring framework combined with the structure functions methods will provide the state-of-the-art theoretical foundations to analyze the role of the turbulence where intermittency remains a key open question to analyze and interpret field measurements, since mixing events are rarely observed nor statically converged in field measurements of strongly stratified turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The sound system of a person's native language influences not only how second-language learners produce words but also how they recognize words, making it difficult for second-language learners to hear sound contrasts that do not distinguish words in the native language or that differ in how they distinguish words in the native and second languages. These difficulties can in turn impact second-language learners? ability to understand speech in their second language, thus causing important communication breakdowns, and they can exacerbate the degree of foreign accent that second-language learners typically evidence in speech production. This project seeks to clarify and explain the nature of this native-language influence by investigating a linguistic phenomenon that plays a critical role in spoken-word recognition across languages but has been under-investigated: lexical stress. <br/><br/>The project?s specific goals are threefold. First, the project will elucidate whether the cue-weighting theory of speech perception can provide a strong theoretical framework for understanding the listening difficulties that second-language learners encounter with lexical stress, and for developing training stimuli and methods to enhance the perceptual learning of lexical stress. Second, it will help resolve theoretical debates about the mechanisms underlying second-language perceptual learning, the nature and robustness of second-language perceptual representations, and the degree to which adult second-language perceptual learning remains malleable. Third, it will provide a theoretical foundation for the teaching of second-language speech perception, enabling instructors to tailor teaching practices according to students? native language and individual abilities, and the effectiveness of training stimuli and methods. Participants will complete cue-weighting perception experiments, sequence-recall experiments, visual-world eye-tracking experiments, and perceptual training experiments, as well as proficiency and perceptual aptitude tests.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of them, such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and healthcare wearables, require real-time and in-situ learning to be perceived as truly intelligent. However, the limited computing and energy resources available at the edge device (e.g., mobile devices, sensors) stand at odds with the massive and growing cost of state-of-the-art machine learning training, posing a grand challenge for real-time machine learning (RTML) at the edge. This goal of this project is to foster a systematic breakthrough in achieving efficient online training of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in pervasive resource-constrained platforms and applications. An order of magnitude advance in RTML would enable numerous edge devices to proactively interpret and learn from new data, improve their own performance using what they have learned, and adapt to dynamic environments, all in real time. Success in this project will enable truly intelligent edge devices to penetrate all walks of life and thus generate significant impacts on societies and economies. This project will lead to new courses and open-education resources that can attract diverse groups of students and eventually deliver a platform for inclusion and innovation.  <br/><br/>The project addresses the RTML grand challenge using a three-pronged 'co-design' approach that seamlessly integrates algorithm, architecture, and circuit-level innovations. Specifically, at the algorithm level, an efficient training framework for RTML, for which trained models are also natively efficient for inference, will be established. Aggressive time and energy reductions can be achieved, at first by improving general training techniques, and then by focusing particularly on online learning and adaptation. At the architecture level, the project will first target reducing the high cost of data movement by trading it for lower-cost computation, and then generate optimal dataflows and hardware architectures to maximize the joint benefits of algorithms and hardware. At the circuit level, the project will leverage adaptive low-precision algorithms and architectures to design ultra-energy-efficient mixed-signal compute fabrics. Statistical computing techniques will be incorporated to demonstrate efficient, scalable, and robust machine learning chips. Finally, at the system level, an integration effort will be included to aid the realization of realistic system goals and to evaluate the innovations of the three core thrusts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent technological advances had a profound effect on our answers to that challenge.  They allow for rapid and cost-effective sequencing (i.e., reading) of pathogen genomes and can generate enormous amounts of data in almost real time. Genomic epidemiology is an interdisciplinary research area that uses the large-scale analysis of viral genomes to understand how viruses evolve and spread.  The methods of genomic epidemiology are currently becoming major instruments not only for research, but also for public-health decision making of broad societal importance. However, its computational toolkit is still developing, and this process faces many hard algorithmic challenges.  Some of the major problems are: (i) how to extract the whole spectrum of viral genetic diversity, including newly emerging mutations and variants, from noisy and fragmented sequencing data; (ii) how to use genomic data to investigate outbreaks and reconstruct virus-transmission networks; and (iii) how to identify highly pathogenic or transmissible viral variants. The algorithms for these problems should be accurate, reproducible, interpretable and scalable with respect to the levels of ""big data"" produced by modern sequencing platforms. Development of such algorithms and study of the corresponding algorithmic problems is exactly the goal of this project. Other major objectives are to help to bring computational genomics into high-school and undergraduate classrooms, to broaden participation in computational biology via advanced pedagogical techniques, and to facilitate training of the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers, who will simultaneously possess an expertise in computer science, epidemiology, and molecular biology, and will be able to develop innovative algorithms and apply them to real-life problems.<br/><br/>This project will undertake the systematic study of fundamental computational problems of genomic epidemiology from the theoretical computer-science perspective. The overarching objective is the development of new methods based on cross-disciplinary convergence of techniques from algorithmic graph theory, network theory and mathematical (and, particularly, combinatorial) optimization. The first major specific scientific goal is the development of methods for assessment of viral genetic diversity using networks of statistically linked mutations and a graph-decomposition approach. The second goal is the development of a family of combinatorial algorithms for reconstruction of viral transmission networks using the fusion of phylogenetics and a network-theory approach to social networks relevant to infection dissemination.  The final goal is the design of scalable computational techniques for quantification of viral phenotypic diversity using combinatorial and convex optimization.  The investigator will closely collaborate with biologists and epidemiologists to ensure biomedical relevance and applicability of the developed algorithms. It is also expected that some of the new machinery will be applicable to non-biomedical problems arising in graph theory and in studies of complex networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Films of bacterial aggregates, also called biofilms, are a ubiquitous form of microbial life. When they grow on solid-liquid interfaces, they can cause health problems like infections near joint implants. When biofilms grow at air-liquid interfaces, they can cause lung problems.  How biofilms grow and adapt at these interfaces is not well understood.  This work will first explore how bacteria cope with changes in surface tension and energy.  Next, this work will study how bacteria?s adaptation to changing conditions can be manipulated to create new materials.  Finally, this work will suggest how viruses and nanomaterials could be used to control bacterial development at fluid interfaces.  The results of this work will ultimately be relevant for treating chronic lung infections or developing more effective treatment of crude oil spills using bacteria. Moreover, these research activities will motivate students to pursue STEM careers. The project will adapt professional engagement strategies to develop pre-college and college experiences for minorities, first-generation, and financially challenged students.

The work will advance understanding of energy metabolite-mediated changes in immune cells which can then be leveraged to generate robust immune responses against a variety of diseases including infections, cancer and inflammatory diseases.

Towards this goal, the focus of this CAREER project is to understand the energy metabolite, transcription factor and functional protein axis in dendritic cells (DCs). The research presents a method for engineering particles that deliver metabolites to DCs in vitro and in vivo. This project will make engineering contributions by developing synthetic routes of metabolite-based nanoparticles that function as both carrier and cargo. Life science contributions will be made by identifying correlation between metabolites, transcription factors and epigenetic markers in DCs. Importantly, this project will determine the epigenetic changes in DCs due to succinylation/glycosylation of transcription factors and histone.

Importantly and in contrast to other 2D materials, these properties can be systematically varied and studied within the same family, without changing elemental composition and type of interatomic bonds in the material. These unique features make MXenes equally interesting for fundamental science and application development, where they can be used in new planar and flexible devices, leading to new technologies and significant economic impacts. Some of these applications that are researched now include health monitoring sensors, high performance energy harvesting and storage systems, and chemo-photothermal cancer therapy. However, the adhesion of MXenes, which is critical in many of these applications, has yet to be systematically investigated. To date, there have only been a few theoretical studies of the adhesive behavior of MXenes, with little to no experimental data. In a broader sense, experimental determination of adhesive properties of MXenes will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental relationships between adhesion and atomic structures for low dimensional materials. This could revolutionize the modern materials and manufacturing industries in harnessing the adhesion for coatings and planar devices made of low dimensional materials.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are to: (i) systematically investigate the adhesive interactions of MXenes at the atomistic, nano- and micrometer scales, (ii) using the unique advantages provided by MXenes, systematically and separately examine the effects of surface functional groups and monolayer thickness of 2D materials on their adhesive interactions, and (iii) explore the environmental effects on the adhesion of MXenes including surface water and oxidation process. To achieve the goals, we intend to: (1) utilize the atomistic scale contact-based experiments to investigate the effect of atomic structures and surface terminations on the adhesion, (2) employ nanoindentation to understand the interfacial traction-separation relations of MXenes with themselves and other materials, (3) explore the potential use of in-situ nano-shear-lag experiments to investigate the shear interactions of MXenes, (4) combine the multiscale modeling and the experimental results to understand the coupled adhesive mechanisms involving the surface defects, terminations, monolayer thickness, and (5) explore the possible evaluation of the effects of surface water and oxidation process on the adhesion of MXenes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These beetles are unique in that they also harbor fungi that act as their food source which grows on the tree tissues. Some of these fungi can then infect the tree and in several cases can result in the death of host trees within months of infection. These beetles and their pathogenic fungi occur worldwide and pose a significant threat to forestry and natural ecosystems. However, no genetic models for the study of any ambrosia beetle-fungal partner pairings are available. This proposal will use the Xyloborus beetle-laurel wilt pathogenic fungus (Harringtonia lauricola) as a model. Both the original beetle and the fungus are invasive to the United States and are rapidly spreading throughout the Southeastern part of the country. The beetle carries the fungus to trees, where the fungus is capable of killing otherwise healthy trees. There are over 500 different species of trees that the beetle uses as a host including swampbay, redbay, sassafras, and the agriculturally important crop of avocado, where the only treatment is to cut and burn the trees. In this project, we will study the dynamics and genetics of how the beetle harbors its fungal partner, including how the beetle chooses, promotes the growth of, and carries the fungus from host tree to host tree. These data can provide foundational information that can ultimately be used to help stop the spread of these tree pathogens. In addition, the project will provide opportunities for training and outreach to high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students on fungal biology, disease, symbioses and evolutionary processes. In partnership with programs at University of Florida, the investigator will develop educational material for the high school teachers and the general public on fungal-insect symbioses.  <br/><br/>Insect-fungal mutualisms are widespread in nature and ambrosia beetle-fungal interactions represent some of the oldest and most successful symbioses known. The fungus serves as the sole source of nutrition for the beetles that burrow into trees to form galleries where they grow and ?farm? the fungus for food. These beetles have evolved specialized structures (mycangia) that house, transport and disseminate the fungus. These fungi and beetles have co-adapted to symbiotic lifestyles throughout evolutionary history and include independent evolutions of different types of mycangia that house different fungal symbionts. The fungus, Harringtonia lauricola is a highly destructive tree pathogen affecting avocado and other members of the Lauraceae family and has killed >300 million trees in the US alone. H. lauricola is the mutualistic partner to its original invasive (to the US) beetle carrier (Xyleborus glabratus) and may have now spread to indigenous beetle species. We will investigate the developmental and genetic mechanisms which underlie the relationship between H. lauricola and Xyleborus beetles. The project will use cellular and genetic approaches to test specific hypotheses concerning symbiotic association. We will: (1) probe the cellular dynamics of mycangial colonization, including investigating selection, persistence/maintenance, turnover, and competition in the mycangia using microbiological and cellular (e.g., microscopic) methods, (2) identify genetic mechanisms that mediate fungal symbioses, e.g., what fungal genes/network are important for colonization and fitness within the mycangia, and (3) construct gene expression profiles (i.e., transcriptomics) of the fungus during mycangial colonization to help define the evolutionary processes that has led to fungal-mycangial symbioses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fluid systems consist of different substances such as mucus, saliva, or biosurfactants, that exhibit intricate geometries such as thin films, filaments, foam, and extremely small droplets, and that encompass multi-physics processes such as thin sheet fragmentation, vortex-capillary interaction, and fluid contact. The project aims to enable the accurate simulations of complex interfacial fluid phenomena characterized by these thin, dynamic, and non-manifold flow features on the mesoscopic length scale between 0.1 micrometer and 1 millimeter. At this intermediate length scale, fluids exhibit complicated flow dynamics and geometric forms due to the interaction between surface tension and other physical ingredients which are remarkably different from their macroscopic or microscopic counterparts (for instance, fluid can bounce, walk, glide, contact, or form non-manifold foam structures which are difficult for conventional approaches to simulate). The work will bridge this scientific gap by leading multifaceted efforts to develop novel geometric data structures, non-manifold interface tracking algorithms, structure-preserving PDE gauge formulations, multiphase coupling schemes and parallel numerical solvers, all of which will be integrated into a unified simulation framework to boost a broad range of hygiene-related applications centered around these flow processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Design activities for engineering systems across infrastructure, aerospace, and defense domains more closely resemble a collective decision-making process than centralized authority in traditional systems engineering practice. This topic is of interest because U.S. agencies and firms are actively architecting systems with decentralized decision authority, described variously as Internet 4.0, cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-things, or systems-of-systems across domains, including energy, transportation, manufacturing, and space systems. The design of these engineering systems differs from that of other systems because their large scale, long lifetime, and proximity to social systems evoke complex features such as adaptation, self-organization, and emergence, which take place over strategic timescales. A deeper understanding of how strategic dynamics impact designer interactions across theoretical and empirical perspectives can help to avoid costly overruns and cancellations by identifying and mitigating undesirable dynamics in conceptual design phases. Advances in systems engineering must develop theory, methods, and tools to coordinate and facilitate collective design activities. <br/><br/>This project builds on a line of economic methods applied to engineering design including utility theory, decision theory, social choice, and game theory. Collective systems design is modeled as a bi-level problem, where lower-level decisions correspond to an optimization problem and upper-level strategy decisions correspond to a coordination game. Normative models of agent behavior are based on classical and Bayesian game theory with utility functions incorporating behavioral factors such as risk attitudes. Multi-agent simulation studies evolution of strategies under repeated interaction among agents. Behavioral experiments collect empirical data about human decision-making for validation. The research will contribute new knowledge about how to characterize, study, and modify the strategic dynamics of engineering systems during conceptual design phases. The educational plan develops and delivers simulation activities to model systems problems by combining technical modeling and social interaction. The simulation activities behave as a highly abstracted model system to elicit rich strategic behaviors through face-to-face interaction, engage students with challenges of socio-technical problems, and retain computational tractability to teach analytical methods in educational contexts. Development and broad public dissemination of simulations in the context of Earth science space missions will expose a wide audience to strategic issues of government-commercial interdependency in space systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Qualitative researchers collect and analyze non-numerical data to understand people's interactions, opinions, and experiences. The presence of potential bias in qualitative research is a well-recognized problem, but research to increase transparency and trustworthiness in the analysis phases have been limited. This research develops a novel role for visualizations in addressing current challenges in qualitative data analysis through the integration of text analysis and multimodal data extraction. Given the prevalent use of qualitative research in academia, qualitative data analysis without transparency and verification can have far-reaching negative impacts such as discriminating policies, suboptimal patient-care, and reinforced stigmas. Thus, qualitative data analysis should be conducted in a rigorous manner to yield trustworthy and meaningful results. The techniques developed will significantly contribute to the data analysis, visualization, and human-computer interaction fields.<br/><br/>Despite advances in qualitative data analysis software, there are three key dilemmas in the current qualitative research process: the cognitive burden resulting from the vast amount of data, subjectivity and potential bias that are introduced by the researcher, and the underutilization of multimodal data containing important non-verbal cues such as vocal tones and facial expressions. The specific objective of this proposal is to identify and demonstrate: (1) how text analysis techniques can be combined with visualization and human feedback to alleviate cognitive burden and lessen bias; and, (2) how visual summaries of audio features can promote the incorporation of non-verbal cues in qualitative analysis. An open-source visualization webtool supporting these enhanced analysis techniques will be developed using an iterative, user-centered design methodology.

One of the biggest obstacles is crop diseases, which can cause significant damage to important crops and limit production. Fusarium oxysporum is a fungal pathogen that is known to cause severe damage to many crops, including cotton. Recently, there has been an outbreak of cotton Fusarium wilt caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (Fov) in some southern U.S. states. This project aims to better understand the evolution and pathogenicity of F. oxysporum and to identify resistance genes that could help protect crops. The project will also provide opportunities for training and education in plant genomics and molecular biology for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as outreach opportunities for underrepresented minorities and African scientists. By using cutting-edge technologies, this project will advance our understanding of F. oxysporum and its interactions with hosts, which could ultimately lead to more effective disease management strategies and increased crop production.<br/><br/>Over several years, the team has collected data on the pathogen characteristics and germplasm screens of a naturally infected cotton field in Texas. Based on this data, they have developed a hypothesis about the evolution and pathogenicity of F. oxysporum and gained molecular insights into the fungus-host interactions. They have also created platforms for transient and stable assays to study the loss and gain of function in cotton. The team aims to determine the genetic diversity, evolution, and pathogenicity of Fov and other F. oxysporum species and understand cotton's resistance mechanisms to Fusarium wilt through association genomics. The research will take a systems approach to understanding the co-evolutionary dynamics of pathogen virulence and host resistance in the complex genome of both the fungus and cotton. F. oxysporum species complex (FOSC) is a group of isolates with different host specificities, which are defined as formae speciales. FOSC has complex genome structures with core chromosomes and accessory chromosomes that may be associated with virulence and host specificity. The proposed research will explore the evolutionary dynamics of accessory chromosomes and their role in virulence and host specificity. The project will provide insights into Fov-cotton interactions and a broader understanding of F. oxysporum-host interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sexual violence is a serious public health problem in the United States: every 68 seconds an American is sexually assaulted. Online-to-offline sexual violence refers to nonconsensual sexual acts that occur via the combination of computer-mediated and face-to-face communication. The ways in which Americans discover and interact with potential sexual partners are increasingly computer-mediated, however we have little understanding of how computer-mediated communication influences perceptions of appropriate sexual behavior, which may predispose individuals to becoming perpetrators or victims of sexual harm without their realization. The knowledge produced through this project will benefit public health and constitute crucial advances in multiple intersecting fields such as human computer interaction, nursing, and psychology via informing entirely new solutions to online-to-offline sexual violence that are truly preventative and do not rely on conscious intent by the perpetrator to cause harm, or recognition by victims that harm is occurring. <br/><br/>The research uses a mixed methods, longitudinal approach to studying online-to-offline sexual activity through online dating, a well known context for sexual violence. A framework of online-to-offline sexual violence through the lens of computer-mediated consent will be developed by creating, curating, and analyzing a dataset of user behavior examples during online dating. This will comprise instances of online daters' behavior across online and offline interaction as it relates to sexual activity such as consent practices, as well as the impacts of such behavior on key psychological constructs. Data collection will be made more scalable and privacy-preserving with a data donation app embodying best practices for sexual experience reporting.

Users can thus achieve a high level of engagement by interacting with the augmented environment through the mobile user interface. Typical MAR apps require executing several compute-intensive tasks to render virtual objects and, using Artificial Intelligence (AI), analyze the environment. However, due to their relatively small form factor, mobile devices only have limited computing resources and energy available for the MAR app execution, which may lead to short battery life and poor user experience. To ensure the future success of MAR, it is thus important not only to conduct novel research on how to enable high energy efficiency in MAR apps but also to educate the future workforce in the best practices for energy efficient mobile software design. To achieve these goals, this project will propose an edge-assisted and energy-efficient framework for MAR apps. Specifically, the project designs runtime algorithms that (1), on each mobile device, control user-perceived performance and energy consumption by manipulating virtual object quality, AI-model complexity, and AI-task allocation on the heterogeneous computing resources, (2), on the supporting edge servers, ensure scalability by grouping similar virtual object decimation requests for minimized cross-user performance cost under limited edge computing and storage resources, and (3) will be implemented and tested on a physical testbed.<br/><br/>By providing a framework that makes MAR apps more energy-efficient, this project will help speed up the adoption of augmented reality in many different key sectors of modern society, such as education and workforce training, and will unlock the full potential of new technologies such as augmented remote meetings and augmented experiences in public places. The project will also result in the creation of new graduate-level courses to educate the future workforce on energy-efficient mobile resource management, new research opportunities for undergraduate students, and new summer camps for K12 students. The course material will be made available to other universities interested to introduce similar courses, projects, and summer camps. The results of this project will be disseminated through publications in top-tier conferences and journals. Similarly, all the source code of the proposed algorithms will be made available as open source.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High levels of noise can have negative effects on animals, particularly those that communicate with sounds. Several studies have investigated how human-generated noise can impair the recognition of vocal communication signals. Interestingly, some studies have shown changes in signals produced by animals that live in cities that help them cope with the negative effects of noise. Whether and how the sense of hearing can change in response to human-generated noise is not known. Studying the iconic ?ribbit? of Pacific chorus frogs, this project explores precisely this. We will compare the calls and the hearing abilities of frogs that live in urban and rural regions across the San Francisco Bay Area. We will also study whether such changes in calls and hearing abilities allow animals to communicate easier in noisy environments. Further, we will explore whether changes in hearing among urban and rural populations are related to changes in the structure of the ear. These research activities will be complemented by educational activities, including research training of diverse student populations and science education outreach in local communities. As this project will further our understanding of the consequences of noise pollution for sensory perception and behavior, our results can inform conservation and urbanization efforts and promote progress in the design of communication devices that interact with humans.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic noise has dramatically increased over the past decades, becoming a major form of pollution. Accordingly, there is growing interest in understanding the effects of anthropogenic noise on animal behavior. For animals that communicate acoustically, anthropogenic noise can impair the detection and recognition of vocal signals. Several studies have investigated how vocal signals and signaling behaviors change to minimize the detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise. In contrast, we do not know whether the hearing capabilities of urban animals also change to better cope with high levels of noise. The central hypothesis of this project is that, among populations with different levels of natural and anthropogenic noise, the auditory system varies in ways that facilitate signal reception. We will test this hypothesis using Pacific chorus frogs (Hyliola regilla) from populations with low and high levels of natural and anthropogenic noise. Specifically, we will (i) characterize the acoustic environment (soundscape) and vocal signals of populations with different levels of noise, (ii) determine how auditory processing abilities vary among soundscapes, (iii) determine how such variation in vocalizations and hearing abilities relate to acoustically-mediated mating behavior, and (iv) examine anatomical mechanisms underlying population-level variation in auditory processing abilities. By combining behavioral, physiological, and anatomical studies of auditory processing, this project will further our understanding of how novel environments shape sensation, perception, and animal communication systems in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantification of cancer evolutionary dynamics is therefore essential to understanding the mechanisms of cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing has enabled characterization of tumor composition at the finest possible resolution, thus providing researchers with the data needed to potentially allow for such quantification. However, to realize this potential, appropriate algorithms and data analysis tools are needed. The computational discipline that extracts evolutionary parameters from genomic data by integrating phylogenetics, population genetics and statistical learning is called phylodynamics. While almost all existing phylodynamics methods are developed for viruses, there is a growing realization that this methodology is also highly relevant to cancer biology. However, the development of cancer phylodynamics algorithms faces many challenges associated with the nature of cancer genomics data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing a phylodynamic framework for joint inference of cancer phylogenetic trees and evolutionary parameters from single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-Seq) data. This framework will allow cancer researchers to carry out a statistically and computationally sound evaluation of the effects of particular genome alterations or their combinations. In addition, this project will support development of innovative cross-disciplinary curricula, and bioinformatics training for diverse cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students at Georgia State University (Title III designation of Predominantly Black Institution), University of Connecticut, and UConn Health.<br/><br/><br/>The project has three interrelated technical aims. First, investigators will develop algorithms for joint reconstruction of clonal frequencies and phased cancer clone genomic profiles (including copy number variation profiles and single nucleotide variants). The project will concentrate on low-coverage scDNA-seq that can  provide enough clonal data to guarantee the density of branching events in the cancer  phylogenies necessary for phylodynamics analysis. Second, the researchers will design a novel methodology for intra-tumor phylodynamics inference. This includes scalable construction of plausible clone phylogenetic trees  using a novel bipartition-based median-tree approach, together with maximum a posteriori inference of cancer fitness and mutability landscapes. The distinguishing feature of the proposed approach is the use of convex optimization techniques rather than MCMC sampling, which will guarantee scalability and accuracy of developed computational tools. Finally, a comprehensive set of experiments will be conducted to validate and assess the accuracy of developed methods.  These will include computational experiments on simulated and publicly available scDNA-Seq data, as well as using scDNA-Seq datasets generated by in vitro and in vivo experiments conducted at UConn Health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humans frequently take for granted and exploit these ecosystem services without fully understanding the ecological feedbacks, linkages, and interdependencies of these processes to the wider ecosystem. As demands on coastal ecosystem services have risen, marshes have experienced substantial loss due to direct and indirect impacts from human activity. The rapidly changing coastal ecosystems of Louisiana provide a natural experiment for understanding how coastal change alters ecosystem function. This project is developing new metrics and tools to assess food web variability and test hypotheses on biodiversity and ecosystem function in coastal Louisiana.  The research is determining how changing habitat configuration alters the distribution of energy across the seascape in a multitrophic system. This work is engaging students from the University of Louisiana Lafayette and Dillard University in placed-based learning by immersing them in the research and local restoration efforts to address land loss and preserve critical ecosystem services. Students are developing a deeper understanding of the complex issues facing coastal regions through formal course work, directed field work, and outreach. Students are interacting with stakeholders and managers who are currently battling coastal change. Their directed research projects are documenting changes in coastal habitat and coupling this knowledge with the consequences to ecosystems and the people who depend on them. By participating in the project students are emerging with knowledge and training that is making them into informed citizens and capable stewards of the future of our coastal ecosystems, while also preparing them for careers in STEM. The project is supporting two graduate students and a post-doc.<br/><br/>The transformation and movement of energy through a food web are key links between biodiversity and ecosystem function. A major hurdle to testing biodiversity ecosystem function theory is a limited ability to assess food web variability in space and time. This research is quantifying changing seascape structure, species diversity, and food web structure to better understand the relationship between biodiversity and energy flow through ecosystems. The project uses cutting edge tools and metrics to test hypotheses on how the distribution, abundance, and diversity of key species are altered by ecosystem change and how this affects function. The hypotheses driving the research are: 1) habitat is a more important indirect driver of trophic structure than a direct change to primary trophic pathways; and 2) horizontal and vertical diversity increases with habitat resource index. Stable isotope analysis is characterizing energy flow through the food web. Changes in horizontal and vertical diversity in a multitrophic system are being quantified using aerial surveys and field sampling. To assess the spatial and temporal change in food web resources, the project is combining results from stable isotope analysis and drone-based remote sensing technology to generate consumer specific energetic seascape maps (E-scapes) and trophic niche metrics. In combination these new metrics are providing insight into species? responses to changing food web function across the seascape and through time.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Biological Oceanography and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They must frequently replicate existing refactoring research from scratch ? this wastes time, effort, and introduces threats to validity. The project's novelties are to create and disseminate a repository of software refactoring-related artifacts and online tools, to enable refactoring as a service, sufficient to support rigorous empirical studies and experiments with the detection, prioritization, repair, testing, and documentation of software quality issues across a broad community of researchers, educators, software engineers, and STEM researchers. The project's impacts relate to issues of great economic impact: large software companies spend millions of dollars yearly to reduce the technical debt through refactoring. The publicly-released infrastructure will support the transition of refactoring research into practice and will enable STEM researchers to better maintain their software prototypes as these inevitably decay. The proposed infrastructure REFCRI will be a catalyst for revamping software engineering courses at many universities to emphasize real-world examples of refactoring and will offer tremendous education resources for practitioners. The investigators will organize workshops on the platform to foster a thriving community.<br/><br/>The investigators will curate a repository of refactoring data sets via data pre-processing techniques to (i) clean the data, and (ii) check its coverage and diversity. The team of this project will release an API to allow the refactoring community to easily upload datasets, refactoring teaching examples/tutorials, tools, and publications.

The project vision is to develop Programmable In-network Security, or ?Poise?. Poise aims to design and integrate a wide range of defenses directly inside the network, leveraging the technology trend of network programmability. If successful, a Poise network would support security as naturally as today?s networks support connectivity.

The potential impact of Poise is to make future networks fundamentally more secure than they are today.  <br/><br/>This project presents a vision of Programmable In-network Security, or ?Poise?, informed by the recent trend that network devices are becoming increasingly programmable, and with a goal of supporting security as a first-class network attribute. The project plans to take a three-pronged approach to realizing this goal. First, Poise aims to transform a programmable switch into a defense platform by designing a wide range of security applications that reside in the switch. Second, Poise aims to transform a network of programmable switches into a defense fleet, by architecting defense applications into the network paths and synchronizing them for whole-network defense. Third, Poise seeks to ensure that the defense applications, individually and collectively, are themselves secure against attacks. In its ultimate embodiment, a Poise network would toggle a wide array of defenses rapidly on and off as traffic flows through, mitigating attacks in real time.

The electrical potential recordings using a large microelectrode array from neuronal cultures has been widely used to monitor neural spike activities and cellular activities. However, this approach does not monitor neurochemical release, and therefore only contains indirect information regarding synaptic neurotransmission. The neural spike activities and the neurotransmitter secretions are related; however, one cannot be used to predict the other because of the complex vesicle trafficking and exocytosis processes. Because many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer?s disease and Parkinson?s disease, interfere and modulate synaptic functions prior to neuronal loss, ideally, the new technology should be able to monitor the dynamics of both neural spike activities and neurochemical release from synapses.

The education program is expected to (i) increase public scientific literacy, (ii) engage underrepresented student groups in STEM, and (iii) provide a highly demanded curriculum to prepare students in the emerging field of neural engineering. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a novel neurochemical-electrophysiology sensor technology that can simultaneously monitor neurochemical and neural spike activities. The neurochemical-electrophysiology sensor will enable the comprehensive investigation of synaptic function from action potential (AP) propagating through the axon to rapidly evoking neurochemical events at the synapses which cause the extracellular release of neurotransmitters. The new neurochemical-electrophysiology technology will provide label-free, multisite, and long-term monitoring of neuronal synaptic transmission activities, hence, enabling the characterization of synaptic function in physiological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. The project's Research Plan is organized under three aims: (1) Develop high-density neurochemical-electrophysiology amplifiers with fast-scan cyclic voltammogram (FSCV) capability; (2) Develop on-chip 16,384 microelectrode array and investigate switch-matrix connectivity; and (3) Apply the neurochemical-electrophysiology technology to monitor synaptic transmission from a large neural network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As demand for automation grows, enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence, control, and smart charging systems become beneficial. However, while other technologies have been considerably revolutionized, the effort to develop a smart and efficient charging system for automation has not. Power electronics is a critical technology in the charging system to convert electric energy into a different level or type to deliver it to an electric load, such as batteries. Therefore, it must tackle the key challenges that prevent us from obtaining a smart, compact, and efficient charging system. As an effort to overcome the challenges, wireless power transfer technology has been explored to reduce the charging error and remove manual intervention to charge their batteries. It can eliminate heavy wire cables, connectors, and power plug failure resulting from dust, dirt, and other environmental factors. Moreover, the autonomous driving technology makes this technology beneficial because they can go to the charging station when their batteries run out. However, current power converters for wireless power transfer are limited in maximizing performance because of the available technologies and designs. This proposed research aims to develop a high-frequency power converter to miniaturize a wireless power transfer system efficiently and investigate pioneering charging methodologies for battery-powered vehicles. This research will accelerate advances in various applications such as transportation electrification and renewable energy technologies by improving the battery charging methodology. Broader transformative impacts are also anticipated from the proposed research into undergraduate and graduate curricula and the involvement of undergraduate and underrepresented students in research. Also, outreach to K-12 students and local industries will be pursued to introduce wireless power transfer and power-electronic circuits and ensure the broad transformative impact of the research activities.<br/><br/>This project aims to investigate new design techniques to improve power density and performance of power electronics while studying innovative approaches that enhance the charging ability in the WPT system. The research will be performed through the intertwined thrusts that involve: i) designing and implementing a high-frequency resonant converter with magnetic resonant coupling coils to increase power density efficiently, ii) investigating a bidirectional wireless power transfer system using self-synchronous rectification and control system to provide Vehicle-to-Grid capability, and iii) exploring advanced wireless power transfer charging approaches such as vehicle-to-vehicle and dynamic charging to reduce the charging time by diversifying the charging methods. The dependence of the circuit performance on the switching devices, magnetic designs, gate drive circuitry, and compensation network topology will be explored in detail. The PI will simulate the proposed system in the multiphysics software to evaluate human exposure to electromagnetic fields due to high-power operation at high frequencies. Also, multiple coil structure will be studied to reduce the leakage fields and minimize the expensive and lossy shields. Successful project completion is anticipated to expand the operating range and power level of power-electronic circuits for wireless power transfer systems using novel charging approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The East African Rift is among the best places to study the influences of Earth processes on the evolution of mammals. Here the region?s geologic and climate histories, including the formation of the rift system that is the cradle of humankind, are preserved in sedimentary rocks in a unique way. The team will investigate these sediments, and the fossils they contain, to gain insight into ancient climate and habitats that record the emergence of humans, their primate ancestors, and African mammals over the last 25 million years. Our research will explore relationships between tectonics, climate, and mammal evolution in the Turkana Basin, Kenya using integrated field, laboratory, and modeling studies. New and existing data will be combined to study the links between rift development, climate change, and their respective roles in vegetation and mammal evolution. The team will produce a tectonic model that reconstructs rift evolution in this region of East Africa for the past 25 million years, and the tectonic model will be integrated with climate-vegetation models of equal or better resolution. Independent geological, geochemical, paleoecological, and paleontological data will be used to validate these model outputs to distinguish the influences of tectonics and climate on the evolution of Turkana ecosystems and mammals. The project will also train several postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and provide them with the opportunity to conduct field work in Kenya.  <br/><br/>This project seeks to test multiple hypotheses centered on questions regarding the complex interplay of tectonics and climate on the evolution of mammals and late Cenozoic terrestrial ecosystems.  The team have designed an integrated approach to explore the roles of continental rifting and global and regional climate on the evolution of primates and other mammals in the Turkana Basin from 28 to 5 million year ago. A time-dependent, kinematic and dynamic tectonic model for East Africa will be used to explore evolution of the entire Rift System. The tectonic model will be integrated with an Earth system model coupled to a dynamic vegetation model to test our hypotheses. The model outputs will be validated with new proxy data from the Turkana Basin that includes lithostratigraphy, radiometric dating, clumped isotope thermometry, plant wax biomarkers, enamel isotopes, paleobotany, dental microwear, and ecometrics, that taken together, enable independent reconstruction of the climate, tectonic, and faunal evolution in the region. Our multidisciplinary, multi-institutional project includes training opportunities for the next generation of scientists, including training of three graduate students, four postdocs, and at least 11 undergraduates.

Inclusion of an elementary mathematics specialist on a team of teachers has potential to systemically improve mathematics education, build students? mathematical capacity to succeed, and increase student achievement in mathematics.  Too few students in the U.S. are attaining high levels of mathematics learning, compounded by persisting gaps in mathematics achievement.  This project aims to improve mathematics teacher effectiveness and teacher leadership in elementary schools in which many students have great economic needs and are from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.  The project focuses on the recruitment, preparation, support, and retention of elementary mathematics specialists who deliver rigorous mathematics instruction and serve as mathematics teacher leaders. <br/> <br/>This project at Georgia State University includes partnerships with the metro Atlanta school district Gwinnett County Public Schools and the nonprofit Corners Outreach.  Project goals include to: (1) recruit successful, experienced, and diverse elementary mathematics teachers from high-need schools that serve underrepresented student populations to become elementary mathematics specialists; (2) increase the number of elementary mathematics specialists in these schools through evidence-based preparation in two university endorsement programs; (3) develop elementary mathematics specialists who are highly effective mathematics teachers and teacher leaders; and (4) support and retain elementary mathematics specialists as they serve as teacher leaders, including coaching university teacher candidates, in these schools.  This five-year project will involve 26 in-service elementary teachers, aiming to promote mathematics equity and access, support teacher retention in high-need schools, and situate teacher candidates in a hiring pipeline.  The project's teachers will be prepared and supported as elementary mathematics specialists through completion of the K-5 Mathematics Endorsement and Teacher Support & Coaching Endorsement. In addition to completing these two endorsements, teachers will also engage in a Professional Learning Community and one-on-one mentoring.  Evaluation and research involving mixed methods will demonstrate how the intentional and continuous project components affect the mathematical content knowledge, instructional practices, beliefs, and teacher leader skills of elementary mathematics specialists.  Results have the potential to advance understandings in the areas of mathematics teacher education and professional development, particularly of elementary mathematics specialists in high-need schools. This Track 3: Master Teacher Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

At the same time, novel two-dimensional materials and polymer derived high temperature ceramics have captured the attention of the materials community. In this research project, two dimensional MXene will be incorporated into a silicon oxycarbide matrix to generate new materials, both on Earth and at the International Space Station. The high temperature evolution behaviors of two-dimensional materials and polymer to ceramic conversion under microgravity conditions will be systematically compared with the processes on Earth. These materials are expected to have high oxidation resistance, excellent electrical conductivity, and low density. They should also have great synergistic potentials for toughness, strength, and high temperature stability. The composites can be made into almost any shape (bulk, coating, discrete feature, et cetera) and size (nano- to macro-) based on application needs. In addition, these materials can easily produce complex shape, thin-wall, or freeform components with lightweight and functional capabilities in high temperature environments. This research will usher in a new generation of advanced materials which have great potential to be used  as heat exchangers, electric systems, catalyst support, energy storage, electrodes, nano-devices, and microsystems. Ultimately, project results will lead to new applications benefiting space science and life on Earth.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research project. The PI will expand current activities to Eastern Virginia while continuing efforts with different summer camps on campus. In addition, the PI will expand outreach efforts to the Western Virginia Science Museum to stimulate the interest of females and minorities in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This research project will advance understanding of atomic- and nano-level species interactions under different gravitational conditions in order to explore a new class of high temperature stable and electrically conductive materials. The high temperature composites will include both dense and porous microstructures but the methodology developed will be applicable to a wide range of high temperature materials derived from 2D additives and polymer precursors. This research project is expected to develop new theories, provide new knowledge, and offer novel methods in   atomic level design and thermodynamic prediction of polymer derived ceramics. Results from this project will open new opportunities for  using microgravity to understand and create novel high temperature materials. The team will conduct the research using four approaches. First, using MXene exfoliation and surface functionalization, pre-pyrolysis at 500-700C will be conducted in order to provide controlled states for microgravity and Earth gravity studies. Second, different atmosphere pyrolysis will be conducted on Earth and under microgravity to understand the atmosphere and gas release effects on new phase formation. Third, theoretical thermodynamic calculation and experimental pyrolysis studies will be combined in order to explore the fundamental interfacial interaction and phase evolution processes. Finally, gravitational effects on 2D MXene deformation, stacking, and chemical interaction with silicon oxycarbide during pyrolysis will be comprehensively investigated; the phase and structural evolution of the porous systems will be correlated with pore stability and shrinkage/collapse under different gravity conditions.

This relies on our ability to reconstruct accurate images of brain activity from millions of neurons. However, traditional electrophysiological techniques using the current paradigm of the ?single-neuron per electrode? approach lack the scalability to read signals from millions of neurons. Therefore, it is critical to investigate new means of interacting with neurons. To address this unmet need, the objective of this CAREER project is to discover a new neural interfacing modality using brain neurochemicals that can accurately capture the brain?s activity at a large scale. The project will also lead an exciting role in closing the knowledge and interest gaps in science and engineering via a multidimensional approach, including a new high-school research program, undergraduate research experience, and teach-in events at local public schools. <br/><br/>The main idea of this project is to exploit the stochastic nature of neurotransmitter diffusion to investigate a superresolution neurochemical imaging technique. The excitation of neurons results in action potentials that propagate through the neuronal body and axons toward synapses. At the synapses, these action potentials instigate the secretion of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter molecules released from a single vesicle diffuse and subsequently reach multiple adjacent electrodes to be measured. Based on the diffusion characteristics, the precise origin of neurotransmitter secretion can be localized. This localization technique is similar to triangulation in principle, but it considers the diffusion path to make precise localization of neural activities. This method has unique advantages over triangulation by being able to distinguish both x-y location and also z position based on the diffusion characteristic. Also, because the diffusion of molecules is a slower process compared to voltage propagation, the point source can be pinpointed with high accuracy. Using this approach, a few electrodes can produce neurochemical imaging with a high spatial resolution. This new approach will transform neural interfaces by enabling simultaneous measurements from millions of neurons without requiring an equivalent density of electrodes. The superresolution neurochemical probe will help unravel the complex role of dopamine?s spatial distribution in cognitive processes by directly mapping the neurochemical activities in the brain with high spatiotemporal resolution. This project will result in not only the most advanced neurochemical probe available to date but also the superresolution algorithm that can enhance the spatial resolution into nanometers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to understand the social and ethical dimensions of how Automated Hiring Platforms are created and how they function within the job market. This will be accomplished through surveying companies that use Automated Hiring Platforms about how they use them, observing how Automated Hiring Platforms are designed, and through interviews with those who design and develop them and with human resources professionals and job applicants.

For example, many of the EDA problems such as Boolean optimization are combinatorial optimization problems, which are unlikely to be solved by polynomial-time algorithms. In practice, those problems can be solved using scalable optimization algorithms with approximations and domain-specific heuristics, which are mostly developed by extensive hand-engineering efforts with strong domain knowledge. However, recent progress in developing  such algorithms and associated heuristics is slowing down significantly due to the high barrier of technical knowledge, time-consuming hand-engineering, and several misleading designing strategies. This project aims to employ reinforcement learning and neural networks to enable self-learning high-performance algorithms and heuristics over graphs, which can outperform existing hand-crafted approaches without human supervision and domain knowledge. This will can be generalized to autonomously learn and discover novel graph-based combinatorial optimization heuristics at a wide range of application domains without any human guidance.

The reinforcement agent with the various reward formulations and novel training methodologies and algorithms will enable effectively learning novel combinatorial optimization heuristics with a wide range of performance customization. OneSense system will be integrated with an open-source end-to-end EDA design space exploration system, which will allow productive exploration and deployment of self-learned optimization heuristics over graphs in Boolean optimization.

They play a central role in information transmission, social interactions, economic transactions, and the spread of diseases, to name a few. Moreover, many networks, including this underlying critical infrastructure such as communication, power, and transportation networks, are highly interdependent. While there exists considerable research on the modeling and analysis of isolated networks, the study of interdependent and multilayer networks, particularly in the presence of strategic and self-interested decision makers, confronts many open challenges. This proposal will leverage tools from optimization, game theory, machine learning, and graph theory towards building an analytical framework for the study of multilayer networks. The findings will have impact on the design and operation of self-organizing multi-agent systems in complex network environments, as well as in securing interdependent critical infrastructure. Integrated with the proposed research, the education plan will broaden participation in the proposed research areas and provide audiences at all levels with applied and hands-on experiences through collaboration with outreach programs at the Ohio State University. <br/><br/>At the core of this proposal is the study of multilayer networks using game-theoretic modeling and analysis. This project will propose and analyze a new class of multi-network games for the study of decentralized decision-making and learning over interconnected networks. This framework will account for the multi-modality of information and communication channels available to entities in multi-agent systems and identify the potential sources of inefficiency in decentralized decision making in multilayer network environments (as compared to both centrally operated and single layer networks). It will also propose and evaluate the impact of incentives or interventions to shape the outcomes of decentralized decision making and distributed learning on these networks, through mechanism design and targeted interventions. These findings will be used to show how the holistic study of multilayer networks, as opposed to focusing on each network individually, enhances our ability to design and evaluate economic and regulatory interventions, and prevent unwanted equilibria or learning outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This iron is supplied by dust that is carried from land out across the ocean by strong winds, or by volcanic activity deep within the ocean.  However, large areas of the ocean are very remote from both land and deep-sea volcanic activity, and the amount of iron that reaches these areas is quite small.  In these regions microscopic life is often limited by the very low concentrations of iron that characterize this environment.  To use iron, microbes must first extract it from seawater.  To do this, some microbes have the ability to manufacture unique organic compounds called siderophores that are specifically designed to capture iron from seawater and transport it into the cell.  The presence of siderophores in seawater acts as a signal to know where in the ocean iron may be limiting microbial productivity.<br/><br/>US GEOTRACES program is a cooperative, multi-investigator effort to make high quality, high-resolution measurements of metal concentrations across representative sections of major ocean basins.  GEOTRACES data will serve as a benchmark against which future measurements, made as the ocean responds to climate change, can be referenced.  Most biologically important metals in the ocean are bound to organic compounds such as siderophores, and the goals of our project are to identity and measure these metal-organic complexes at the molecular level on a section across the South Pacific and Southern Oceans between Tahiti and Antarctica.  The section will consist of ~ 30 evenly spaced sites where samples of seawater will be collected from the surface to the bottom of the ocean.  Trace-metal organic complexes will be extracted from these samples and analyzed in the laboratory for iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, manganese, and iodine containing complexes.  The molecular identities, concentrations and water column distributions of these complexes will be determined and used to assess how microbes acquire and use trace metals and other nutrients.  In parallel, select samples will also be collected and analyzed for microbial genomes to provide information on which classes of microbes manufacture and use siderophores to acquire iron.  Data will be archived in national and international databases.  The project activities will help train the next generation of marine scientists and inform the public about how science can inform us about the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Until recently, bacteria were considered the main degraders of organic matter, while non-bacterial consumers? role in carbon cycling was largely been ignored.  However, eukaryotes such as fungi exhibit distinct metabolic capacities and responses to environmental variables, suggesting global change may alter the balance of microbial activities in the oceans and potentially alter the fate of marine carbon.  Here, researchers integrate field data with modeling and laboratory experiments with representative cultures to identify microbes? functional roles in marine organic matter degradation and to determine their response to changing environmental conditions.  This project will open new windows into the diversity of microbial metabolisms and how these dynamics will shift with global change driven increases in temperature and other environmental factors. Additionally, this projects builds a new scientific research team and expands scientific training at levels ranging from K-5 teachers, to undergraduate and PhD students.<br/> <br/><br/>This project will leverage a decade-long, coastal microbial time series, the Piver?s Island Coastal Observatory (PICO), to examine how diverse heterotrophic microbial communities (bacteria, phytoplankton, fungi and Labyrinthulomycetes protists) metabolize carbon compounds under different thermal regimes. This project will develop a model microbial consortium that has the potential to transform perception of carbon cycling in coastal systems by integrating functional, organismal-interaction and environment-dependent responses into a modeling framework. Empirical Dynamic Modeling will identify drivers of the observed dynamics, differentiate causation from correlation, infer effects of possibly unobserved variables (e.g. predation), and quantify interactions between organisms. This data will further be used to develop a culturable model consortium whose members metabolize distinct components of phytoplankton-derived organic matter. To test both model predictions and how well the consortium represents complex microbiomes, both the model consortium and a ?wild? coastal seawater microbiome will be assayed for changes in function (phytoplankton DOM degradation) as temperatures increase (+4 C). These experiments will compare outcomes for individual isolates, the consortium, and a wild coastal microbiome in composition/abundance, gene expression and degradation of specific compounds. Finally, experimental results will be used to parameterize and refine an Ensemble Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics model that can predict the fate and transformation of carbon in marine systems under varying climate scenarios. While this research leverages existing expertise in marine microbiomes, this model consortium approach can be applied to diverse systems to answer questions about environmental filtering, organismal interactions and functional diversity critical to predicting ecosystem-level responses to environmental change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the computational tools to analyze and manipulate the massive-scale species biogeography data has not been fully developed. Historically, classifications of biogeographic regions were based on descriptions of the ecology, taxonomic composition or vegetation features of regions. Recent approaches provided more quantitative, and objective classifications, but broadly recapitulated earlier efforts and overlooked the evolutionary implications captured by the shared phylogenetic relationships of species. Because the field of biogeography has traditionally developed as an observational science rather than an experimental one, developing replicable analytical tools for biogeography into reproducible workflows is critical. The R software package phyloregion ? designed for biogeographic regionalization and macroecology ? can overcome these computational challenges. It contains tools for biogeographical regionalization, macroecology, conservation, and visualization, and has potential application in various disciplines including evolution, microbial diversity, systematics, ecology, phylogenetics, and many others. In this project, the research team plans to substantially increase computational efficiency of functions in phyloregion, to add new functionality, and create a model for user-guided software development in biogeography.<br/><br/>The project will develop and implement new tools in phyloregion for biome evolution and biogeographical investigations. Novel Grade of Membership model that represents sampling units as partial memberships in multiple groups will be established to analyze large biogeographic datasets. It will extend phyloregion with new tools to visualize patterns of biogeography, macroecology and evolution. Phyloregion will be enhanced to pass objects between R and RevBayes (a C++ tool for Bayesian phylogeography) for phylogeographic visualization through R. Finally, it will introduce new tools for conservation that reflect the key dimensions of phylogenetic diversity including richness, divergence and regularity. Phyloregion is already widely used and represents one of only a few biogeographical resources in R tailored for megaphylogenies and macroecological datasets. This research will create new, open-source, and freely distributed software tools with potential for transformative impact in biogeography and beyond. Workshops and conferences will be used for dissemination, and to provide introduction to intermediate R coding and implementation of biogeographical tools. Workshops will target a mix of faculty, postdocs, and especially graduate and undergraduate students, who will be trained on the use and application of phyloregion in their research, and to help develop their own novel biogeographic functions to assemble into an R package. The research team will work with existing diversity programs at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi and Southeastern to recruit diverse undergraduate participants, and provide resources for them to learn about graduate school. All products from this project will be disseminated free and open-sourced through computer codes, publications, conferences, workshops and vignettes. Phyloregion vignettes will be used to create an upper-division course for undergraduate and early graduate students.

Frailty is an aging syndrome related to low physiological reserves in organs and systems and is associated with increased risk of hospitalization, adverse therapy outcomes, disability, and mortality. The proposed application of the technology is to risk stratify hospitalized and community dwelling older adults and will be implemented through a smartwatch and smartphone to measure frailty in under 5 minutes.  Monitoring technologies, such as the proposed frailty score, have the potential to improve older people?s safety, manage their health and assist them in maintaining their independence. Additionally, these technologies hold the promise of enormous cost savings for the healthcare system by enhancing the ability of providers to provide timely intervention prior to a patient?s deterioration requiring acute care.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel objective sensor-based frailty assessment tool. In this frailty tool, for the first time, instead of assessing characteristics of physiological systems in basal resting-state conditions, a provocative physical stress test will be employed to quantify the level of physiological reserve within and across cardiac and motor systems. Biomechanics approaches including muscle model and heart rate dynamics analysis will be used to characterize motor and cardiac system behaviors. In addition, the proposed technology may be used to assess dynamic interactions between the motor and cardiac systems using state space reconstruction of motor and heart rate behaviors within the stress-response model. The test takes 60 seconds to perform (repetitive and fast elbow flexion) and can provide the frailty score immediately after the test. The proposed approach has been validated cross-sectionally using comprehensive frailty assessment approaches that take 45-60 minutes and longitudinally based on adverse hospital/treatment outcomes, readmission, and mortality.  In addition to the sensor-based frailty score, the technology has been transformed from more expensive equipment to a simple smartwatch platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each step may be optimized, yet for a step there may be uncertainty about the larger context of its contribution that if known during production would allow for greater efficiencies, better quality, and improved productivity.  If a global system analysis and optimization could, in addition, be conducted cooperatively with each step during production, the end product and overall production would greatly benefit. Advances in hybrid distributed control and optimization, in highly networked cyber-physical systems, and in artificial intelligence and machine learning have opened new opportunities in cyber-enabled manufacturing.  This Future Manufacturing Research Grant (FMRG) CyberManufacturing project connects and coordinates the ensemble of various manufacturing processes, operating at different manufacturing stages under a cyber-coordinated close-knit system, defined by an analytical framework, known as STREAM, a multi-stage distributed future manufacturing system. This project provides a public online repository that hosts the STREAM data, models, simulators, controllers, analytics, and empirical studies, and that facilitates sharing research experiences about STREAM with the research and industry communities. The project creates new outreach and workforce development activities for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as working professionals in the field of manufacturing. These research results will be included in the university curriculum for  advanced manufacturing, architecture design, machine learning, simulation, and system control and optimization. <br/><br/>This project is an interdisciplinary research project with three interconnected research tasks: (1) STREAM architecture design and implementation. There is a novel bridging middleware architecture to enable seamless machine interoperability, and software- and hardware-based accelerators will be built to enable efficient communication and computing in cyber-manufacturing systems. (2) STREAM modeling and quality control. There is a novel multi-layer functional graphical model to address the high-dimensional functional dependencies over STREAM machines and a spatial-temporal iterative learning control method to achieve an accurate and efficient process quality control. (3) STREAM simulation and production control. To handle the multi-level dynamic process interactions in the system that collectively meet process quality, cost, and resource constraints, there are coordinated, high-fidelity multi-resolution simulators, assisting with the hybrid control of STREAM production. These research tasks are validated in an open-source additive manufacturing testbed for the manufacture of high energy/power density supercapacitors. The modeling and analysis methodologies form a rigorous basis for continuous improvement of quality, manufacturability, and productivity of future multi-stage and distributed manufacturing systems.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS) in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and the Divisions of Civil. Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) and Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Resilient-NET takes an integrated technical-social-climate perspective to bring together disparate disciplines and traditionally isolated networks to address the multitude of challenges faced by urban dwellers. This network integrates climate models into risk and urban logistics models, addresses reliability and logistics problems associated with supply chains, and explores coupling among climate, infrastructural and social systems. Resilient-NET catalyzes new cross-disciplinary global collaborations, synergizes complementary scientific expertise, and provides critical access to one-of-its-kind pilot projects, data, platforms, and research capabilities for U.S. researchers to make global impacts and strengthen their leadership roles on emerging challenges in building resilience into future urban socio-technical systems. Resilient-NET creates a roadmap towards future resilient urban ecosystems, to generate societal impacts on the livability and economic viability of American cities. Participating networks include world-renowned research centers on urban resilience from Asia and Europe, cross-disciplinary U.S. research communities, NSF-funded networks on Extreme Events Research, United Nations? Habitat Program, and stakeholders from the industry sectors of IoT, Smart Cities technologies and National Labs.<br/><br/>This collaboration identifies key research gaps and enabling capabilities in building urban resilience through an integrated technical-social-climate approach. The design activities are organized into three clusters. Cluster 1 focuses on how digital space?the skeletons of future urban cybernetic organisms?can be enhanced and used to improve future urban resilience research; Cluster 2 identifies the new types of convergence research structures needed to improve social resilience in urban environments and address coupled infrastructure and social systems; and Cluster 3 accelerates the understanding of the impacts of extreme events on future urban social-technical systems, and identify the missing capabilities that enable future resilience of dense urban environments evolving with climate change, infrastructure redevelopment, and digitization of physical infrastructure. Addressing these societally important challenges fosters convergence research from data science, logistics, social science, civil engineering, geosciences, and climatology, with a scope and magnitude beyond the capabilities of a single research community. International networks established via Resilient-NET are essential to accelerating the discovery of knowledge in this space through early access to new data and platforms currently only available from global partners and through collaborative efforts which promote knowledge, data, and best practice sharing.<br/><br/>The Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations. The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts. This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
