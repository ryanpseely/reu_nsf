Understanding CME evolution is particularly important as they are major drivers of severe space weather. The low-corona segment of the CME structure is known as the coronal dimming: an area dominated by short-lived open magnetic field that grows and decays as the magnetic field is dragged out into interplanetary space. To understand CME evolution as a whole, one has to study the evolution of dimmings in conjunction with the CME morphology and its physical properties from the solar corona all the way to the Earth. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the CME and dimming evolution through initial 50 events using solar observing satellites including Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO). The CME morphology and magnetic structure will also be investigated using the Potential Field Source Surface and Graduated Cylindrical Shell models. The CME properties will be identified in the solar wind data and linked to geomagnetic disturbance values on Earth. Another 150 dimmings will be added to the event catalog and related to CME solar wind properties and geomagnetic observations on Earth. The project will support NSF-sponsored REU students and NOAA-sponsored Hollings summer students will be responsible for data preparation and testing. The dimming event catalog will be made publicly available as part of the Big Earth Data Initiative project to improve rapid and long-term access to key data to support research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The amount of time this transit takes is also the amount of time available for chemical reaction to occur. At the same time, the exact path that rain takes through watersheds - whether through shallow soils or deep, fractured bedrock - influences which reactions occur and at what rates. Consequently, observations of river water chemistry can be described equally well by models that attribute all variation to changes in either flow paths or flow rates. This ambiguity is problematic as the predicted effects of climate change on water resources are different depending upon the exact processes governing flow and reaction. To provide new insights into the controls on river water chemistry, this project will develop new approaches for analyzing variations in chemistry over time to separate the effects of flow paths from flow rates. The project will engage undergraduate students through an engineering design course, internships, and public outreach on local water quality issues.<br/><br/>This work will leverage the information content of time-series data to constrain the coupled timescales of subsurface water transit and solute acquisition. To avoid some of the assumptions embedded in past work, non-parametric approaches will be used to infer geochemical kinetics and solute generation mechanisms. After being validated against 2-D numerical and analog experiments, the analysis approach will be used to elucidate the role of Critical Zone structure in the climate-weathering feedback as well as account for the non-linear behavior of trace element and isotopic proxies to improve mixing models. The results of these applications will be used to inform a new global analysis of weathering processes and their implications for planetary habitability with a timescale-agnostic framework for comparing terrestrial and marine systems. To lower barriers to collecting time-series data, undergraduate engineering design teams will develop a design-for-purpose autosampler.

The research will be performed in a multilateral international partnership that unites the University of Delaware, US, the National Aerospace University in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and the West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin, Poland. US portion of the collaborative effort will be co-funded by Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Communications and Information Foundations Program (CCF).  <br/><br/>The proposed effort aims at: (a) establishing a partnership among academic research teams from Ukraine, Poland, and the US; (b) building a resilient and collaborative research and education program of excellence in Ukraine in machine learning (ML) for satellite lidar sensing of Earth; and (c) exploring radically new concepts in generative compression for the storage or communication of compressive lidar measurements. The methods will be applied to data obtained from a new generation of satellite lidars, coined compressive lidars (CS lidar), that will be used to unravel the topological structure of the Earth?s surface and its forests, which have a profound effect on ecosystem processes. Spaceborne lidars today are limited in spatial resolution and coverage since laser reflections are only measured along 1D footprint line scans. Compressive lidars take sparse measurements of Earth from hundreds of km above Earth to then computationally reconstruct the 3D imagery with resolution and coverage, as if the data was collected from just hundreds of meters in height. To date, satellite lidars do not use data compression to avoid loss of information. CS lidars, however, rely on deep learning reconstruction algorithms covering orders of magnitude larger areas of Earth where the opportunity of data compression arises naturally. This project will thus explore radically new approaches to data compression using generative models which have shown the potential to produce more accurate image reconstructions at much deeper compression levels. The project will recruit a fresh cohort of talent in Ukraine and Poland who will be galvanized to embark on enduring careers that revolve around the intersection of machine learning and Earth remote sensing. <br/><br/>Spaceborne lidar is an important imaging technology that is used to unravel the topological structure of the Earth?s surface and its forests which have a profound effect on ecosystem processes that determine nutrient, water, and carbon cycles on Earth. Spaceborne lidars today are limited in spatial resolution and coverage since laser reflections are only measured along 1D footprint line scans. In between these, vast amounts of landscape remain without sampling illumination. To overcome this limitation, a new generation of satellite lidars are being developed at NASA taking on a radically new sensing paradigm where the traditional 1D line scanning is abandoned and replaced by sparse and wide-field-of view lidar illumination, coined compressive satellite (CS) lidars. The objective is to compressively sense Earth from hundreds of km above Earth to then computationally reconstruct the 3D imagery with resolution and coverage, as if the data was collected from just hundreds of meters in height. NASA?s satellite lidars to date do not use data compression of the measurements to avoid loss of information. CS lidar, however, relies on deep learning reconstruction algorithms covering orders of magnitude larger areas of Earth where the opportunity of data compression arises naturally. NASA?s CS lidar team is currently not exploring this problem and thus the proposed exploratory research effort is valuable, complementary, and timely. While traditional image compression relies on hand-crafted encoder/decoder pairs, the research team will explore radically new approaches to data compression using generative models which have shown the potential to produce more accurate image reconstructions at much deeper compression levels. CS lidars promise to significantly enhance both the field-of-view and imaging resolution of satellite altimetry where data compression becomes increasingly important.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's novelties are its focus on shallow embeddings, which have been shown to enable simpler reasoning techniques, and mixed embeddings, which have been shown to serve as a good interface for different languages/tools. The project's impacts include providing a simple framework for mechanically reasoning about functional correctness as well as providing more insight into embedding techniques.<br/><br/>This project focuses on three tasks. First, the investigator and his group will develop a tool that translates C code to mixed embeddings that enable equational reasoning.

They can dissipate and store mechanical power but cannot generate positive net power. The lack of power generation limits movements that require the user to move against gravity, such as going upstairs or transitioning from sitting to standing.  This lack of power may induce uneven loads in the body, which can increase the likelihood of chronic back pain and increase the effort to walk. Active prostheses have the potential to overcome these fundamental challenges. However, commercially available powered prostheses are heavier, noisier, more expensive, and generally less accessible than unpowered versions. The overall goal of this project is to reimagine existing rigid prosthetic components as compliant mechanisms that reduce mass, energy consumption, audible noise, and part count of powered prostheses. Muscles take advantage of the elasticity of tendons (in series with the muscle) and ligaments (in parallel with the muscle) to efficiently transfer power from the muscle to the joints. This project will provide a new understanding of how to engineer elastic components in parallel with electric motors as engineered ligaments to make powered prostheses more attractive and accessible.<br/><br/>The performance and behavior of compliant mechanisms depend on three fundamental factors: 1) material properties, 2) geometry, and 3) load-deflection response. This project will develop new knowledge to design the load-deflection response and geometry of compliant mechanisms that connect in parallel with electric motors to reduce motor torque. This reduction implies lighter, more energy-efficient, and quieter prostheses, as it requires lower reduction ratios, fewer gears meshing, lighter motors, and less heat dissipation. This collaborative project between the University of Notre Dame and Brigham Young University will establish two scientific contributions: 1) a robust convex optimization framework to design the load-deflection response of a parallel spring that guarantees motor torque reduction in multiple locomotion activities despite parametric uncertainty (e.g., user mass, walking speed); and 2) a design framework for compliant mechanisms with optimal load-deflection profiles to reimagine existing rigid components and implement the benefits of parallel compliance without a tradeoff in terms of mechanical complexity or extra components. The application of these innovations will result in an Open-Source Compliant Ankle, with open-source designs available online that complement the existing NSF-funded Open-Source Leg. The research team will collaborate with non-profit organization 2ft Prosthetics and local Amputee Support Groups to incorporate the feedback from prosthetic users, manufacturers, and clinicians into new designs. The outcomes of this research will include the organization of a conference workshop, new content in a graduate-level class on Wearable Robotics, and a 3-week summer program for local middle schoolers interested in STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In both low dimensional topology and operator K-theory, the PI will use analytic tools to study questions about these spaces, such as how they are curved or how objects can be embedded inside them.

In operator algebras, this project focuses on studying their K-theory and its applications to invariants in geometry and topology. The K-theory groups of operator algebras are the targets of index maps of elliptic operators and have important applications to the geometry and topology of manifolds. This project involves studying the K-theory of certain C*-algebras and using them to study infinite dimensional spaces; studying the noncommutative geometry of groups that act on these infinite dimensional spaces and, in particular, the strong Novikov conjecture for these groups; and studying the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for high dimensional expanders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although found in everyday materials from tires to paints, polymer nanocomposites also have future potential as advanced functional materials in applications from energy storage to water purification.  This research will provide a fundamental understanding of chemistry, physics and engineering principles that can be brought together to investigate a new type of composite containing a mixture of charged polymers and particles coated with similar or different charged polymers to achieve properties not possible with traditional composites.   In short, the overall goal is to promote the progress of science leading to new and improved advanced materials.  One fundamental issue is controlling molecular interactions that determine how particles are distributed in a composite material. One challenge with this ?mixing? approach is a tendency for particles to aggregate.  To overcome this limitation, a second fundamental issue in this study is the fabrication of highly loaded composites where the polymer is incorporated into a scaffold, analogous to water swelling a sponge.  To accelerate the discovery of new materials, a smart experimental approach will be used where data will be characterized and fed back immediately to formulate a new composite.  This process is continued until the optimum formulation is found.  Students performing this research will gain valuable skills in data science, enhancing career opportunities, and learn to utilize valuable resources (materials, equipment) sustainably. Graduate and undergraduate students also participate in annual public events including Nanotechnology Day at Penn,  Philly Materials Day, and the Philadelphia Science Festival.  A particularly unique program is ?First Exposure to Research in STEM,? which provides a structure for introducing first-generation, low-income students to their first research project. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Polymer nanocomposite (PNC) structure determines their properties. However, the full potential of PNCs is hindered by lack of control over structure-property relationships, partly due to the prevalence of non-equilibrium structures. Here, PNCs containing discrete nanoparticles (NP) in a polymer matrix or those fabricated from bicontinuous, nanoporous scaffolds are designed, processed and characterized to understand their fundamental thermodynamic, interfacial, and dynamic principles.  The objectives of this work are to (1) elucidate how brush charge density affects NP dispersion in polyelectrolyte (PE) matrices of varying charge and polarity and explore kinetic pathways towards percolated structures, (2) investigate infiltration kinetics of polar polymers into scaffolds, and (3) develop autonomous experimentation (AE) to accelerate discovery of PNCs with distinct structures. Aim 1 investigates PE-NPs in polymer matrices of increasing polarity. Aim 1a studies PE-NP/matrix miscibility to provide insight into brush-matrix electrostatic interactions. Aim 1b studies phase separation to guide the  identification of kinetic pathways that produce percolation of charged brushes. Aims 2a and 2b investigate bicontinuous metal and polymer scaffolds, respectively, infiltrated with polar matrix polymers. Infiltration kinetics and properties are studied as a function of pore confinement and scaffold type. The significance of these studies involves the discovery of pathways for fabricating (bi)continuous structures for enhanced energy storage or water purification applications. In Aim 3, AE-optical microscopy will be used to map the phase diagram of PNCs, whereas AE-GISAXS, in collaboration with scientists from Brookhaven National Laboratory, will identify materials and processing conditions that produce percolated PNC structures with advantageous mechanical properties and conductivity.  In summary, fundamental studies of PNCs) combined with data-science-driven characterization will act synergistically to advance knowledge for materials discovery in this project.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Generative AI systems are built on unimodal and multimodal combinations of language, speech, and vision machine learning models. Generative AI models such as the chatbot ChatGPT and the text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion offer innovative and practical tools. However, this technology has inherent problems. Generative AI models learn implicit associations and cognitive errors documented in psychology from large-scale sociocultural data. Generative AI error pose implications for performance disparities in AI, as well as AI ethics, particularly concerning the impact of generative AI on individuals and society. Outputs from easily accessible generative AI models contain associations and errors that amplify issues that are challenging to mitigate for both AI developers and users. This project will develop methods for evaluating associations and errors in generative AI, assess the impact of generative AI on society, and analyze how generative AI shapes human cognition and agency. The project will advance knowledge by developing methods to address bias in machines, human-AI collaboration, and society. The open-source tools and materials presented by this award will raise awareness among a range of stakeholders, including the student populations, researchers, developers, industry, the open-source community, AI users, policymakers, and the public. This effort will enhance AI education at the University of Washington by introducing a generative AI ethics curriculum across disciplines and divisions. The scientific evidence produced by this award will inform policymakers on the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI. <br/><br/>This project will integrate computer and information science research in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, speech processing, and human-AI interaction with methodologies and large-scale datasets from social cognition. The project's primary objective is to empirically analyze the societal impact of generative AI, contributing to the ethical and responsible development and deployment of AI. The project seeks to evaluate and characterize associations and errors in generative AI systems by developing principled and generalizable detection and measurement methods. Leveraging the findings and current evaluation methods, the research will devise approaches that automatically identify and reduce these signals in generative AI models, taking into account the specific task, application, context, and use case. These approaches will encompass techniques such as training data augmentation, embedding space processing, fine-tuning, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from feedback. By examining generative AI biases in comparison to implicit and explicit biases of humans at the state and country levels and identifying emergent generative AI errors, the project will uncover the broader societal impact of generative AI. The analysis of changes in human implicit association test scores and decisions following exposure to generative AI outputs will assess their influence on human perception and decisions in human-AI collaboration. Accordingly, the award will develop novel approaches that align generative AI with human values by introducing new associations to mitigate the negative consequences caused by generative AI errors. The potential advancements resulting from this award extend beyond computer and information science, providing tools and insights for cognitive science, psychology, linguistics, sociology, and political science, while informing fields such as philosophy, law, and policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For such safety-critical domains, the current toolkits usually fall short in uncertainty quantification, a key feature that is necessitated for informed decision-making. Given the enormous data collected by IoT devices on-the-go, scalability is another key enabler of real-time IoT sensing and management with low latency. Further, how to endow learning with adaptivity and robustness to unpredictable dynamics in IoT is of utmost importance, especially with humans-in-the-loop. Before embracing the full potential of safety-critical IoT, novel tools have to be developed to address these major challenges. Towards this goal, this CAREER proposal advocates fundamental research that aspires to advance the current tools for real-time IoT sensing and management, with direct impact on a number of safety-critical domains, including healthcare, transportation, and environmental sensing. Leveraging the PI's institutional resources, the PI will transform the proposed research goals into educational activities, through i) mentoring graduate and undergraduate students; ii) curriculum development that cross-fertilizes the fields of machine learning, communications, signal processing and networking; as well as iii) interdisciplinary collaboration with UGA's Center of Cyber-Physical Systems. This seamless integration of research and education is central to the PI's career path and is well aligned with UGA's mission ``to teach, to serve, and to inquire into the nature of things."" To further promote the societal embracing of the emergent IoT technologies, the PI is committed to disseminate the research outcomes to the general public, in particular K-12 students, through short courses, online videos, and workshops.<br/><br/><br/>This proposal puts forth an ambitious plan by tailoring advances in contemporary Bayesian machine learning tools, namely, Bayesian function approximation, Bayesian bandit optimization, and Bayesian reinforcement learning, to address the aforementioned challenges. This fresh Bayesian flavor naturally innovates existing toolkits with uncertainty quantification and robustness, essential to safety-critical IoT. The resultant approaches will not only benefit key IoT-enabled tasks, but also markedly push the envelope of these disciplines by incorporating IoT-driven constraints. Specifically, three complementary and intertwined research thrusts will be pursued. Thrust 1 (T1) puts forth a fundamental uncertainty-aware function learning framework, which not only directly benefits the prediction-oriented IoT sensing task in T1, but also contributes to Bayesian optimization for open-loop blind IoT management in Thrust 2 (T2), where the decisions made by the IoT controller do not affect the IoT state. Thrust 3 further builds on T1 and T2 to scale up Bayesian RL for real-time closed-loop IoT management with full interaction between the IoT state and the IoT controller. The ultimate pursuit is a holistic framework that integrates novel algorithms with uncertainty awareness, scalability, and adaptivity for real-time IoT sensing and management, the associated rigorous analyses for robustness to unpredictable dynamics, and the deployment to real safety-critical IoT applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They can dissipate and store mechanical power but cannot generate positive net power. The lack of power generation limits movements that require the user to move against gravity, such as going upstairs or transitioning from sitting to standing.  This lack of power may induce uneven loads in the body, which can increase the likelihood of chronic back pain and increase the effort to walk. Active prostheses have the potential to overcome these fundamental challenges. However, commercially available powered prostheses are heavier, noisier, more expensive, and generally less accessible than unpowered versions. The overall goal of this project is to reimagine existing rigid prosthetic components as compliant mechanisms that reduce mass, energy consumption, audible noise, and part count of powered prostheses. Muscles take advantage of the elasticity of tendons (in series with the muscle) and ligaments (in parallel with the muscle) to efficiently transfer power from the muscle to the joints. This project will provide a new understanding of how to engineer elastic components in parallel with electric motors as engineered ligaments to make powered prostheses more attractive and accessible.<br/><br/>The performance and behavior of compliant mechanisms depend on three fundamental factors: 1) material properties, 2) geometry, and 3) load-deflection response. This project will develop new knowledge to design the load-deflection response and geometry of compliant mechanisms that connect in parallel with electric motors to reduce motor torque. This reduction implies lighter, more energy-efficient, and quieter prostheses, as it requires lower reduction ratios, fewer gears meshing, lighter motors, and less heat dissipation. This collaborative project between the University of Notre Dame and Brigham Young University will establish two scientific contributions: 1) a robust convex optimization framework to design the load-deflection response of a parallel spring that guarantees motor torque reduction in multiple locomotion activities despite parametric uncertainty (e.g., user mass, walking speed); and 2) a design framework for compliant mechanisms with optimal load-deflection profiles to reimagine existing rigid components and implement the benefits of parallel compliance without a tradeoff in terms of mechanical complexity or extra components. The application of these innovations will result in an Open-Source Compliant Ankle, with open-source designs available online that complement the existing NSF-funded Open-Source Leg. The research team will collaborate with non-profit organization 2ft Prosthetics and local Amputee Support Groups to incorporate the feedback from prosthetic users, manufacturers, and clinicians into new designs. The outcomes of this research will include the organization of a conference workshop, new content in a graduate-level class on Wearable Robotics, and a 3-week summer program for local middle schoolers interested in STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research which aims to address these gaps by working at the intersection of bio-inspired design, systems engineering, and engineering design to establish quantitative tools for addressing system resilience when minimal information is available. Biological ecosystem characteristics will be investigated for their ability to guide system designers in the early design stages towards better response and recovery, including situations involving targeted and/or random disturbances. Ultimately, the project will develop knowledge and methods to ensure that human systems can withstand disturbances ? especially important for the critical infrastructure systems that supply our water, power, or medicines ? by safeguarding against potential failures and costly downtime. Collaborative feedback from ecologists, industry, and academic experts will ensure that the interdisciplinary work maintains each domain?s critical features. Additional deliverables from this project include a ?Walk Like an Engineer? program, which engages participants of all ages and abilities in engineering inspiration scavenger hunts through local parks, led by both a bio-inspired engineering design expert and a Nature Center host. The themed nature walks, which will focus on topics such as ?Nature?s Systems? and ?Nature?s Resilience?, will encourage participants to see themselves as design engineers learning from nature. The program will advance the United States future workforce by nurturing interdisciplinary communication skills and early interest and excitement in STEM-based design, while also teaching the public about nature and engineering in a connected manner. <br/><br/>This project supports the long-term goal of enhancing the early integration of resilience into the system design process, allowing designers to make proactive choices to create more sustainable and resilient systems that can withstand disruptions and recover effectively. The research objectives of this project are to provide quantitative tools for assessment of biological inspiration in engineering system design, extend the use of effective bio-inspiration into system recovery, and formulate practical design tools for achieving system resilience from biological ecosystem principles found to be effective. Ecological Network Analysis will provide a quantitative method for extracting desirable traits from resilient biological ecosystems (e.g., food webs) and applying them to human engineered systems. Of interest is how these traits can improve a system?s robustness and recovery, which will be tested using a variety of case study types and criticality levels, including supply chains, water distribution networks, power grids, and industrial resource networks. The most beneficial biological systems traits will be further investigated to generate fundamental engineering principles, such as the impact of topology versus weights on nature?s systems characteristics. A study of targeted versus random disturbances will provide additional insight into where these biological systems characteristics have the most value for engineering designers seeking system-level resilience. The project?s research objectives are integrated and enhanced by the project?s educational objectives: to create and foster engineering excitement before students typically self-exclude from STEM; teach the public about how nature and engineering can be connected; and create STEM access for and inclusion of students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Evaluation of the educational outreach activities will also provide important documentation for the use of nature to increase interest in engineering at all ages, as well as in underrepresented and underserved groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The widespread acceptance of these cell models, coupled with their growing commercial availability and ease of deriving patient-specific cells, have underscored their potential to revolutionize our understanding of human physiology and function. To date, however, limited techniques exist for comprehensive investigation of the properties of such cell models over time, which greatly impedes their translation for physiology investigations, disease modeling, and pharmacology research. This project will address these technical challenges and develop automated lab-on-a-chip platforms for comprehensive chronic monitoring and control of cell physiology. This will be accomplished via innovations in materials, device fabrication, circuit design, software development, and system integration. The research results represent important steps towards the next generation lab-on-a-chip health monitoring and modulation systems. If successful, the outcomes will significantly simplify the operation, expand the possibilities, and create new opportunities in many programs of biomedical research, in which automated lab-on-a-chip devices with reduced human exposure are highly demanded. The education activities will integrate with the technical developments through multidisciplinary training of students in bioelectronics research, introduction of new undergraduate courses on optoelectronic biomedical systems. Outreach plans involve lectures and designing pedagogical demonstration kits to educate K-12 students as well as active research participation by local high school students.<br/>This project will develop and validate automated lab-on-a-chip platforms that allow for direct high-content, real-time, multiparametric interrogation of multiple parallel live cell properties and their interplay at meaningful levels of spatiotemporal precision inside standard cell culture environment. The project includes three research objectives: (1) explore cellular-scale components for crosstalk-free electrical recording, stimulation, and triple-parametric fluorescence recording of in vitro live cell function. The structure-property relationships of those components will be investigated to optimize the device performance. Optical and electrochemical modeling will be performed to yield fundamental insights into their characteristics; (2) develop compact lab-on-a-chip platforms for automated, long-term, multiparametric probing of live cell models under controlled cultivation conditions. The full compatibility with incubator culturing environment is beneficial for work with dangerous pathogens, such as COVID-19, toxic substances, and radioactivity. Advanced hardware and software designs will enable independent control of each modality, fast measurement, and data analysis. This will eliminate the need of significant technical expertise to manually analyze the high-content data generated, dramatically save the time efforts, reduce error, and improve accuracy for the experimenters; (3) validate the platforms via rigorous benchtop measurements and high-content on-chip screening of induced pluripotent stem cells-derived neurons.

These systems have found applications in diverse fields, including ecology, engineering, and social sciences, yet their high-dimensional nature makes them challenging to study. This often leads to significant theoretical and computational difficulties, known as the ?curse of dimensionality.? Recent advances in applied mathematics have shed light on these complexities, revealing that complex NetID patterns can arise from low dimensional interactions. Building on these insights, this project is dedicated to developing a theoretical and computational framework to address the estimation problems within these models by exploiting the underlying low dimensional structures. The overarching goal is to create efficient, physically interpretable surrogate models that bridge the gap between qualitative analysis and quantitative data-driven applications, ranging from sensor network optimization to modeling the environmental and climate impacts on fish migration. This research program will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, featuring a graduate summer school at the intersection of NetIDs and machine learning. There will be a particular focus on engaging female and underrepresented minority students in this vibrant field, blending machine learning with differential equations. The project's findings will also enrich mathematical data science course materials for both undergraduate and graduate education.<br/><br/>This project aims to make fundamental mathematical, statistical, and computational advances for solving NetIDs' estimation problems. The research will focus on three primary areas: (1) Developing innovative sampling strategies for optimal data recovery in NetIDs with linear interactions by exploiting their inherent low-dimensionality in terms of sparsity, smoothness, low-rankness. (2) Establishing robust statistical estimation of NetIDs with nonlinear time-varying interactions by combining machine learning, numerical analysis, and functional data analysis to create physically consistent estimators that bypass the ?curse of dimensionality,? while exploring the identifiability and convergence as sample sizes increase. (3) Investigating the statistical predictive properties of Graph Neural Differential Equations, aiming to derive upper bounds for their transferability and generalization error.

Such an assumption is often violated in practice, due to e.g., adversarial perturbations, modeling error between simulator and real-world applications, non-stationary environment, and limited amount of training data. The discrepancy between the training and test environments gives rise to a model mismatch, which lead to a notable decline in performance and restrict the suitability of RL in crucial domains, e.g., healthcare, critical infrastructure, transportation systems, and smart cities. To address the above challenge, there have been noteworthy efforts to develop distributionally robust RL approaches. This CAREER project aims to advance the fundamental algorithmic and theoretic limits of distributionally robust RL. The research outcome of this project holds the promise to push the algorithmic and theoretical boundaries of robust RL, and will deliver provably convergent, efficient and minimax optimal robust RL algorithms. The project will have a significant impact on theory and practice of sequential decision making in various domains, e.g., special education, intelligent transportation system, wireless communication networks, power systems and drone networks. The activities in this project will provide concrete principles and design guidelines to achieve robustness in face of model uncertainty. The integration of research work into education and outreach will target K-12 educators, graduate, undergraduate and underrepresented students with efforts on (i) Artificial Intelligence (AI) summer camp for K-12 educators; (ii) Buffalo Day workshop; (iii) curriculum development; (iv) student supervision.<br/><br/>The research efforts are organized around three complimentary thrusts: (i) Thrust A focuses on developing theoretical and algorithmic foundations for distributionally robust RL under the long-term average-reward criterion.  (ii) Thrust B focuses on developing a unified framework of distributional robustness for learning (robust) policies from offline dataset without active data acquisition and exploration, and further uncovering their fundamental limits; (iii) Thrust C focuses on constructive approaches and fundamental limits of robust RL under constraints, i.e., optimizing reward while simultaneously guaranteeing constraints under model uncertainty. This project will develop fundamental understandings of robust RL, minimax optimal robust RL algorithms and novel technical convergence and complexity analyses. The research outcome will significantly improve the robustness of RL algorithms and will be of interest to a broad range of communities, e.g., machine learning, statistics, information theory, networking, communication, power, and education.

However, many key questions are still not fully understood. For example, most massive elliptical galaxies, among the oldest and most massive structures in the universe and hosts of supermassive black holes (SMBH), cease forming stars and transition into passively evolving systems. While the precise mechanisms underpinning such ""quenching"" are unclear, SMBHs appear to play a key role by suppressing the infall of fresh gas - the raw material of star formation - from the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The PI will conduct a computer simulation of a massive galaxy's formation and evolution with spatial resolution sufficient to resolve the CGM's complex structure and the small-scale physical processes occurring there. This work will inform and complement large-scale cosmological simulations and will provide mentoring and training for three graduate students in cutting edge galaxy simulations. Undergraduate students will also be involved, and the investigator will engage in outreach to local high schools and public planetarium shows. <br/><br/>To better understand the evolution of massive galaxies, the investigator and her group will conduct a very high- resolution numerical study using a cosmological-zoom simulation focusing on the formation of a single massive galaxy while following its evolution all the way down to the current epoch (z = 0). The major objectives of this work are to understand (1) how SMBHs form and grow in massive galaxies, (2) precisely how SMBH ""feedback"" leads to star formation quenching, (3) the structure and evolution the CGM, and (4) how the evolution of satellite galaxies is affected. The team will use the newly developed Enzo-E, which is a highly scalable redesign of the original Enzo code for the exascale era. They will develop a new state-of-the-art SMBH formation/feedback model, which will be added to the publicly available code and shared with the community. The proposed simulations will force enhanced refinement in the galaxy's CGM, providing unprecedented details of this major gas reservoir around massive galaxies, which likely plays a key role in regulating the fueling of both SMBHs and star formation. This research will provide insight into the complex interplay between SMBHs, the CGM, and star formation in a massive galaxy, and it will provide a framework for simulating the effects of (e.g.) cosmic rays, dust, and radiative transfer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, understanding clot formation and its response in the live blood environment is crucial for predicting and treating clot growth. However, predicting clot growth and rupture is challenging, as blood flow impacts the formation and composition of a clot, which in-return determines the strength of the clot and its response to flow. On the other hand, the growth and composition of the clot changes the flow as well. This award will support research striving to develop multiscale modeling tools that use powerful computers and artificial intelligence to better predict clot growth and its response to pulsatile flows, collision from blood cells, and vessel dilation. Experimental validations will be performed using 3D printed silicon based vascular network replica.  In addition, the project will integrate research and education by developing curriculum, employing innovative teaching tools like interactive notebooks to train the next generation or engineers and scientists, with a focus on underrepresented minorities, in computational thinking, high-performance computing, and machine learning.

There has been much exciting progress in the field of deep reinforcement learning in the past few years, with RL agents demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of problem domains. However, to achieve this progress, it is necessary to have access to a fast simulator and tens or hundreds of millions of data points that are collected, trained on, then thrown away. Off-policy methods are an alternative approach, which provide much more data efficiency because they are not restricted to only training on on-policy data and can even be used to train on existing offline data. This suggests that to truly unlock the potential of reinforcement learning, we must develop principled off-policy algorithms. This project is focused on advancing RL by looking at a framework that aims to provide a unified, principled objective that applies to both standard and off-line RL settings and will allow us to efficiently solve large-scale, real-world, sequential decision-making problems.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will examine the dual formulation of this objective, which gives rise to a principled off-policy objective that sidesteps issues present in the more commonly used primal formulation. This objective will lead to algorithms particularly suitable for large state-action spaces, long horizons, and sparse rewards encountered in real-world problems. The PI will explore connections between existing and new imitation learning and reinforcement-learning methods and the proposed framework. The PI will show that both imitation learning and reinforcement learning methods are unified under this objective and present theoretical guarantees for this class of methods. Finally, the PI will extend the dual framework to leverage pre-training and fine tuning for improved sample efficiency. This includes exploring methods for incorporating out-of-domain datasets and multiple modalities in self-supervised pre-training, especially relevant for applications in household robotics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Various scientific reports emphasize the critical need for decarbonization technologies such as carbon capture to mitigate CO2 emissions and combat climate change. However, conventional heat-based carbon capture systems face technical challenges that limit their utility, including high energy requirements and the thermal degradation of absorbent materials. Electrochemical carbon capture (ECC) processes are being developed as an alternative to thermal-based processes. ECC processes are advantageous because they can operate at moderate temperatures and are plug-and-play and modular. ECC processes are also more efficient than similar thermal processes, relying solely on electricity potentially sourced entirely from renewables. This project will develop an innovative ECC process that employs engineered soft interfaces for a scalable, modular, and environmentally sustainable method of CO2 separation. This approach advances carbon capture science and supports the National Science Foundation's mission to promote scientific progress and national health by directly addressing CO2 emission mitigation. The project's educational and outreach initiatives, embedded in the investigator?s Climate Learning Integration in Modern Education model, aim to inspire future STEM generations. These initiatives will be particularly impactful within underrepresented communities because they integrate cutting-edge research into the educational content through project-based learning, fostering a well-informed and environmentally conscious society.<br/><br/>The project aims to advance ECC by employing engineered soft interfaces at liquid-liquid interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions. This novel approach addresses current ECC process performance limitations, such as the reliance on costly ion-selective membranes and oxygen gas sensitivity. These engineered interfaces will be developed and optimized for enhanced CO2 separation performance and system energetics. State-of-the-art scanning electrochemical microscopy will assess the interface performance, ensuring precision and innovation in the research methodology. The broader implications of this work extend to various electrochemical applications, including electrochemical-based water treatment and energy storage. Furthermore, integrating this research with STEM education through novel educational modules offers an effective platform for knowledge dissemination and student engagement in climate change solutions. Specifically, undergraduate pre-service STEM teachers will participate in the research through project-based learning techniques, which can inform the development of their curricula.

Compared to traditional search engines, they provide a coherent narrative, which could potentially facilitate the exploratory phase of users' searches. Generative AI responses are more readable, coherent, and contextually appropriate; hence, they sound authoritative and definitive. However, existing generative AI models are subject to problems such as hallucinations, unsupported misleading answers, outright misinformation, and hidden biases. Another issue is that the majority of user queries are ambiguous. Current systems, including those that employ generative AI models, do not appropriately consider ambiguity by providing users with alternative answers to their queries. The vision of this project is to enable users to use generative AI models to obtain an interpretable, diverse, and unbiased set of alternative answers, viewpoints, subtopics, or aspects as required for various questions or tasks in information access, where each distinct answer or viewpoint is faithfully attributable to a set of evidence and supporting information sources. This project aims to make information access easier, more effective, and more trustworthy for users. Given that search is among the most common online activities, this project is positioned to have a substantial impact on society, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of topics, encouraging critical thinking, and facilitating informed decision-making.<br/><br/>To achieve the above goal, this project proposes the development of novel retrieval models to enhance the relevance, diversity, and interpretability of their results. This project will develop models for multi-granular diversification of search results to significantly improve the generalizability of retrieval models in providing diverse results for open-domain queries. In addition, this project enables the full utilization of search results by AI systems through explanations of their relevance and diversity. Building on top of explainable search results, the project introduces explanation-based optimization of search results. This involves improving search results based on reasoning over failures of retrieval models. The resulting retrieval systems will be particularly useful for augmenting large generative AI models through access to explainable explicit knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their ubiquity, ripples preserved in the geological record are invaluable to interpret past or remote climates, atmospheric conditions and fluvial regimes. In this context, understanding how ripples form is crucial to relate their size to environmental factors. According to conventional wisdom, decameter-scale dunes and decimeter-scale ripples on Earth emerge from clearly different processes related to wind motion and sand transport. However, recent experiments shattered this clean distinction by showing the emergence of an unexplained second type of wind ripple, somehow akin to water ripples and large ripples on Mars. The proposed investigation of this potentially ubiquitous new type of bedform can alter the interpretation of ripples in the field and the geological record, and shed light into some unexplored complexities of sediment transport. Broader impacts include the development of several public exhibits intended for K-12 students and educators, in collaboration with outreach experts at TAMU. The project will also provide research and educational opportunities for two early career principal investigators and undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This research will investigate the emergence of these new ?hydrodynamic? (also called ?drag?) ripples on Earth using a combination of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and grain-scale transport simulations. The goal is to uncover the physical mechanisms controlling the origin and scaling of meso-scale bedforms (ripples) on Earth, and by extension, on water and other planetary bodies such as Mars, Titan and Venus. The three objectives are: validate and calibrate Hanratty?s hydrodynamic model, estimate the transport saturation length, and explain the transition from ?impact? to ?hydrodynamic? ripples. The central hypotheses are that there is a hidden sub-scale modulation of the aeolian transport layer that can explain the new observations and that hydrodynamic-driven instabilities become less relevant at a large enough grain size, for which only ?impact? ripples are to be expected.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching premise of this research project is that the current organization of design teams around analysis disciplines (e.g., thermal analysis, structural analysis) or around physical components (e.g., engine, battery, exterior body) may not be the ideal way to architect human-AI teams. Considering the differences between humans and AI systems in terms of their capabilities, there may be alternative ways to divide tasks and responsibilities in system-level design problems among humans and artificial members within a team. This research will contribute to the field of design science through a systematic and comprehensive analysis of team architectures in hybrid human-AI teams and the impact of those different architectures on design outcomes. Rather than assuming a pre-defined role for AI, this project will follow a top-down Systems Engineering approach to identify best practices for defining roles for AI in a design team using computational models of human and AI decision-making processes. An experimental study using a video game platform will engage human users to work alongside AI teammates in solving a design problem to assess the impact of human factors in this context as well. The findings will inform how AI technology should be integrated into the engineering design workforce with proper task allocation in order to reduce system development time and costs for future enterprises in multiple industries, spanning from smart healthcare to defense. The project will generate broader impacts by engaging a diverse group of undergraduate students into research using the STEM-SI program at Lehigh University. Integrated with the research program, the education plan will improve pedagogical practices in statistics and machine learning for engineering systems applications using e-training games. Outreach workshops within local communities will attract broader interest in data science by engaging middle school girls in data-related challenges in engineering using the CHOICES program at Lehigh University. <br/><br/>This research addresses the lack of fundamental principles to guide task partitioning and division of labor for hybrid human-AI teams, accounting not only for heterogeneity among decision-makers (represented by a select set of characteristics), but also for important human factors. The project will use multi-agent simulations to model generalized agents that solve context-free design problems following Bayesian decision-making processes. These agents will be characterized in terms of task performance, self-confidence, and confidence in other team members. A computational analysis will use various problem partitioning and task assignment strategies from decomposition-based design and machine learning to quantify their impact on team collaboration considering diverse agent characteristics. Mirroring this simulation scenario, behavioral experiments on an electric vehicle design and control game will present a collaborative design decision-making problem for hybrid human-AI teams with alternative task allocation scenarios in a controlled setting. These experiments will collect behavioral data that capture the effects of human factors, including bias, workload, and job satisfaction, and that will be used to validate or refine the computational findings. As a by-product, this research will develop an open infrastructure to study human-AI collaboration in design teams by sharing the experimental platform with the broader scientific community. This project will also integrate video game platforms developed for the behavioral study into existing mechanical engineering courses and data bootcamps to teach undergraduate and graduate students data analytics. Outreach workshops will use the same game platforms to increase data literacy and promote STEM careers among middle school girls.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerous infectious disease outbreaks over the past two decades have demonstrated the need for epidemiological modeling. They also revealed shortcomings of existing scientific techniques to accurately predict epidemic dynamics and to devise effective control strategies. This project will establish a new efficient simulation method that makes it possible to assess rare but highly consequential events. It will be used to identify decisive risk factors concerning the fabric of virus-spreading interactions that can facilitate large epidemic outbreaks. A well-documented example are superspreading events that played an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigations will be focused on models for diseases similar to COVID-19 and HIV as archetypal cases. The improved understanding and models of epidemiological processes will be used to devise and analyze efficient preventive strategies with the goal of providing more reliable guidance for the general public and health-policy decision makers, saving lives and resources.<br/><br/>Traditionally, the dynamics of infectious diseases are studied on the basis of deterministic compartmental models, where the population is divided into large groups, and deterministic differential equations for the group sizes are employed to investigate disease dynamics. Classical examples are the deterministic SIR and SIS models. This is a strong simplification of reality that ignores to a large extent the heterogeneity in contact patterns and biomedically relevant attributes across the population as well as the stochastic nature of infection processes. Both have a decisive impact on the dynamics at the early stages of epidemic outbreaks and need to be incorporated to enable reliable predictions. Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods can sample more realistic stochastic agent-based dynamics, but cannot efficiently assess the preconditions leading to rare consequential events. The project will address this challenge with a new numerical technique that allows one to efficiently sample important but rare epidemic trajectories of realistic models under suitable constraints. The research will renew attention on the crucial role of rare events in the genesis of large outbreaks, including combinations of bottlenecks in contact networks and the stochastic nature of the disease dynamics. Risk-factor analysis based on the new method will provide answers to cutting-edge questions in disease diffusion concerning outbreak preconditions, information flow, and control strategies. This approach will open new avenues for research on the prevention and control of epidemics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Human Networks and Data Science program (HNDS) of the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To expand urban development, preserve property values, and avoid paying for flood insurance, real estate developers in the US request to remove properties from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regulatory floodplain, often through flood protection infrastructures such as levees and drainage. However, such infrastructures frequently divert floodwaters to others downstream, an effect that has not been well studied. Underserved communities are the most exposed but may not have the tools to challenge their underrepresentation in flood maps or zoning changes. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research which aims to advance foundational knowledge by generating observed flood data to measure if and where flood protection infrastructures change flooding patterns as well as who is affected. The project builds capacity for using satellite-based maps to counter unjust actions from flood maps and advocate for more equitable allocation of mitigation funding. This project examines past policies that have contributed to increased flood exposure of underserved communities and sheds light on their long-standing injustice.<br/><br/>As floods impact more people and properties in a changing climate, public policies must evolve to address this growing risk and prioritize protection for the most vulnerable. Current regulatory floodplain maps underrepresent flood risk in part due to reductions though the Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) policy. To evaluate the accuracy of redrawn maps, this project documents where floodplains have been reduced because of LOMR policies and builds a spatial database of flood events from multiple satellite sources between 2001 and 2023. The work will address the question of the extent to which flood protection infrastructures are responsible for amplifying inequality in flood exposure by combining census data with satellite observations and statistical models to assess if the burden of flood risk has shifted among different demographics and communities.

In response, continual learning is emerging as a promising paradigm to meet this demand. Distinct from other learning paradigms, continual learning emphasizes the ability to maintain performance on previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new information. It focuses on rapid adaptation to new environments by appropriately recalling past knowledge and actively seeking side information to accelerate learning and improve accuracy. However, current methods in continual learning are predominantly empirical and lack a clear theoretical foundation, limiting their wider application and hindering further progress. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a principled framework for continual learning, consisting of novel theoretical insights and practical algorithmic designs. The research outcomes will substantially advance our understanding of continual learning, enrich its algorithmic framework, and provide scalable algorithm packages. The outcomes will be integrated into machine learning courses at all levels, benefiting students across disciplines such as electrical engineering, statistics, and computer science.  The project will actively involve underrepresented students in STEM, synergizing research and education at undergraduate and graduate levels, and developing introductory materials for K-12 students through AI apprenticeship programs.<br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to pioneer a methodological framework of continual learning for autonomous machine learners navigating dynamic data environments. The framework addresses three essential facets of continual learning. First, it will establish mathematical foundations of continual learning and scalable online algorithms to recollect an evolving memory for fast adaptation and capability expansion. Second, it will develop methods to amplify learning efficiency from informative, even less reliable, pseudo labels. Lastly, it will develop approaches for expanding the predictive power with task-specific assistance from peer learners who possess cross-modal data. The developed foundations will lead to novel algorithms to empower intelligent engineering systems to learn more efficiently and effectively in an ever-changing world. The project will also offer deep insights into pivotal machine learning questions, such as understanding the fundamental trade-offs between adaptivity and forgetting in dynamic learning environments, gauging the maximal influences of minor yet jointly dependent data perturbations on modeling results, and quantifying a model's room for improvement when the underlying law of probability remains elusive. Furthermore, these developments are anticipated to have broader impacts, enabling resource-constrained machine learners to continually broaden their learning capabilities in complex practical applications, such as intelligent transportation systems and cellular performance management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Remarkable strides in the theory and application of this toolset over the past three decades, combined with a similarly impressive acceleration in computing capabilities, have helped proliferate the use of optimization software in science, engineering, business, and beyond. Yet, the commercial optimization solvers being utilized in practice often lack rigorous numerical guarantees which, largely unbeknownst to users, may cause them to return inconsistent results. Such outcomes can lead practitioners to draw incorrect conclusions about the problem or system being analyzed and ultimately lead to misguided and erroneous decisions. The rather unpredictable and non-negligible plausibility of these and other incorrect outcomes, which can be traced to the compounding and deleterious effects of roundoff errors, detracts from the implicit trust placed on optimization solvers, and it is specially concerning as these cyberinfrastructures are being widely employed on ever larger and more numerically complex problems. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will seek to establish the next generation of optimization solvers with robust numerical guarantees by integrating and building on a mature suite of algorithms for avoiding roundoff errors at low computational cost. The envisioned contributions will result in reliable, open-source optimization solvers that will be made available to academics, practitioners, and the public at large. In addition, the project will design and launch a recruitment and multi-tiered summer research internship program to increase underrepresented student engagement, build critical skills for succeeding in graduate study, and foster interdisciplinary learning communities.<br/><br/>This CAREER research project will develop rigorous theory and computational methods to enable the reliable, fail-proof solution of real-world linear programs and mixed integer programs, which is a pivotal guarantee beyond the reach of optimization solvers that work exclusively with finite-precision floating-point arithmetic. To that end, the planned activities will include transforming various inefficient subroutines based on exact rational arithmetic required to validate and/or repair optimization solver outputs, which remain the primary computational bottleneck of mixed-precision optimization solvers with numerical guarantees. The research activities will build on a suite of integer-preserving matrix factorization algorithms, which are primed to be integrated into these state-of-the-art solvers. In addition, the project will explore how to repurpose previous exact primal optimal solutions and exact dual feasible solutions to further enhance the capabilities of mixed-precision optimization solvers with numerical guarantees on numerically challenging problems. The associated activities will include deriving sparse matrix factorization updates, leveraging them to build novel local search methods, and implementing the resulting algorithms on open-source solvers. It is expected that the envisioned theoretical contributions will also have fundamental implications beyond the development of optimization software.<br/><br/>This CAREER award is jointly funded by the Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) Program of the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate and the Operations Engineering (OE) Program of the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) in the Engineering (ENG) Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will address this issue through developing and testing design principles for afterschool programs that build youths? interest in a broad range of computing careers. As part of this project, girls in middle school will co-design an afterschool robotics program, named MyTurn, in partnership with women mentors from industry and undergraduate computer science programs. While participating in MyTurn, girls will work in teams to design and program reconfigurable social robots that will perform youth-selected applications, such as providing various types of assistance to others. The research will explore whether and how different design elements of the program fostered girls? interest in computing and computing careers. The materials associated with MyTurn, as well as the design principles that informed the creation of the program, will be widely and freely disseminated through numerous professional networks that develop afterschool programming. Ultimately, the deliverables from this project are likely to advance knowledge and practice regarding broadening participation in computing careers and career pathways among girls and women who have historically been underrepresented in these fields. <br/><br/>In this Exploring Theory and Design Principles project, the University of Illinois Chicago will develop theories and principles which illustrate how stakeholders can co-design afterschool programs that increase middle school girls? interest in computing careers. These theories and design principles will be iteratively developed and tested in conjunction with the afterschool social robotics program. Mixed methods research will identify key mechanisms that positively influence youths? experiences, sense of belonging, and interest in computing and computing careers. Specifically, the project team will analyze surveys that explore youths? interest in computing and computing careers; transcripts of interviews with the youth and their mentors; videos of the participatory sessions during which women and girls co-design the afterschool program; and youth artifacts. The findings from these analyses will be disseminated widely via professional networks of computer science education researchers and practitioners. This project will result in empirically-tested design principles, which outline how educators of afterschool programs can build girls? interest in computing careers at a critical time in their trajectories, which can prepare and inspire them to pursue additional computer science experiences and courses in high school and beyond.

Of those with MCI, up to 15 percent develop dementia down the line. Unfortunately, there is an increased shortage of healthcare workers, and the cost of at-home nursing care is prohibitive. To meet this challenge, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to democratize interactive robot learning to enable care partners (e.g., spouses, children, nurses) to program and personalize a robot's behavior through intuitive modes of interaction to assist the care member (i.e., person with MCI) with activities of daily living. Robot learning is achieved using Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which is about computational methods and interfaces to enable end-users to teach robots new skills through interaction (e.g., skill demonstration). Traditional robotics deployments typically rely on a large number of experts and create robots that are expensive and not easily adapted. Instead, LfD offers a scalable alternative by leveraging efficient algorithms and interactions with non-expert end users. Despite its potential, and decades of research, LfD has not been deployed broadly, in part because these systems do not provide the care partner end-users with insights into the robot's understanding of the world or how the users can be better teachers. This award seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional robotics (such as cost and scale) and modern robot learning approaches (the fact that they are relegated to the laboratory) by enabling robot learning to be accessible and scalable to support aging in place for persons with MCI. The eventual goal is to have a robot that can be used in the home of someone with MCI to help them with their daily tasks, and that the robot can be easily programmed by someone who does not have specific technical training.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the research team will develop new LfD algorithms and interfaces in partnership with collaborators at the Cognitive Empowerment Program at Emory University, members of the MCI community, clinicians, and researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in a transdisciplinary research effort. With the oversight and input from MCI focus groups, the research team will collaboratively execute three research thrusts. First, the team will conduct transdisciplinary research to collect and open-source a first-of-its-kind, multimodal, longitudinal dataset from care partners interacting with a robot with the goal of programming it via LfD to carry out assistive tasks for care members. Second, the team will formulate novel, explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques enabling users to gain a ?theory of mind? of the robot, specifically to foster users gaining insight into the behavior of the robot while learning to collaborate via mixed-initiative LfD interactions. Third, the team will develop novel, peer-teaching LfD algorithms that enables the robot learner to develop a theory of mind about an LfD teacher (i.e. the care partner alongside the person with MCI), leverage that insight to tutor a human teacher, and provide explicit feedback for how the teacher can provide better instruction to the robot. The success of the techniques developed will be based upon improving the robot?s performance at specific tasks, reducing the amount of time required for the user to train the robot, and improving user experience in terms of workload, stress, and perceived usability of the robot. The outcome of this research will be open-source datasets, interfaces, and roadmaps guiding researchers in democratizing robots, transitioning LfD from the laboratory to the real world. Finally, the research team will also develop a new educational outreach program in partnership with high school educators to integrate robotics into their classrooms in underserved communities in Georgia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical consideration when designing longitudinal studies is a power analysis that outlines the sample sizes needed to ensure a high probability of detecting important effects of interest. However, there are no guidelines or tutorials to help applied researchers conduct such power analyses. In addition, researchers usually plan their longitudinal studies under budget constraints and there is a lack of literature providing methods of calculating optimal sample sizes under such constraints. The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive statistical framework, software tools, illustrative examples, and training materials for the optimal design of longitudinal studies in STEM education. Specifically, the statistical theory, tools, and training developed by this work will be broadly applicable to longitudinal designs for STEM education programs, and other social programs in health science, psychology, and public policy. This project contributes to STEM education by estimating design parameters for outcomes commonly used in STEM education and illustrating design and analysis methods using data from prior longitudinal studies of STEM education programs.<br/><br/>This project is designed to achieve four integrated research and education goals.  First, the investigator will develop a statistical framework to guide the power analysis and optimal sample size planning for longitudinal experimental and quasi-experimental studies in STEM education using all currently available methods, and then compare their results to help researchers select the most appropriate design and analytic methods for their longitudinal studies. Next, the project will develop empirical estimates of the design parameters using data from ongoing and prior longitudinal studies with outcomes commonly used in STEM education.  The research will execute the formulas in two new tools (i.e., PowerUpR-Growth and an R Shiny App) and develop accompanying software documentation.  Finally, this project will develop illustrative examples, training materials, and workshops on the design and analysis of longitudinal STEM education programs. The statistical framework and tools have the potential to provide a more practical and flexible way to identify more efficient longitudinal designs and assist researchers in evaluating the long-term effects of their STEM education programs.

This will be addressed by developing a deposition mechanism using multimodal powder sizes and an innovative non-contact electrostatic powder spreader. (2) Laser-powder interaction is affected by characteristics such as shape, morphology, and size distribution. The shift in the stable/unstable keyhole mode due to the shadowing effect of non-spherical powder at higher laser scan speeds will influence the process map, and mechanical interlocking of particles. Comprehensive investigations into laser-powder interactions will be undertaken, using in-situ observations such as synchrotron X-ray imaging and multi-physics modeling.

One strategy for recruiting a diverse workforce in CS is to build accessible pathways from community colleges to undergraduate CS degree programs. Community college transfer students represent a diverse, high-achieving, and often untapped pool of talented emerging computer scientists.

In response to a stimulus (such as temperature), these polymers can be repeatedly re-shaped without re-molding and re-used prior to the product?s end-of-life. Re-shapable polymers are also useful for soft robotics applications as they enable programming of the material motions via the use of a multi-material approach. The challenges are, however, to create materials with maximized ability for shape changes while controlling the morphing temperature and the materials? self-healing characteristics. This project will take advantage of the capability of dynamic covalent bonds to dissociate and re-form, and the temperature-sensitivity of this process, to support controllable material shape morphing. The project will explore the effects of chemical substitutions at a dynamic bond and other molecular parameters of polymer materials (such as polymer chemical identity, number of dynamic bonds, etc.) on material functionality. Advanced instrumental techniques will be used to study the role of molecular motion in the material morphing and self-healing properties. The project will create a fertile training ground for participating graduate, undergraduate and high-school students. The PI will work with undergraduate students to provide research experiences and will be engaged in diversity-enhancing and outreach activities with the goal of encouraging female and minority students to pursue studies in materials science and careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/><br/>PART II: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The ability to make re-processable, re-shapable polymer materials can transform the future of commodity polymers and afford novel products for advanced biomedical and soft robotics applications. This project will study dynamic covalent polymer networks based on the maleimide-furan Diels-Alder (DA) reaction and aim to uncover the main underlying principles of developing materials with desired thermomechanical and shape-morphing characteristics. The focus will be on understanding how molecular and structural characteristics of the network determine the materials? thermal, self-healing and shape-morphing properties. While the current DA polymer (DAP) materials made with 2-substituted furans (2-DAPs) suffer from low thermal stability, aging of their self-healing properties, and insufficient control of shape morphing, this project will address these challenges and develop a new family of DAP materials with practical thermal stability, self-healing and shape-morphing characteristics. This will be achieved by introducing stronger DA crosslinks (controlled by substitution in the furan ring) and understanding of the relationships between molecular parameters of the network (chain rigidity, length of the polymer strands, presence of entanglements), molecular motions and macroscopic viscoelastic properties of DAP materials. The project will involve synthesis of DAP networks using 3-substituted aminofurans (3-DAPs) with improved temperature resistivity, studies of stereochemistry and thermodynamics of DA junctions using DSC, FTIR, and NMR techniques, and exploration of the contributions of entanglements in material thermomechanical properties and self-healing properties using neutron reflectometry (NR) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching techniques. The above studies will serve as a foundation for creating shape-morphing DAP constructs with programmable morphing of their permanent shape via the mechanism of network plasticity. The main outcome of the project will be the development of the knowledge relating molecular parameters, stereochemistry of DA crosslinks, molecular diffusivity within DAP networks, and the resultant material self-healing and shape morphing characteristics. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the US has experienced a worrying increase in maternal mortality over the last two decades, resulting in the US reaching the highest rate among developed countries. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication related to high blood pressure. Each year, preeclampsia afflicts 8-10% of US pregnancies and can lead to maternal and/or neonatal death unless it is detected and treated in early stages of the pregnancy. It remains a challenge to identify women at higher risk of preeclampsia, as several factors, notably age, race, and the history of pre-pregnancy diseases, can contribute to developing the condition. This project will build innovative technologies to allow computers to understand and predict the likelihood of a woman developing preeclampsia during pregnancy, particularly among women from minority racial groups. Building such a system requires massive data, ranging from demographic to individual health records, to train the computers to predict preeclampsia. The main novelty of this project is in its capacity to learn from clinical data that are often imperfect, suffering from missing or incomplete records with possibly very little information on preeclampsia cases, and to remain fair toward subpopulations of various racial groups, including Native Americans, when predicting the risk of preeclampsia. The technologies developed in this project will also have the potential to help build tools that can help in early detection of other diseases. <br/><br/>This project investigates developing novel machine learning (ML)-based clinical decision aid tools for early detection of preeclampsia (PE). The main novelty of this project is in its capacity to effectively address several issues specific to learning from PE datasets that, if not addressed, continue to impede the clinical implementation of ML-based early detection of PE: (Challenge I) PE datasets often face inherent class imbalance; (Challenge II) Constructing reliable ML models for early PE detection necessitates mining large and diverse datasets, such as electronic health records, posing a significant challenge to the scalability of existing ML models; and (Challenge III) PE disproportionately affects certain racial groups, notably American Indian/Native American women, turning the fairness of such ML models into an ethical concern due to these disparities, and posing a challenge in adopting ML for disease detection. In response to these challenges, the investigator will (1) develop a new class of parameter-free classifiers to effectively address the bias resulting from class imbalance, thus eliminating the need for computationally expensive hyperparameter tuning, a common issue with cost-sensitive learning models for class imbalance; (2) develop a novel scalable classification method for learning from large-scale PE datasets through formulating the learning task as a sequential decision-making process, guiding data sampling in classification; and (3) develop a class of fair classifiers based on tractable optimization models that balance fairness and accuracy as well as novel performance-fairness metrics to simultaneously measure fairness and accuracy for imbalanced data. The investigator further studies adapting the fair ML model for online learning settings within a novel scalable framework that can handle massive data. Successful implementation of the proposed ML-based PE detection models will enhance identification of pregnant women at a high risk of preeclampsia, while reducing racial biases in relevant maternal health management systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite notable recent advancements, there is currently a lack of an effective predictive modeling and optimization framework to aid in designing these advanced composite materials, considering the optimal nonlinear behavior and complex geometries of the constituents. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award addresses this challenge through an integrated educational and research program. The research program focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art composite modeling and design capabilities for composites involving nonlinear behavior and potential damage under extreme loading conditions. This framework will be utilized to uncover the fundamental relationship between the microstructure's constituent properties, geometries, and structural performance. A comprehensive educational plan is to train the next generation of professionals with a strong background in composites to meet the nation?s growing demand for high-performance materials. <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER award is to elucidate the microstructure-property-performance relationship for composite materials by developing and exercising an efficient and accurate multiscale reduced order modeling and design framework. First, an adaptive multiscale reduced order model for rapid multiscale analysis and probing of the material response space will be developed. The model will consider realistic composite material behavior with a focus on viscoelastic behavior and damage of the matrix, damage of the reinforcement, and cohesive debonding of the material interface. The multiscale model will be thoroughly verified against direct numerical simulation and validated using experimental data for different hybrid composites. Finally, the model will be incorporated into a multi-resolution gradient-based reduced order design (material and shape) framework that enables the efficient design of hybrid composite microstructures. The modeling and design framework will empower us to develop advanced composites with tailored mechanical properties. It also has the potential to inform and guide advanced manufacturing techniques, facilitating precise fabrication of materials with optimized microstructures.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MoMS) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is motivated by a fascinating and crucial process happening in our body every moment: a cell squeezes through pores much smaller than itself. For example, red blood cells around 8 ?m, frequently squeeze through endothelial pores around 0.5 ?m in our spleens. This is their regular ?physical fitness test?, which destroys aged cells and diseased cells in malaria and blood disorders. Another example is the neutrophil, the most abundant white blood cell, which exits the circulation to fight infections in the tissues by squeezing through endothelial pores in the blood vessel walls. In cancer, circulating tumor cells also squeeze through these pores to metastasize in distant organs, which is the major contributor to cancer mortality. To squeeze through such narrow pores, all these cells have to experience extreme mechanical deformation. Slight changes of molecular structures in the cell would have significant consequence on the cell?s survival. In this project, advanced computer simulations will be applied to predict how different components of the cell affect its ability to pass through small pores. This research will also be complemented by educational and outreach programs based on curriculum development, hands-on construction of tensegrity structures, and a cell squeezing demonstrator to inspire K-12 students to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>The research goal is to reveal the biomechanics and mechanobiology of transendothelial migration (TEM) of cells by multiscale modeling and its integration with experimental data. Although extensive experiments have been conducted to study TEM of cells, achieving a quantitative understanding has proven challenging without the aid of mathematical modeling. Unfortunately, there are limited predictive mathematical models of TEM due to its complex and multiscale nature. To address this challenge, the research will adopt a multiscale modeling approach and integrate experimental data to investigate TEM of three cell types: red blood cells, neutrophils, and tumor cells. Specifically, the research objectives include: (i) study TEM of mature and immature red blood cells during mechanical filtration in spleens; (ii) study TEM of neutrophils during inflammation response in lung capillary beds; (iii) study TEM of a tumor cell nucleus during cancer metastasis in distant organs. This project will advance our fundamental understanding of TEM and contribute valuable insights into a wide range of biomedical problems such as biomechanics and mechanobiology of cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, phosphorus exists in extremely low abundance in the oceans limiting the productivity of the biosphere. The majority of phosphorus is derived from weathering of phosphate minerals from continents. However, for the first one to two billion years of Earth history, there were no continents to weather. Shortly after the first continents emerged above sea level (~3.2 to 2.6 billion years ago, Ga), microbes evolved the ability to perform oxygenic photosynthesis, which led to an oxygen-rich atmosphere and massive increase in primary productivity. Was the oxygenation of the oceans and atmosphere directly related to weathering of Earth?s first continents? This study will develop a record of the concentration of phosphorus in ancient oceans ~2 to 0.5 Ga to examine if the evolution of marine microorganisms was linked to weathering of early continents when the Earth was covered in ice. Ultimately, phosphorus abundance may have enabled the evolution of aerobic and multicellular organisms. The research will be integrated into new Earth sciences curricula developed with local high school teachers for neighboring rural districts. The project will develop open-access classroom and field-based learning modules and virtual field trips that connect students to the Cambrian explosion?the evolution of macroscopic animals?in the Pennsylvania landscape. The efficacy of the new curricula will be assessed through serial knowledge assessments implemented before and after exposure and ?knowledge boosts? in subsequent years. Mid-Atlantic high school teachers will be trained in various resources to be implemented in their classrooms.<br/><br/>Microbes have been intimately linked to carbonate minerals and the chemical evolution of Earth?s surface since life began. The metabolic innovation of oxygenic phototrophy >2 billion years ago contributed to the rise of oxygen, increased global primary productivity, and permanently changed biogeochemical cycles. However, little is known about why microbes evolved the ability to photosynthesize relatively late in the history of life, and what controlled the pace of subsequent microbial evolution. The primary goal of this CAREER award is an assessment of phosphate availability?an essential nutrient for all life?in the environments that host textural and geochemical evidence for primitive microbes and emergent metabolisms. Was the reduced productivity of the Mesoproterozoic a symptom of a phosphate reservoir depleted by oxygenic phototrophs? Was the evolution of crown group eukaryotes and metazoans fertilized by weathering-derived phosphate from Neoproterozoic global glaciations and the breakup of supercontinents? This project tests the hypothesis that enhanced phosphate availability was essential to the evolution of eukaryotes and metazoans by reconstructing seawater [P] via carbonate-associated phosphate (CAP) on existing Precambrian sample sets within the context of Proterozoic global glaciations, tectonics, and existing temporal and diagenetic frameworks. The research will improve our understanding of CAP and its utility for geo- and astrobiology by (1) analyzing CAP in the same Precambrian samples that have a wealth of existing diagenetic and geochemical data, and (2) performing growth experiments to develop mineral-specific CAP-[P]seawater calibrations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will expand the University of Cincinnati?s transdisciplinary innovation hub to student populations across three states (Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana), which will increase student participation from two local high schools and one University-associated internship site to 10 schools and four internship sites at the University of Cincinnati, Bowling Green State University, University of Akron, and Ohio University. Scaling within each state will extend transdisciplinary instruction and learning to different student and teacher populations both rural and urban with underrepresented and underserved populations, and to new regions within a state-wide educational system. The modern STEM workforce needs diverse, cross-trained professionals with both strength in their discipline and the ability to address complex scientific problems. To meet the needs of the scientific and technological workforce, the project will educate students and train teachers in concepts that bridge biology, technology, and engineering disciplines, demonstrating the interrelatedness between science and engineering using innovative technological advances. Participating high school students will study the behavior of biological organisms and learn how to apply animal behavior to the design of their own autonomous robots (animal-robot sensorimotor systems). Student interns will work with near-peer undergraduate and graduate student researchers and faculty mentors to actively engage in ongoing research in biology and/or engineering laboratories where they will participate in the design and execution of experiments and the collection, management, and analysis of collected data. The project connects students and teachers with locally-relevant science, engineering, and technology industry partners to see how science and engineering are applied to solve critical problems for the benefit of society. In parallel, the project will create school-to-university internship sites that connect the transdisciplinary knowledge gained by students with real-world experience. Project activities will provide students with conceptual knowledge, practical research skills, and awareness of career pathways in the biological sciences and robotics industries. <br/><br/>With the introduction of the curriculum across states, researchers will test the robustness and replication of the intervention across state boundaries that differ in their educational standards. Researchers will study the impacts of the transdisciplinary curriculum and research internships on students? learning, interest, and self-efficacy in STEM, and teachers? implementation of a transdisciplinary curriculum in ways that are responsive to local school contexts. Investigators will study, (1) What is the impact of transdisciplinary learning and real-world application via research internships on students? scientific inquiry practices?, (2) What is the impact of transdisciplinary learning and real-world application on students? interest and self-efficacy in STEM?, and (3) What changes do teachers make in how they teach through a transdisciplinary curriculum in ways that are responsive to their local school contexts? Researchers will use written science inquiry assessments and surveys of students? STEM interest and self-efficacy to document the impact of the transdisciplinary curriculum on student outcomes through a multilevel design to account for variation among teachers, classrooms, and schools. Additionally, the project will provide a scaled model of how science, technology, and engineering practices can be cultivated through culturally responsive teaching, and evidence of how teachers learn how to implement transdisciplinary learning. This project will have broader impacts by documenting how transdisciplinary learning can impact students? interest and self-efficacy in STEM, informing the design of future interventions to incorporate more features of transdisciplinary practice. Findings will impact transdisciplinary education research and practice in areas of teacher practice, teacher preparation, and professional development. Beyond its immediate impacts, the project scales, extends, and implements a set of experiences in transdisciplinary thought and problem solving to prepare students for modern STEM careers in rapidly emerging transdisciplinary areas of biology, technology, and engineering. The study of the curriculum across states will test the robustness and replication of the innovation across state boundaries that differ in their educational standards.

The main subject of the conference is theoretical quantum information science, underpinning future technologies that rely on quantum computers and devices. The conference brings together scientists from both classical and quantum information science with the aim of communicating exciting research trends to the quantum workforce and igniting compelling new research directions. Following the tradition of previous installments, this conference consists of a careful balance of cutting-edge, high-impact research talks and time slots for academic discussions and collaborations. This format has been highly successful as it produced a substantive body of work acknowledging progress achieved during previous Beyond IID conferences. A particular focus of the conference is on support, active engagement, and career development of junior researchers (i.e. graduate students and postdocs) from all backgrounds. Several events aimed at these participants have been planned, including a career panel and poster session helping to train the next generation of quantum scientists and connect them with the larger research community. In addition, having the event at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign highlights the robust and dynamic quantum ecosystem within the state of Illinois, including the on-campus Illinois Quantum Information and Science Center (IQUIST), the Chicago Quantum Exchange (CQE), and others. Notably, the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area was recently chosen as a quantum Regional Technology and Innovation Hub by the US Economic Development Administration. Finally, Beyond IID is the only conference of its size and focus in North America in 2024, providing a unique opportunity for many researchers on this continent to learn about the current results in this field.<br/><br/>The scientific content of the Beyond IID conference series covers the information-theoretic and mathematical aspects of quantum information science, and its connections to classical information theory and mathematical physics. Core topics discussed in previous Beyond IID conferences include one-shot and finite-blocklength information theory, quantum Shannon theory, cryptography, generalized resource theories, entropy inequalities and matrix analysis. The conference aims to provide a venue for classical and quantum information theorists to report recent progress, identify open problems, and advance current research in quantum information. The latter two objectives are facilitated by an open problems session, an integral part of the conference that continues to drive research in the above areas.  Each day will start with an hour-long invited talk giving a broad overview of selected topics by prominent researchers. This year, two of the invited talks are dedicated to the memory of Christopher King and Mary Beth Ruskai, whose work had an immense impact on quantum information theory.  The invited talks are followed by contributed talks on exceptional recent results rigorously selected by a program committee.

As a consequence, there is an urgent need to ensure trustworthiness of these systems when deployed in practice. The goal of this project is to design novel techniques for reasoning about neurosymbolic programs, which are programs that include DNN components. For traditional software, formal methods have provided powerful techniques for reasoning about program correctness. However, these tools struggle with programs that include DNN components due to the difficulty in reasoning about correctness properties of DNNs. This project's novelties are algorithms and techniques for designing trustworthy neurosymbolic programs by quantifying uncertainty of DNN components in a rigorous way. By doing so, downstream components can account for uncertainty in the DNN predictions; for instance, a robot may act cautiously if it believes an obstacle might be present. As a consequence, this project can have significant impacts by improving the reliability of modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which are increasingly pervasive in our world. Further, a new graduate class on trustworthy machine learning is being created, and novel applications of generative AI in computer science education are being explored.<br/><br/>The fundamental idea of the project is to leverage conformal prediction, a strategy for quantifying uncertainty of arbitrary blackbox models that comes with theoretical guarantees. The broad idea is to convert a given model into a conformal predictor that outputs a set of labels (called a prediction set) that is guaranteed to contain the ground truth label with high probability. For example, a conformal object detector can detect all objects in an image with high probability, with some of the detections marked as uncertain. Several techniques for reasoning about programs based on conformal prediction are being explored. First, the notion of conformal Hoare logic, an extension of Hoare logic designed to formally reason compositionally about neurosymbolic programs where the individual DNN components are all conformal predictors that come with conformal guarantees, is being developed. Second, a strategy for converting a traditional neurosymbolic program into a conformal one, by applying conformal prediction to the individual DNN components and then propagating uncertainty through the whole program, is being developed. Third, conformal synthesis strategies for synthesizing neurosymbolic programs that come with conformal correctness guarantees is being developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research objective is to advance the design of efficient, large-scale graph algorithms for the massively parallel and distributed computational frameworks that comprise modern data centers.

Increasingly, many firms seek to integrate cyber threat intelligence (CTI) about emerging threats and their relevance to vulnerabilities within their assets. However, much of the current CTI analyst practice is reactive, in which analysis manually examines exploits (software that circumvents vulnerabilities and allows an attacker to manipulate cyber-assets) after an attack. More proactive approaches to using CTI might prevent many cyber-attacks; in particular, sources such as Dark Web hacker forums often include signals about possible emerging exploit trends and attack vectors. However, these large, international, and ever-evolving platforms often contain millions of posts, a scale that makes conventional CTI analysis prohibitive, limited, error-prone, and time-consuming. Therefore, this project seeks to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled analytics techniques based on text analysis and network science to identify emerging trends and to link exploits to vulnerabilities. The models and results produced from this research will be integrated into curricula for cybersecurity students and data scientists to help rapidly grow a well-trained workforce in proactive AI-enabled CTI analytics. <br/><br/>This CAREER project seeks to develop two thrusts of proactive CTI research.

The data and methods from this research will be integrated into three thrusts to improve cyber-AI education: (1) new lessons for an AI for Cybersecurity course at Indiana University, (2) resources to enhance the cybersecurity curricula of NSF CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service institutions, and (3) proactive CTI learning modules for the AI+ platform offered by the Open Data Science Conference, one of the world's largest data science communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses critical challenges surrounding biased data and constantly changing technologies, or drift, leading to reduced accuracy, especially for marginalized groups. The research focuses on evaluating how well algorithms perform across diverse people, various types of measurements, over time, and with technology updates. Outputs of this project promise to enhance the fairness and reliability of AI technologies for monitoring biosignals, offering breakthrough methods for equitable and reliable health monitoring outside of the clinic. <br/> <br/>The research plan unfolds in two primary thrusts. The first thrust develops robust techniques for assessing and reporting algorithm performance across intersectional populations, with a particular focus on regression tasks involving continuous variables. This includes characterizing existing biosignal training dataset demographics, designing reporting standards, and implementing a theory-based method for quantitative evaluation of algorithmic fairness while considering intersectionality. An empirical analysis will assess intersectional fairness on key biosignal algorithms and datasets. The second thrust focuses on detecting and monitoring concept drift over time in biosignal data and algorithms, accounting for intersectional demographic shifts. This involves developing methods and metrics for concept drift monitoring, providing a nuanced understanding of how changes in training data composition impact the performance of AI-based biosignal algorithms. This work will result in gaining fundamental knowledge about bias and drift, advancing techniques for their detection and monitoring, and, ultimately, enhancing the equitable and reliable application of AI in biosignal algorithms for improved health outcomes. The project's scope also extends to an outreach and education plan, promoting increased access to biosignal monitoring devices and fostering diversity in STEM fields. This multifaceted approach ensures that the impact of the research transcends theoretical advancements, directly benefiting society through the improvement of wearables for health monitoring as well as the development of methods to enable more general AI oversight.

Epidermal cells in plant leaves, especially pavement cells (PCs), exhibit interdigitated puzzle shapes. Shape formation of PCs serves as an ideal model to understand principles governing cell morphogenesis and tissue growth in developmental biology. During the development, PCs change from small rounded polygonal shapes into large interdigitated puzzle shapes, under the regulation of the extracellular plant hormone and multiple key molecules accumulated at the plasma membrane (PM). This developmental process also involves reorganization of cytoskeletal components and dynamic cell-to-cell communication. The multiscale mathematical model proposed in this research will have a broad range of applications from tissue engineering to biomanufacturing and biotechnology. The PI will develop a satellite undergraduate research program based on University of California, Riverside (UCR), a Hispanic-serving institution with many first generation college students. The program will also recruit students from California State Universities and high schools in local public school district. Research symposia and summer research programs will be organized through the coordination with department of mathematics, Association of Women in Mathematics at UCR Chapter, Interdisciplinary Center for Quantitative Modeling in Biology at UCR, and nearby colleges to promote public awareness on research and career paths in mathematical biology.<br/><br/>The morphogenesis of PCs is a complex process. During the early stage, extracellular hormone induces nanoclustering on the PM of individual cells to initiate cell polarization. It is followed by nonhomogeneous mechanical forces exerted along cell wall and a subcellular signaling gradient to regulate cell-cell interaction. Stable cell polarization, further the interdigitated jigsaw cell shapes, will be established under the regulations between the nanoclustering signals and structural components in the same cell and regulations of Rho GTPase signals between neighboring cells. Different hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism underlying the PC morphogenesis, while most of them focus on either chemical signals or mechanical properties in PCs. The proposed study will test new hypotheses that include both the chemical signaling network and mechanical properties, as well as interactions between them, and therefore provide novel insights into the fundamental principles of cell shape formation and tissue development. This project will develop a multiscale model using the local level set method to incorporate both chemical signals and mechanical properties in a multicellular environment to test different hypotheses on the shape formation of PCs. Machine learning techniques and experimental data will be used in the modeling selection, parameter estimation and model calibration.<br/><br/>This CAREER project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program at the Division of Mathematical Science and the Developmental Systems Cluster at the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Few materials satisfy these criteria while also being strong and tough enough for broad use in engineering. To solve this, one can take inspiration from natural materials, which are made to be both renewable and durable by using precise nano- and microstructures. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research for creating strong, tough, and sustainable materials through new knowledge of small-scale fracture in architected materials. Bio-derived and/or biodegradable materials will be created with precise microstructures using advanced manufacturing tools. Mechanical testing and computer modeling on both small- and large-scale materials will reveal how cracks grow and propagate in complex structures. This knowledge will be used to inform the design of new sustainable materials for aerospace, construction and automotive industries. It will further be used to develop new programs and courses for promoting sustainable materials use in the next generation of engineers. <br/><br/>Emerging strategies using architecture to enhance toughness often have bioinspired designs, but they largely ignore how architecture affects the development of fracture process zones, especially at small length scales. This is especially true in anisotropic or hierarchical structures, which can have complex fracture processes occurring at multiple length scales. This research will reveal how architecture can inhibit and redistribute material-scale damage when introduced at relevant fracture length scales. Architectures will be made using sustainably sourced materials with features at or below the constituent fracture process zone size using both macro- and nanoscale additive manufacturing. Concomitant simulations will use elastic-plastic-damage finite element modeling to reveal how different structures can spread, deflect, or impede damage to create larger architectural fracture process zones and enhance toughness. These efforts will be incorporated into a new undergraduate outreach initiative on sustainable materials design that aims to recruit underrepresented community college students into university STEM programs. It will also be used in a graduate course on architected material design where students will try to develop new sustainable materials solutions to existing engineering problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While existing research explores the wellbeing of employees in single teams, there's a gap in understanding how being part of multiple teams influences the experiences and overall wellbeing of individual team members and teams in organizations. This project addresses the relationship between multiple team membership (MTM) and wellbeing, crucial for organizational productivity. Individuals navigating multiple virtual teams experience ?context variety.? In other words, they move between diverse technological, task-related, and socio-psychological contexts. This includes using different platforms and emerging technologies (e.g., AI nudging tools), facing varying task requirements, and experiencing different levels of inclusion and psychological safety across teams. Despite being a common experience, prior research hasn't explored how team context variety influences individuals? and the entire team?s wellbeing, including both positive and negative outcomes, such as excitement or burnout. This research aims to integrate scholarly perspectives on teams, management information systems, and human resources, contributing to a richer theoretical understanding of MTM dynamics. The outcomes will contribute to improving workers' wellbeing and fostering inclusive work environments.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to: a) understand how technology, task, and socio-psychological variety across teams affect individual and team wellbeing when team members are simultaneously members of multiple teams, and b) to help organizations, managers, and employees design supportive workplace experiences. The project focuses on multiple levels of analyses: the individual, the single team, and the meso-level, which is defined as a liminal space across multiple teams within an organization. The research team relies on a mixed method approach, including interviews to capture a holistic view of the lived experiences of multiple team membership of knowledge workers and develop a theoretical model, experiments to granularly analyze technology affordances, and surveys to confirm the proposed theoretical model we develop and to better capture variety in task and socio-psychological contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wirelessly-connected biomedical devices are an indispensable part of such remote healthcare solutions. With the increased longevity of patients, the long-term reliability of the wireless transceivers used in biomedical devices is becoming a concern. Furthermore, the sensitive nature of personalized healthcare raises concerns about the data security. This CAREER project will study the security threats and failure mechanisms in radio frequency integrated circuits (RFIC) and develop intelligent, low-energy analog solutions so as to create a trusted wireless transceiver with the capability to detect and cure impairments. The proposed research in this CAREER project will fundamentally change the remote healthcare solutions by developing a new class of miniaturized self-healing and trusted wireless transceivers that can provide high-speed connectivity at the device level. Moreover, this project enhances the foundational knowledge in hardware security by introducing novel low-energy analog encryption techniques for use in secure data communications. The education plan in this project will significantly enhance the knowledge of students in communications and hardware security. Through collaboration with industry, students will have the opportunity to work with industrial mentors and gain practical knowledge in electronics. The plan also contains initiatives focused on STEM education in K-12. As part of this effort, summer workshops on secure electronics and data communications will be offered to local high school students and their teachers, followed by design competitions to inspire the students to seek post-secondary education in STEM related fields. Lab visits and boot camps will also be organized as part of outreach activities to share resources and facilitate the knowledge transfer to teachers and students.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to develop intelligent, self-healing and trusted wireless transceivers by introducing low-energy analog asymmetric encryption and adaptive self-healing. The proposed research consist of two research thrust areas: (1) low-energy trusted data communications with smart threat detection capability, and (2) intelligent self-healing. Both research thrusts benefit from energy-efficient analog neural networks (ANNs) to improve the functionality. Applying innovative asymmetric analog encryption on the modulated waveforms in the wireless transceiver, an energy-efficient end-to-end encrypted wireless communication link is created. The proposed design will use scalable linear time-invariant (LTI) to generate the keys needed for encryption and decryption. A low-energy ANN will monitor the transceiver parameters for any sign of potential attack and notify the encryption engine accordingly. The transceiver will also be authenticated using low-overhead device fingerprinting techniques. Similarly, a low-energy adaptive analog self-healing unit will be developed to increase the reliability by detecting the performance degradation and abnormalities, and actively adjust the transceiver parameters. The self-healing unit uses an innovative dual-loop adaptive structure. The first loop is built within the analog front-end (AFE) and is always engaged to monitor short-term performance degradations while the second loop relies on a low-energy ANN and samples the data selectively to correct for long-term defects. The ANNs used in both research thrusts are built using energy-efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs) and are co-designed to reduce the delay and area overhead. The outcome of this CAREER project will enhance the remote healthcare by accelerating the adoption of smart personalized solutions in medical community, particularly for long-term treatment of chronic diseases. It will also lay the foundation of a smart, self-healing and trusted electronic platform for biomedical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students liking and believing they are good at math (positive math affect) is crucial to their continued study in STEM disciplines. Increasing the number of students with positive math affect and supporting their capacity to pursue STEM careers requires engaging and effective mathematics course sequences. However, the practice of separating students into upper and lower-level math courses often limits access to important mathematics as well as to STEM fields for many students. Tracking organizes math coursework both within and across the secondary grades functioning as a gatekeeper for many students. De-tracking pathways, on the other hand, have the potential to broaden access to important mathematics and, ultimately, to STEM fields. This project examines student and teacher experiences with the de-tracking of math sequences in a public school district in Western Oregon. It examines how a district-wide cohort of middle school students, as individuals and in groups, identify with and define what it means to be good at math, and how these identities shift over time as they progress through math sequences. It also establishes a partnership between a mathematics education researcher and a school district (Research Practice Partnership) to study changes in pedagogy, define problems of teaching practice, and design solutions as the district transitions to de-tracked classes. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the de-tracking of one school district's math sequences; in particular, the project follows a cohort of middle school students in both tracked and de-tracked conditions. It aims to capture both individual math identities--how students relate to mathematics--and normative (group) identities--how students are recognized as competent math learners in public spaces. Math identity ""portraits"" are constructed by analyzing the students' drawings of who or what math was to them, written responses on how they know when someone is ""good at math,"" and responses to a Semantic Differential survey designed to elicit beliefs about the five strands of math proficiency. Using mixed methods analysis, the project synthesizes the analysis of data collected from the students at three points in time to construct both individual student math identity ""snapshots"" that can then be compared across time as they move through tracked and de-tracked sequences. As the district moves to fully de-tracked middle school math pathways, the Research Practice Partnership will collectively determine which problems of practice are critical in supporting newly integrated math classes and examine evidence of multiple ways that students can legitimately show mathematical competence and foster productive mathematical dispositions. This will include adopting and evaluating new pedagogy, curriculum, and assessment methods designed to increase the number of students who are seen, and see themselves, as proficient math learners.<br/><br/>The award is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lacking tools to adjust to these changes, tropical plants might struggle to survive. This study will investigate how two tree species, Pterocarpus officinalis and Dalbergia ecastaphyllum, cope with changes in temperatures and water supply and how these changes are affecting their physiology. The study site is located in the Corredor Ecolgico del Noreste, a natural reserve in the Caribbean that represents freshwater coastal wetlands. Working with natural resource managers, community, and scientists, data will be collected to characterize the effects of climate change on these trees with the goal of advance knowledging that can be applied to inform management decisions about coastal wetlands restoration.<br/><br/>In the past decade, Puerto Rico and the broader Caribbean region have witnessed a historical increase in temperature. Trends suggest that this warming trajectory will continue, accompanied by other climatic extremes, including rising sea levels, extreme precipitation events, and intensified atmospheric disturbances. Coastal tropical vegetation is in a perilous situation, where in the context of a warmer planet and rising sea levels, vegetation might not have the physiological mechanisms for acclimation. This study?s goal is to assess the ecophysiological responses of nitrogen-fixing species in tidal freshwater wetlands in response to warmer temperatures and increased salinity under the same mesoclimate conditions. The research will investigate 1) how warmer climate and increased salinity affects photosynthesis and regulation of osmotic balance, and 2) how these environmental changes affect activity and efficiency of nitrogen fixation. Using an interdisciplinary approach involving plant physiology, ecology, climate change science and metabolomics, the study will include field observations of two tree species, Pterocarpus officinalis and Dalbergia ecastaphyllum, that share the same mesoclimate but different hydrologic conditions, and greenhouse experiments in which air temperature and saline conditions will be modified. Data examined will include light and temperature response curves to assess leaf thermal tolerance, plant morphological traits, hydraulic conductance, osmotic potential, 13C and 15N isotopic analyses for nitrogen fixation, as well as nutrient analysis and non-targeted metabolomic analyses to create a profile of metabolites related to salt stress and temperature changes. The combined approach will be applicable to informing plant selection in conservation management efforts, thus enhancing the potential benefits these critical ecosystems provide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry can be described as the study of systems of polynomial equations and their solutions, whereas topology is the mathematical discipline that studies notions such as ?shape? and ?space"" and develops mathematical techniques to distinguish and classify such objects. A notion of central importance in these areas is that of a ?moduli space? - this is a mathematical ?world map? that gives a complete inventory and classification of all instances of a particular mathematical object. The main research objective of the project is to better understand the structure of these spaces and to explore new phenomena, by importing techniques from neighboring areas of mathematics. While the primary aim is to advance knowledge in pure mathematics, developments from these areas have also had a long track record of successful applications in physics, data science, computer vision, and robotics. The educational component includes an outreach initiative consisting of a ?Math Circles Institute? (MCI). The purpose of the MCI is to train K-12 teachers from around the country in running the mathematical enrichment activities known as Math Circles. This annual 1-week program will pair teachers with experienced instructors to collaboratively develop new materials and methods to be brought back to their home communities. In addition, a research conference will be organized with the aim of attracting an international community of researchers and students and disseminating developments related to the research objectives of the proposal.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research component is to develop new methods via topology and geometric group theory to study various moduli spaces, specifically, (1) strata of Abelian differentials and (2) families of polynomials. A major objective is to establish ?asphericality"" (vanishing of higher homotopy) of these spaces. A second objective is to develop the geometric theory of their fundamental groups. Asphericality occurs with surprising frequency in spaces coming from algebraic geometry, and often has profound consequences. Decades on, asphericality conjectures of Arnol?d, Thom, and Kontsevich?Zorich remain largely unsolved, and it has come to be regarded as a significantly challenging topic. This project?s goal is to identify promising-looking inroads. The PI has developed a method called ""Abel-Jacobi flow"" that he proposes to use to establish asphericality of some special strata of Abelian differentials. A successful resolution of this program would constitute a major advance on the Kontsevich?Zorich conjecture; other potential applications are also described. The second main focus is on families of polynomials. This includes linear systems on algebraic surfaces; a program to better understand the fundamental groups is outlined. Two families of univariate polynomials are also discussed, with an eye towards asphericality conjectures: (1) the equicritical stratification and (2) spaces of fewnomials. These are simple enough to be understood concretely, while being complex enough to require new techniques. In addition to topology, the work proposed here promises to inject new examples into geometric group theory. Many of the central objects of interest in the field (braid groups, mapping class groups, Artin groups) are intimately related to algebraic geometry. The fundamental groups of the spaces the PI studies here should be just as rich, and a major goal of the project is to bring this to fruition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Failure of the building exterior can lead to cascading water intrusion, extensive interior damage, and disruption to businesses. The cost of repair resulting from such damage can be significant. High- and mid-rise buildings are designed to last for decades. During a building?s lifespan, urbanization and climate change pose major and evolving risks to the building exterior, yet significant technical barriers prevent these risks from being adequately considered in building design and resilience analysis. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support research that focused on developing new methodologies to assess these evolving risks to improve the lifetime performance of a building exterior in hurricanes and enhance resilience of coastal urban communities. These methodologies will be encapsulated in a user-friendly, cloud-based online application, UrbanWinds, for engineers to quickly evaluate wind loads and building risk change in preliminary design or planning stages of new buildings, and to assess changing risk of an inventory of buildings at urban scales. Through the integration of research and education, unique hands-on and collaborative learning experiences for diverse groups of middle and high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will be designed through a portable STEM kit. This activity is expected to produce next-generation engineering and education professionals who are trained in principles of wind engineering, state-of-the-art experimental and computational modeling techniques, and STEM teaching skills. This award will contribute to the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Data generated from this project will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https:/www.DesignSafe-CI.org).<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to assess the nonstationary (?evolving?) hurricane risks to urban building envelopes (?exterior?) during urban development in a changing climate. A deep learning-based data-driven model of wind pressures on urban buildings as a function of changes in surrounding building clusters under urban development will be investigated. Wind tunnel tests will be conducted to provide wind pressure data for developing the data-driven model. Reynolds number effects on complex aerodynamic loading on clustered buildings, which have not been studied in the literature, will be investigated using the large-scale NSF-supported NHERI Wall of Wind Facility at Florida International University. Traditional fully coupled probabilistic methods may be impractical to assess uncertainties of wind direction for building clusters due to significant computational costs. Adding nonstationary risks due to climate change presents an enormous technical challenge. A new reliability- and scenario-based methodology will be developed to capture the nonstationary characteristics of hurricanes and site-specific wind direction effects. Combined, the above efforts will advance the field of building design and urban resilience planning by capturing essential nonstationary characteristics of risks to building envelopes due to urban development and climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It may result in the catastrophic rupture of critical components. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research enabling novel micromechanical creep testing techniques, and it furthers the fundamental understanding of creep deformation mechanisms in advanced materials such as multi-principal element alloys. This research contributes to enabling superior creep-resistant materials, which benefit critical sectors of the U.S. society such as energy, transportation, aviation, propulsion, and space exploration, with far-reaching beneficial consequences on human well-being, economics, and environmental sustainability. This award also integrates research and education by supporting various outreach activities and creating new opportunities for underrepresented students to engage in scientific research.<br/><br/>Creep strength is arguably the most important mechanical property for structural alloys operating at high temperatures. Standard creep tests are expensive and time-consuming, and they require bulk samples. When developing new materials, however, high-throughput techniques that are capable to test small samples are typically required. This is particularly important in the case of multi-principal element alloys, due to needs to explore their vast compositional space. Nanoindentation is a high-throughput test suited for small samples, and it has been the primary technique to screen not only creep, but also fatigue, and fracture properties of these materials. This CAREER award funds research that attempts to advance nanoindentation as a high-throughput technique for fast screening of creep properties. The research combines multiscale modeling, micromechanical tests carried out at high temperature within a scanning electron microscope, and machine learning to establish a relation between nanoindentation and uniaxial creep properties. The research also broadens the fundamental understanding of high-temperature deformation mechanisms in body-centered cubic refractory multi-principal element alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mechanical failure occurs when the loads experienced by a tissue exceed the tissue?s strength. Depending on the location in the body, soft tissue rupture can have devastating consequences for human health. However, predicting the location and conditions that promote soft tissue failure can be challenging since the required local biomechanical characterizations cannot be realized using traditional experimental approaches. To address this longstanding challenge in soft tissue biomechanics, this work will leverage pioneering optics-based mechanical testing and imaging approaches, to attempt to experimentally characterize the local environment of tissue defects in mouse arteries. Experimental findings will be used to inform a computational model of aortic rupture. Outcomes and technological advances stemming from this research will be applicable to failure analysis in soft tissues from multiple physiological systems. This work will be integrated with an educational platform focused on open-science, accessibility to optics-based mechanical testing technologies, and opportunities for students to participate in interactive STEAM educational activities. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to better understand the biomechanical consequence of localized aortic wall defects and characterize the factors that contribute to aortic rupture using innovative mechanobiological, microstructural, and mechanical testing approaches. To accomplish this goal, spatial biological measurements will be mapped onto full-field biomechanical measurements to develop local structure-function relationships in and around tissue defects. Specific research objectives include a comprehensive biomechanical assessment of local aortic wall defects and fatigue-induced failure propagation using 1) ex vivo model of trauma-induced aortic damage and 2) in vivo model of thoracic aortopathy that will inform 3) particle-based computational model of soft tissue failure. Additionally, an educational outreach program will provide opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds, ages, and levels of experience (K-6, university, and incarcerated adults) to participate in STEAM activities including new optics- and physics-based coursework and hands-on demonstrations related to optics and mirrors, material structure and function, and cardiovascular health. Together, this combined research and educational plan will advance the field?s understanding of local soft tissue rupture mechanisms while teaching students about the importance of cardiovascular health and mechanobiology.

These data-intensive scientific applications pose significant challenges to the storage systems of high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, that are heterogeneous and extremely complex. Scientists who need high-speed data access often experience frustration in effectively using these heterogeneous storage options. There is need to build the long-missing automated HPC I/O (Input/Output) middleware to transparently help scientists achieve optimal data access performance without their manual efforts. Designing automated HPC I/O middleware for large-scale, heterogeneous, and shared HPC storage systems is an extremely challenging task. The researchers supported by this grant plan to  leverage machine learning techniques to understand the requests and the current system status, intelligently and adaptively scheduling and coordinating I/O requests. The outcomes of this research are expected to work with existing storage components and minimize the impacts on both scientific applications and the HPC systems.<br/><br/>This project plans to tackle this grand challenge by exploring practical reinforcement learning-based (RL) methods and building relevant software infrastructure in an HPC environment. There are two main focuses in the project: 1) RL-based data placement for high storage utilization, and 2) RL-based I/O coordination for shared storage. Both tasks depend on identifying effective reinforcement learning methods and integrating these methods effectively into HPC systems. To achieve this goal, a novel, system-centric reinforcement learning framework will be developed. Moreover, in each research focus, various RL algorithms, deep neural network designs, and reward shaping will be proposed, implemented, rigorously benchmarked, and compared with state-of-the-art solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, one of the major limitations that prevents wider adoption of WPT is its stringent orientation and alignment requirements in existing implementations. Current efforts from both academia and industry resulted in either 3-dimensional (3D) multi-coil structures that are too bulky for most applications or 2-dimentional (2D) planar coil arrays that only addressed misalignment issues while leaving the orientation issue unresolved. The goal of this CAREER project is to achieve efficient omnidirectional WPT systems with new spatial calibration methodologies that can dynamically shape the magnetic field direction to match the orientation of the receiver device for optimum power transfer without using a bulky 3D structure. By addressing this major challenge of WPT, this project will benefit a wide range of applications, from low-power implantable or ingestible medical devices with orientation/location uncertainties inside the body to higher-power consumer electronics, without the need for careful orientation and position alignment with the wireless transmitter, revealing the full potential of wireless power technology. In terms of education, this project will provide undergraduate students with chip-level design experience, opportunities to interact with industry professionals on practical applications, and new courses. These education activities will bridge gaps between university education and industry needs with better training of students to address the nationwide workforce demand in industry. The outreach activities in close collaboration with various organizations will also help develop a broader STEM workforce by increasing the participation of students from various groups and providing them with more opportunities to obtain the knowledge and skills to pursue career goals as engineers or scientists.<br/><br/>To achieve 3D omnidirectional WPT without using bulky 3D structures, a controlled 2D near-field coil array will be developed to shape the magnetic field with real-time spatial calibration techniques to determine and generate the optimal phases and amplitudes driving the coils in the array. Three system-level approaches will be explored for different application scenarios with different constraints, namely: 1) Receiver Backward Excitation, which is inspired by the theory of reciprocity in classical electromagnetism to sense the receiver-driven signals in reverse to pick up potentially optimum driving signals at the transmitter; 2) Transmitter Forward Excitation, to analyze the reflected impedance by sensing the transmitter-driven voltages and currents, and then calculate the optimum driving parameters; 3) Feedback Guided Searching, by optimizing the search space and then utilize feedback signals from the receiver to search for optimal driving parameters. In addition, a pseudo-2D approach with thin-film receiver structure will also be developed when the transmitter does not have the flexibility to implement a planar multi-coil array. In each approach, theoretical analysis and hardware development of system-level topologies, chip-level integrated circuits, and closed-loop control techniques will be performed for prototyping and measurement. To improve system efficiency, adaptive optimizations of coils and resonant links and development of nonlinear power and voltage regulation techniques will be performed with measurement verifications. The successful completion of this CAREER project will enable wider adoption of WPT, trigger innovations, open new trends for omnidirectional wireless powered applications, and generate broad impacts in our society.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems (CCSS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physical computing tools, such as robots, can help children develop CS understanding; however, most robots currently available to elementary teachers are relatively expensive and offer little flexibility in terms of which concepts they allow students to learn and how learning happens. The research aims to understand the assets that students and teachers bring to the activities, and capture feedback on implementation from the students and teachers to improve the robot design. The project is potentially transformative in its goal to use Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to create a robot that is more responsive to the range of student abilities found across elementary and middle school classrooms. The project aims to help students develop CS and executive functioning skills such as self-control and planning, which are crucial to school success and successful STEM careers. It also aims to help teachers develop confidence and fluency in integrating CS content into their day-to-day work with students.<br/><br/>This project builds on prior collaborations that yielded a low-cost, working prototype that is adaptable for use in kindergarten settings up to middle school and beyond for a ?low-floor and high-ceiling? functionality and extendibility. The research will implement activities featuring the robot in urban and rural elementary classrooms in Virginia school districts to investigate students? development of CS and executive functioning skills as well as student interest in STEM and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The project will use design-based research methods to explore how teachers scaffold CS learning activities within their classrooms and how to create educational robots and associated materials for students with and without disabilities at the K-12, 3-5 and 6-8 grade bands. The project aims to work with 18 elementary and middle school teachers, with over 1700 students using the robot and associated activities. Expected outcomes of this project include improved CS understanding and executive functioning skills in children, improved teacher self-efficacy with integrating CS into their classroom, and a set of design principles for educational robots for students with and without disabilities. All project materials, including activities, robot designs, and building instructions will be openly available on the project website and Github.

One of the main notions used is that of a surface group representation, a concept which connects surfaces to generalizations of classical geometries such as Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. The study of surfaces has surprising applications throughout many fields of mathematics and physics. Consequently, the project lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines. In addition to cutting edge mathematical research, the project will promote the progress of science and mathematics through different workshops aimed at graduate students as well as community outreach events. The educational component will also focus on creating an engaging and inclusive place for mathematical interactions for students and early career researchers.<br/><br/>In the past decades, both the theories of Higgs bundles and Anosov dynamics have led to significant advancements in our understanding of the geometry of surface groups. Recent breakthroughs linking these approaches are indirect and mostly involve higher rank generalizations of hyperbolic geometry known as higher rank Teichmuller spaces. The broad aim of this project is to go beyond higher rank Teichmuller spaces by using Higgs bundles to identify subvarieties of surface group representations which generalize the Fuchsian locus in quasi-Fuchsian space. The cornerstone for the approach is the role of Slodowy slices for Higgs bundles. Specifically, the PI aims to establish Anosov properties of surface group representations associated to Slodowy slices in the Higgs bundle moduli space. This approach will significantly extend applications of Higgs bundles to both Anosov representations and (G,X) geometries. It will complete the component count for moduli of surface group representations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

L-functions are functions on the complex plane that often encode interesting information about arithmetic objects, such as prime numbers, class numbers, or ranks of elliptic curves. For example, the Riemann zeta-function (which is one example of an L-function) is closely connected to the question of counting the number of primes less than a large number. Understanding the analytic properties of L-functions, such as the location of their zeros or their rate of growth, often provides insight into arithmetic questions of interest. The main goal of the project is to advance the knowledge of the properties of some families of L-functions and to obtain arithmetic applications. The educational component of the project involves groups of students at different stages, ranging from high school students to beginning researchers. Among the educational activities, the PI will organize a summer school in analytic number theory focusing on young mathematicians, and will run a yearly summer camp at UCI for talented high school students.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the project will investigate zeros of L-functions by studying their ratios and moments. While positive moments of L?functions are relatively well-understood, much less is known about negative moments and ratios, which have applications to many difficult questions in the field. The planned research will use insights from random matrix theory, geometry, sieve theory and analysis. The main goals fall under two themes. The first theme is developing a general framework to study negative moments of L-functions, formulating full conjectures and proving partial results about negative moments. The second theme involves proving new non-vanishing results about L-functions at special points. Values of L-functions at special points often carry important arithmetic information; the PI plans to show that wide classes of L-functions do not vanish at the central point (i.e., the center of the critical strip, where all the non-trivial zeros are conjectured to be), as well as to study correlations between the values of different L-functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will investigate the mechanism underlying the feedback of splicing on transcriptional regulation, focusing on the role of the splicing factor U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (U1snRNP). Beyond the lab, this initiative extends its reach to high-school and middle-school students and educators. By nurturing scientific curiosity and literacy, the researchers will offer hands-on workshops, lab internships, and tutorials on computational biology and statistics. Overall, this project not only promises to unveil novel layers of gene expression regulation but also actively contributes to cultivating the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Transcription and splicing are intrinsically coupled; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying their co-regulation remains poorly understood. This project, centering on the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (U1snRNP), aims to unveil the modes of action and principles governing the feedback from splicing to transcriptional regulation. The study is structured into two main aims: (i) Determining the rules dictating U1snRNP-dependent promoter regulation through splicing, and (ii) Exploring the mechanisms driving U1snRNP-dependent downstream promoter activation via transcript length regulation. The first aim involves assessing the dependency of U1snRNP-mediated promoter regulation on the strength and location of 5' splice sites. In the second aim, the project delves into the effects of U1snRNP inhibition on global alternative promoter usage, chromatin structure, and promoter directionality. By unraveling the mechanisms behind the role of U1snRNP in promoter regulation, this project will reveal novel layers of gene regulation. Ultimately, the findings of this project will pave the way for the development of advanced computational tools capable of predicting gene regulatory networks and designing therapeutic molecules for precise control of gene expression.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early theories assumed this process was simple and unidirectional: We perceive things in our environment, process it with high-level cognition, and then plan and execute appropriate actions. In contrast to this view, recent studies suggest that our actions can also influence how we perceive things. For example, people are better at perceiving the changes in the orientation of objects when they are intending to grasp them. This project aims to determine the mechanisms underlying this perception-action interdependence, using a combination of behavioral, psychophysical, physiological, and computational approaches. The work involves the collaboration of two international research teams, one based in the United States and one in Israel. The investigators are also committed to promoting inclusivity and diversity by mentoring talented undergraduates in an EPSCoR state, as well as nationally selected students from groups underrepresented in science. Additionally, the investigators will produce and distribute multimedia science cartoons (SciToons) aimed at K-12 students, teachers, and the general public.<br/><br/>The questions addressed here focus on the mutual interdependence of perception, cognition, and action.  The project integrates novel empirical methods with continuous action tracking, pupillometry, and computational modeling. The first goal is to understand how determinate actions need to be in order to influence visual perception. The second goal is to assess which aspects of visual processing improve when we prepare to act or have been trained to act. The third goal is to determine whether preparing to act enhances visual processing by changing how much attention is paid to the target and/or how quickly it grabs attention. The aim is to advance our understanding of the interdependence between perception and action-driven mechanisms.

While many approaches to teaching multilingual students tend to reflect deficit-based perspectives, decades of research show that quality mathematics teaching builds on the assets that students bring to the classroom. For this reason, there is a pressing need to develop pedagogies that leverage students? languages in mathematics, and, relatedly, to develop methods for supporting teachers in learning such pedagogies. This project partners with a mathematics department at a public middle school to co-design, analyze, and improve teachers?  translanguaging pedagogies, that is pedagogies that draw on students? full linguistic repertoires as resources for their learning. This project will investigate how teachers make sense of and enact translanguaging pedagogies, how translanguaging pedagogies shape students? mathematical experiences and learning opportunities, and how teachers? learning of translanguaging spaces can be supported. As a result of this work, teachers, teacher educators, and researchers will be able to better understand how students? languages can be leveraged as resources for mathematical learning, contributing to efforts to address persistent opportunity gaps for multilingual students across the nation.<br/><br/>This project employs a series of three qualitative studies using social design experiment methods to address its primary goals. In the first study, the research team and the teachers will co-design pedagogical resources such as lessons, mathematical tasks, and pedagogical strategies to support translanguaging in middle school mathematics. In the second study, the research team will video-record these co-designed translanguaging pedagogies in the classroom, focusing investigation on the character of students? learning opportunities and experiences in translanguaging spaces. In the third study, the project team will develop video clubs to support teachers? learning about translanguaging pedagogies, using classroom video as a key learning resource for teachers.

Therefore, it is imperative to prioritize safety as a fundamental aspect across various domains of AI research. Notably, due to the ubiquity of network (graph) data, network learning techniques have strongly impacted AI in the past decade, being widely deployed across applications such as social networks, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, real-world networks often include challenges like data issues and unforeseen environmental hazards, resulting in risky AI techniques and unsafe outcomes when these networks are employed. Existing studies for safe network learning lack versatility, efficiency, and comprehensive integration across multiple safety dimensions. They struggle to ensure timely, safe predictions in practical scenarios and fail to holistically address data, model, and usage aspects. These challenges collectively hinder their capability and effectiveness, and there is currently a lack of a holistic framework to adequately tackle safety issues in network learning. To bridge this research gap, the goal of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a novel Safety-centric Network Learning framework (SNL) for safe decision-making on networks in the wild. The project outcomes will substantially impact network learning research and offer advanced solutions to address challenges across diverse domains such as public health, cybersecurity, and social media. Additionally, the project will foster interdisciplinary collaborations and facilitate technology transfer to industry. The project outcomes will be made publicly accessible and broadly disseminated. Moreover, the project will integrate research with education through novel curriculum development and student mentoring activities with an emphasis on underrepresented groups, aiming to train and educate future generations in effectively developing and utilizing AI while also ensuring AI safety. <br/><br/>The project will involve comprehensive efforts to develop SNL that prioritizes the critical safety dimensions of reliability, stability, and explainability, and further encompasses the crucial aspects of data, model, and usage in a general, efficient, and integrated manner. Formally, SNL will provide reliable network data and network learning models (reliability) while generating stable and consistent outputs (stability) accompanied by easily understandable usage explanations (explainability). Specifically, the research components that engage innovative theories, algorithms, and models in this project are fourfold. First, design novel network learning algorithms to identify and generate reliable network data that are minimally impacted by data and environmental issues. Second, create new network representation learning models and training strategies to promote efficiency and reliability in learning network representations. Third, devise innovative data-to-model optimization theories to ensure the stability of network learning. Finally, develop novel generative learning methods to advance the usage explainability and output receptivity of network learning. The unified framework allows seamless collaboration and mutual reinforcement among different research components. Through the convergent research program, the project will not only make significant advancements in network learning and AI safety research but also shed novel insights to tackle various societal challenges, ultimately benefiting society at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, when those data are about people and what they do, there are risks to privacy that can grow with the sophistication of the analysis.  In response, the Future of Privacy Forum Education and Innovation Foundation (FPF) is convening a Research Coordination Network (RCN) for Privacy Preserving Data Sharing and Analytics.  The RCN is bringing together experts from academia, industry, and government to support the development, deployment, and scaling of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)?tools that allow for data analysis without sacrificing privacy.   While PETsthey can mitigate risk, there are many factors holding back these technologies? widespread use.  One of the biggest stumbling blocks to the broader adoption of PETs in research is the current lack of clarity regarding how regulators will interpret and enforce privacy rules when organizations use them. The RCN is working to resolve this issue by bringing stakeholders together to discuss the use of PETs and explore how rules and standards can promote their appropriate use. <br/><br/>The project team is convening a multidisciplinary, cross-sector, and international expert group of scholars and practitioners who focus on PETs development and use to understand the risks of data sharing and analytics. This work is in direct response to recommendations from the National Strategy to Advance Privacy Preserving Data Sharing and Analytics. Further, the team is convening a secondary sub-network of high-level regulators from around the world that will inform and respond to the primary network, addressing the legal frameworks relevant to PETs adoption. With input from both groups, the project team is developing and disseminating new guidance to accelerate progress toward a privacy-preserving data-sharing and analytics ecosystem that will foster convergence and characterize and strive to narrow persistent differences, and illuminate options to support broad deployment of PETs. The team is examining multiple mechanisms for this deployment, including via new technology, law and regulation, and/or standards and certifications.

This is a broad field to study, so important distinctions are made based on how the class of structures is described (or axiomatized). If the class is describable in first-order logic, it is called an elementary class. First-order logic has many powerful properties, especially the property of compactness. Compactness allows model theorists to build structures with exotic properties and has driven much of the model theory of elementary classes, most notably classification theory. However, many classes of structures are not describable in first-order logic (these are called nonelementary classes). Lacking compactness, the development of nonelementary model theory and classification theory has proceeded much slower than its elementary counterpart. Recent work in nonelementary classes has shown that various fragments of compactness can still hold in some nonelementary classes and are still powerful enough to prove various results of elementary classification theory. The PI will develop more of these fragments in nonelementary classes. Additionally, the PI will run a program to build research infrastructure at their home institution (an R2 institution and HSI).  This program will support undergraduates conducting research in logic, supported by a speaker series that will build connections between expert logicians and faculty and students.<br/><br/>This research will develop fragments of compactness in a variety of ways.  From category theory, methods from accessible categories and from topoi will be used to find compactness principles in certain nonelementary classes.  Drawing on model theory and set theory, generalized indiscernibles and generalizations of the Erdos-Rado theorem will find compactness principles that hold in all nonelementary classes.  Further drawing on set theory, the connections between large cardinals and compactness principles (along with other model-theoretic ideas) will be extended.  The connections formed in categorical logic will be extended to higher category theory to open new areas for model theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Initially, Earth was uninhabitable because it was covered by a magma ocean and frequently struck by giant impactors. Through time, the first crust crystallized, oceans precipitated, and continents started forming. Yet, we don't know when these processes occurred and when Earth became habitable. This is due to lack of a rock record for Earth?s first ~550 million years of history, the Hadean Eon. The only remaining materials from that time are zircons. Most of our knowledge comes from a single location of Hadean zircons, the Jack Hills in Australia. Recently, the PI?s team discovered Hadean zircon in South Africa. This offers a second lens into the Hadean Eon. Trace elements and isotopes of these zircons will help address processes key to Earth?s habitability. This includes the onset of plate tectonics, outgassing from the mantle, and the emergence of crust above sea level. The proposed research offers symbiotic opportunities to integrate research and educational experiences. The PI will create a museum exhibit to be shown at the Harvard Museum of Natural History and the Ngwenya museum in Eswatini. The research also offers abundant research opportunities for undergraduates from underrepresented minorities. Lastly, improved undergraduate and graduate teaching materials will be disseminated for broader use. The project supports one female early career scientist, one postdoctoral researcher, and 10 undergraduate research assistants.<br/><br/>The proposed work will create the first large dataset of Hadean zircon outside the Jack Hills by analyzing a statistically robust number of zircons and by broadening and integrating zircon isotopic (Hf, O, Si) and trace and rare earth element geochemical analyses. The research examines Hadean zircons from the Green Sandstone Bed, South Africa, that were previously collected, extracted, and dated through a separate grant. Firstly, the research will test whether the zircons formed in a stagnant-lid or mobile-lid (i.e., plate tectonics) environment through an integrated study of zircon Hf and O isotopes, trace elements and with modeling. Secondly, it will assess redox-sensitive Ce anomalies in mantle-derived zircons to evaluate the oxidation state of the mantle. A comparison to data from Hadean zircons of the Singhbhum Craton and the Jack Hills will provide constraints on mantle heterogeneity. Thirdly, it will assess isotopic (O, Si) and geochemical proxies (Al, P) to test for the generation of clays and the presence of meteoric waters as proxies for continental emergence through time.

While existing research explores the wellbeing of employees in single teams, there's a gap in understanding how being part of multiple teams influences the experiences and overall wellbeing of individual team members and teams in organizations. This project addresses the relationship between multiple team membership (MTM) and wellbeing, crucial for organizational productivity. Individuals navigating multiple virtual teams experience ?context variety.? In other words, they move between diverse technological, task-related, and socio-psychological contexts. This includes using different platforms and emerging technologies (e.g., AI nudging tools), facing varying task requirements, and experiencing different levels of inclusion and psychological safety across teams. Despite being a common experience, prior research hasn't explored how team context variety influences individuals? and the entire team?s wellbeing, including both positive and negative outcomes, such as excitement or burnout. This research aims to integrate scholarly perspectives on teams, management information systems, and human resources, contributing to a richer theoretical understanding of MTM dynamics. The outcomes will contribute to improving workers' wellbeing and fostering inclusive work environments.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to: a) understand how technology, task, and socio-psychological variety across teams affect individual and team wellbeing when team members are simultaneously members of multiple teams, and b) to help organizations, managers, and employees design supportive workplace experiences. The project focuses on multiple levels of analyses: the individual, the single team, and the meso-level, which is defined as a liminal space across multiple teams within an organization. The research team relies on a mixed method approach, including interviews to capture a holistic view of the lived experiences of multiple team membership of knowledge workers and develop a theoretical model, experiments to granularly analyze technology affordances, and surveys to confirm the proposed theoretical model we develop and to better capture variety in task and socio-psychological contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each cell is enclosed by an extracellular<br/>matrix. You can think of an extracellular matrix as a housing that protects and contains<br/>a cell?s contents. In plants, that housing is particularly strong and rigid and is composed<br/>of a wide variety of biopolymers. One such polymer is known as extensin. As its name<br/>implies, extensin plays an important role in controlling plant growth and extension, and<br/>it does so by forming a polymeric molecular scaffold or frame. This work aims to<br/>understand what governs scaffold formation at the molecular level and how we can use<br/>this knowledge to design new biopolymers that mimic or imitate the properties of<br/>natural extensins. In the face of global climate change, our reliance on fossil fuels must<br/>be reduced, not only for use as transportation fuels, but also as chemical/polymer<br/>feedstocks. Potential industrial applications of this research are numerous and include<br/>the creation of biodegradable plastics, molecular electronics, food enhancement,<br/>cosmetics additives, etc. This research will also provide training opportunities for<br/>undergraduate and graduate students in biophysical chemistry and biochemistry. New<br/>undergraduate course materials for physical chemistry and biochemistry will be<br/>developed, and various outreach and scientific literacy projects for primary/secondary<br/>school aged children and adults are planned.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/>Extensins (EXTs) are network-forming hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins found<br/>naturally in plant cell walls. Monomeric EXTs self-assemble to form insoluble polymeric<br/>cell wall scaffolds. Very little is known about what governs EXT self-assembly at the<br/>molecular level. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been previously used to explore<br/>the behavior of EXT self-assembly. These studies showed that EXT monomers<br/>spontaneously self-assemble into intricate dendritic scaffolds. Furthermore, different<br/>EXT types displayed different self-assembly behaviors, whereby some EXTs favored<br/>more xy-plane growth (termed ?branching?), while others displayed z-plane growth<br/>(termed ?stacking?). These changes were attributed to differences in the repetitive,<br/>modular, and amphiphilic nature exhibited by different EXTs. To better understand the<br/>molecular drivers of EXT self-assembly, three objectives are proposed. First, will be<br/>further characterize the self-assembly of native EXT glycoproteins by AFM to study<br/>their kinetics, pore sizes, and relative growth in the x-, y-, and z-planes. Synthetic<br/>biology will then be used to create biomimetic EXTs that vary in amphiphilicity,<br/>modularity, and repetitiveness and test for their self-assembly behavior using AFM.<br/>Lastly, the biochemical and biophysical properties of synthetic self-assembled EXTs will<br/>be characterized and compared with a focus on monomer adhesion strength and<br/>polymer flexibility.

Whilst these systems carry out their main function, which is computation, they inadvertently generate traces that could potentially disclose sensitive information through alternative physical or digital pathways known as ?side-channels.? As we become increasingly dependent upon computing systems, it is more critical than ever to know how side-channel signals can be created, how side-channel leakage can be modeled, and how future software systems should be designed to be robust against side-channel attacks. This proposal explores new methods and tools for quantifying and modeling side-channels for a wide range of processors. Successful completion of this project brings new methods, findings, and open-source tools for analyzing and quantifying side-channels. Various designers and industries can gain advantages from these techniques and tools, including hardware designers, computer architects, compiler designers, and software developers. Our findings enable the construction of secure software systems while reducing cost and time-to-market. As an integral part of this research program, we also propose an educational agenda involving K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and broader security community education.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research proposal is to build a comprehensive tool for side-channel leakage analysis. To achieve this, we first need to improve our modeling capabilities, particularly for physical side-channels, and then focus on integrating these models into established simulation and analysis tools. Based on these needs, our proposal is structured into two research thrusts and an evaluation plan. Each thrust is further broken down into three main research objectives. The first thrust is focused on building an accurate tool to estimate power and electromagnetic (EM) side-channels at the software level. Using three research objectives, we plan to build a model that can accurately model various processor architectures as well as other important components (e.g., accelerators) on a system-on-chip (SoC). The second thrust is focused on modeling microarchitectural side-channels. Specifically, the main goal is to build a new tool that can combine established binary analysis tools with known side-channel leakage models. The ideas proposed will be evaluated using a detailed evaluation plan. We will apply our methods to a wide variety of systems and setups with different hardware and software designs. We will consider various scenarios including different microarchitecture designs (in-order, out-of-order, multicore) and different side-channels (physical electromagnetic signals, digital cache side-channels, transient/speculative side-channels).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While automation can increase precision and efficiency, setting up new automated workflows can be costly, requiring expertise and significant up-front engineering time. Because of this cost, automation is largely used for tasks that are sufficiently frequently used that this up-front investment can be recouped, such as in the context of mass production. Domain experts working at smaller scales or with niche workflows cannot benefit in the same ways, hindering their progress. In contrast, this research prioritizes a broader community of fabrication practitioners whose varied requirements demand a broad diversity of automation strategies. This project will help practitioners identify viable opportunities for automation in their work, contribute open-source software and hardware toolkits with which practitioners can author their own automated digital/physical workflows, and organize communities using and maintaining these technologies. These outputs will provide assistance to a wide range of people developing innovative human-centered systems that use digital/physical workflows in their chosen application areas through a series of courses and workshops that will be taught using these technologies and through their open-source release.<br/><br/>This research includes three main areas: formative research on the work of practitioners who span digital and physical spaces, such as fabricators or laboratory scientists; the development of novel devices and hardware modules for automating physical processes including motion control and active end effectors; and end-user software that scaffolds the authoring of automated digital/physical workflows, including modules that support the creation of task-specific artificial intelligence (AI) models for automated event detection.

Despite their importance, the structure and operation of the regions which supply magma to the surface remain poorly understood. It is currently uncertain, for example, whether magma is distributed across ?mush zones? spanning the entire crust or stored in distinct ?magma chambers?. This project will re-evaluate magma storage depths and the origin of chemical variability in volcanic systems in the Cascades using an approach that makes use of small pockets of magma trapped within erupted crystals, termed melt inclusions. Crucially, the CO2 contents of small bubbles within these melt inclusions will be measured directly, in addition to the surrounding melt. This project will contribute to the scientific understanding of volcanism along the Cascade arc, which presents a significant hazard to society. It will also foster close collaborations and a multi-tiered, peer-to-peer mentoring structure between two early career PIs, two graduate students, and multiple undergraduate students. The grant will also support a mentoring program for scientists and a virtual forum for academics to share their stories about adapting to fieldwork, conferences, and workshops.<br/><br/>The volatile contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions provide important constraints on the depths at which mafic magmas erupting in the Cascades were stored and staged prior to eruption. However, the vast majority (97%, N=410) of previously published olivine-hosted melt inclusion data from the Cascades did not measure CO2 in vapor bubble(s). Preliminary Raman analyses of N=339 Cascade vapor bubbles indicates that without these measurements, storage depths have been underestimated by factors of 2-5X. Measuring melt inclusion volatile contents while accounting for CO2 and carbonate in the vapor bubble (using in situ heating experiments) will better constrain magma storage depths in different regions of the Cascades and provide insights into any variations in storage depth along strike (perhaps due to melt H2O contents, crustal stress state, or magma flux rate). While whole-rock trace element analyses are commonly used to assess magmatic processes in both the crust and mantle, whole-rock samples are generally an amalgamation of materials assembled and modified over a great range of unknown depths. Trace element measurements from melt inclusions with known entrapment depths will better constrain assimilation and mixing processes affecting liquid compositions and can reveal where in the crust these processes occur. He isotope data from aliquots of olivine from the same samples will further constrain the extent to which crustal materials have contributed to the most mafic components. Together, these data will provide unique insights into the origins of enriched signatured of continental arc magmas. This study will also assess mantle melting conditions, the processes causing mafic magmas to stall in the crust, and other topics relevant for melt inclusion studies worldwide (e.g., identifying processes forming carbonate in vapor bubbles and testing bubble growth models). Graduate and undergraduate students will acquire skills in a wide variety of hands-on geochemical techniques, data interpretation, coding, and software development. Students will build networks by travelling to different laboratories, interacting with collaborators at academic and government institutions, and presenting their findings at professional conferences. The grant will also support the development and improvement of open-source software tools, helping the volcanological community move to data processing and modelling workflows which are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The PIs will also co-ordinate a virtual forum with panelists and a Q&A to share the voices and experiences of scientists with a broader audience, with a focus on laboratory and field work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, human-AI collaborative decision-making performance is often lower than expected. A lack of sufficient and effective engagement between the person and the AI is a fundamental contributor to these disappointing outcomes. Often, decision makers do not engage with the advice provided by the AI system with their full cognitive capacity or, when they do, they engage with it in ways that lead to inappropriate trust and reliance on the system---both under-reliance and over-reliance are a problem. In current practice, AI-based decision aids do not sufficiently encourage human engagement, nor do they take human engagement behaviors into account. This project aims to create radical new designs for human-AI interaction in which AI is engagement-oriented to improve human-AI collaborations in decision-making.<br/><br/>This project develops and evaluates three novel human-AI interaction paradigms: (1) Human-Reflective AI interaction, in which AI is designed to increase the decision makers' engagement level by guiding them to critically reflect on the decision process; (2) Human-Adaptive AI interaction, in which AI assistance will be presented in a personalized manner to nudge decision-makers into appropriately engaging with the AI recommendations; and (3) Human-Behavior-aware AI interaction, in which AI is trained to anticipate decision-makers' engagement behavior and optimize for the human-AI team performance. This project will contribute new scientific knowledge about ways to incorporate cognitive factors of decision-makers, including their capabilities and limitations, into the designs of AI-based decision aids to best support decision-makers and increase AI-human team performance. Comprehensive evaluations on the impacts of new human-AI interaction paradigms on usability, user experience, and the human-AI decision-making performance will reveal the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and inform the selection among them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there are two major challenges that must be addressed: how to quickly yet rigorously process such large datasets, and how to avoid becoming overconfident in the conclusions reached, given the limitations of the data and knowledge of how such systems work. This research develops a comprehensive framework and set of algorithms for addressing both of these challenges in a general way, so that scientists and other data analysts can use them off-the-shelf, thereby accelerating the acquisition of new knowledge. The work will be developed in the context of two modern application areas of broad interest. The first is to enable biologists to learn about the inner workings of systems that are difficult or impossible to observe directly (such as the internal functioning of cells or the evolutionary history of animal species). The second is to enable ecologists to predict how ecosystems change over periods of time ranging from months to decades, thereby enabling better management of ecosystems and deployment of ecological monitoring efforts. The investigator is working directly with experts in these applications to have an immediate and substantive impact in both areas. In one educational component of the project, the investigator is a core member of the team developing new modern introductory applied statistics courses for undergraduate students at Boston University. The investigator is also writing an accessible textbook on the design and analysis of algorithms for data science, which will be of broad interest to students and researchers in machine learning, data science, statistics, and related fields. <br/><br/>Despite many empirical successes, a lack of machine-learning methods with rigorous guarantees has resulted in systems that unpredictably perform poorly in real-world settings and therefore cannot be trusted for scientific discovery and safety-critical applications. Hence, there is an urgent need to create learning algorithms that are simultaneously scalable to the large datasets and high-dimensional models typical of machine-learning applications; able to accurately quantify uncertainty to ensure correct decision-making despite model misspecification, distribution shift, and data corruption; and are reliable and easy-to-use for the typical machine-learning practitioner. The primary technical objective of the project is to provide a comprehensive solution to these challenges by developing provably correct subsampling Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms with automated tuning procedures. The key technical tool is a statistical-scaling-limits approach to establishing statistical and algorithmic foundations for how to tune basic subsampling MCMC algorithms designed for inference in latent variable and Gaussian process models, and for modified subsampling MCMC algorithms that can improve computational efficiency and numerical stability. These theoretical developments will be translated into practical, user-friendly algorithms with diagnostics that inform the user if the theory is applicable to their problem. The theory and algorithms will also be extended to distributionally robust losses such as maximum mean discrepancy. The research program is highly interdisciplinary, drawing on theory and methods from large-scale probabilistic machine learning, statistics, stochastic analysis, stochastic process theory, and numerical analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Key advantages of such mixed conduction polymers include their flexible form factor,   their ability to be processed at low temperatures using additive printing approaches such as inkjet or screen printing, and their multifunctional technological capabilities. Through judicious choice of molecular structures, it is also possible to access water-soluble polymers that will enable development of environmentally benign options for a range of sensing, advanced computing, and energy applications. This project aims toward the discovery of new, sustainable mixed conduction polymer chemistries and processes and identify critical structure-function relationships. It will do so through a combination of chemical design and synthesis, molecular and structural characterization, property determination and optimization, as well as through an integrated theoretical and experimental approach.  As a result, new generations of mixed conduction polymers having unprecedented performance may be identified. Students engaged in the proposed project will benefit from the multidisciplinary nature of the program, developing technical expertise in balance with the ability to communicate and collaborate with scientists and engineers in other fields.

Known as organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), this class of polymers has characteristics believed to originate from ionically charged or polar side chains that readily solvate or interact with ionic species. To date, the choice of OMIEC chemistries is severely limited whereby transformational advancements in ab initio design require much improved fundamental insight into advantageous synthetically accessible molecular structures and thin-film morphologies that could allow for unprecedented levels of ionic-electronic coupling, compatibility with electrochemical doping, and ion percolation effects. To address limitations in materials design and transport phenomena in OMIECs, this project encompasses the following three Aims: (i) synthesize and characterize target OMIEC structures with unexplored side-chain and backbone paradigms; (ii) establish links between OMIEC backbone and side-chain chemistries and electrolyte gating, film swelling, and ion/electron transport properties through operando studies and molecular modeling; and (iii) explore mixed side-chain chemistries (via copolymerization and/or blending) as a route towards additional control over OMIEC properties. It is hypothesized that expanding the design space available to OMIEC materials via new side-chain chemistries, including additional design capabilities incorporated via copolymerization and blending, could enable unprecedented control over OMIEC properties and device performance. <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

WA CURE is a joint effort by 34 Washington State public community and technical colleges to expand the use of Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). Fifty-eight percent of Washington State?s undergraduate students are enrolled at community or technical colleges. Thirty-seven percent of STEM majors at these colleges identify with historically underrepresented groups, e.g., students of color, first-generation college students, and non-traditional learners such as working adults. Community and technical colleges report similar institutional barriers to adopting CUREs, such as a lack of research culture, institutional support, and connections to research infrastructure. Lessons learned from this project aim to generate useful insights for colleges to overcome these barriers to CURE adoption. <br/><br/>The project?s primary research questions will be: 1) How, and in what way, does participation in a CURE learning community affect a faculty member?s pedagogical practice? 2) To what extent do CUREs, as implemented by participating faculty, affect and potentially close equity gaps across student academic performance, persistence, completion, and transfer? and 3) How, and in what ways, does the college-wide implementation of CUREs identify and validate promising practices about organizational change, scaling CUREs at participating colleges, and replicating CUREs at colleges in other states? These questions will be addressed via three methods: 1) a professional development program to expand implementation of high-quality CUREs, complemented by a shared, open-access CURE curriculum archive; 2) a CURE ?institutionalization incubator? ? the WA CURE Academy ? to cultivate faculty leadership, form strategic action plans, and produce change through CURE implementation; and 3) new assessment and research infrastructure to foster a culture of scholarly teaching and research on CUREs at participating colleges, as well as increase awareness of related research opportunities among these colleges? students and faculty.

This carbon is at risk of being lost to the atmosphere and contributing to climate change, due to recent patterns of wildfire that are also related to climate change. Determining how wildfires affect C stored in the soil is difficult, because it is rare that researchers know where a wildfire will take place before it happens, so there are not often measurements of C content from before the wildfire. In addition to assessing how much C is lost to the atmosphere when organic matter is combusted during a wildfire, fires can change how the remaining soil C is transformed, as remaining organic matter decomposes and returns C to the atmosphere. For this RAPID project, the extensive wildfire season in Canada in 2023 offers this team a unique chance to measure fire-induced soil C losses at their previously studied sites and to compare the size of C emissions derived from combustion during the fire vs. decomposition afterwards. In this project, the researchers will test pre-fire samples and return to to obtain and test post-fire samples in order to determine how fires affected carbon cycling. This research offers a critical opportunity to leverage rare pre-fire data to investigate pressing questions about wildfire effects on soil C content in a globally-relevant ecosystem. The findings will inform understanding of post-wildfire ecology and interactions between fire severity and C cycling. In addition, junior researchers will be trained, and the project team will develop new outreach materials to engage the public on the topic of fires and soils.<br/><br/>As part of sampling campaigns in 2019 and 2022 in Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP), AB and NWT, Canada, and the surrounding region, the research group collected a large number of soil samples from sites that had not experienced fire for at least 30 years. They characterized pre-burn soil C and N concentrations, pH, microbial community composition, and respiration (decomposition). The 2023 WBNP fire complex burned 32 out of 70 of the previously sampled sites, representing a range of soil types, including organic-rich peatlands and sandy acidic soils, and dominant tree species. In this project, researchers are pairing post-burn sampling with the existing pre-burn samples to answer two questions: (1) How does fire severity relate to post-burn soil C decomposition rates? (2) How does the relative importance of C losses due to combustion vs. changes in C decomposition rates change over time with increasing fire severity? At each site, researchers will estimate C losses due to wildfire, collect soil cores and quantify soil C, and measure potential decomposition using soil incubations. They will use simple biogeochemical models to extrapolate potential net C losses through decomposition, to quantify the relative magnitude of these two major C loss pathways ? direct losses through combustion vs. changes in C decomposition rates after the wildfires. Further leveraging this dataset, researchers will collect and preserve subsamples of soil for future efforts to characterize microbial community composition. These samples will be compared with pre-burn (and lab-burned) microbial communities from previous sampling campaigns ? another opportunity to take advantage of these unusual pre-fire datasets. Samples will also be preserved for further chemical characterization supported by future proposals, in order to explore the potential role that organic matter chemistry plays in determining post-fire soil C decomposition rates. The research project will provide training for a graduate student, undergraduate field assistants, and a research technician, as well as enhance wildfire and climate change public education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teaching and learning in science classrooms are increasingly mediated by technology. Tragically, the use of technology has perpetuated inequities in science education because digital interfaces are designed and used in ways that frequently prohibit blind modes of learning. Consequently, this blind-led project is designed to improve the long-term accessibility of technology-mediated high school science education by improving teacher awareness and preparation. The aims of the project are to: (1) investigate the state of inservice teachers? knowledge about constructing born accessible (i.e., proactively accessible) technology-mediated science classes; and (2) iteratively develop opportunities for pre- and inservice teachers to learn how to construct born accessible technology-mediated science classes.<br/><br/>This project will explore high school teachers' knowledge of the technological, pedagogical, ideological, and legal aspects of creating born accessible technology-mediated science classroom experiences.  The project will seek to explore the factors that influence what teachers know.   The four-phase exploratory sequential mixed methods study will qualitatively explore teachers? knowledge.  The project will then develop and pilot an instrument to measure teacher knowledge.  Finally, the investigator will integrate the qualitative and quantitative research findings. In synergy with the research, the project will develop opportunities for preservice teachers to learn how to create technology-mediated science classes that are born accessible to blind and low-vision students. The education activities will use case-based learning and an iterative instructional design process to develop and implement: (1) a case library, (2) two hybrid units for preservice teachers, and (3) asynchronous open educational resources for pre- and inservice teachers nationwide. The project aims to improve the long-term accessibility of science education to foster blind and low-vision people?s full participation in science.

Understanding past farming and dietary conditions can also help to understand some of the challenges people face today. Traditional farming techniques can be insightful to global food security and cultivation practices in modern-day marginal environments. <br/><br/>This project addresses these issues by specifically asking: When did millet spread westward from its point of geographic origin?

The research team focuses on identifying organic residues preserved in pottery sherds to assess relevant receiving areas cooking techniques far from millet?s origin. They examine and evaluate the isotopic compositions of wheat and barley preserved at 41 sites to enable insights into the water management strategies in those regions. By addressing those questions, the implication of the project moves beyond the regional focus.

It will use seismic observations and methods to advance understanding of volcanic hazards and the fundamental processes that create different types of volcanoes and magma types. This volcanic system is active, and the presence of nearby population centers means the Three Sisters is classified as a Very High Threat volcanic system for the U.S. The Three Sisters volcanic complex includes a wide variety of volcanic structures and geologically young lavas (about 2,000 years old). Additionally, about two decades of satellite data show that areas near the volcanoes are deforming due to inflation under the surface. Existing data are scarce partly because the immediate vicinity of the volcanoes is a difficult to access and federally protected Wilderness. This project will add observations in these areas by using small temporary seismic instruments, that can be transported on foot and do not require digging, to address both the accessibility challenges and the need for minimal impact. Combining the new temporary seismic data with modern imaging and earthquake detection methods, the researchers will gain a systematic view of subsurface structures. This will assist in more rigorously understanding the record of prior eruptions and ongoing monitoring of deformation. The seismic data collection and analysis will engage students from multiple institutions and personnel from regional hazard monitoring agencies to promote professional training and communication to stakeholders.<br/><br/>The Three Sisters volcanic complex is classified by a U.S. Geologic Survey report as a Very High Threat system, with geodetic evidence for ongoing surface deformation, lava flows as young as about 1,600 years, and Holocene eruptions of compositions ranging from basaltic andesite to rhyolite. Yet, there is little knowledge of the 3-D distribution of middle to upper crustal magma storage and microseismicity beneath this multi-vent volcanic complex located within the High Cascades graben. Observational seismology has been limited by the need for minimal impact in a large federal Wilderness. The project will deploy an array of low-impact nodal seismometers to provide the first local imaging of the Three Sisters magmatic system. Analysis of the data will advance understanding of how magma reservoir structure in multi-vent systems is linked to spatial variations in edifice construction and erupted compositions, with dominantly basaltic andesite in the northern part of the volcanic complex transitioning to more prevalent rhyolite eruptions at the southern end. Seismic imaging with the new temporary network data will begin with relatively conventional ambient noise surface wave tomography and then push the boundaries of temporary nodal array imaging by applying anisotropic adjoint tomography. The influences of edifice topography and radial anisotropy on magma reservoir imaging will be tested with numerical 3-D wave propagation and inversion methods. The new data will also be used to scrutinize microseismic activity and conduct receiver function imaging of localized interfaces, which could better define interactions between tectonic and magmatic deformation structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research seeks to study how progressive tissue loss drives ventricular enlargement, leads to tissue damage associated with neuroinflammation and axon loss and is clearly visible in medical imaging of the brain. The framework will explain the impact of decade-long brain shape changes on functional brain structures, such as the ventricular wall.

That includes contributions to the annual Brain Awareness Week as well as research opportunities catered to 10th-graders and undergraduate engineering students.  <br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to combine medical image registration, mechanical characterization, and constitutive modeling to fundamentally understand the relationship between organ-level tissue volume loss and periventricular tissue degeneration during aging. Thus, the research objectives of this project include to (i) infer ventricular enlargement from longitudinal image data; (ii) to quantify the evolving properties of periventricular tissues; and (iii) to establish a constitutive brain aging model that predicts ventricular enlargement and corresponding periventricular whiter matter lesion locations. Upon completion of the work, it will become clear (i) how cerebral atrophy drives microstructural degeneration of periventricular white matter tissue and (ii) how the severity of age-related brain shape changes is a reliable predictor for the brain?s overall state of health. Additionally, the tools arising from this work will be an important addition to the soft tissue biomechanics community. The overarching focus will be on using the newly generated knowledge to identify subjects that are at increased risk for early periventricular white matter lesion formation. This project will ultimately allow the PI to advance the emerging field of computational and experimental neuromechanics and establish his long-term career in brain health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Third, this investigation aims to determine the design principles of number talks that positively impact productive mathematical identity development while determining how mathematics identity evolves over time. This project has the potential to improve kindergarten to third grade mathematics education for students by intentionally leveraging (and confirming) resources for productive mathematical identity development. Further, this project will also equip educators to design number talks building upon students' funds of knowledge and to also support their efforts to positively develop students' mathematical identities.<br/><br/>This project seeks to answer the overarching research question: What role does mathematics identity development play in learning processes? The principal investigator will collaborate with kindergarten to third grade students, families, teachers, and community partners across three schools and a community center. Using participatory design research methodologies, this project will begin in collaboration with students, families, and community partners by leveraging photovoice or participatory photography to document how mathematics is used in everyday, out-of-school activities. Then, teachers will engage in participatory research via Math Labs to iteratively plan, enact, reflect, and revise number talks connected to students' funds of knowledge. Together, we will seek to understand how the mathematical objects (i.e., images) contained in number talks will mediate learning to build students' identity and number sense by using qualitative analysis to understand the alignments/contradictions between interactions (people and tools), norms and practices (positioning within the learning community), frames (funds of knowledge lens), and narratives (resources for recognition) that afford/constrain mathematical identity development. Further, we will identify design principles of number talks (i.e., norms and practices) that support or hinder the development of productive mathematical identities.

Autonomous ground vehicles itself promise to prevent more than 9 million accidents and 2 million injuries annually, conserve 7 billion liters of fuel and save more than 36,000 lives while reducing healthcare costs associated with accidents by $190 billion in the U.S. However, successful mission execution and navigation of autonomous systems rely on accurate and reliable positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services. Current cyber-resilient PNT solutions, which rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), employ various techniques, such as inertial navigation systems (INS), vision-based sensing, the utilization of lower earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations or terrestrial pseudo satellites. However, they are susceptible to unintentional interference, multipath issues, atmospheric effects, segment errors, intentional interference or jamming, and spoofing. This CAREER project generates in-depth insights into the fusion and integration of built-in sensors (GNSS along with inertial and perception sensors) of autonomous systems for cyber-resilient navigation under threat uncertainties and contested environments. This project will investigate four complex problems related to integrated navigation systems: (i) threat modeling and cyber risk assessment; (ii) self-learning-based cyber attack modeling; (iii) signal, sensor fusion and navigation solution levels cyber attack detection; and (iv) secure autonomous navigation in contested environment; to advance fundamental knowledge on autonomous navigation challenges aggravated by growing cyber risks. This research pushes the boundaries of the science of cyber-resilient navigation under evolving cyber threat patterns. In addition, higher education is not keeping up with the increasing demand for a future cybersecurity workforce.

They form at the world?s mid-ocean ridge spreading centers and are important records of the plate spreading process. Past studies of abyssal hills have treated them as purely random processes. The statistical parameters of such processes, such as mean, variance, characteristic scale, etc., can be correlated to plate spreading conditions, such as spreading rate, magma supply and crustal thickness. In this way, abyssal hills across the oceans can be used to probe plate dynamics through space and time. Recently, however, some studies have reported the detection of periodic signals embedded within otherwise random abyssal hill profiles. Such a signal could be evidence of previously-unrecognized influence on mid-ocean ridge magma processes, such as climate-driven changes in sea level, or deep-seated modulations of magma delivery. This study will use a new, robust algorithm developed by the lead PI. It detects and quantifies (amplitude, wavelength) periodic signals embedded within a random field. The algorithm will be applied to bathymetric data in the North and South Atlantic Oceans. There, decades-worth of surveys and transits provide abundant data for analysis. Periodic values will first be correlated to past spreading parameters to establish basic relationships. Regional variations in periodic values will then be investigated. This will permit investigating possible deep-earth controls on the formation of periodic signals. The result should establish key constraints in the future modeling of mid-ocean ridges. In addition, the code will be made available to the general public with a user-friendly interface. This will enable non-expert researchers and students in a variety of fields to make use of the algorithm. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The existence, or not, of periodicities in abyssal hill morphology has been vigorously debated in recent publications, and some have hypothesized that such periodicities are evidence of external forcing, such as by the impact of Milankovitch cycle-caused sea level fluctuations on the volcanic construction process at mid-ocean ridges (MORs), or internally forced, such as by modulations of mantle upwelling. This project will employ a newly-developed empirically pre-whitening algorithm for detecting and quantifying periodic signals that are embedded in a random field. It will be applied to the abundant archival trackline bathymetry data in the North and South Atlantic Oceans, which samples large and diverse regions of abyssal hills formed at slow-spreading MORs. This will enable testing of a first hypothesis: that temporal periodicities are present in slow-spreading MOR-generated abyssal hills. Preliminary analysis provides initial support, but confidently doing so requires much more than a few anecdotal examples.  The existence of periodicities in the seafloor fabric could have significant implications for understanding and modeling MOR dynamics. If periodicities in abyssal hill morphology do exist, what factors of MOR spreading are they responsive to? This question leads us to a second hypothesis: that variations in temporal periodicities exist that are related to spreading properties and mantle conditions at the MOR at the time of formation. It can be tested directly by correlating periodic parameters to paleo-spreading rates, and indirectly by comparing periodic parameters to aperiodic statistical parameters, such as RMS height and characteristic scale, which are themselves correlated with various MOR parameters as noted above. This project will also investigate whether or not there are regional patterns to the periodicities measured, which could be indicative of responsiveness to mantle heterogeneities. For example, recent modeling indicates that periods and amplitudes of crustal thickness-derived seafloor periodicities will be dependent on mantle permeability, a poorly-constrained parameter that is critical for modeling melt transport in the mantle. <br/><br/>By modernizing the original code for operation in a Python coding environment, the technique will be accessible to a wider audience, and has the potential to be used in interpreting a wide variety of Earth science and other time series (e.g., climate and weather, oceanographic, etc?). The team will promote the code through social media and develop materials to train interested users. Support of an early career scientist and building capacity in computational geoscience is a further broader impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The state-of-the-art silicon power devices are approaching silicon material limits, which urges the exploration of new semiconductors for next-generation power electronics. Ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors possess unique material properties for future power electronics that promise far superior performance beyond the incumbent silicon and maturing gallium nitride and silicon carbide power technologies. Aluminum nitride (AlN) exhibits the largest bandgap and critical electric field in the UWBG semiconductor family with excellent thermal conductivity, which can enable power electronics with higher efficiency, higher voltage, high frequency, and higher operation temperature. However, the performance of current AlN power devices lags far behind AlN material limits due to poor fundamental understanding of AlN epitaxy, surfaces, contacts, and devices. This project aims to significantly advance the development of UWBG AlN-based field-effect transistors (FETs) for high-performance power electronics through innovative integrated material and device engineering. Critical material and device obstacles for AlN power FETs will be tackled, and the project will lead to new fundamental insights into AlN and its epitaxial science, surface, contacts, and power devices. This research is promising to unlock the full potential of UWBG AlN for high-efficiency, high-voltage, fast, compact, and robust power electronics and transformative for other UWBG semiconductors? fundamental research and device development. The successful outcome of the UWBG AlN power technology can increase energy efficiency and security, reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve resiliency and efficiency of the electric grid, enhance penetration of electric vehicles and renewables, and significantly contribute to carbon neutral and net-zero carbon goals. In addition, this project will offer various education opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students on power semiconductors and enhance student diversity in STEM fields, including mentoring undergraduates in research, developing new semiconductor curriculum, organizing outreach and intern programs for K-12 students, broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, and collaborating with semiconductor industry for workforce training.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop high-performance UWBG AlN power FETs through holistic material and device engineering for next-generation high-efficiency, high-voltage, high-temperature power electronics. Five research thrusts are proposed to address crucial material and device impediments toward AlN power FETs with performance close to AlN limits. AlN epitaxy science and engineering in Thrust 1 will obtain a fundamental understanding of growth dynamics and doping mechanisms of AlN homoepitaxy via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and shed light on defects, doping, and carrier transport in homoepitaxial AlN. AlN surface science and engineering in Thrust 2 will significantly enrich the surface science and knowledge of AlN on different crystal orientations using comprehensive material and electrical characterizations and develop effective surface engineering to mitigate adverse surface effects. AlN contact study and optimization in Thrust 3 will enhance and optimize AlN Schottky and ohmic contacts essential in AlN FETs via novel regrowth and processing technologies. AlN power device engineering in Thrust 4 will implement innovative electric field management approaches to prevent premature device failure and develop normally-off AlN power FETs with the aid of device modeling and material innovations from other thrusts. Thrust 5 will realize monolithically integrated AlN power electronics with power FETs, drivers, and control circuits for higher efficiency, higher power density, faster switching, smaller form factor, and higher robustness, which is the first of its kind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this CAREER project is to develop a theory of fine-grained complexity for approximation algorithms for a few fundamental problems.

In the shallow water of the surf zone the time-averaged wave-driven forcing raises water levels near the shoreline and, in the case of obliquely incident waves, drives alongshore currents. The resulting circulation patterns include a rich field of eddies and vortices. Surfzone eddies have been hypothesized to be generated by instabilities of sheared alongshore currents, by wave-group modulations of the sea surface, by the ends of breaking waves, and by currents interacting with complex bathymetry. This project will address these hypotheses with a unique suite of high spatial resolution estimates of currents from remote sensing and in situ sensors obtained during prior field studies that include a wide range of wave conditions and bathymetries.<br/><br/>Existing extensive field observations of surfzone waves, circulation patterns, and underlying bathymetry will be used to test hypotheses about surfzone vorticity that were derived from numerical studies. These hypotheses include: (1) on an alongshore variable seafloor, the dominant spatial scales of surfzone vorticity depend on spatial scales of the underlying bathymetry, and these large-scale eddies are tied to the seafloor inhomogeneities; (2) small spatial-scale vorticity also depends on the vorticity injected into the water column at the ends of breaking waves, which increases with the directional spread of the wave field; (3) during energetic conditions, the momentum of alongshore currents can overcome forces (such as bathymetry-induced pressure gradients) that cause complex circulation patterns, resulting in alongshore-uniform flow with significantly reduced large-scale vorticity. Although the data used here are from a specific field site, the wide range of wave and bathymetric conditions observed over a decade allows development of a surfzone vorticity climatology that will be applicable at many locations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, understanding of how to support effective collaboration structures in CS classrooms is limited by two factors. First, existing CS curricula tend to emphasize individual assignments and participation structures, while often actively discouraging collaboration and learning from peers. Second, classroom technologies such as iPads and Chromebooks are inherently single-user devices, making productive collaboration challenging in practice.<br/><br/>The project brings together teams of K-12 educators, computer scientists, learning scientists, and undergraduate students to develop technology and curriculum.

Hybridization is also involved in economically important processes such as the domestication of crop plants and the evolution of weedy species. Biologists have made substantial progress describing hybridization in many organisms and investigating its significance for evolutionary adaptation and the origin of new species. However, the reasons behind why some organisms hybridize often but others do not remain obscure. Understanding these reasons requires an appropriate research organism that has engaged in hybridization in different environments both in ancient and modern times. This study will use the flowering plant genus Heuchera, commonly known as alumroot or coral bells. Researchers will study the environmental context of hybridization in Heuchera across North America and through its recent geological history. The relationship between hybridizing species and their climatic environment will be assessed using genetic data for all species, ecological modeling, and volatile chemical profiling of plants and their pollinators. These data and models will be implemented into a teaching plan that introduces data science training into classes at Mississippi State University. Students will gain hands-on experience through course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). This project will benefit two established courses, and two new courses will be developed. Summer research experiences will further enable students to learn field, lab, and computational skills. Additionally, a workshop for high school teachers will result in development of data science curricula for high school students. The researchers will also outreach to the scientific community through a Data Wrangling workshop series aimed at early-career plant scientists. Finally, the researchers will launch a website focusing on publicly accessible scientific information for these economically important landscaping plants.<br/><br/>The overall theory that this project seeks to test is that hybridization frequency is related to change through time both of organisms and of the environments they live in, both of which control the flow of genetic information.

Rough patches on fault surfaces can collide and lock, preventing any further movement on a fault. Earthquakes begin when these rough patches break, and earthquake characteristics are controlled by frictional processes at the fault surface that evolve as the earthquake occurs. This project will advance our understanding of the physics of earthquakes by exploring two mechanisms that may regulate the friction of faults during earthquakes. The first occurs when heating leads to increased pressure in fluids, which can promote continued slip in earthquakes through lubrication, and the second is hardening due to producing more space for the lubricating fluids, which can impede earthquakes. To better understand these processes, the PI will conduct experiments at earthquake like conditions using a one-of-a-kind deformation apparatus at Brown University. The PI will test the roles of natural fault roughness and wear processes on the two competing processes. The results from this work will advance our understanding of earthquake physics and will inform the development and modification of new and existing earthquake rupture models. These models play a vital role in mitigating earthquake hazard and risk worldwide by improving the understanding of earthquake processes. This project will also enable the PI?s continued participation in DEEPS CORES, a program that develops and implements STEM curriculum for local Providence public schools. DEEPS CORES aims to expand participation in STEM fields from under-represented groups and to improve science literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>Experimental validation of physics-based constitutive equations that describe the frictional behavior of geologic materials during seismic slip is a critical step in advancing physics-based dynamic rupture models for earthquakes. This work will use the newly modified Tullis Rotary Shear Apparatus at Brown University to conduct several suites of dynamic rock friction experiments investigating two mechanisms that may regulate the frictional behavior of faults during earthquakes: thermal pore-fluid pressurization weakening (TPW) and dilatancy hardening (DH). TPW occurs as frictionally heated pore fluids thermally expand faster than the fault pores. In poorly drained conditions during seismic slip, this leads to increases in the pore pressure that decrease the shear stress acting on the fault thereby weakening the fault. DH has the opposite effect in which shearing causes the formation of new microcracks increases total pore volume, thereby reducing pore fluid pressure and strengthening faults. TPW will only be significant during earthquakes if DH is minimal. To elucidate to roles of wear and fault roughness on dynamic friction and explore the balance between TPW and DH, the PI is conducting experiments at slip rates up to 1 m/s, elevated confining pressures (45-60 MPa), and elevated pore pressures (25-40 MPa) on samples with both variable permeability and sliding surface roughness mimicking the range of fault roughness measured on faults in nature. Mechanical data will be combined with microstructural analysis and micromechanical modelling to guide the analysis and interpretation of results. These experiments will be the first with independently controlled and elevated pore pressure, confining pressure, and normal stress at slip rates of 1 m/s. It will establish conditions under which wear processes, enhanced by natural fault roughness, allow TPW to develop in samples with varying permeabilities and will also establish the extent to which DH counteracts TPW on rough surfaces at high displacements.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Earth Sciences, Geophysics Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project sites are distributed across landscapes with diverse environmental and social attributes, and so represent ideal case studies to examine how communities with differing conditions coped with the challenges posed by colonial expectations and local environmental realities. The project applies dendroanthracological techniques to identify specific woodland management and wood-use practices that may have been used to maximize wood production in specific areas. Through the analysis of botanical assemblages of seeds, agricultural patterns are mapped across environmental zones and historical boundaries, contributing to a broader understanding of agricultural opportunities and constraints in the colonial Southwest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fishponds were essential for community food production and held special cultural significance. Land use was managed through a traditional approach called the Ahupua?a system. Each ahupua?a was self-sufficient for the community it served and stretched from the reefs of the shoreline (makai) to the mountain ridges above (mauka). Native Hawaiians began revival of their cultural heritage over the last 50 years, including restoration of ancient fishponds and methods used to cultivate food. Decline of plantation agriculture in Hawaii over has reduced agricultural education in schools. This project aims to investigate how to integrate sustainable aquaculture practices embraced by Native Hawaiians for centuries with emerging agricultural technologies (AgTech) focused on using sensors, measurement of relevant parameters, and data science literacy. The project immerses high school students in Hawaii to the traditional knowledge and heritage of fishponds and aquaculture alongside hands-on science investigations using emerging technologies to improve agricultural practices. Students use smart farming technologies and sensors to collect data and employ data science to understand and make decisions about the best ways to grow limu (seaweed).  Students gain new skills in data science and agricultural technologies in general, as well as connect with knowledge holders in their community to gain a deeper appreciation for their Hawaiian heritage, culture and knowledge. <br/><br/>The Institute for Future Intelligence (IFI) and the Pacific International Center for High Technology Research (PICHTR) collaborate to research and develop an integrated STEM curriculum focused on AgTech that will connect traditional and modern practices in aquaculture to promote culturally responsive STEM education. The efficiency and sustainability of aquaculture production can be further improved with innovative AgTech, while modern agricultural/aquacultural practices would be enhanced by the traditional Hawaiian approaches to growing food in a community that connects the mountain to the shore. The project will be piloted at Castle High School in the Windward district of Oahu. Teacher professional development workshops will be offered to STEM teachers across Hawaii. The research project takes a mixed methods approach to investigate three driving inquiries: (1) In what ways and to what extent can the project enhance student learning of AgTech, data science and AI concepts and practices through innovative use of Integrated STEM curriculum design? (2) In what ways and to what extent can the project increase students? interest in modern smart agriculture practices and develop partnerships for career and workforce preparation when meaningful connections to place-based and traditional knowledge are integrated into the curriculum? (3) In what ways and to what extent can the project improve equitable STEM education, interest in careers in agriculture and aquaculture, and workforce preparation when modern data science and AgTech approaches are used in the curriculum? This project strives towards four outcomes: (1) students learn to use emerging AgTech and data science practices, (2) students learn STEM within the context of the historically significant aquaculture in Hawaiian society, (3) students conduct scientific research in aquaculture, and (4) students are prepared to enter the STEM workforce with knowledge of current AgTech practices or continue their education in the related fields at colleges. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Piercing numbers is an area in discrete mathematics that seeks the minimum number of elements needed to intersect all the sets in a given family of sets. This minimal set of elements is called a piercing set of the family. Many practical problems can be formulated as questions about piercing sets, where the family of sets may arise in various contexts (e.g., subscribers in a social network, geographical areas, biological cells). An example from cellular communication is as follows: given that the range of a cell tower is 200 feet, what is the minimum number of towers a company has to place, and where should those towers be placed, so that every household has service? Here, the family of sets is the family of disks of radius 200 feet centered at every household, and cell towers are to be placed at every point of a piercing set. Fair division and mass partition are areas in economics and discrete mathematics where one aims to find optimal ways to divide a set of goods equitably among agents with subjective preferences. These methods can be used to divide an estate, a jewelry collection, or a piece of land among heirs, or to split up the assets of a business when a partnership is being dissolved. As is apparent in all the above examples, the questions studied as part of this project are natural, intuitive, and easy to formulate. However, they are often notoriously difficult to answer and require sophisticated tools from different areas of mathematics. This project aims to develop such tools from an area of mathematics called topology. The educational component of this project includes delivering summer schools on ?Topological Methods in Combinatorics? to undergraduate and graduate students, writing a textbook on the subject, and mentoring students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the development of a topological framework based on the KKM theorem and its extensions to address these problems. This topological framework can be described as follows: the configuration space of all possible solutions to the problem (that is, all possible piercing sets/mass partitions/partition of goods) is modeled by a polytope P; if no ""good"" solution is found among the set of all possible solutions P, then one obtains a KKM cover of P; the conclusion of the topological theorem, namely that a large enough collection of the sets in this KKM cover intersects, is then translated to a contradiction to the given properties of the family of sets/mass/goods in question. The main objectives of this project include two primary aspects: first, the discovery of new KKM-type theorems that can be effectively employed within this topological framework, and second, the exploration of innovative ways to leverage this topological method in resolving discrete math problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The enriched count detects such differences. In some cases, it is closely connected to the number of holes of dimension d in the shape of a space of real solutions to the equations. This project exploits the power of the enriched count, exposing potential applications in number theory and algebraic geometry. The award will also support a pipeline for a strong and diverse mathematical workforce.  This will involve a continuing program of week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During this program, the PI will facilitate collaborative projects with high school student and teachers, providing background material as necessary. Graduates from the summer program will be encouraged to continue on to a Research Experience for Undergraduates that will provide further mathematical training and research mentorship.  <br/><br/>The proposed research studies number-theoretic and algebro-geometric questions using cohomology theories and homotopical methods in the framework of Morel and Voevodsky's A1-homotopy theory.

New Gromov--Witten invariants defined over general fields have the potential to satisfy wall-crossing formulas, surgery formulas, and WDVV equations. For this, the project studies notions of spin over general fields. The Weil conjectures connect the number of solutions to equations over finite fields to the topology of their complex points: The zeta function of a variety over a finite field is simultaneously a generating function for the number of solutions to its defining equations and a product of characteristic polynomials of endomorphisms of cohomology groups. The ranks of these cohomology groups are the Betti numbers of the associated complex manifold. The logarithmic derivative of the zeta function is enriched to a power series with coefficients in the Grothendieck--Witt group, producing a connection with the associated real manifold.

An intellectual challenge in studying word problem solving is separating out and modeling the different cognitive skills that word problems draw on, such as mathematical reasoning, verbal reasoning, linguistic knowledge, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. All of these can contribute to the difficulty that children face when solving word problems but it has traditionally been difficult to identify the role that language plays since human language is messy and complicated. With the advent of Large Language Models, of which the most well-known recent example is ChatGPT, it is now far easier to model and systematically probe a wide variety of language behavior. This CAREER project will use Large Language Models and computational techniques to study math word problem solving in elementary school students (Grades 3-5). The project will lead to the creation of a novel data set of word problems, new insights into both word problem solving and language models, and a system that allows for the generation of custom word problems for use in classrooms. The project has the potential to lead to the eventual development of techniques that will help children who struggle with word problem solving. The investigator?s teaching mission focuses largely on teaching students and the public about the increasingly important and rapidly changing landscape of language technology. He will teach courses focused on language technology, ethical issues surrounding language models, and participate in public panels for disseminating this information more widely.<br/><br/>To enable studying the capacities required for solving word problems in higher granularity than was possible before the existence of Large Language Models, this project will create a novel bank of word problems that vary along a variety of linguistic dimensions (e.g., syntactic and lexical complexity). Then, the project team will use modern causal intervention techniques on computational language models to partition out the sources of difficulty in these problems. The second phase of the project is to collect human data from kids in Grades 3-5, modeling individual variation and demographic variation along mathematical, verbal, and linguistic dimensions. The third phase is to develop language-model-based system for generating word problems that vary in difficulty along several possible dimensions. The computational modeling work has the potential to answer longstanding questions about how linguistic variables can increase or ameliorate word problem solving difficulty. On the computational side, there is the potential for major improvements in language model interpretability, which is itself a major goal in computational language processing since these models are, in effect, black boxes and the ways they implement abstract behaviors remain mysterious. This CAREER project is supported by the EDU Core Research (ECR) program.

Cognitive, cultural, and data biases can interfere with these processes at every stage, requiring data analysts to be thoughtful and reflective as they do their work. This project?s goal is to help analysts reduce their biases through tools that help them critically assess their thought processes using metacognition, or thinking about thinking. Metacognition will be a guiding idea for developing tool features that help analysts be aware of possible biases. Studies of metacognition have shown that it can be helpful in other educational and analysis settings; this project will use ideas from those studies to develop methods that identify potential biases and present activities to help analysts avoid them. The project team will also create educational materials and work with non-profit partner organizations to help the general public think more deeply about their own analytic strategies and how they might be improved. <br/><br/>This project will apply theories of metacognition to address human biases and improve decision-making processes on an individual level. The project is structured around four research thrusts. The researchers will first organize theories of metacognition and translate them into an actionable design space of metacognitive interventions in visual analytics (Thrust I). Next, the researchers will work alongside non-profit partner organizations to co-design and develop a suite of metacognitive interventions (Thrust II) and evaluate those interventions in a series of laboratory experiments (Thrust III). Finally, the researchers will assess the extent to which empirical findings translate to real-world efficacy in a case study deployment of metacognitive interventions (Thrust IV). This work will test whether meta-cognitive interventions, when successfully applied in data-driven decision-making, can both boost awareness of the technical accuracy of analytic results and foster more thoughtful, socially accountable, and diligent practices in data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The economic and human toll of these navigational difficulties is often underestimated. Researchers have found tremendous economic losses resulting from poor architectural design, measured in millions of missed appointments and missed flights, delayed deliveries, reduced performance of new and temporary staff members, and time spent providing directions to visitors. The immediate human costs of stressful buildings can also be substantial, particularly for those whose needs are frequently overlooked in design, such as the elderly and the young, and people with cognitive impairments, among others. Spatial anxiety and frustrating inefficiency are very real phenomena with implications for the wellbeing of those who must work in and navigate through buildings whose designs are not user-friendly. To make the built environment easier to navigate, it is now possible to use virtual simulation tools that analyze a building?s layout, check for ?problem spots? and confusing design features, and evaluate the human effects of altering specific environmental features. Performing such analytical checks on design documents before the building is constructed can save a great deal of financial expense and human grief in the long run. The goal of this project is to use data from actual human navigational experiences to help improve such computational design-evaluation tools. Better design review will contribute to more comfortable and enjoyable public spaces, and produce economic benefits through improved operational efficiency in facilities such as hospitals and airports. <br/><br/>This research proposes a transformative approach to evidence-based design (EBD), a field that has traditionally relied on logistically complex and expensive methods such as post-occupancy studies and participatory design sessions with building users to inform design decisions. The research will leverage the unique capabilities of virtual reality (VR) to create engaging wayfinding evaluation tasks in various facilities, and collect data about how participants navigate through these virtual buildings and react to key environmental features. The researchers will then identify predictable trends in the extensive resulting dataset via machine learning. This approach will allow us to replace the rationalized pathfinding algorithms used in existing crowd-simulation models (which are wildly inaccurate in relation to actual human behavior) with an Evidence-Based Cognitive Agents Model (EBCAM) to produce more realistic simulated human responses to architectural features. As a final step, the researchers will validate the EBCAM simulation by comparing, and, if necessary, fine-tuning, its predictions against data collected from human participants in two real-world buildings. This project also extends human?building interaction analysis beyond wayfinding performance outcomes, by considering broader factors in spatial experience such as uncertainty, emotional response, and spatial memory. The extent of continuous data collection that will be performed regarding psychological factors during wayfinding, unprecedented in previous studies, will allow for testing new theoretical frameworks in the spatial navigation field, as well as enhancing the evidence-based simulation tool. The application of these empirical findings in the form of a simulation tool vastly increases their accessibility in design workflows, potentially making it possible for a much broader range of facilities to receive the benefits of evidence-based review. The general public can benefit from such expansion in evidence-based design analysis, which until now has mostly been limited to wealthy, urban contexts. The research will further enhance the usability of design by incorporating overlooked groups such as older adults, developing a model that reflects their specific needs. The tool will empower designers to work more confidently and creatively, knowing that evidence-based evaluations can help to confirm or refute the value of an innovative idea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central objective is to overcome the current dichotomy within polymer science wherein recyclable and reprocessable materials often lack stability, while more robust ones lead to negative consequences because of their long-term environmental persistence. Through innovative design and precise molecular manipulation, this project aims to develop polymers that offer both long-term usability and innate reparability while maintaining their robust nature and resistance to solvents and high temperatures. The research will explore the critical molecular parameters of an underutilized chemical moiety that will govern polymer lifecycle?from synthesis to degradation?balancing processability with performance. The success of this project will lead to materials that require less frequent replacement, thereby reducing waste and promoting sustainability. Critical components of this project involve educational and outreach activities directed toward local students of all levels, as well as training and professional development of graduate and undergraduate students in emerging areas of chemistry and polymer science.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The research focuses on four specific aims that collectively seek to expand the capabilities of covalent adaptable materials (CANs). Aim 1 investigates using pendent squarate esters as a novel dynamic exchange mechanism for CANs to improve the diversity of catalyst-free exchange chemistries for vitrimer materials. Aim 2 will explore the influence of pendent group squaramides on supramolecular polymer networks, aiming to understand how squaramides contribute to network properties and responsive behavior. The work in Aim 3 will combine squaramide and vinylogous urethane exchange to generate materials that are both dynamic-covalent and supramolecular, aiming to illustrate the enhanced properties that can be attained through straightforward methods. Aim 4 seeks to develop a new dynamic exchange approach through step-growth polycondensation, aiming to introduce unique exchange chemistry for CANs. The research employs a comprehensive set of molecular manipulations designed to elucidate fundamental structure-property relationships. The modularity of the approach provides a viable platform for understanding the roles of chain structure, topology, and functionality in the dynamic behavior of associatively crosslinked polymers. The scientific broader impacts of this research contribute to sustainability by designing polymers with longer life spans and recyclability. The work extends the benefits of dynamic networks to new exchange mechanisms, offering an alternative route to sustainable materials. The educational goals include this project serving as a training ground for the next generation of scientists. Students will acquire expertise in various synthetic and materials characterization methods, gaining a balanced understanding of both contemporary and foundational aspects of polymer science. A multi-pronged outreach program aims to foster excitement and broaden participation in science. The program includes research experiences with a focus on underrepresented minorities. By integrating scientific research with educational and outreach activities, the project aims to make a significant contribution to the field of polymer science while also addressing broader societal needs.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their importance, the structure and operation of the regions which supply magma to the surface remain poorly understood. It is currently uncertain, for example, whether magma is distributed across ?mush zones? spanning the entire crust or stored in distinct ?magma chambers?. This project will re-evaluate magma storage depths and the origin of chemical variability in volcanic systems in the Cascades using an approach that makes use of small pockets of magma trapped within erupted crystals, termed melt inclusions. Crucially, the CO2 contents of small bubbles within these melt inclusions will be measured directly, in addition to the surrounding melt. This project will contribute to the scientific understanding of volcanism along the Cascade arc, which presents a significant hazard to society. It will also foster close collaborations and a multi-tiered, peer-to-peer mentoring structure between two early career PIs, two graduate students, and multiple undergraduate students. The grant will also support a mentoring program for scientists and a virtual forum for academics to share their stories about adapting to fieldwork, conferences, and workshops.<br/><br/>The volatile contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions provide important constraints on the depths at which mafic magmas erupting in the Cascades were stored and staged prior to eruption. However, the vast majority (97%, N=410) of previously published olivine-hosted melt inclusion data from the Cascades did not measure CO2 in vapor bubble(s). Preliminary Raman analyses of N=339 Cascade vapor bubbles indicates that without these measurements, storage depths have been underestimated by factors of 2-5X. Measuring melt inclusion volatile contents while accounting for CO2 and carbonate in the vapor bubble (using in situ heating experiments) will better constrain magma storage depths in different regions of the Cascades and provide insights into any variations in storage depth along strike (perhaps due to melt H2O contents, crustal stress state, or magma flux rate). While whole-rock trace element analyses are commonly used to assess magmatic processes in both the crust and mantle, whole-rock samples are generally an amalgamation of materials assembled and modified over a great range of unknown depths. Trace element measurements from melt inclusions with known entrapment depths will better constrain assimilation and mixing processes affecting liquid compositions and can reveal where in the crust these processes occur. He isotope data from aliquots of olivine from the same samples will further constrain the extent to which crustal materials have contributed to the most mafic components. Together, these data will provide unique insights into the origins of enriched signatured of continental arc magmas. This study will also assess mantle melting conditions, the processes causing mafic magmas to stall in the crust, and other topics relevant for melt inclusion studies worldwide (e.g., identifying processes forming carbonate in vapor bubbles and testing bubble growth models). Graduate and undergraduate students will acquire skills in a wide variety of hands-on geochemical techniques, data interpretation, coding, and software development. Students will build networks by travelling to different laboratories, interacting with collaborators at academic and government institutions, and presenting their findings at professional conferences. The grant will also support the development and improvement of open-source software tools, helping the volcanological community move to data processing and modelling workflows which are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The PIs will also co-ordinate a virtual forum with panelists and a Q&A to share the voices and experiences of scientists with a broader audience, with a focus on laboratory and field work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The meeting is open to all with interest in CompMath, with a particular emphasis on attracting current and recent PIs of the CompMath program, as well as early career researchers such as junior professors, postdocs, and Ph.D. students working in CompMath. The meeting aims to achieve three primary goals: (1) Community building in CompMath by bringing together the CompMath community to strengthen and expand the network of NSF-supported PIs. Parallel research sessions serve as a platform to highlight the achievements of the PIs and the CompMath program; (2) Engagement of early career scientists through a poster session designed to highlight their works, activities aimed at the professional development of early career researchers, and travel support for these attendees; (3) A forward-looking report will be compiled by the organizers by leveraging community input that presents an overview of discussions during the meeting and summarizes any strategic community recommendations and outcomes from the meeting focusing on the major achievements of CompMath, current challenges, and exciting new research directions.<br/><br/>The CompMath disciplinary program at NSF supports a variety of research endeavors, which include more classical foci of numerical analysis, PDE solving algorithms, and mathematical optimization, along with the more recent and/or nascent subfields of randomized linear algebra, computational imaging, and mathematical aspects of data science and machine learning. Investigators from these subfields indeed attend their own discipline-specific conferences and professional events and also take opportunities to attend meetings in related fields. However, there is a dearth of meeting opportunities between a large collection of researchers who focus on the broad collection of foundational research questions in CompMath. Because the community of PIs supported by project awards from the NSF CompMath program does not have targeted events/conferences where the community broadly meets, the main motivation for this proposal is to organize such a professional meeting. The PI meeting will feature focused presentation sessions where PI?s will highlight their NSF-supported work in the previously described technical research areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the storage-stack infrastructure that underpins current datacenter storage services was designed in the pre-datacenter era, primarily for desktop and on-premise computers. When used as-is in datacenter systems, this storage stack incurs unnecessary performance overhead, poorly utilizes resources, and hampers sustainability objectives. Consequently, this results in elevated costs for millions of users relying on datacenter storage. This project aims to design and develop local storage stacks specifically tailored for datacenters to enhance performance, optimize resource utilization, and contribute positively to sustainability goals.<br/><br/>The key technical approach is to ingrain datacenter-awareness into the local storage stack ? in particular, the fact that datacenter systems are designed with inherent redundancy to tolerate failures. This project takes a broad view and identifies four fundamental pillars of storage stacks: performance, crash safety, efficiency, and data integrity. In four synergistic research thrusts, we will redesign and optimize the mechanisms underlying the above pillars by exploiting the inherent redundancy.

Indeed, many interventions aimed at improving people?s functioning and/or quality of life, ranging from psychological therapy to military training, attempt to improve this ability. However, our understanding of the effects of stress on inhibitory control is relatively limited. This project characterizes how stressful situations influence the cognitive mechanisms and processes underlying inhibitory control. The results of this project thus have the potential to identify mechanisms that could be targeted by relevant interventions to improve their effectiveness. In addition, the data collected in this project will be used to develop a publicly available novel course, as well as workshops, to disseminate both the knowledge of the project?s results and the technical skills needed to use the project?s methods. The dissemination of these results and technical skills is likely to contribute to long-term societal benefits, such as improved mental health and productivity. <br/><br/>Although a number of studies have examined the effects of stress on inhibitory control, current theory and important findings from each area?s primary literature have not been considered in the work combining the two. As a result, conflicting results abound in work on stress and inhibitory control, and some findings are difficult to reconcile with current theories of inhibition under stress. Using experimentally manipulated acute stress, computational cognitive modeling, and both standard and mouse-tracking cognitive tasks, the studies in this project develops a new theory of how stress influences inhibitory control. Analytic methods include not only standard behavioral analysis, but also salivary hormone assays, cognitive model parameter estimation, and analysis of nuanced mouse-tracking dynamics unfolding over time. The goal is to advance our understanding of how contextual factors, such as stress, influence inhibitory control, which contributes to both basic science and may guide the development of interventions to improve inhibitory control. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Perception, Action and Cognition and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advancements in the human-technology frontier demand the readiness of next-generation scientists who can further develop and test such technologies. Yet, regions of our nation are experiencing a significant shortage of qualified job candidates. This ITEST design and development project tackles the challenge of workforce development in the state of Alabama, by creating a physiological computing curriculum for upper elementary school children enrolled in afterschool settings. Participating children will measure their own physiological data (such as muscle energy) and design computer programs that react to their data in real time. Through the curriculum and extracurricular activities, the project also exposes participating children and their families to emerging computing careers. By focusing on how participation impacts children?s career aspirations and confidence for learning STEM, the project has the potential to inform current understanding of the barriers, challenges, and successes young learners experience during physiological computing and how their conceptual understanding of foundational computer science concepts evolves. <br/><br/>Anticipating that future generations of engineers and scientists will need skills related to creating computer applications and programs associated with human movements and emotions via electrical activity, this three-year project will develop and iteratively implement a standards-aligned, physiological computing curriculum with a disciplinary literacy approach that encourages career exploration and critical thinking. The project uses design-based implementation research to examine its hypothesis that participation in the physiological computing environment and related career enrichment activities will enhance elementary students? conceptual understanding of computer science, self-efficacy for learning STEM, and STEM career aspirations. The project aims to enroll over 100 elementary students and prepare 20 (in-service and pre-service) teachers through professional development to enhance teachers? technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge to lead the lessons. Data sources include teacher focus groups, student surveys and interviews, students? conceptual drawings and design blueprints, and eye gaze and scan paths during on-screen problem-solving tasks. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, a remarkable paradigm shift has occurred in our understanding of quantum observables in particle physics and cosmology, revealing their emergence from underlying novel mathematical objects known as positive geometries.  The conference will center on the amplituhedron, the first and major example of a positive geometry, which describes particle interactions in a certain quantum field theory (QFT). We aim to explore connections between the amplituhedron and cluster algebras, a mathematical theory with broad applications across various areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. The conference will also actively engage and empower junior researchers and women, ensuring their integral presence and impactful contributions to the conference.<br/><br/>More precisely, building on the work of Lusztig and Postnikov on the positive Grassmannian, the physicists Arkani-Hamed and Trnka introduced the amplituhedron in 2013 as a geometric object that ""explains"" the so-called BCFW recurrence for computing scattering amplitudes in N = 4 super Yang Mills theory (SYM). Simultaneously, cluster algebras ? originally introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky to study total positivity ? have been revealed to have a crucial role in describing singularities of N = 4 SYM scattering amplitudes. Thus, one can use ideas from quantum field theory to connect cluster algebras to positive geometries, and in particular to the amplituhedron. Additionally, QFT can also be used to discover new examples of positive geometries. Our program will bring together a wide range of mathematicians and physicists working on adjacent areas both to draw new connections within algebraic combinatorics and geometry and to advance our physical understanding of scattering amplitudes and QFT. <br/>The conference website is https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event/amplituhedra2024/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity since they are among the most natural ways to represent the fundamental objects in the EDA flow. However, with increased design complexity and chip capacity, an increasing performance gap exists between the extremely large graphs in EDA and the insufficient support from general-purpose hardware, such as mainstream graphics processing units (GPUs).

The distribution of such variable traits within a species can shift over time. For example, behavioral traits can change quickly in response to environmental change or species interactions. The dynamic shift of trait distribution within a species can modify the interaction patterns among species and ultimately affect the stability of ecosystems. However, the prevalence and significance of such effects have not been evaluated systematically. This research project aims to fill in the gap by integrating theoretical and empirical approaches. A mathematical framework will be developed to classify different types of interaction modification and identify conditions that would destabilize ecosystems. Additionally, a comprehensive survey of empirical studies will be conducted to assess the level of evidence for the various types of interaction modification identified above and provide criteria for evaluating past and future case studies. This project will train young researchers in the interdisciplinary area between mathematics and ecology to address important environmental and ecological problems facing the next generation. In addition, educational kits and programs will be designed to promote teaching of important ecological concepts and engage underrepresented groups in K-12 schools.<br/> <br/>Intraspecific trait variation has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in determining ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Although some work has examined how the variation of heritable traits affects eco-evolutionary dynamics, non-heritable variation caused by phenotypic plasticity, developmental differences, or species interactions has received less consideration. Ecosystems have traditionally been studied as dynamical systems with fixed interaction strengths, but these interaction strengths will no longer be constant if the trait distributions can shift within short timescales. Such ?trait-shift induced interaction modification? (TSIIM) can lead to higher-order interactions among species, causing species extinction or coexistence that are otherwise unexpected. This project will develop a theoretical framework for studying TSIIM by generalizing traditional dynamical systems to incorporate intraspecific trait variation and categorizing these systems into different network motifs. The effect on large ecosystems will be studied using a disordered systems approach augmented by the new motifs. Meta-analysis of these motifs using empirical studies will provide insight on the mechanisms by which higher-order interactions arise from TSIIM, prompting experimental searches for such phenomena and their consequences.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program at the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Population and Community Ecology Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology at the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's impacts are marking a pivotal step in transitioning deductive verification from academic research into practical application. The outcome of this project will enhance software quality, safety, and security, offering substantial benefits to society.

Workshop attendees will include established experts, early-career researchers, and students, and the program will actively engage all participants.  Each morning will feature plenary talks by experts and/or lightning talks highlighting the work of junior researchers.  The afternoons will be devoted to working in groups on open problems.  This series of regular workshops has been critical to the development of an enthusiastic community of researchers in low-dimensional topology, helping this new and growing area gain momentum and fostering numerous collaborations across career stages and demographics. The organizers take pride in the camaraderie and welcoming atmosphere they strive to create, and many in the community deeply value and appreciate these events. <br/> <br/>A trisection splits a 4-dimensional space into three simple pieces.  Since their introduction roughly a decade ago, trisections have proven to be a successful new tool with which to study smooth 4-manifolds, with numerous articles written in the interim to develop the foundations for trisection theory. An important strength of the theory of trisections is the way it interfaces with a variety of other topics in low-dimensional topology.  This interface provides an opportunity to explore many classical areas of 4-manifold topology through a new lens. Such areas include, for example, the study of knotted surfaces in 4-space, diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, exotic smooth structures, group actions and (branched) covering spaces, and symplectic structures.  The main goal of these workshops is to bring together researchers from multiple areas to propose and to work on open problems, with a particular focus on the inclusion of early career researchers.  The workshops are preceded by a series of introductory virtual pre-workshop talks, which serve to bring new researchers up to speed, to facilitate the work to be done in groups, and to incorporate a broader, worldwide audience.

Bridge cables, muscles, flexible body armor, and aerospace composites are all fiber bundles of some form. Understanding the failure properties of these bundles is crucial but challenging. The lower the desired failure probability (higher reliability), the harder it is to accurately predict. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to increase our understanding of the mechanisms leading to bundle failure. It uses a new computer modeling method to combine experimental data and theory. This will provide insight into how fiber bundles behave, allowing for better estimation of bundle failure probabilities. Knowing the probability of failure allows for better decision making and potentially decreased costs for structures made from fiber bundles, including cables and composites. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. The project will also provide research and outreach opportunities for pre-college minority students, to inspire them to attend college and consider a future in STEM, broadening participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impacting engineering education.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to understand how interactions between fibers determine the bundle?s stress-strain response through deformation to fracture, and the key driving mechanics leading to bundle failure. Bundle failure is caused by instability leading to collapse, and understanding the onset of instability and the lower tail of the failure distribution is critical to ensuring ultra-high reliability. The novelty of this project is the combination of modeling (mechanistic, probabilistic, and stochastic) with experiments in a data-based Monte-Carlo simulation, which will be extensively validated against experimental data. This simulation will numerically determine full bundle stress strain behavior. Further, the new ability to numerically predict distributions of bundle load-strain characteristics for generic, non-linear fibers, will result in improved understanding of the fundamental mechanics of fiber load sharing. Student involvement is key to the success of this project, which involves careful fiber material testing, theoretical concepts, and statistical modeling. This research is ideal for students with a blend of tractable experiments, theory and coding. Their new knowledge and abilities will be cemented through inclusion in outreach activities and presenting at professional conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This corresponds to losing less than one second in the entire age of the universe. Such accuracy not only enables incredible timing precision, but also facilitates the study of phenomena that may affect the passage of time such as gravity, dark matter, and the variation of fundamental constants. Research on future generations of optical atomic clocks is focused on further improving accuracy and/or allowing a comparable accuracy to be achieved in deployed systems operating in real-world environments. This work will draw from the toolbox of quantum information science to improve the resource efficiency of optical clocks by using on-the-fly measures such as those found in quantum error correction and by using programmable entanglement generation. This research will provide undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on experience in precision metrology and atomic quantum science. This experience, along with curricular innovations and outreach to the broader community, will help promote the growth and diversity of the American quantum workforce.<br/><br/>The operating principle of optical clocks involves comparing a sub-Hz-linewidth laser oscillator to an ultra-narrow atomic transition to correct its frequency fluctuation and drift. The main limitations on clock performance stem from (1) the baseline stability of the laser oscillator, and (2) the atomic resources needed to correct laser frequency fluctuations whose accuracy is hampered by the projective nature of quantum measurements. This work seeks to address both issues by enabling independent operation of two atomic array optical clocks within the same apparatus and by using an optical cavity to engineer spin squeezing that mitigates projection noise. Specifically, by levering the rich atomic structure of ytterbium-171, one clock subsystem will be used for real-time correction of the laser phase during the interrogation of the other clock subsystem via ?mid-circuit? operations, enabling nearly a 10-times extension beyond the laser coherence time. This work merges the capabilities of neutral-atom quantum computers, optical atomic clocks, and quantum networking devices into one system. It will thus lead to advances of broad societal impact such as fault-tolerant quantum processors as well as quantum networks of optical atomic clocks that can provide quantum-secured timekeeping and the ability to search for new physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous research in the region has focused mainly on larger sites with monumental architecture, but the recent application of airborne laser scanning now allows for the study of the smallest sites that represent the earliest agricultural settlements in the region. This archaeological investigation focuses on understanding not only the strategies used to establish these earliest settlements, but to understand how they changed over time before they were ultimately abandoned. The archaeological perspective thus allows for a full accounting of how small-scale communities form, evolve, and dissolve over multiple centuries. A top priority for this project is also to educate undergraduate students from a Hispanic and minority serving institution in scientific research methodologies. Student project assistants benefit tremendously from the high-impact practices of fieldwork and professional collaboration. Additionally, the project collects data on smaller archaeological sites and features to help protect them against ongoing demographic and environmental changes in the region. Another key focus of the project is to work with students to bridge the divide between academia and a broader audience interested in understanding the origins of modern society through the use of public-facing media.<br/><br/>Recent advances in airborne laser scanning technology now allow for the identification of the smallest-scale earliest settlements in the region that were not covered by constructions from later archaeological periods. Understanding how the region was first settled by farmers can provide critical insights into the origins of social complexity because the region lacks any natural surface water resources that could be expected to sustain a year-round presence. The project is well placed to make significant advances toward understanding how people adapted to challenging environments that likely required new forms of social organization. What sorts of environmental and social strategies did the earliest agricultural settlers use to gain a permanent foothold in the region? What factors led to the eventual abandonment of these earliest settlements 500 years later?

However, current solutions lack a holistic understanding of cyber-physical resilience in complex systems, failing to connect IIoT network vulnerabilities with dynamic manufacturing processes for effective detection and control. To address these gaps, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to develop novel methodologies that integrate modeling, detection, and control measures for understanding the cyber-physical resilience of continuous critical manufacturing systems. This study will work to eliminate barriers to the development of new policies, regulations, and standards for IIoT applications in manufacturing. In collaboration with industry stakeholders, this project promises long-term benefits by extending its methods and tools to other critical infrastructures, thereby enhancing national cyber-physical resilience. Meanwhile, the education and outreach activities in this project foster sustained awareness of cyber-physical resilience among both future and current manufacturing professionals. Introducing new courses and training materials enhances students' exposure to advanced manufacturing technologies and improves their data science and cybersecurity skills. K-12 outreach initiatives boost understanding of IIoT and cyber-physical resilience, promoting manufacturing careers. A specially designed training software addresses the need for intuitive cybersecurity training in engineering language. These endeavors align with the National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing by contributing to the goal of ensuring national security.<br/><br/>This study addresses critical challenges in continuous manufacturing systems' cyber-physical resilience. The research objectives include (1) Development of Generalizable Tools: The project aims to build generalizable tools for cyber-physical resilience quantification. By creating stochastic models that integrate cyber connectivity and system dynamics of heterogeneous components, a novel quantification metric will be established. This metric considers both IIoT network features and manufacturing system dynamics through stochastic optimization, revealing system-level risks induced by IIoT connectivity. (2) Rethinking Anomaly Detection: The project will rethink cyber-physical resilience-driven anomaly detection by incorporating system-wide resilience quantification into process-based anomaly detection algorithms. This involves designing novel semi-supervised learning algorithms that incorporate resilience, with a focus on understanding the theories governing detection accuracy and resilience enhancement in high-dimensional data-driven anomaly detection. (3) Collaborative Learning-Based Resilient Control Strategies: The study aims to create collaborative learning-based resilient control strategies. Leveraging reinforcement learning and system connectivity, these strategies enhance a system's adaptability to cyberattacks.

The intellectual merits of the project include improved reliability of network applications that incorporate renewable energy sources, facilitating detection and correction of errors associated with IB source models and associated measurements and, incorporation of IB renewable energy sources in overall generation dispatch of large power grids.  The broader impacts of the project include training and education of students via REU programs in the summers and as student researchers during regular semesters.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient state estimator (SE) which can trace the fast dynamics of IB energy sources so that effective control feedback signals at time scales commensurate with such dynamics can be implemented.  This goal will be accomplished by using fast data acquisition to capture voltage and current signals in discrete time.   Such measurements  will be used to incorporate discrete-time models of power system elements into state estimation formulation in a computationally robust and efficient manner; enabling fast and automatic rejection of errors in sampled measurements; exploitation of the special structure of discrete-time network model to develop a parallel computation framework facilitating scalability of the developed SE algorithm for very large scale systems including those operating under unbalanced three-phase operating conditions accounting for nonlinear elements and frequency dependencies of line/cable parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The large number of such documents makes it very hard for people to read and absorb them all, a phenomenon known as ?information overload"". Applying computer algorithms that can automatically extract events is a promising solution because they can transform large amounts of text into smaller summaries in the form of structured event knowledge graphs that reveal the relationships between the people, places, and times in the events. Current deep learning-based event extraction techniques mainly focus on extracting event knowledge at the level of individual sentences and are unable to extract a knowledge graph spanning multiple sentences with sufficient accuracy or efficiency. For example, existing techniques would struggle with events described in a long document having multiple sections. Moreover, these extraction techniques do not capture accurate information regarding real-life events because they typically include nuanced attributes such as causes and effects. The research goal of this CAREER award is to build information extraction (IE) methods with natural language processing methods, using the latest deep learning-based techniques, to construct an event knowledge graph for storing knowledge and improving the ability of people to track rapidly evolving event information. In the short term, the project will improve the quality and comprehensiveness of event knowledge graphs. In the long run, the project will entirely transform people's experiences and habits in acquiring event knowledge from various sources. The system to be developed through this award will better support numerous event-oriented tasks that people need to perform, such as future event prediction, event factuality verification, and risk event prevention, all of which have profound impacts on society. Moreover, our work would make fundamental contributions to a wide range of interdisciplinary applications such as statutory reasoning based on legal documents, prediction of disease outbreaks, and biomedical document understanding, all of which currently rely on extremely slow and high-cost methods.<br/><br/>The general technical goal of this project is to address the knowledge gap of event extraction from long and complex documents (as compared to the traditional sentence-level extraction) and to do so in an efficient manner. The general goal is divided into three sub-research goals. First, to extract the entirety of event attributes, which is not possible for current models trained on a dataset with a predefined schema, the project introduces a new question-answer generation paradigm that enables a novel representation of events from clusters of documents discussing the same events. The project will leverage document hierarchy information for extracting events, which enforces the validity and broad coverage of event information. Motivated by the fact that current event knowledge construction is inefficient and is impaired by pairwise event-event relation predictions, the second research goal is to develop novel techniques enabling the construction of the event knowledge graph. For this purpose, the investigators propose interleaving targeted retrieval and joint modeling of event arguments and entity-entity relations. This not only enables efficient updating of graphs, but also ensures its global consistency. Finally, the third goal is to adapt to individual information-seeking needs, which is not considered by current methods. The project will study schema induction strategies and schema matching algorithms for adapting the event knowledge graph to user preferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are cells from healthy adult patients that are ?rewired? so that they can form any type of cell found in the body. Currently, heart muscle grown from iPSC in the laboratory is more similar to heart muscle in a fetus than an adult. This means that lab grown muscle does not accurately predict the way drugs will affect patients. This is a major obstacle to developing drugs to treat heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Shortly after birth, babies? hearts must pump with stronger force because their blood pressure increases. At the same time, their hearts? energy source shifts from sugar to fat. Previous research suggests that individually mimicking these changes in mechanical resistance to pumping, or changing the energy source from sugar to fat, can enhance lab-grown heart muscle. This research project will support combining those changes, with the goal of producing muscle that more accurately predicts the way drugs will affect patients. In addition, planned collaborations between the scientists performing this work and local high school teachers will expose students who are underrepresented in the STEM pipeline to science and engineering. <br/><br/>In the perinatal and postnatal stages of heart development, mechanical forces on the heart (preload and afterload) increase. Concurrently, ATP-sourcing switches from glucose to fatty acids. This research hypothesizes that mechanical loading and ATP-sourcing act in a synergistic manner to elicit electrical maturation of cardiomyocytes derived from iPSC by regulating Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) signaling. To address this hypothesis, the PI will leverage a high-throughput, iPSC-derived micro-heart muscle array technology. Biophysical cues applied to the micro-tissues will be controlled using linear actuators to stretch tissue (preload) and magneto-rheoelastomeric substrates to control the rigidity of the substrate tissues work against (afterload). Overall changes in micro-tissue electrophysiology will be determined using voltage sensitive dye, genetic calcium indicator (GCaMP6f), high-speed microscopy and automated video analyses. Using a combination of ion channel specific blocking drugs, immunostaining and RNAseq, these overall changes in electrophysiology will be linked to changes in expression of specific ion channels. Finally, a series of studies with PPAR-pathway modifying drugs will be performed to specifically probe the role for the PPAR-pathway in electrical maturation of iPSC-cardiomyocytes. The overarching focus of the research is to obtain deep understanding of how mechanical cues synergize with soluble, chemical cues like the metabolic substrate, to affect cellular fate and function. This project will allow the PI to advance the knowledge base in mechanobiology and establish his long-term bioengineering career.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neuromorphic engineering is a promising frontier to usher in the next generation of CV systems taking advantage of sparsity in the input and network architecture, reducing the number of operations through event-based computation i.e., compute only when necessary. This project aims to develop a versatile energy-efficient bio-inspired sensing, computing, and learning framework by developing a closely-knit system, from devices and circuits with rich spatio-temporal dynamics to network architectures inspired by the visual cortex and adaptive learning algorithms for visual perception. This will be achieved primarily using compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures that process and extract a variety of critical visual features in close physical proximity to where the data is stored in memory. The proposed research will embark on a uniquely integrated approach that addresses challenges at all levels, from devices, circuits, architectures, and algorithms leading to novel CV applications, inspired by neuroscience, such as low latency dynamic object classification, tracking and adaptive visual attention. The breadth of skillsets that are required to effectively train a new cadre of workforce in neuromorphic engineering for computer vision makes curriculum design and integration with existing frameworks incredibly challenging. The proposed BioVision educational consortium will address this issue. The main objective of this consortium is to collaborate and implement a comprehensive workforce development plan that incorporates evidence-based best practices to help train a new generation of engineers and researchers, who are equipped to satisfy the growing needs of the computer vision industry.<br/><br/>The grand vision of this proposal is to reimagine modern computer vision (CV) pipelines that exist today and replace the components with bio-inspired sensors, processors and algorithms that can drastically improve energy efficiency, data efficiency and lower latency. To reinvent the CV pipeline, three research thrusts will be addressed simultaneously. Thrust 1 will focus on creating and building a new class of retina-inspired vision sensors, that outperforms existing cameras, such as frame-based or neuromorphic Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), in terms of features, efficiency and latency. Thrust 2 will focus on modeling, design and implementation of scalable corticomorphic networks on hardware, exhibiting non-linear neuromodulatory dynamics at multiple timescales using mixed-feedback control. Thrust 3 will focus on implementation of network architectures and algorithms inspired by neuroscience, such as reinforcement learning with stochastic rewards, event-based temporal pattern recognition. The proposed research has the potential to lead a generational shift in the fields of computer vision, neuromorphic computing, and artificial intelligence. Developing an energy-efficient event-based camera capable of versatile spatiotemporal pattern recognition and novel features inspired by the retina, along with a general purpose, programmable, event-based computer vision pipeline can have a transformative impact on our society, by impacting critical areas like healthcare, Internet of Things (IoT), military defense, edge computing and industrial automation. Enabling the use of advanced CV on personal electronics can revolutionize our lifestyle through technologies such as self-driving vehicles, always-on smart surveillance, and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) applications. Bio-inspired vision sensors, such as the DVS camera sold by companies like Prophesee and iniVation, are primarily developed in Europe and Asia and have no industry or academic contribution from USA. This proposal will address this national challenge by training a new generation of world-class researchers and provide the USA with a leading advantage in the deployment of next-generation computer vision systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each morning will feature plenary talks by experts and/or lightning talks highlighting the work of junior researchers.  The afternoons will be devoted to working in groups on open problems.  This series of regular workshops has been critical to the development of an enthusiastic community of researchers in low-dimensional topology, helping this new and growing area gain momentum and fostering numerous collaborations across career stages and demographics. The organizers take pride in the camaraderie and welcoming atmosphere they strive to create, and many in the community deeply value and appreciate these events. <br/> <br/>A trisection splits a 4-dimensional space into three simple pieces.  Since their introduction roughly a decade ago, trisections have proven to be a successful new tool with which to study smooth 4-manifolds, with numerous articles written in the interim to develop the foundations for trisection theory. An important strength of the theory of trisections is the way it interfaces with a variety of other topics in low-dimensional topology.  This interface provides an opportunity to explore many classical areas of 4-manifold topology through a new lens. Such areas include, for example, the study of knotted surfaces in 4-space, diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, exotic smooth structures, group actions and (branched) covering spaces, and symplectic structures.  The main goal of these workshops is to bring together researchers from multiple areas to propose and to work on open problems, with a particular focus on the inclusion of early career researchers.

This perspective contrasts with recent scholarship suggesting that urbanism results from a complex interplay of top-down and bottom-up processes. To address this imbalance, this project investigates how the actions of non-elite individuals aggregate to shape cities through activities like private economic enterprise. Such findings are broadly relevant to resolving open questions about how cities are formed, sustained, and eventually fail. Within the described framework, the team investigates an early walled city. The research has the potential to reveal temporal or geographical variability among urbanisms in the heartland of cities by providing a holistic view. The initiative integrates researchers from various national and international universities with resident specialists and students from the site's region. The collaboration affords early career scholars with the datasets needed for doctoral research and professional advancement. Furthermore, the team empowers heritage professionals and students in the region by providing training in the latest digital and scientific methods in archaeology, thereby improving scientific infrastructure and increasing capacity for future research. Project data is shared online through Open Context and archived through the University of Central Florida Library.<br/><br/>To evaluate the role that everyday people played in the development of ancient cities, the researchers rigorously evaluate patterns of wealth, health, and diet in the archaeological record. Intensive surveys and excavations of residential districts investigate economic patterning and social stratification. Targeted studies  clarify the presence or absence of large-scale, centralized storage and production, towards understanding the extent to which elites intervened in the organization of labor and wealth production. The initiative complements field research with additional scientific studies (bioarchaeological, stable isotope, and compositional analyses) to assess how people of all socio-economic levels expressed decision-making through commercial and consumer activities. Laboratory studies transform the detritus of everyday life?pottery, bone, carbonized plant remains, and small artifacts?into datasets capable of answering the project?s research questions about social differences and economic organization. Finally, a geophysics team will complete a large map of the city using magnetometry, a non-destructive technique that reveals subsurface architecture, generating a snapshot of the city?s civic districts, neighborhoods, streets, and walls.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Semiconductor devices, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), liquid crystals, and ferromagnetic materials have conventionally served as tools for RF tuning. However, these technologies are constrained by limited tuning ranges and low power handling capabilities. To overcome these limitations, cold plasma presents a promising solution. Manipulating internal parameters, such as electron density, gas type, and pressure, offers extensive tunability over plasma electromagnetic properties. Cold plasmas have already provided significant advantages across various societally relevant applications, such as plasma medicine, food preservation, water treatment, plasma fertilizer, electric propulsion systems, sterilization, and semiconductor fabrication. This research explores fundamental physics and demonstrates techniques for establishing stable microplasmas with exceptional electromagnetic properties for versatile RF electronics. To realize this vision, (1) theoretical and modeling frameworks for high-frequency microplasmas will be developed, (2) a closed-loop microplasma monitoring and control system will be investigated, and (3) stable microplasmas with unprecedented electromagnetic features will be realized. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved, a unique educational plasma lab will be established, and a circuit-based electromagnetic-plasma simulator will be developed. In addition, various synergistic outreach activities will be conducted, including Toledo Excel summer camps for underrepresented students. By combining innovative research, educational initiatives, and outreach efforts, this endeavor aspires to advance the landscape of reconfigurable RF electronics, paving the way for emerging multi-objective and multi-frequency systems.<br/><br/>Plasmas represent rapidly reconfigurable media that can be controlled on nanosecond timescales. The interaction between microplasmas and electromagnetic waves introduces a new field of significant applications that can be categorized as ""Gaseous Microelectronics."" This study aims to push the boundaries of plasma science by exploring widely tunable microplasmas capable of unconventional interactions with electromagnetic waves. This exceptional behavior will be achieved through fundamental understanding and precise control of microplasma kinetics. While some efforts have been made in plasma-based RF electronics, this research field has not yet been comprehensively explored, specifically for microplasmas with extreme electromagnetic features?a knowledge gap this project aims to address. To pursue this overarching objective, a novel closed-loop control system, including innovative diagnostic techniques, will be developed to accurately manipulate microplasmas. With all theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigations involved, the goal is to realize (i) high-Q microplasma varactors with extraordinary tunability, (ii) natural epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) microplasmas, and (iii) low-loss negative index materials (NIMs). Rapidly and widely tunable, low-loss, and high-power materials for high-frequency tuning do not currently exist, but this research can change this paradigm. By leveraging these unique materials, more efficient utilization of the electromagnetic spectrum can be achieved, effectively meeting the escalating demand for wireless services. In addition, these features will benefit emerging sensing, biomedical, and space applications, addressing critical needs in these domains and fostering technological innovations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One approach to reduce the incidence of bugs in software is known as formal verification, in which a developer constructs a mathematical proof that the software follows an intended specification.  Yet existing tools for formal verification cannot be applied to establish the security and privacy of many applications. The reason is that these applications combine three challenging features and requirements: (1) concurrency, in which multiple computer systems interact at once, (2) fault-tolerance, meaning that systems must handle failures and crashes, and (3) randomization, in which programs generate and use random data to achieve security properties. Existing tools for formal verification only support a subset of these features.  The project's novelty is a new approach to formal verification of systems that combines all three of these features, thereby enabling the verification of security and privacy properties of important applications.  The project's impacts are in improving the reliability and correctness of secure software systems.  In addition, the primary investigator is developing new teaching materials on verification of security and privacy properties of randomized systems.<br/><br/>The technical approach is based on a new method for reasoning about randomized systems called asynchronous couplings. This method allows one to prove that two randomized programs behave in equivalent ways, even when the two programs generate random samples at different times and locations. The primary investigator is developing a new logic for program verification that combines asynchronous couplings with recently developed techniques for reasoning about distributed, fault-tolerant systems based on concurrent separation logic. The resulting logic is extensible, in the sense that higher-level techniques for proving security and privacy properties can be encoded in the logic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The enormous variety of traits that different plants have evolved to cope with stress then becomes available to protect the food supply. The discovery of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and its application to biology have made such trait-replacement approaches possible by replacing one piece of DNA (the genetic material that encodes traits) with another at a precise location in a plant?s DNA. However, the replacement activity, which relies on the plant?s own proteins, is highly inefficient in plants, making its use impractical. The project embarks on a search to test many possible ways to change crop DNA in order to make the replacement function of CRISPR more efficient. In this project, a plant and animal researcher join forces to conduct the type of searches ? called screens ? that were done in human cells and now in plant cells. These screens are done in preparations of millions of free cells that activate many genes to test for one that makes replacement more efficient. The goal of the project is to develop a method to make the most productive crops amenable to receiving new genes that make them more stress-tolerant.<br/><br/>The ability to transfer traits from one plant to another using CRISPR-mediated homology directed repair (HDR) would offer a powerful approach to develop new varieties that could tolerate climate change. However, HDR, which involves the activity of endogenous genes, is highly inefficient in plants, limiting its use. The project adapts HDR-enhancement screens performed in animals to plants, screening for endogenous genes that improve HDR efficiency. The screen involves a genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) component in a suspension of free plant cells (protoplasts), in this case from Zea mays. The CRISPRa components are tittered to activate one gene per cell. The cells come from a line that carries a constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP). A rare ?hit? ? a gene whose activation improves HDR ? will replace the GFP with a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) sequence. The CFP-positive cells are separated via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and the genes that mediated the HDR events are identified by amplifying the guide RNA cassette by the Polymerase Chain Reaction and sequencing. These hits are then verified by independent tests and, if they pass secondary screening, are tethered to a CRISPR associated protein 9 enzyme for testing in planta.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During exercise, injury, and repair, bone tissue at nanometer length scales is exposed to constantly changing loads. However, the current framework for understanding fracture is largely based on static and macroscale assessments of bone health. The ability to quantitatively assess and mitigate fracture risk and prescribe treatment requires a fundamental understanding of time-dependent properties of bone tissue at nanometer length scales. This research will work to resolve in real time how the nanoscale constituents of human bones rearrange and deform, when subjected to dynamic loads that mimic physiological conditions ranging from walking to trauma. The project will investigate how this adaptation varies in healthy and osteoporotic human tissue to understand the fundamental causes of increased fracture risk. In the future, it is hoped that this approach will help accelerate assessment of therapies with respect to tissue evolution and fracture. This work integrates educational activities in partnership with local museums and high school educators, to develop interactive modules that teach mechanics and imaging of biological systems to historically underserved and underrepresented high school students. <br/><br/>This research program will investigate the adaptation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in human bone at physiologically relevant, fast time scales. The dynamic and non-affine deformations of bone at the nanoscale will be analyzed to experimentally answer: 1) how the nanostructure of bone changes under cycling loading 2) what mechanisms dictate dynamic fracture in bone and 3) how the components of microscale tissue hierarchy contribute to damage tolerance in healthy and osteoporotic bone. To answer 1) and 2), the program will develop fatigue and dynamic fracture experiments on micron-sized bone samples in scanning electron and synchrotron X-ray microscopes with 30 nm and 20 ms spatio-temporal resolution. The small experimental length scales will uniquely allow the use of small human bone biopsies to answer question 3). In the context of pre-existing macroscale bone mechanics, the research will inform and develop constitutive models to describe strength and toughness with respect to crack velocity in the form of an evolving dynamic cohesive zone. The experimental data will be hosted in an open-source repository and help advance the understanding of how the extracellular matrix adapts at timescales too fast for cells to respond and remodel, with follow-up studies to understand how this impacts cell fate. The approach will establish a generalizable framework for investigating tissue fracture across length and time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's impacts are that it provides a powerful new tool for modeling interactive systems in challenging adversarial environments and also helps productively write code that remains correct in worst-case environments. The investigator especially focuses on the impacts of this new tool in security applications, such as mathematical games where one agent pursues another. The project's novelties are that it improves our ability to model code and data as separate, yet interacting things, and that, for the first time, it transforms a yet-unexploited logical tradition into a practical programming language, called dynamic logics and game logics.<br/><br/>The technical approach combines two well-established ideas: the paradigm of logic programming and a family of formal logics called game logics. Logic programming is a style of programming where programs are made up of formal logical rules and running a program is equivalent to searching for proofs. Game logic is a family of modal logics where every modal operator defines a model of a zero-sum game between two players. This project builds on the investigator's development of a theoretical connection between game logic proofs and computation, transforming it into a practical connection. This transformation will build upon prior literature on both automated analysis of dynamic logic formulas and on other rich logic programming languages such as answer-set programming languages. The impact is to provide a concise, expressive language for modeling interactive systems, software included, with adversarial environments. Because game proofs correspond to winning strategies, a major impact will be the blurring of lines between proof search and program synthesis, providing an elegant mechanism for automatically searching for the winning strategies of the programmer's game models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The transformation and exchange of materials at these interfaces depend on extreme hydrological disturbances such as flooding, sea level rise, and seiches. As the intensity of extreme hydrological events increases with a warming climate, there is a need to know the rate at which these processes take place along coastal interfaces. However, scientists often rely on direct discrete measurements using soil cores and sensors to estimate these rates, which are incapable of capturing spatial changes, making it hard to use models to predict how these areas will be affected by changes in climate. Hence, better ways to measure these processes are needed, and more scientists from different disciplines need to work together to leverage their different approaches. This project will advance the use of geophysical imaging techniques, including natural electrical potential, induced polarization, and electrical conductivity, to better understand changes in soil conditions along coastal interfaces. This project will also mentor environmental science and ecology students on how to use these geophysical methods to expand the spatial resolution of environmental measurements. <br/><br/>The proposed research in this project will [1] assess the relationship between the distribution of natural electric potential and redox potential and how both change with different soil moisture and organic matter contents, [2] investigate how organic matter and soil moisture contents affect the migration and storage of electric current, and [3] assess how changes in permeability affect the storage of electrical charges within soils along coastal interfaces. This study will involve using geophysical data from laboratory experiments and automated long-term, repeated field measurements on soils at both the Chesapeake Bay and Lake Erie regions. These robust datasets will be combined with direct measurements of soil redox potential, moisture content, matric potential, salinity, and soil respiration to study how processes along coastal soils change spatially. The multidisciplinary approach of integrating geophysics with ecological studies developed in this research will be used to train upper-level undergraduate and graduate students. A case-study approach will also be used to include geophysics in the environmental science and ecology curriculum at the University of Toledo and made publicly available.

Current approaches to meet such a diverse scope of functions rely on exploratively blending assorted polymers with large quantities of tackifiers, plasticizers and other additives as needed. This mixing-based approach toward property control is ineffective and imprecise. Furthermore, loose additives are prone to leaching and migration, which leads to property variation over time along with inevitable surface contamination, thus prohibiting their use in sensitive applications such as art restoration, biomedical devices, and microelectronics. The proposed adhesion-by-architecture platform will empower the design of additive-free adhesives with tailored property combinations that can be switched on demand. The platform is based on brush-like polymer networks with dynamic molecular linkers, which provide various pathways for molecular-scaffold reconfiguration without losing material integrity. The abundance of structural parameters in molecular brush networks allows for the programmable variation of distinct physical characteristics independent of chemical composition and one another. Developing structurally programmable adhesives with actively modulated performance will offer a breakthrough in soft matter engineering, yielding active adhesives with exceptional property combinations and switching on-demand capability. The design of advanced materials will provide ample opportunities for interdisciplinary training of graduate students with diverse backgrounds through integration of precision chemistry, soft-matter physics, and emerging technologies.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Adhesive performance results from an interplay of bulk and interfacial deformation mechanisms, both viscoelastic in nature. Understanding how molecular brush architecture controls this interplay represents the intellectual focus of this proposal. The proposed research will address the following fundamental problems. The first is the hierarchical relationship between adhesion and molecular network architecture, spanning different length and time scales. Understanding how an individual element of the brush structure contributes to the viscoelastic response is a crucial milestone towards programmable control of the performance of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs). The second is the inherent reliance of adhesion on chemical composition and the interdependence of distinct adhesive characteristics such as tack, stretch, and work of adhesion. The design-by-architecture approach will allow breaking these conventional rules to allow for the variation of physical characteristics independent of chemistry and one another. The third is the current inability to switch the adhesion strength of pressure-sensitive adhesive materials on demand without perturbing the integrity and shape of a device. This challenge will be addressed by strategically incorporating dormant functionalities that can be activated by an external stimulus to trigger internal rearrangement of the network topology.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research seeks to guide conservation strategies in an ecosystem that supports a diversity of wildlife and human populations. The project also increases access to paleontology by training students in paleontological research methods. Students will use their research experiences to develop K-12 lesson plans that meet the national educational standards in both the US and Jamaica. In collaboration with international partners, these lesson plans will be deployed in a series of STEM camps for children and their teachers. <br/><br/>This research integrates existing museum collections and novel paleontological excavations with biogeographic theory and ecological modelling to quantify biodiversity through time, measured through the lenses of taxonomic and functional richness.

In nature, some animals have specialized physiology that allow them to ingest toxins without being harmed. Some Central and South American poison frogs can sequester neurotoxins in their diet and repurpose those toxins as a chemical defense from predation. These frogs move the alkaloids from the intestines, through the bloodstream and to the skin where toxins are stored in glands. This project investigates how these frogs cope with ingesting neurotoxins and the results may provide a more complete picture of oral drug distribution, metabolism, and new methods of toxin resistance, because many of the toxins are similar to pharmaceutical drugs used in humans. This research will provide learning experiences to all age groups in both the United States and Ecuador, where research and fieldwork on poison frogs is conducted. High school biology teachers will be involved in summer research and will incorporate their research findings into their science curriculum. This award will also provide research internships for local community college students, and a portion of this research will be conducted in an undergraduate laboratory course at Stanford University. In Ecuador, research will be communicated to the public through educational displays at the Centro Jambatu of Amphibian Research and Conservation in Quito. <br/><br/>Poison frogs acquire alkaloid-based chemical defenses from dietary arthropods, although how these lipophilic alkaloids are moved across organs without self-toxicity is unclear. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the physiological mechanisms and convergent evolution of toxin sequestration and autoresistence in poison frogs through three aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that independent evolutionary origins of chemical defense is associated with expression changes of genes whose products are involved in small molecule transport and metabolism. Alkaloid profiles and gene expression in several tissues will be quantified across poison frog species that represent independent origins of chemical defense evolution. (2) Test the hypothesis that alkaloid sequestration evolved by co-opting transporter proteins for either sequestration or excretion. Gene expression profiling across organs in toxic and non-toxic lab-reared poison frogs will be used to identify membrane transporters enriched in tissues that sequester alkaloids. Candidate carriers will be functionally tested in cell-based assays. (3) A serpin protein in poison frogs that can bind a range of alkaloids was recently discovered by the research team. The binding profile of this toxin sponge for various alkaloids will be examined. Whether this toxin sponge is necessary for alkaloid sequestration will be tested through gene knockdown studies. Together, this work will test the hypothesis that chemical defense in poison frogs evolved via multiple mechanisms, each of which occur at a distinct level of organismal organization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the study is to contribute to an understanding of how scientific evidence informs policymaking. The study focuses on meta-analysis, an increasingly authoritative form of evidence in which individual research studies are synthesized in a way that is said to facilitate scientific consensus but in doing so introduces new forms of uncertainty. For surgeons, the general conclusions of meta-analysis may be difficult to reconcile with the individual needs of patients; for policy makers, meta-analysis may back an intervention that worked at the sites where it was studied but is not compatible with the needs of their constituents; and for judges, meta-analysis may conflict with the court's adversarial process and written standards of evidence. By comparing these three cases, this research will contribute to a general understanding of how the organizational constraints, agendas, and values of these actors impacts how they interpret ambiguous evidence. The findings of this research may contribute to reforms in the way that decision makers in various domains evaluate scientific evidence in contentious debates.<br/><br/>To study these cases, the researcher will interview policy makers and surgeons, and analyze archival documents, such as court transcripts. The use of mixed methods will permit an understanding of the social and historical context in which meta-analysis becomes a useful, if fraught, form of evidence in each of these domains. The intellectual merit of this project is that it takes up a classic question in science and technology studies, how scientists and their audiences manage epistemic uncertainty, in the light of a powerful new form of evidence across three heterogenous domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The XLEAP instrument will provide researchers a unique combination of x-ray techniques including 2D and 3D elemental imaging modes, oxidation state measurements, and complementary non-x-ray microscopy. Together, these new resources will enable researchers to ask and answer entirely new questions about how plants take up, transport, and use metals and micronutrients; how plants respond to environmental stimuli like bacteria, microplastics, and climate; how metals are transformed in soil degradation processes and at the soil-root interface; and how metals and micronutrients are taken up and stored in marine plant and animal life. These research questions are critical to efforts to develop nutritious and climate resilient crops, improve agricultural practices, and reduce human impacts on the environment. XLEAP will leverage a relationship with the Cornell School of Integrative Plant Sciences to engage its future user community during construction.

The facility will also include an on-site growth chamber for controlled environments during beamtime, as well as dedicated sample preparation facilities (stereomicroscope, microtome, cryo-microtome) for room-temperature and frozen hydrated tissues. XLEAP will offer XRF imaging, tomography, and confocal modes; x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in time-resolved or spatially resolved modes; and micro- x-ray diffraction (XRD) imaging. Combinations (e.g. XRF + XRD) and rapid switches between these modes (e.g. from XRF to XAS) will be important in the design and construction of the beamline. The ability to study living plants in-situ in a customized growth chamber on the beamline will enable researchers to examine genotype-phenotype relationships in non-stressed tissues. Microfocused x-rays at energies >40 keV and cutting-edge detectors with low per-pixel dwell times will minimize radiation dose and damage to living tissue, enabling study of dynamic changes in living tissues on multiple time scales. High energies will offer high-sensitivity unambiguous measurements of high-Z elements like iodine and rare earth elements.

The East Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest repository of fresh water on the planet and represents the greatest potential contribution to sea-level rise, yet little is known about its thermal and mechanical conditions, as well as its potential for ice-mass loss. It also contains the oldest meteoric and atmospheric gas climate records on the planet; exploration for and utilization of those records is key to reliable modeling of climate variations in the near- and mid-term future. Exploration of the interior of the East Antarctic ice sheet has proceeded slowly but steadily over several decades, mainly through remote sensing technologies. Despite great progress, pressing questions remain about Earth's climate >1 m.y. ago, ice deformation, geothermal heat flow, basal material properties, and subglacial geology. These problems are best addressed by quickly penetrating to the glacial bed of Antarctic ice sheets, retrieving ice core and rock core samples, and providing boreholes for down-hole logging of physical properties in ice. This is made possible by the US Rapid Access Ice Drill, developed as a new drilling technology capable of direct access. It has been tested in the field in Antarctica and is now ready for scientific research. The Principal Investigators of this award will convene a workshop in 2024 to support research community use of the Rapid Access Ice Drill in Antarctica. Workshop participants will meet to consider how the drilling system can best be used to advance our understanding of current operative ice-sheet processes, past climate records, history of ice-sheet development, and the geological substrate to the East Antarctic ice sheet, all of which have societal relevance.

To achieve optimal productivity, the different parts of the plant, and the plant as a whole, must rapidly acclimate to fluctuating changes in environmental conditions (e.g., changes in light intensity, temperature, humidity, the presence of pathogens, etc.). Because in nature, or under field conditions, not all parts of the plant are simultaneously subjected to the same environmental conditions, plants evolved the ability to rapidly transmit cell-to-cell signals from one part to another, optimizing their overall photosynthetic activity, growth, and productivity. This ability is termed ?systemic signaling?. A novel live imaging method to detect rapid systemic signals within and between different parts of the same plant (i.e., cell-to-cell) and/or between different plants living in a community (i.e., plant-to-plant) was recently developed. This new method will be used to study different key regulators of rapid systemic signaling within and between different plants and characterize the molecular mechanisms that integrate them. Findings from this research will enable the development of future crop plants with enhanced resilience to global warming, preventing yield losses that are estimated at billions of dollars annually to the US economy. In addition, this research will be disseminated to the public through YouTube videos, radio programs at a local public radio station, outreach activities at the University of Missouri farm, as well as mentored research experiences for undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>Stress-induced systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation play a pivotal role in plant resilience to abiotic stress. A novel imaging method that enables the measuring of rapid whole-plant systemic signals (reactive oxygen species, redox, calcium, and electric) in living plants grown in soil was recently developed. This method was used in previous studies to identify several important regulators of rapid systemic cell-to-cell signaling in plants, as well as to discover aboveground plant-to-plant systemic signaling. However, the mode of integration and hierarchy of systemic cell-to-cell and plant-to-plant signals is currently unknown. Using the newly developed imaging method, the hierarchy, mode of integration, and tissue specificity of different rapid systemic cell-to-cell and plant-to-plant signals triggered by a local application of excess light stress or wounding will be determined. In addition, the type of information being transferred during plant-to-plant signaling in response to excess light stress or wounding, and the protein complexes at the plasma membrane that integrate systemic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and redox signaling will be identified and studied. Results obtained from this study could lead to the development of novel approaches to enhance the resilience of crops to different stresses associated with global warming, as well as to the identification of key multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane that link reactive oxygen species, redox, and calcium signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Outcomes from this project will illuminate our understanding of this poorly understood component of the stress tolerance machinery common to all plants, with potentially far-reaching impacts for agricultural productivity and food security. Multiple educational programs will be provided, including an REU-style training program in the plant sciences for undergraduate students, materials for public outreach events such as the annual Fascination of Plants Day, and a proteomics instructional module for graduate students. This suite of programs will result in long-term impacts that develop novel educational opportunities for undergraduates, enhance course content for graduate students, and promote an appreciation among the general public of plants? contribution to society, while fostering the career development of the PI?s trainees.<br/>Plastoglobule lipid droplets of plant chloroplasts are believed to be a major orchestrator of adaptive responses to environmental stresses. Yet, understanding of plastoglobule function remains limited to hypothetical models, lacking experimentally validated molecular functions. It is the objective of this project to elucidate the central role of all six plastoglobule-localized ABC1 protein kinases (ABC1Ks) in plastoglobule function. These ABC1Ks are the most abundant enzymes of the plastoglobule and are thought to serve as master regulators of plastoglobule function through phospho-regulation of the plastoglobule proteome. This project will characterize the protein kinase activity of each ABC1K, define the phospho-regulatory network of plastoglobules, dissect the functional relevance of the unique N- and C- terminal flanks of ABC1Ks, and unravel the biological functions of the ABC1Ks. These goals will be accomplished through a series of in vitro kinase assays with heterologously expressed ABC1Ks and phenotypic investigations of knock-out and over-expressor mutant lines, including a large-scale phosphoproteomic and lipidomic study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, little is known with regards to how neural circuits reconcile competing signals that drive opposing behavioral responses; therefore, investigating how neural circuits integrate and/or reconcile opposing response circuits could lead to the discovery of new and exciting learning processes. To observe how neural circuits accomplish this signal integration, this project utilizes a learning assay in a nematode, previously described by the primary investigator. For this learning protocol, two stimuli that each drive an innate, opposing locomotor response (i.e., forward vs backward locomotion) are paired. This pairing does not augment the later response to a single stimulus, but rather results in a novel response outcome, a cessation of locomotion; thus, the innate responses activated by these stimuli qualitatively impact the conditioned response. This learned response stabilizes over minutes and may involve modulation from neurons that are downstream from the interneurons where signal integration likely occurs (e.g., motor neurons). This award supports collaborations between the primary investigator and two faculty partners to pursue multiple avenues of investigation. Through these collaborations, the primary investigator will gain access and expand her skill set to include state of the art genetic tools as well as advanced microscopy techniques that will allow for observing activation of single neurons either during stimulus pairing in behaving animals or following stimulus pairing in immobilized animals, targeted activation of single synapses or subset of synapses predicted to be involved, and behavioral analysis of mutant strains to investigate the possible role of the neuron-supporting glial cells in forming the learned response. This project will provide meaningful research opportunities to a number of undergraduates in the primary investigator?s laboratory and in a course-based undergraduate experience (CURE) lab course. By establishing these techniques at the primary investigator?s home institution, this project will expand the available tools for scientific enterprise. <br/><br/>This project combines modern genetic tools and imaging approaches to visualize the dynamics in neuron activity and uncover cellular mechanisms involved in neural circuit signal integration and learning in C. elegans. To identify neurons activated during and after pairing of opposing locomotor response neural circuits, fluorescence from the NeuroPAL unique neuron marker will be captured simultaneously with GcAMP (a genetically-encoded calcium indicator) fluorescence. Strains of C. elegans that express light-sensitive ion channels genetically targeted to specific neurons will be employed to activate/deactivate targeted circuits during paired signal presentation. To target a single synapse or set of synapses involved in circuit integration, this project will combine optogenetics with patterned point illumination and super resolution/FLIM confocal microscopy. Finally, using targeted mutations the potential role of glial cells in facilitating learning following this stimulus pairing will be explored. This project has the potential to reveal a new understanding for how individual neurons, circuits, and/or glia participate in integrating simultaneous opposing response signals and how this experience alters an organisms? behavior. This award affords the principal investigator supported time to learn these genetic and microscopy approaches and incorporate these skills into her laboratory?s research program and lab courses, providing undergraduates with a meaningful research experience and the opportunity to work with a female primary investigator who is an underrepresented minority in science. Faculty at the primary investigator?s home institution will benefit from the expanded local tools available from the introduction of these modern techniques. These approaches will also be disseminated to other Neuroscience faculty at undergraduate institutions through a workshop at the next Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience Conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plant community responses are observed repeatedly in the fossil record, and could help predict future changes by measuring traits from plant fossils. Much effort has focused on the ways that leaves respond to and record environmental conditions. However, leaves depend on long-lived organs, such as stems, to enable plant function. This study will establish a new database dedicated to plant stem traits from fossil xylem to understand plant community responses to major intervals of ancient climate change. More broadly, this project will prepare a new generation of Earth scientists for this highly interdisciplinary work and expand participation in research through training and mentoring targeted towards underrepresented groups in paleontology through the creation of a paleontology and ecosystem modeling short course. <br/><br/>This project is focused on assessing water transport in the xylem of Paleozoic and Mesozoic plants as an adaptation that influenced survivorship across two major intervals of climate change: the Late Paleozoic Ice Age of the Carboniferous-Permian (~300 million years ago [Ma]) and the hothouse climate of the Triassic-Jurassic (~200 Ma). This project will focus on three specific aims: (1) establish a unified xylem fossil functional anatomy database to facilitate (2) prediction of hydraulic traits for extinct taxa and (3) integration of fossil-observed leaf and xylem traits to predict whole-plant function using a modified ecosystem process model (Paleo-BGC). Investigators will use this approach to assess extinct plant water stress and ecosystem function through periods of extreme global climate change and test the hypothesis that coordination of leaf and stem water transport traits distinguished taxa as casualties, survivors, and thrivers during floral collapse and recovery during both global cooling and warming events. This project prioritizes training a new generation of interdisciplinary Earth scientists through training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars. Additionally, a short course for underrepresented and early career scientists focused on linking paleobotany, plant physiology, and climate change will be created. Pre- and post-course summative evaluations will be applied with an aim to improve future course iterations? delivery of climate-change-focused interdisciplinary geoscience to the target audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ions, charged atoms and molecules, are the way in which electricity flows through living organisms. Negatively-charged electrons and positively-charged holes flow through semiconductors in electronics such as computers and mobile phones. Materials that conduct both ions and electrons bridge these worlds. This gives them many potential applications that bring together electronics and biology. Blends of semiconducting polymers and charge-balancing electrolytes are a promising class of mixed ionic and electronic conductors. In particular, they can be biocompatible and flexible. This makes them attractive materials for wearable and implantable bioelectronics and possibly even neuromorphic computers inspired by the human brain. Ideally, a mixed conductor could be designed on-demand for a given need. However, the chemistry between polymers and ionic electrolytes is complex and many aspects are poorly understood. These fundamental limits in understanding relationships must be addressed for these materials to reach their full potential. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team that combines material characterization, modeling, and device testing to provide fundamental knowledge into these relationships. The results of this project will be used to advance the technologies in which these material systems are used. Students working in this project will develop in-demand technical, communications and critical thinking skills. All of these are essential for preparing the future STEM workforce. Outreach to the community is an integral component of the project. Annual in-person workshops will provide high school science teachers hands-on experience in making and characterizing devices such as electrochromics and transistors. Follow-through includes materials for teachers to make working devices and circuits and learning modules to accompany these materials and experiments. These learning activities will enhance STEM education by connecting fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics with the everyday lives of the students.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Electronic and ionic transport in conjugated polymers depends on a complicated web of variables, ranging from polymer structure through the extent of solvent-induced polymer swelling. This project investigates three primary variables that influence electronic and ionic transport, including electrolyte solvent chemistry, electrolyte ion chemistry, and polymer sidechain chemistry. Spectroscopic and device level measurements will be combined with quantum-chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to establish a fundamental understanding that spans from molecular level chemical interactions to device level ionic and electronic transport properties. In terms of electrolyte solvent, the project determines how the dielectric constant of the solvent and the solvent?s ability to swell the polymer impact electronic and ionic transport. In terms of electrolyte ion chemistry, the project determines how ion shape and hydrophobicity impact electronic structure and ionic and electronic transport as a function of polymer sidechain chemistry. The results of this project are essential for building a comprehensive predictive model that can be used to guide materials design and electrolyte selection for various applications of electrochemically doped conjugated polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project employs a novel methodology to assess productivity through quantifying numerous sedimentary pigments. Pigments have many strengths as proxies, including their organism class or taxonomic specificity and their ability to reflect organisms that do not produce hard macrofossils, which are particular assets for work that aims to understand trends in cyanobacterial communities. Quantifying sedimentary pigments of different organisms can both provide insight on what drives bulk primary productivity and characterize how individual groups of primary producers might respond.

To enjoy the benefit of modern multicore machines, an algorithm must fit the data and auxiliary space in memory. On modern hardware, using too much space in an algorithm limits the solvable problem size on a multicore machine and may slow down the performance in practice. Consequently, designing efficient algorithms nowadays faces very different challenges from decades ago.  This CAREER project focuses on two critical challenges in parallel algorithm design and analysis: space efficiency and communication efficiency. The project will provide efficient computational models to better meet multiobjective optimization formulations, new graph algorithms and data structures with improved theoretical guarantees, as well as open-source software for the new data structures and algorithms.  This project aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, which is crucial for promoting the accessibility of parallelism to a diverse set of problems.  The educational plan comprises redesign of algorithm courses to include memory storage considerations as well as support for a coding club and coding competition designed to make computer science more accessible, particularly to the underrepresented student population reflected in the local area. <br/><br/>This project has two major thrusts. The first thrust is to study space-efficient parallel algorithms. This project will first study a simple yet effective computational model for measuring space usage of a parallel algorithm with the objective of investigating space-efficient parallel graph algorithms and data structures using auxiliary space sublinear to the input size. The second thrust is to study algorithm design on the new processing-in-memory (PIM) system, which has recently been developed to reduce the need for expensive data transfers between CPU and memory.  The algorithmic challenge here is that the PIM system is a combination of shared memory and distributed memory, so efficient algorithms on PIM must utilize advantages of each. This project will study algorithms and data structures that are efficient on the PIM architecture.

However, many non-computing faculty are not prepared to teach the computing concepts that underlie the computational techniques that their students must master. This project will support non-computing faculty who are teaching computing concepts by developing a curated set of videos that provides the content needed for students to learn basic computing concepts.

The expansion and improvement of the OCCTIVE library will be informed by best practices in instructional video design. The videos will be supplemented with sample teaching material and other support materials that aid faculty adoption. Faculty, who will be recruited from a wide range of disciplines and institutions, will be trained to integrate OCCTIVE into their courses through in person and virtual workshops.

In the field of cyberphysical systems, the challenge intensifies when striving for decentralized decision-making. The successful development of these algorithms can produce potentially transformative paradigms for applications critical to societal welfare. Remarkably, organisms in nature, such as slime molds and fungi, are able to develop decentralized, coordinated networks that optimize transport better than engineers, solve mazes, detect masses at a distance, or even memorize periodic events. This approach is pivotal in addressing dynamic environmental conditions and ensuring scalability as the swarm size expands. This research aims to develop novel collaborative organization algorithms for drone swarms by leveraging advanced computational frameworks that mimic the functionalities of biological networks.  Our strategy involves transferring collective behavior insights from network-forming organisms to formulate rules for individual drones. <br/><br/>The proposal addresses critical knowledge gaps in swarm collaborative algorithms, focusing on the scientific challenge of understanding the principles guiding the transition from microscale to macroscale swarm behavior. On the engineering front, it aims to develop robust machine learning procedures for accurately transferring observed behaviors to synthetic systems and enhance supercomputing capabilities for improved scalability. The novelty lies in adopting a bottom-up biological perspective, mapping simulation data showcasing emergence to the computational and communication constraints of a drone swarm. Additionally, this project fills critical educational gaps in the public understanding of swarm coordination and emergent behavior in engineering. The initiative's open-source tools aim to accelerate basic research in swarm mechanics and enhance STEM education at various levels. With a focus on translating complex concepts into everyday language, the project impacts the next generation of STEM engineers through specialized courses, virtual experiences like ""Swarm Quest"", and also targets the general public with exhibitions like ""Are you smarter than a slime mold?"", aimed at the youngest audience. The initiative involves mentoring a high-school teacher in Pennsylvania, graduate and undergraduate students at Penn State, and the creation of free instructional material on the concept of emergence in cyberphysical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasingly, students in all disciplines must learn to use computing technology. To meet the increased need for students to use computational methods across all fields, non-computing courses commonly integrate computational components into their curricula. However, many non-computing faculty are not prepared to teach the computing concepts that underlie the computational techniques that their students must master. This project will support non-computing faculty who are teaching computing concepts by developing a curated set of videos that provides the content needed for students to learn basic computing concepts. The infusion of foundational computing concepts into non-computing courses will increase both the number and diversity of students who are prepared to utilize computational technologies when they enter the workforce.<br/><br/>This project?s goals are to (1) expand and strengthen the OCCTIVE video library (Online Computing-Concepts Toolkit of Interdisciplinary Videos for Education), designed to introduce foundational computing concepts in non-CS courses, (2) broadly disseminate OCCTIVE for use by non-CS faculty and peer tutors, and (3) assess the impact of OCCTIVE use on students, faculty, and peer tutors. The expansion and improvement of the OCCTIVE library will be informed by best practices in instructional video design. The videos will be supplemented with sample teaching material and other support materials that aid faculty adoption. Faculty, who will be recruited from a wide range of disciplines and institutions, will be trained to integrate OCCTIVE into their courses through in person and virtual workshops. The efficacy of the OCCTIVE library will be measured by assessing students? comprehension of computing concepts, faculty?s adoption of materials in their classes, and peer tutor experiences.

These devices can potentially revolutionize the way hydrogen is made. Despite the promise, though, use of these devices faces significant challenges due to fast degradation of the cell under prolonged operation. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research aiming to understand the complex degradation mechanisms within reversible solid oxide cells. By overcoming these challenges, the technology can enable cost-effective use of hydrogen as a clean fuel in industries and the heavy-duty transportation sector. Utilizing hydrogen as a long-term energy storage solution, it also promotes the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid. This research spans multiple disciplines such as solid mechanics, electrochemistry, and advanced imaging. In alignment with UMass Lowell's mission as a Minority Serving Institution, the project seeks to encourage inclusivity by engaging underrepresented groups in energy engineering research and education, fostering a more diverse and inclusive workforce in the field.<br/><br/>The rapid degradation in reversible solid oxide cells during electrolysis mode, caused by delamination failure at the oxygen electrode/electrolyte interface, is commonly associated with the buildup of oxygen partial pressure. Significant scientific challenges persist in fully comprehending the mechanisms responsible for the reduced degradation observed under reversible modes, especially with a bilayer oxygen electrode configuration. This research aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap by investigating the intricate interactions between mechanical and chemical stresses at the oxygen electrode-electrolyte interface under dynamic operating conditions, utilizing integrated mechano-electro-chemical approaches. The research will attempt to unravel the complex dynamics of crack initiation and propagation within 3D heterogeneous microstructures of oxygen electrodes from advanced full-field X-ray imaging technique. Through rigorous coupling of model and experiment approaches, the contributions of material variations and structural geometry modifications to performance improvements will be delineated. These findings will make a marked impact on the design of new oxygen electrodes and development of protocols for safe operation of reversible solid oxide cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorm downbursts, and other phenomena, virtually every region of the U.S. is at risk of extreme winds. Predictions from climate models anticipate an escalation in the occurrence and severity of these hazards, underscoring the need for cost-effective design concepts to create wind-resistant buildings. The structural integrity and long-term performance of low-rise buildings and civil infrastructure are heavily influenced by atmospheric turbulence near ground level where this infrastructure exists. Yet, a solid grasp of this flow phenomenon is lacking, limiting the ability to create risk-consistent design guidance. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support research that attempts to address this knowledge gap by advancing the fundamental understanding of turbulence in densely populated environments and the associated wind loads on structures. The project will utilize a combination of wind tunnel experiments, computer simulations, and theoretical developments in fluid dynamics. Findings from this project will enable improvements in wind-resistant design standards, bolstering national welfare and prosperity. Research activities will be complemented by an educational and outreach program leveraging recent advances in virtual and augmented reality technology to enhance teaching and accessibility to engineering education. This award will contribute to the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP).<br/><br/>The specific objective of this project is twofold: the first is to characterize turbulence and fundamental mechanisms responsible for extreme wind events in urban areas under stationary and non-stationary flow conditions; the second is to derive improved analytical formulations for flow statistics that are relevant to the precise characterization of wind-loading conditions. An extensive series of wind tunnel tests and high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of flow over idealized urban environments will form the basis for the analysis. The hypothesis is that analysis of Reynolds stress budget equations combined with modern model reduction and coherent-structures identification techniques will enable the development of conceptual formulations encoding the dependency of first and higher order flow statistics onto surface morphology and flow forcing conditions. The analytical models will be derived for integration within building design codes to improve the resilience of low-rise structures, with potential long-lasting impacts on large-scale community resilience to the changing landscape of wind hazards. The project will utilize the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research infrastructure (NHERI) Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel at the University of Florida and will archive and make publicly available the project data in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-CI.org).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For plants, this is compounded by declines in pollinators, which have been documented across the world. There is concern that many flowering plant species will decline alongside their pollinators because almost 90% of flowering plants rely on animal pollination to make seeds, grow new plants, and prevent extinction. Short-term, year-to-year fluctuations in pollinators and other environmental factors (like precipitation) during a longer-term decline make the challenge of identifying a true plant decline even harder. Despite the strong dependence of plants on pollinators, pollinator declines may not immediately cause plant declines, and this can prevent us from detecting the warning signs of plant extinction. For example, plants may appear to do better immediately after a pollinator decline by reinvesting energy that would have been used to make seeds into improving their survival. This project will amplify natural variation in pollination for thousands of plants, follow their fates, and use mathematical models to understand how plants persist despite year-to-year changes in pollination and other environmental factors. This project will help scientists to understand why some plant species are more at risk from pollinator declines than other species.  <br/><br/>The project will leverage 9?11 years of field-based data on plant demography and pollinator abundance to measure and experimentally impose stochastic fluctuations in pollinator abundance.

Projections of the population models will demonstrate the consequences of stochasticity in pollination services for plant population dynamics.

ML, especially deep learning that uses deep neural networks, has made remarkable breakthroughs in various research domains and disciplines including computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and math, to name a few. However, in the past decade, extensive work has shown ML models are vulnerable to privacy and security attacks. For example, email spam filters can be compromised by data poisoning attacks, where attackers confuse ML models by feeding them bogus data, allowing adversaries to send malicious emails containing malware or other security threats without being noticed. Attackers can also make repeated requests to models, looking at the results in order to reconstruct the data used to build ML models; in health domains, for instance, successful data reconstruction attacks might expose private medical details about patients. Many defense methods have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, but they face several limitations: they often aren?t effective in real-world applications with strict confidentiality requirements, or unacceptably degrade the performance of the models. Further, most defenses are aimed at particular learning methods or attack types, making it hard to deal with multiple concurrent attacks, and generalizing poorly to different types of models and data. This project?s goal is to address these limitations by designing a trustworthy learning framework based on information theory. The outcomes of the project will advance the state-of-the-art trustworthy ML and information-theoretic approaches to privacy, while contributing to the growing national need for professionals in ML and cybersecurity.<br/><br/>To do this, the team will design a practical, accurate, flexible, and generalizable information-theoretic trustworthy representation learning framework with robustness and privacy guarantees. The work will be structured around three thrusts. Thrust 1 will design novel information-theoretic representation learning methods against common privacy attacks, including membership inference, property inference, and data reconstruction attacks. Thrust 2 will design novel information-theoretic representation learning methods against common security attacks, including test-time evasion attacks, training-time poisoning attacks, and training- and test-time backdoor attacks. Thrust 3 will generalize Thrust 1 and Thrust 2 to handle diverse attack types (e.g., multiple privacy/security attacks or their combination), data types (e.g., spatial-temporal data, multimodal data), and learning types (e.g., federated learning, graph learning, self-supervised learning). The proposed framework will be evaluated on datasets and learning tasks from several domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, multimedia, and networking. The team will develop an open-source toolkit to make the techniques widely available to other researchers in academia, industry, and government. Outreach and educational activities, including summer camps, talks, lectures, tutorials, and workshops, will promote the participation of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, with a focus on providing opportunities for people from groups underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(VDC) with the aim to provide transformative improvements to disaster science by integrating model-driven methods with data driven techniques. As data are continuously updated, so are the models executing within the VDC ? as changes occur, new predictions and recommendations will help drive disaster management decisions.<br/><br/>Specific research tasks of this collaborative US-Japan project include: 1) stakeholder workshops to understand the older adult disaster resilience landscape; 2) integrate diverse data sources (geospatial and human-centric) into a novel data architecture, that supports enrichment and harmonization/alignment of multiresolution spatiotemporal data; 3) execute physics-driven hazard simulations developed by experts in the US/Japan team using the integrated data; and 4) simulate disaster processes and consequences in VDC with target older adult population and relevant hazards on the US West Coast and Tohoku region in Japan to explore optimality of response decisions/policies. The disaster digital twin framework and tools developed will build upon existing, tested technologies by PIs at both countries: multi-agent disaster simulation framework developed in Japan, and he CAREDEX data exchange platform for older adults in the US.<br/><br/>While the project focuses on disaster preparedness for senior populations during hazard events such as tsunamis and earthquakes, the proposed technology has the potential for widespread usage for vulnerable populations in multihazard settings. The project will offer opportunities for PhD and postdoctoral researchers to contribute, as well as involve undergraduates, graduates and minorities to develop and ruggedize systems related to disaster resilience for our vulnerable populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Variation in energy metabolism probably plays an important role because energy drives behavior, and is especially important for behaviors requiring peak performance, such as mate attraction and escaping from predators. However, the exact relationship between energy use and behavior is still poorly understood, particularly for energetically costly natural behaviors that affect fitness. To address this gap, this project will use repeated measurements of energy use and signaling behavior in a treefrog to determine how these traits relate to one another and allow these frogs to perform extremely challenging behaviors. These measurements will be made under different temperatures to determine how environmental conditions could modify the energetic costs of behavior, which could help to understand how organisms will respond to climate change. The genetic basis of the relationship between energy and behavior will be investigated to determine how these traits could evolve and potentially identify important regions of the genome affecting energetics and performance. The educational goals of this project are to build scientific capacity and knowledge, targeting middle school students? knowledge of behavioral energetics, data interpretation skills and appreciation for the value of scientific research, as well as graduate students developing their mentorship skills. <br/><br/>Variation in behavioral expression is often driven by variation in energetic physiology, but how these traits covary and whether they do so at the among- or within-individual level is poorly known, actively debated, and key to understanding evolutionary and ecological outcomes. The goal of this project is to identify the physiological drivers of individual variation in competitive acoustic signals in treefrogs, how physiology affects signaling plasticity in the face of environmental change, and the genetic basis of energy-signal covariance. The proposed approach is to 1) determine the energetic basis for individual variation in signaling, using repeated measurements to quantify among- and within-individual variance components in resting metabolic rate and the metabolic cost of calling, 2) test the competing predictions of different energy allocation models to determine the metabolic basis of variation in signaling plasticity, 3) discover the consequences of environmental temperature variation on behavioral energetics and its underlying individual variation and 4) use genome-wide relatedness measures to estimate heritability and the genetic covariance of these traits. Together, this project will answer fundamental questions on the mechanistic basis of individual phenotypic variation and represents a major advance in these efforts by studying a trait that is energetically costly, repeatable, and under direct sexual selection. The scientific findings from this work will be used to build a series of lesson plans aimed at teaching principles of behavioral energetics to middle school science students, and to provide a structured mentorship training program for graduate students working with undergraduate researchers.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Behavioral Systems Cluster and the Integrative Ecological Physiology program  in the Division of Integrative and Organismal Systems, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the research in genomics involves the use such methods; that is to say, they require data from thousands of participants in order to detect subtle relationships between genes and health outcomes. The work of recruiting participants and organizing their data is an increasingly complex task, outpacing the ability of individual scientists to produce data at the scale they need to conduct research. To address this gap, a variety of private entities, healthcare providers, nonprofits, research collectives and governmental funding agencies have formed organizations called biobanks. Biobanks produce large amounts of genetic and health data that can be used across a number of research projects. While biobanks are undoubtedly necessary for big data research, they also transfer a number of critical data collection decisions from laboratory scientists to biobank designers and database administrators. This project offers insights into how biobank design affects discovery in human genomics. The aim is to contribute to public understanding of the impact of digital technologies on knowledge of human health and disease.<br/><br/>This research project examines biobanking practices across multiple organizations, building on the concept of epistemic infrastructures, meaning the tools that shape and constrain how we produce knowledge. The research explores three key questions: How biobanks make decisions about which data they will collect; how research communities adapt their research aims in response to those choices; and how biobanks change over time in response to pressures from both within and outside of the research communities they serve. To address these questions, the project uses a mixed-methods approach, which includes analyzing technical literature about biobank design, research literature produced using biobank data, conducting interviews with biobankers, and observing their work. In the process, this research uncovers the mechanisms by which biobanks influence genomic research and offers a new perspective on the relationship between data infrastructures and the production of scientific knowledge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the project will enhance academic experiences in non-major STEM courses with a goal to attract more underrepresented minority students from non-major science courses into Geology and Chemistry; two disciplines at WTAMU that have low representation of diverse student populations. The project is also committed to retaining students through meaningful and practical research experiences that can position students for success as undergraduate researchers and in prospective STEM careers and advanced degrees. By tailoring learning modules (through online bridge courses) and properly training STEM research faculty with effective teaching practices (through thoughtfully designed workshops), the project will be proactively (rather than reactively) preparing students for future job opportunities and participation in the U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>RBCURE will be guided by two project goals: to enhance undergraduate STEM education in non-major STEM courses and to improve student experiences in both the classroom and the research laboratory. Fulfilling the goals of RBCURE will be accomplished through four project activities: 1) curriculum design in two non-major science courses (Geology and Chemistry); 2) creation of two online bridge courses to facilitate transitioning from the course for non-majors to the subsequent course for students selecting a science major;3) development of a research faculty workshop on STEM mentoring; and 4) development of an online module system for new research students. The project objectives are: to have equitable representation of student success in redesigned Geology and Chemistry non-majors part one courses by increasing ABC/DFIX ratios; to evaluate the effectiveness of two online bridge courses for student success and recruitment into part two science major geology and chemistry courses; to assess the effectiveness of a research faculty development workshop designed to identify best practices for conducting undergraduate research; to improve research student experiences by providing online support modules intended to front-load research information that students would complete at the start of their research project; and to develop an IUSE-HSI Track 2 Implementation and Evaluation (IEP) proposal for submission that uses findings and lessons learned.

Fluorescent proteins are widely used to watch and track biochemistry in living cells. However, the relationship between specific motions and structures of the protein and how this relates to the light-catalyzed motion of the chromophore is not fully understood. The proposed computational work will provide insight into these relationships with techniques that model the motion of the entire fluorescent protein and its reaction to light. This line of research is expected to support the development of new monomeric, red anion sensors, tunable photoswitchable dimers, and potentially create broadly applicable rational design principles to create new sensors. This project includes virtual and classroom-based research experiences in computational chemistry for undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to apply computational chemistry to the understanding and rational design of new fluorescent protein (FP) sensors. FPs are used ubiquitously in biochemical experiments and as tools in chemical biology, where they can be applied to image molecules or mechanisms of interest. The development of new FP sensors is largely empirical?the relationship between the atomic details of the protein structure and photophysics of FP chromophores is not well understood. This fundamental knowledge gap makes the creation of targeted FP sensors especially challenging. Our central hypothesis that there is a physical relationship between the structural ensemble of the protein on the ground state and the motion of the chromophore on the excited state that, if clearly understood, could aid in the creation of new sensors. To test this hypothesis, the Walker team will use a combined approach of classical molecular dynamics (MD), excited state nonadiabatic quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) dynamics, and machine learning (ML) to investigate specific systems with the aims of developing new fluorescent probes and establishing rational design principles for FP sensors more generally. This work will characterize the impact of surface mutations on the homotetrameric Dicosoma red fluorescent protein vs monomeric derivatives, design and study new anion-specific red FP sensors based on NeonGreen and endeavor to determine the mechanism of action for photodissociative Dronpa dimers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing numbers of Americans are experiencing care within Intensive Care Units (ICUs), which are hospital areas dedicated to the sickest patients and staffed by healthcare teams with advanced training in critical care medicine. Progress in the science and practice of critical care has improved survival among ICU patients. Yet some patients experience an extended period of ill-health after their ICU stay that is caused not only by illness but also by side-effects of interventions. For example, patients can suffer lasting muscle weakness from paralytic medicines used in sedation or symptoms of post-traumatic stress. These side-effects, which span physical, cognitive, and emotional domains of health, are collectively called Post-Intensive Care Syndrome. This syndrome can prevent former ICU patients from returning to their workplaces and family lives. However, it remains unclear how and by whom the medical and social ramifications of critical care can be addressed. This project will result in patient- and family-centered proposals for action to address and mitigate Post-Intensive Care Syndrome.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to understand how medical professionals and health systems can address the consequences of intensive medical care among ICU survivors. How do healthcare workers in ICUs expand their goals and practices from short-term rescue to address the longer-term outcomes associated with Post-Intensive Care Syndrome? What new forms of longitudinal care for patients after the ICU need to be engineered? What does this syndrome reveal about the values, priorities, and challenges that underlie American health systems? While clinicians and patients alike hope for recovery, uncertainty remains about what recovery means and how it is experienced. In tracing how ICU survivorship is transformed through care practices, healthcare policy, and patient experience, this project contributes new understandings of recovery beyond medical rescue that will help to inform healthcare improvement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(DDT) which utilizes human-centered data to improve community resilience. The DDT will capture the evolution of a disaster and its impacts to humans, creating an approximate replica in the cyberworld through sensing, computing, and communication. Given that disasters have a disproportionate impact on older adults (across disasters in Japan and the US, nearly 75% of mortality and morbidity burdens are among those over the age of 65), this project will focus on older adults as the key population with personalized care needs in a disaster. The US-Japan team will design tools to create ?Virtual Disaster City? (VDC) with the aim to provide transformative improvements to disaster science by integrating model-driven methods with data driven techniques. As data are continuously updated, so are the models executing within the VDC ? as changes occur, new predictions and recommendations will help drive disaster management decisions.<br/><br/>Specific research tasks of this collaborative US-Japan project include: 1) stakeholder workshops to understand the older adult disaster resilience landscape; 2) integrate diverse data sources (geospatial and human-centric) into a novel data architecture, that supports enrichment and harmonization/alignment of multiresolution spatiotemporal data; 3) execute physics-driven hazard simulations developed by experts in the US/Japan team using the integrated data; and 4) simulate disaster processes and consequences in VDC with target older adult population and relevant hazards on the US West Coast and Tohoku region in Japan to explore optimality of response decisions/policies. The disaster digital twin framework and tools developed will build upon existing, tested technologies by PIs at both countries: multi-agent disaster simulation framework developed in Japan, and he CAREDEX data exchange platform for older adults in the US.<br/><br/>While the project focuses on disaster preparedness for senior populations during hazard events such as tsunamis and earthquakes, the proposed technology has the potential for widespread usage for vulnerable populations in multihazard settings.

This Engaged Student Learning Level 2 project intends to develop learning packages to offer multiple representations of knowledge that can help students bridge theory with practice, develop problem-solving skills, and gain a comprehensive understanding of vibrations and control theory in a practical context. This project has the potential to produce advancements in understanding of student learning by exploring what ways these multiple representations are most effective for faculty and students.<br/><br/>The proposed learning packages include four main components: (1) 3D printed lab equipment designs; (2) virtual simulations; (3) virtual assistant-based AI support; and (4) guided learning activities. The project team plans to explore three research questions: (1) To what degree can learning packages enhance student learning capabilities around dynamics and controls within the context of carefully designed AI-assisted learning experiences using hands-on equipment and virtual simulations? (2) Why do potential users choose to use one or more parts of the dynamics and control learning package? (3) Which element or combinations of elements in the dynamics and controls learning package are most beneficial for its users?

While recruiting from a nationwide pool, special consideration will be given to underrepresented groups, students attending baccalaureate degree programs at colleges and universities in the Appalachian region and beyond, and, in general, institutions with limited research opportunities. Through weekly interactions, training, and mentoring, participants are expected to complete an independent research project, obtain first-hand experience with the rigors of and best practices in mathematical research, and familiarize themselves with mainstream expectations for graduate school and pursuing a career in mathematics. This program will also help strengthen STEM education and attract talent to West Virginia, thereby enhancing the region?s workforce and development. <br/><br/>Participants' research projects will focus on utilizing tools from analysis and PDEs to address practical issues arising from physics and materials science. The projects include a diverse collection of topics based on the research interests of the faculty mentors: systems of conservation and balance laws with singular solutions, asymptotics for a basic cosmological model, and the director field model with electromagnetic waves. Research in hyperbolic conservation laws will focus on solving equations with special initial conditions and employ the characteristic method and, in general, various dynamical systems ideas with geometric flavor. These methods will help us gain quantitative and qualitative insights into more general problems with many applications, such as fluid mechanics, biosciences, and cosmology. The analysis of the director field model will advance our understanding of the interaction between elastic and electromagnetic waves in liquid crystals.

These lesions refer to dilated blood vessels in the fold?s tissue and are particularly common in professions with high voice usage, such as educators, public speakers, and singers. The presence of vascular lesions and their potential rupture affect the ability of the tissue to vibrate normally, which severely disrupts speech and leads to vocal fatigue. However, the underlying mechanisms of lesion growth and fatigue resulting from this condition remain uncertain. There is thus a significant need to investigate the effects of vascular lesions on the phonation process. This project will develop predictive computational models of coupled aerodynamics, hemodynamics, and solid mechanics to account for these lesions, their progression, and the corresponding voice fatigue. The resultant framework will enable improvements in biomechanical models of the human larynx, while such models are also being considered for potential use in surgical interventions, enhancement in prevention of voice disorders, and exploring issues related to voice training. Along with the development and dissemination of technical tools, the award will also support the education and training of underrepresented minorities, expansion through virtual and on-site outreach activities to inspire appreciation of phonation biomechanics within a general audience and connect with interested patients, as well as interaction with pre-collegiate students from marginalized backgrounds through an annual summer workshop. <br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to analyze the three-way interaction between the vascular lesion, poroviscoelastic vocal fold tissue, and glottal airflow, to illustrate the biomechanical characteristics of the tissue and quantify metrics that are hypothesized to be associated with vocal fatigue. Therefore, the research objectives of this project include: (1) developing a fully coupled multi-component fluid-poroelastic structure interaction modeling approach integrating the turbulent glottal airflow and permeable fold tissue in presence of vascular lesions to assess voice fatigue indicators, (2) creating a computational solver for modeling the lesion progression in the form of the pressure-driven crack filled with blood propagating in the poroelastic tissue to explore the significance of phonation conditions, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty in the model predictions using a Monte-Carlo type simulation approach to evaluate how various physical parameters and morphological features affect the fold?s biomechanics and lesion propagation. This project will enable the PI to advance the knowledge base in mechanics and computational simulation, establishing the foundation for her long-term career in speech biomechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tropical forests are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and hold some of the largest stocks of carbon in plants and soils globally. Thus, they are a ?carbon bank,? storing carbon in solid form and reducing potential carbon in the atmosphere as the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, these ecosystems are important to global societies for biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and climate moderation. This project studies the effects of drying on carbon storage and cycling in tropical forests, using a long-term experiment that reduces rainfall inputs to four distinct tropical forests in Panama. The forests have different background rainfall and soil fertility, which could influence how they respond to drying. The project was established in 2015, and thus is accumulating a long-term dataset. In the initial seven years of data there was large variation in carbon fluxes and cycling from year to year, possibly related to variation in rainfall between different years. This new project, called Panama Rainforest Changes with Experimental Drying (PARCHED), will now continue for an additional 5 ? 10 years of measurements. These results will help improve understanding of how tropical forest carbon storage changes over decades in response to climate variability. Undergraduate students will have opportunities to be involved in research, and there will be outreach materials produced in both English and Spanish. <br/><br/>Results from the past seven years of the PARCHED experiment have some anomalies relative to what would be predicted. Some model predictions matched experimental results, while some mismatches suggested that important processes in tropical forests were not represented in the model. In particular, the importance of reduced water fluxes into soils, and related reductions in delivery of nutrients into soils, were lacking from the model, which could be important in the context of inter-annual variation in rainfall and soil hydrology. This project works to: a) determine whether observed chronic drying effects on tropical carbon cycling years persist over one to two decades of background rainfall variation; b) allow for detection of changes in long-term soil carbon storage in tropical forests. The project measures tree stem and root growth, soil carbon levels, and changes in carbon losses from soils via CO2 fluxes. Ongoing work aims to improve the model characterization of important processes in rainforests under drying. In conducting these scientific activities, the project trains and support a full-time field technician, involves undergraduate researchers, and will be used as part of the Smithsonian?s science outreach efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To cope with the continuous evolution in data, an intelligent agent needs to incrementally acquire, perceive, accumulate, and exploit structural and temporal dynamic knowledge throughout its lifetime. This project aims to develop a generic machine learning paradigm to conduct Continual Learning on Evolving Graphs (CoLEG). The success of this project will 1) benefit critical infrastructure (such as social networks, transportation, and renewable energy) and human welfare (in the form of, for example, improvements in healthcare and epidemiology), 2) provide an ideal platform for composing the areas of graph representation learning, time series analysis, continual learning, and causal analysis, and 3) develop open-source tools for evolving graphs that can advance diverse topics such as node classification, link prediction, and temporal forecasting, improve our knowledge of the physical world, and contribute to real-world applications. This project will also 1) engage high school students in research and outreach to K-12 teachers and students, 2) broaden the participation of underrepresented groups especially female and low-income students in STEM, and 3) educate undergraduate and graduate students through the development of new course modules in data mining and machine learning.<br/><br/>To achieve the above goals, it is imperative to address two core challenges associated with evolving graphs, specifically memorization and generalization. The former aims to facilitate the model in acquiring the capacity to comprehensively retain a vast array of conceivable scenarios, encompassing a comprehensive range of existing structural and temporal dynamic conditions. The latter strives to ensure the model can generalize its knowledge and effectively adapt to unforeseen and complex circumstances. This project will develop a generic machine learning paradigm, CoLEG, to resolve the catastrophic forgetting problem by retaining essential structural information and temporal dynamics, ensure the generalization capability, and address real-world applications on evolving graphs. Specifically, 1) a new continual learning paradigm will be formulated to tackle the catastrophic forgetting issue in structural evolving graphs via graph sparsification and topology-aware embedding, 2) new algorithms will be developed to incorporate structural and temporal dynamic patterns of evolving graphs under different regimes, resolve the task-free challenge, and reveal high-order dependencies, and 3) novel solutions will be constructed to pursue pre-trained models and facilitate test-of-time adaptation to ensure the generalization over unforeseen scenarios.

Effective management of invasive species requires that scientists understand how they compete successfully with native species. One of the least understood behaviors of invasive plants is that a single invasive species can dominate in many different types of environments. In particular, scientists have identified a group of ?superinvaders? that, counter to what is expected for native species, can grow very fast in sunlight but also tolerate heavy shade in the forest understory. Although there is good evidence that this behavior drives their increasing abundance in both temperate and tropical forests, scientists don?t understand how this occurs: why should invasive species play by different rules than native species in the same environment? One hypothesis is that invasive species have fewer pests than native species, and this advantage allows them to persist in stressful environments. In this project, ecologists will experimentally test this idea in many different types of forests to determine how this ?superinvader? behavior emerges. Moreover, by linking how plants simultaneously respond to pests and environmental stress, scientists will better understand how species coexist to foster native biodiversity. The project will train two US doctoral students, one postdoctoral scholar and numerous undergraduate students. The project will foster international collaboration, research partnerships and knowledge transfer across the Americas. This will benefit US scientists, doctoral student trainees and postdoctoral scholar. A new Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the University of South Carolina and a summer workshop in Puerto Rico will contribute to broadening participation by undergraduate students from groups under-represented in science and technology. The postdoctoral scholar will lead an effort to create a Forest Superinvader Network that will increase the scope of this project to the global level to facilitate international knowledge transfer and more effective forest and land management worldwide through better understanding of plant invasion mechanisms.<br/><br/>The project involves two components. In the first, research teams will monitor the growth and survival of native and invasive tree saplings across lights gradients in 10 locations across the Americas, including temperate forests in Connecticut and South Carolina, tropical forests in Mexico, Costa Rica, and the Caribbean, and subtropical forests in southern Brazil. Using field measurements of metabolic activity of different tissues above- and belowground, researchers will test the hypothesis that lower energy costs in invaders, as a result of fewer pests, allows these invaders to circumvent functional tradeoffs typically associated with fast growth and shade tolerance. In a second component conducted in five locations, researchers will experimentally remove insects and fungal pathogens from native and invasive saplings to test whether shade tolerance is driven by pest loads. In both components, researchers will build and test integrative models of plant behavior that consider the energetic costs of seemingly disparate behaviors (e.g., resource capture versus defense) to further scientific understanding of critical linkages between plant functional ecology and population dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each day, these coastlines are hammered by the force of thousands of crashing waves, causing the coastline to retreat, sometimes catastrophically.  As climate changes and ocean waves become more extreme, potential acceleration of coastal retreat poses significant threats to natural habitats, cultural heritage, coastal communities, and critical infrastructure. However, the influence of extreme waves on rocky coast erosion is not well-known, limiting the prediction of evolving coastal hazards. This project will synthesize environmental, topographic, and geologic datasets, use innovative seismic monitoring techniques, and develop new models to understand the sensitivity of rocky coast erosion and coastal hazards to extreme waves. The project will integrate research activities into public-facing outreach and university education, including newly developed educational modules and online interactive tools, both leveraging publicly accessible, live-streamed datasets. <br/><br/>This project aims to understand how variable wave action translates to coastal erosion and sea cliff retreat on rocky coastlines. The work is structured around three components: (1) quantifying how tectonics and near-shore morphology control wave energy delivery to rocky shores, (2) measuring near-shore wave transformation and sea cliff response across a range of settings, and (3) piloting a coastal erosion model that accounts for wave climate, wave filtering effects, and cliff erosion thresholds. The project's main contributions include a probabilistic description of wave energy delivery, direct field measurement of wave climate translation to coastal geomorphic work, and a novel erosion model quantifying coastal sensitivity to shifting environmental extremes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heritable aggregated protein assemblies in yeast and other fungi, known as fungal prions, provide a new mechanism for the inheritance and memory, as they control heritable traits that are not directly encoded in DNA sequence but are passed between generations in the form of rearranged proteins. This project will investigate how heritable aggregates are initially generated from a non-aggregated protein. Understanding the formation of heritable aggregates is important for linking environmental and physiological processes, such as cell stress, to heritable properties of cells and organisms. This may also help improve industrial applications, such as production of alcohol and biofuels by yeast. Research project will be integrated with course development, teaching and mentoring, thus contributing to education of diverse workforce in the areas of genetics, biochemistry and biotechnology. It will provide additional support for research infrastructure by strengthening interdisciplinary interactions. <br/><br/>The unifying hypothesis tested in this project is that the ability to form a heritable aggregate in vivo is modulated by complex interactions between aggregation-prone proteins, cellular factors and environment, and is under the evolutionary pressure that is minimizing uncontrolled aggregation. This hypothesis will be tested in proposed experiments. Pathways linking environmental stress to heritable protein aggregation will be uncovered. Mechanisms underlining the abilities of some protein aggregates to promote aggregation of other proteins will be studied. Divergence of protein aggregation capabilities in evolution will be addressed. Relationships between reversible protein condensates, formed by liquid-liquid phase separation, and irreversible protein aggregates will be deciphered. Emergence of molecular features that make protein aggregates heritable will be investigated. Interactions of newly generated aggregates with stress-induced protein folding helpers, termed chaperones, will be explored.

To address the grand challenges of global environmental change, scientists and practitioners need a causal understanding ? or robust evidence of cause-and-effect relationships ? of how and when global change impacts ecosystems. In response, this CAREER proposal will develop an integrated research and education platform to transform understanding of global change impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and to train the next generation of global change scientists. To facilitate these advances, the project will study how chronic drought impacts biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of grassland ecosystems in the southwest/central US because of their importance to the global carbon cycle and current projections of intensifying drought in this region. Then, the research will broaden insights to other ecosystems (e.g., to study warming impacts on alpine tundra), through cultivating inclusive, collaborative teams to tackle focal research questions with NSF Long Term Ecological Research and NEON data. This research?s broader impacts focus on training the next generation of scientists to enhance their methodological toolbox and ability to lead inclusive teams that promote diverse perspectives. To achieve these goals, the researcher will lead a distributed graduate seminar with training in inclusive team science; create innovative, open-source course modules on data science; and catalyze professional development for K12 teachers.<br/><br/>This CAREER proposal seeks to transform the methods used to acquire causal understanding and to generate new causal understanding about the mechanisms through which drought and warming will alter biodiversity and, in turn, ecosystem functioning. This project proposes a novel integration of existing NSF data, new experimental tests, and recent, multidisciplinary advances in causal inference techniques that are currently underutilized in ecology. This convergent approach will generate quantitative estimates of: (1) why and how biodiversity change dampens or amplifies the impacts of drought on ecosystem productivity, and whether the mechanisms through which biodiversity affects productivity (2) differ for soil functions and (3) vary with a site?s climate history and plant functional traits. Through a distributed graduate seminar, the project will include teams of graduate students to synthesize (4) how these direct and indirect effects of global change vary across drivers (e.g., warming, nitrogen pollution) and ecosystems. This integrated approach will deliver insights on the mechanisms through which global change alters the effect of biodiversity on productivity and generate broader advances in the causal inference in ecology. To deliver broader impacts, the researcher will lead a distributed graduate seminar that provides a vehicle to advance the use of best practices for inclusive team science and work with pedagogy experts and graduate students to create and evaluate data science modules. To extend benefits to K12 classrooms and low-income communities in Colorado, the project will work with CU Boulder?s Science Discovery?s Teacher Professional development program to collaborate with teachers to integrate concepts of global change and data literacy into their classes, potentially reaching thousands of students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The principal investigator plans to use game theory to understand the circumstances under which economic agents (such as firms and politicians) have incentives to take socially desirable actions in long-term relationships. The research seeks to answer the following specific questions. First, does a firm have incentives to supply a high quality product when the market has limited information about its past behavior? Second, what kind of information should online platforms provide to consumers in order to motivate sellers to build a reputation for supplying high quality product? Third, can researchers deliver robust predictions on firms? behaviors that can be tested using data?<br/><br/>The principal investigator will answer these questions by using novel methods in the theory of repeated games, reputation, and learning. The first project analyzes how consumers? ability to observe other consumers? choices (i.e., observational learning) affects each seller?s incentives to build a reputation for supplying high quality. Consumers? information is summarized by a stochastic network, which determines whether a consumer?s action can be observed by each of their successors. The results identify network structures under which observational learning strengthens reputational incentives as well as those that cause reputational incentives to break down. The second project analyzes situations where consumers do not have detailed information about the firm?s history. The analysis sheds light on the effects of long social memories, the coarsening of market information, the heterogeneous quality of consumer information on the seller?s incentives to sustain a reputation, and on consumers? welfare. The third project analyzes situations where long-lived agents (e.g., sellers, politicians) can manipulate their past records, for example, they can erase signals from their records at some cost. This is motivated by applications to online platforms in which sellers can bribe consumers in exchange for taking down the negative reviews. The main result shows that, when sellers are sufficiently long-lived, their returns from building reputations are entirely wiped out, even when the market suspects that they may erase records with a low probability. It also shows that players? incentives to sustain cooperation do not necessarily increase with their expected lifespans; and this finding stands in contrast to the standard predictions found in the literature on repeated games.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These MSCs are bound by an organic backbone within a fibrous mesophase, forming an ideal hybrid material where the inorganic and organic components are nearly equal in proportion. Recent work revealed their ability to self-organize into complex, hierarchical structures, displaying intriguing optical characteristics. These findings open up new avenues in understanding and manipulating the self-assembly of such hybrid materials. The goal of the project is to explore the chemical formation mechanisms of these hybrid materials, focusing on their fibrous scaffold backbone, and modifying their composition to cover a wider range of the optical spectrum. This research is poised to significantly advance knowledge in materials chemistry, particularly in the control and organization of hybrid materials. It explores the fundamental principles of self-assembly, potentially leading to new synthetic methods and deeper insights into natural self-assembling systems. The societal benefits of this research are manifold. Optical metamaterials, for instance, have potential applications in advanced technologies like sensors, energy storage, and biomedicine. This project also focuses on educational and diversity aspects, including mentoring underrepresented groups in science, developing outreach programs, and creating educational materials to inspire future scientists. The integration of research with education and outreach ensures that this project not only advances scientific knowledge but also contributes to the national health, prosperity, welfare, and the education of a diverse, skilled workforce.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>A distinct goal of materials chemistry is to develop self-assembling hierarchical materials from nanoscale building blocks. Deciphering the intricate interplay between structure and property in these systems stands as a pivotal enabler for the rational design of advanced optical devices and paves a pathway towards emulating the structural sophistication found in nature. Among the synthetic building blocks that could be used, colloidal, inorganic magic-sized clusters (MSCs) emerge as compelling candidates. The main objective of this project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, is to elucidate the formation mechanisms of MSC-based materials, particularly investigating how chemical interactions within these clusters lead to fibrous self-organization and the resulting unique properties. The experimental approach for these investigations includes modifying the chemical composition of the MSCs, specifically targeting the organic scaffold component, to understand its role in the fibrous mesophase formation. The project will also develop a library of optically active films within the visible range. By focusing on the fundamental aspects of nanoparticle self-assembly and the interplay between chemical composition and physical properties, this project aims to contribute significantly to the field of materials chemistry, specifically in the area of hybrid nanomaterials. The understanding gained from this research could have broader implications for the synthesis of novel materials with tailored optical and structural properties. The outcomes have wide-ranging societal implications, including potential applications in advanced technologies. The project also commits to education and diversity, mentoring underrepresented groups, and developing educational resources, aligning with NSF's mission to advance science, national health, prosperity, and welfare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the skin of the palms of the hands, especially the figure tips, have the highest density of touch sensors to allow object recognition and manipulation. This proposal aims to use the itch-sensing neural circuit as a model system to understand how the mammalian nervous system achieves higher sensitivity of sensory processing in the glabrous (non-hairy) skin. The PI?s group previously identified MrgprC11+ neurons as the main mediator for itch sensation arising from both the proximal body and the glabrous skin of mice. This project will examine the morphological and physiological features of MrgprC11+ neurons to provide a mechanistic understanding of regional differences in sensory processing. The project will support the training of undergraduate and graduate students. The project will also provide high school science teachers with hands-on experience to analyze neuronal connections and promote neuroscience education in high schools. Overall, this project will broaden our scientific and societal understanding of itch sensation.<br/><br/>Disproportional central representation of the glabrous skin is the most striking feature of the somatosensory cortical map. However, where in the somatosensory circuits such biased representations emerge and the molecular and cellular basis underlying the distorted representation are largely unknown. This project will analyze the MrgprC11+ itch-sensing dorsal root ganglia neurons controlling different body locations to investigate how primary sensory neurons contribute to the distorted cortical representation. A combination of morphological, transcriptomic, and physiological approaches will be employed to address three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the morphological basis of regional differences in itch transmission and how this is established during development. Aim 2 will identify the skin-type specific physiological properties of itch-sensing neurons to achieve heightened glabrous skin sensitivity. Aim 3 will investigate skin-type specific synapse formation and pruning mechanisms to promote itch transmission of the glabrous skin. Results generated will deepen our understanding of the somatotopical organization of the nocifensive sensory system in vertebrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The thirteen-lined ground squirrel is an obligatory mammalian hibernator. During hibernation, squirrels switch to lipid metabolism and do not eat during the entire hibernation (up to 8 months). This remarkable abstinence from food is referred to as self-induced seasonal anorexia. How hibernators exhibit negligible hunger drive despite a prolonged period of food deprivation and how their metabolism copes with this process remains one of the biggest mysteries in energy homeostasis regulation. This proposal seeks to understand the molecular, cellular and circuitry mechanisms that allow hibernators to survive for months without food, using tools and approaches from a spectrum of disciplines that have not been previously used for hibernation research, such as optogenetics and fiber photometry.  This grant will support outreach program (Sensory Physiology Club), an extracurricular educational activity aimed to promote scientific knowledge in animal neurophysiology among school students from middle- and high schools from Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts. The efforts are designed to spark interest in biological science through lectures and interactive experimental activities, which go beyond the school curricula. The outcomes of study have far-reaching implications for fundamental biology, medicine, and the future of humanity. Induction of a hibernation-like state could help improve organ transplantation, recovery from ischemia, stroke, or brain injury, and may ultimately enable long-distance space travel, e.g., for manned missions to Mars.<br/><br/>The main scientific goal of this study is to broaden our limited understanding of seasonal metabolic reprogramming and anorexia during hibernation. This study will test the hypothesis that the reversible, self-induced anorexia during hibernation is achieved through uncoupling between peripheral hunger/satiety hormones and the hypothalamic feeding center. Specific aims of this proposal include investigation of the neuronal mechanisms that support insensitivity to metabolic cues and permeability of blood brain barrier and their contribution to hunger suppression during hibernation. This proposal represents an interdisciplinary endeavor that spans multiple scales and integrates various tools and approaches from a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines. Ranging from biochemical blood and tissues analysis, metabolic profiling, transcriptomics to in vivo imaging, electrophysiology, and animal behavior studies. A major innovative aspect of this proposal is the use of in vivo brain imaging, which has not been previously used in hibernating animals.

To circumvent these issues, the technique of using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) has been proposed. RIS can redirect reflected signals toward intended users, thus avoiding signal blockage, mitigating interference, or increasing security. Engineering the desired propagation environment, however, requires knowledge about important parameters such as the directions of the users or transmitters to be available at the RIS. To address this need, this project will develop a new type of hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (HRIS). The HRIS will be designed to sense the incident waves on the entire surface, deduce relevant information, such as the directions of users and transmitters, and reconfigure their reflection patterns accordingly. By developing the HRIS, this project paves the way for the implementation of a truly smart and autonomous propagation environment. This project also examines other opportunities that can be enabled by the HRIS to sense the environment with high spatial resolution, such as imaging objects for context-aware homes and buildings or threat detection. The research project is complemented by a comprehensive educational plan to engage graduate and undergraduate students in designing metasurfaces and HRIS, developing compressive sensing techniques, and devising intelligent electromagnetic environments. This project also includes several undergraduate-led efforts where they will learn to use the HRIS to track devices and provide them with focused beams for wireless power transfer (WPT). The resulting adaptive WPT demonstrations will be used in interactive workshops on topics of electromagnetic research and emerging trends in wireless communications and sensing, as well as at outreach events.<br/><br/>This research project will outline the design of HRIS and experimentally demonstrate their utility in typical wireless communications settings. It will thus make innovative contributions including 1) the design of a novel metasurface that allows for reconfigurable reflection and sensing of the incident wave, 2) the development and experimental validation of novel algorithms for compressive sensing of the propagation environment with high spatial resolution using only a few receiving units, 3) a smart adaptive communications link where the HRIS detects the transmitter and users and transform its reflection patterns accordingly, and 4) development and experimental validation of novel imaging configurations where the scattered wireless communications signals (signals of opportunities) are collected by the HRIS and processed to retrieve reflectivity maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This data movement consumes significant energy and slows down the processing speed, particularly for data-driven applications such as machine learning workloads. In-memory computing (IMC) is a promising solution to address this issue by performing computations inside memory. However, IMC techniques using emerging memory technologies suffer from multiple key technical challenges that limit their applicability in today?s computing systems. Significant error in the computations is likely with these IMC techniques. The processing latency also increases significantly with data-width; e.g., this is approximately an exponential increase for the multiplication operation. This project addresses the critical challenges with today?s IMC techniques by exploiting a simple and uniform representation of data. Complex arithmetic operations on weighted binary data are transformed into simple bit-wise memory-friendly operations on uniform bit-streams. Successful completion of the project will accelerate and reduce the power and energy consumption of a wide range of applications from biomedicine (e.g., retinal implants), to security (e.g., miniaturized unmanned aerial vehicles), to smart sensors and machine learning (e.g., speech recognition). The team will share the project outcomes, including articles, simulators, and hardware and software toolkits, with the research community. The findings and technical outputs will be integrated into instructional materials for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 classroom settings. The project activities will engage active participation of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project combines the complementary properties of two emerging technologies, IMC and unary computing (UC), to implement a high-performance, reliable, and energy-efficient data processing platform with high computational ability. The presented platform addresses the technical challenges of the IMC techniques using emerging memory technologies. It also addresses the latency and cost-efficiency of the existing UC designs with combinational CMOS logic. The technology explored in this project aims to improve the robustness of IMC operations to noise and variation by processing uniform bit-streams. The platform is highly parallel and effectively scales with the size of computations. It enables fast, accurate, and simple execution of a wide range of arithmetic operations entirely in memory. It enjoys independent bit-wise operations, avoiding long chains of operations, an important source of in-efficiency in today?s IMC techniques.

Besides the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer, many other mRNA vaccines and drugs are under development for treating cancers and infectious diseases, gene therapy, and cell therapy. The average global revenue of mRNA therapy in the next decade is projected to be ~$18 billion annually. One main bottleneck for the distribution of mRNA therapy products is the poor stability of the mRNA drug products, which results in high cold-chain costs, big wastage, and limited accessibility to rural areas. The thermostable mRNA formulation technology developed in this project will help pharmaceutical companies to save multi-billion dollars per year associated with low stability and expand the market to the rural US and tropical countries. The thermostable formulations will make the revolutionary mRNA vaccines and drugs accessible to the approximately 60 million rural population in the US and the approximately 3 billion people living in tropical countries without adequate cold-chain facilities. Expansion of the market will also lead to more affordable prices of mRNA therapy products for low-income, especially uninsured, families.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will provide a low-cost and scalable solution to eliminate the cold-chain challenges in the distribution of mRNA active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and mRNA lipid-nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) drug products. mRNAs and mRNA-LNPs in aqueous solutions undergo degradation through various pathways. Currently, the only way to increase their stability without freezing is to remove water by lyophilization, which requires additional facility, costs, time, and process development. This STTR Phase I project aims to test the feasibility to store the thermostable liquid formulations of mRNAs and mRNA-LNPs at room temperature for transportation and long-term storage. The research plan is designed towards two objectives: (1) To demonstrate mRNA APIs with various lengths in the optimized granule formulations retain >90% activity after transportation at 20C for more than two weeks; (2) To demonstrate that the optimized thermostable formulations of mRNA-LNP drug products retain >90% activity after storage at 20C for more than six months and 50C for up to 7 days during tropical outdoor transportation. Completing the Phase I project will provide the evidence to support that thermostability of the proprietary mRNA and mRNA-LNP formulations can meet the industrial requirement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. <br/><br/>This project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them. The project team will also train hundreds of early career scientists, whose research and teaching will benefit from the easy manipulation and use of digital biological specimens. Additionally, bootcamp opportunities will transform motivated grad students and post-docs into future inventors of new analytical tools and functionalities, which will grow the community of morphologists working in digital environments.  MorphoCloud will make working with digital biological specimen data as routine as working with genomics data, so that biologists can focus on their scientific questions rather than get bogged down with complex workflows, technicalities, and limited resources. Proposed cloud services and analytical tools will also make wider-scale, multi-lab collaborations friction-free, via derived data exchange of 3D phenotypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, for applications in real-world engineering systems, existing RL algorithms and theory fall short of addressing three fundamental challenges: high stochasticity, long-horizon regimes and vulnerability to model uncertainty. These challenges are exacerbated in systems with multiple strategic agents. The goal of this CAREER project is to advance the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of RL by addressing these challenges, and enable efficient and resilient RL-based control in engineering systems. This project will particularly focus on applications in computer and communication networks, which will guide the problem formulation, methodology development and evaluation. The project is enhanced by an education plan that aims to offer students from K?12 to college a pathway to obtain experience and training in RL and broadly machine learning, as well as in their applications in engineering systems. This project will also support a mentoring program for students in STEM.<br/><br/>The research work in this project will address the aforementioned challenges via three technical thrusts. Thrust 1 studies finite-time convergence of various iterative algorithms that arise in RL through the unified variational inequality framework, by leveraging tools from modern Markov chain theory. In Thrust 2, we will develop techniques to tame the high stochasticity in long-horizon problems, and further develop RL algorithms that provably learn a stable and near-optimal policy. Thrust 3 studies scalable multi-agent RL through the framework of mean-field game and graphon game, as well as the game theoretical foundation of robust Markov games under model uncertainty.

The SGT Forum is a grassroots, volunteer-run, community meeting in structural geology and tectonics. Over the past decade, the SGT Forum has provided a venue for investigators and educators to communicate, develop, and advance research and teaching in the discipline. Within the geosciences, the field of Structural Geology and Tectonics covers topics that deal with gaining a better understanding of the history and effects of plate motions, and includes studies of fault zones, earthquakes and seismic hazards, determining the history of past plate motions and their influence on volcanic processes and mountain-building events. The meeting location provides an ideal opportunity to gather interested geoscientists in a setting that has a rich and varied array of active and ancient plate tectonic environments in a region with a large number of geoscientists working together to better understand a large set of structural and tectonic issues. The campus of Western Washington University will be the meeting location, and the meeting will recruit and invite a diverse array of geoscientists to participate and will actively seek participation from local and regional 2-year colleges and other institutions with diverse students and faculty. Early career faculty and graduate students will be strongly encouraged to participate, and we will plan for a rich set of networking and professional development opportunities as part of the meeting. Outcomes that stem from this meeting will include better identification of priorities and advances in structural geology and tectonic problems for the Pacific NW region, improvements in training and professional development of geoscience researchers, and to improve community ties and communication and professional networking among the participating geoscientists and the different institutions they work for. Overall, this will result in better understanding of seismic activity and hazards of the region, and improve our understanding of its history of plate-margin processes, which together will benefit the citizens of the region and the nation at large.<br/><br/><br/>The SGT Forum is a platform for building research connections and informal mentorship. Gathering and soliciting meeting participants from a diverse range of professional experience and background will foster greater engagement and participation in geosciences and structural/tectonic research and activities. Three principal goals of the SGT Forum: 1) To identify priorities and share advances in research findings and techniques particular to problems in structural geology and tectonics, 2) To address training and professional development for researchers at all stages, 3) To facilitate networking and community building. For the meeting in Bellingham, they take advantage of local field opportunities and expertise. The setting also brings a natural connection to large research initiatives, and a chance to broaden engagement. The goal is to connect field trips and workshops to talks, poster sessions, and panel discussions across several themes:<br/>Deformation of mafic and ultramafic rocks. Activities include a field trip to Twin Sisters dunite; StraboMicro demonstration; research presentations highlighting results from field and lab; and open discussion of research priorities. Subduction zone geology. Activities include a field trip to San Juan Islands accreted terranes; research presentations Cascadia accretionary complex and fore-arc deformation; showcase collaborative opportunities with USGS & State mapping efforts; discussion of SZ4D GeoArray and CRESCENT Community Fault Model initiatives. Collisional and transpressional orogens. Activities include a field trip to Cascades crystalline core, research presentations; discussion: building on recent regional and Penrose meetings. Magnetic fabrics and paleomagnetism. Proposed meeting activities include a short workshop on applications of paleomagnetism and magnetic fabrics to SGT problems, field sampling, lab methods and analytical tools. Research presentations in these areas, and a preview of StraboMag will also be featured. Field geology instruction.

The current US housing infrastructure sector is in crisis. Plagued by a chronic scarcity of affordable and available homes, rapidly rising costs, the largest home construction labor shortage in over twenty years, and pre-Industrial Revolution production processes that prohibit innovation and efficiency, a drastically different paradigm is required to ensure we have the high-quality housing stock available to provide for the safety, security, and well-being of all US families. The NextHouse vision is a future where housing in the US is primarily built in factories and delivered as integrated and fully-engineered products enabling greater affordability, sustainability, resiliency, health outcomes, and equity. The NextHouse innovation ecosystem will be a central fixture in the Midwest tech corridor to produce disruptive technologies, spur new business, and drive economic growth. Based in a region with a glut of legacy cities and corresponding racial disparities, it will catalyze much-needed economic growth and improved employment opportunities through an expanded factory-built housing industry. Driven by coordinated Indiana and Michigan innovation and workforce development, a fully-automated, and scaled-up factory-built housing industry will deliver innovative and customer-responsive products that improve sustainability, quality of life, and housing equity with a more diverse and inclusive workforce.<br/><br/>The award will be used to launch and grow a NextHouse organization. The leadership team will start by developing procedures and programs for engaging and strengthening partnerships, including a process for soliciting and reviewing proposals for activities by partners that strengthen the ecosystem. A fee-paying NextHouse Industry Consortium will be established as a joint venture with the Purdue Center for High Performance Buildings to facilitate development of direct pathways (i.e., a technology pipeline) to partner companies for deployment of NextHouse technologies and processes. Concepts from R&D and workforce development partners will be funded that demonstrate technology pipeline benefits to strengthen industry relationships. NextHouse will also fund partner proposals to support assessments of opportunities for establishing new regional factory-built housing factories. During the award, partner workshops will be held to: i) identify and prioritize needs for R&D, translation to practice, workforce development, and DEIA; ii) engage regional stakeholders (e.g. housing authorities, economic development agencies, advanced manufacturing partnerships) to identify federal/state initiatives and plan pilot sites in Indiana and Michigan; and iii) grow industry and venture capital participation. The project team will also work closely with industry partners to identify important features for facilities that will ultimately be developed for the planned NextHouse Headquarters, including the HEET (Home Environmental Evaluation Testing) Laboratory that will enable controlled testing of modular housing at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These networks not only provide habitats for freshwater species but also serve as conduits for water-borne pathogens that can cause severe diseases. Researchers will develop a predictive framework that will provide quantitative understanding of how the topological (structural connectivity), geometric (channel length, slope, etc.), and emergent features (e.g., channel ephemerality) of river networks influence the dynamics of flux movement under both steady and transient conditions. This framework will have the potential to assess how different scenarios of change, such as climate and land use change, may affect the future of river networks in their capacity to transport hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical fluxes throughout the landscape. This framework can also inform decisions about managing river networks to reduce their flooding potential and frequency, as well as the concentration of pathogens at critical locations within a basin. The project will disseminate fundamental and applied knowledge about river networks and their transport patterns and properties, with a focus on their relevance to hydrologic, engineering and earth sciences, to an audience of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students.  <br/><br/>The proposed research takes a holistic (mathematical-physical-observational) approach to understanding the flux dynamics on river networks by integrating static, dynamic and emergent connectivity attributes within a single framework that offers the potential to assess how different scenarios of change, such as climate and land use change, may affect the future of river networks in their capacity to transport hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical fluxes throughout the landscape. It leverages the strengths of network theory, remote sensing and field observations, hydrologic principles and numerical modeling to decipher the key topological, geometric, and emergent controls that govern dynamic patterns of flux transport on river networks. In particular, the researchers aim to (i) unveil the most relevant controls imposed by river networks on the aggregation of fluxes during the transport process, (ii) quantify their relation with external forcing such as climate and human actions, and (iii) propose vulnerability indicators for identifying hot spots of change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is why electronic devices are engineered to shed heat and reduce the temperature under operation. This problem is critical at the nanoscale, where it is necessary to control thermal conduction at boundaries between different materials and components. Consider two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, which have shown great promise. These consist of layers of atoms that are tightly bound in the plane and weakly bound between layers. If heat cannot be efficiently transported between layers, there would be significant limits to the use of 2D materials in next generation electronics. On the other hand, a strong thermal boundary could provide the potential for remarkable materials with thermal isolation better than air. The need to understand and control thermal boundary conductance at 2D-2D interfaces and between 2D and bulk materials motivates this project. Investigators will manipulate the thermal properties of 2D materials through changes in their interface structure and chemistry. Investigators will study how to control physical coupling and the effect of novel heat transfer mechanisms. An integral part of this project will be to develop experiential education programs for underrepresented students at the University of Texas at Dallas, the Carnegie Institute of Washington, and local high schools and community colleges. The researchers will work with local museums to develop new artwork conservation programs using optical techniques such as Raman spectroscopy.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>A major gap in the present knowledge of thermal boundary conductance (TBC) is how it can be manipulated by changing the structure of 2D-2D and 2D-bulk interfaces. As these interfaces are often set when the sample is fabricated, only a subset of structure-property relationships has been investigated, and often across disparate samples subject to the variation common to 2D materials. This project is applying extreme pressure within a diamond anvil cell as a new technique for broadly changing the structure of the same interface while measuring the TBC. This is allowing researchers to decode fundamental knowledge on the structure-property relationships for the TBC while also gaining insights into practical pathways for manipulating the thermal properties of 2D materials and thermal limitations of 2D devices. Specific structural and chemical changes at the interface include (1) the increase of physical coupling, (2) the transition from nonbonded to bonded chemistry, and (3) the onset of new phononic and nonphononic heat transfer mechanisms. Raman spectroscopy at optical wavelengths is being used to simultaneously characterize the interface and measure the TBC. The measurements are backed by first-principles modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to the TBC, these models are allowing researchers to identify renormalizations of the phonon dispersion and scattering, which can affect many phonon-limited areas of energy transport and conversion in 2D materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their generation mechanisms remain a subject of much debate, with strong coronal and interplanetary discontinuities or shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CME) being likely responsible. Previous observations studied these shocks at different solar distances from the Earth?s orbit to the outer heliosphere, but were limited to distances mostly outside the Earth?s orbit (>1 au). Currently, however, observations with Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) allow us to build a more complete picture by probing extensively distances below 1 au. A key consequence of studying this region, which is the goal of this project, is that these in-situ observations will provide SEP and shock measurements that are dramatically less affected by transport effects as the spacecraft progressively get closer to the Sun.<br/><br/>The data from PSP and SolO will be analyzed for periods when these spacecraft observe shock events with exceptionally high SEP intensities. The results will address the significant issue of energetic particle acceleration by shocks near the Sun and how the particles affect the structure of these young shocks. Additionally, as energetic-particle-mediated shocks are predicted to occur in various astrophysical settings across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, our comprehensive search for such structures very close to our Sun may fundamentally contribute to our understanding of well-known ?cosmic ray?-mediated collisionless shocks. The science goals of this project are to (1) quantify SEP-mediated shocks, (2) assess SEP impact on shock mediation, and (3) explore shock-SEP relationships.

Current methods rarely do this, so scientists study microbes that can grow and not those present but unable to grow in nonnatural conditions. Therefore, most microorganisms are poorly studied, even if known to exist. This has impeded the scientific discovery of novel materials made by microorganisms that have potential applications in health care, environmental remediation, or industrial use. In this research, microbes isolated from various natural sources will be enclosed in capsules that are smaller than the width of a hair. The composition of capsule will be designed to facilitate the growth of the microbial species enclosed and their communication with the outside environment. This new ?nanoculture system? will be used to study how the enclosed microbial communities communicate and interact with ?outside? microorganisms a natural environment, like that in the gastrointestinal track. This will be tested by feeding the encapsulated microbes to mice without gut microbes and determining if the nanoculture system can restore gastrointestinal health. The results of this research will result in new capabilities to grow microorganisms and develop new materials from these understudied microbes with potential to restore balance to the gut?s microbiomes. The project will expose high school students to the field of biotechnology and develop their technical skills and seed their professional networks as strategies to inspire future careers in this area.<br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This research aims to harness a microfluidic-based technique to develop a multifunctional nanoculture system as a high-throughput assessment tool for microbial community dynamics. The nanocultures are nanoliter cultures made of poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes, which can be manipulated for tunable permeability. The mechanical, transport, and magnetic properties of the nanocultures can facilitate the long-term storage and incubation of the microbial communities in environmental conditions. The nanocultures are thus microdevices capable of eliminating growth rate bias associated with interspecies competition and preserving microbes against biological and chemical insults. The soft-shelled microcapsules can harbor, culture, and store a multitude of microbes for purposes including community dynamics study, growth of challenging species, and the delivery of defined communities for microbiome restoration. A technology will be built to sequester and monitor the dynamics of synthetic or defined microbial consortia in environmental conditions. Specifically, a functional housing will be designed to characterize the unintended ecological impacts of the synthetic communities and to investigate the advantages of their controlled delivery in manipulating various microbiomes. The feasibility of the functional nanocultures for delivering a probiotic producing IL-2 in a mouse model of total body irradiation will be determined. The intellectual merit stems from the body of knowledge that the proposed work seeks to generate. Upon completion of the proposed research, we expect to have vertically advanced microbial-based technology by providing an alternative strategy to quickly and reliably assess the persistence, stability, and safe delivery of a synthetic community capable of impacting microbiomes relevant to human health. Finally, the proposed project is a transformative education model that will engage students and faculty from underrepresented groups. It will promote activities to help students develop new technical skills, participate in conferences, craft their professional development plan, and help 9-12 and undergraduate students embrace the STEM career.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important quality control step in the flow of genetic information is to eliminate faulty and/or foreign messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules so that proteins that may be harmful to the cell are not produced. One of the ways that cells can identify faulty RNAs is by sensing the length of the sequence within an RNA that encodes for a protein versus not. While this mechanism works well in simple organisms such as yeast, the human genome has evolved to have naturally long regions of mRNAs that do not encode for a protein but serve regulatory purposes. How then does the cell know to not degrade such normal transcripts and yet identify potentially toxic RNAs that arise from mutated genes or viral genomes? This project will leverage evolutionary analysis, molecular biology, and genomics tools to identify and understand signals that could allow physiological RNAs that resemble aberrant RNAs to escape quality control. The project will also promote broader societal impacts by engaging 8th- and 9th-grade students in a local school in hands-on research to facilitate their training and exposure to scientific research. <br/><br/>Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is a quality control process that degrades transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTC) to prevent the production of toxic truncated proteins. NMD senses aberrant transcripts either via the presence of exon junction complexes (EJCs) downstream of the terminating ribosome or via the long 3? untranslated region (UTR) generated by premature termination. Many non-aberrant endogenous transcripts and certain viral transcripts also mimic PTC-containing transcripts by virtue of possessing long 3? UTRs and are also targeted by NMD. However, through the course of evolution, several transcripts with long UTRs, both viral and endogenous, have evolved mechanisms to bypass NMD by antagonizing the central NMD factor, UPF1. In this project, natural NMD evasion mechanisms will be investigated for novel insights into this fundamental quality control mechanism. The goals are to identify mechanisms of endogenous and viral bypass of long UTR NMD (Aim 1), determine the role of a mammal-specific UPF1 isoform in the arms race between NMD and its targets through experimental evolution in human and drosophila cells (Aim 2), and engage 8th-9th grade students from a local school in investigating the cross-regulation of different UPF1 paralogs and viral antagonists in yeast (Aim 3).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project further develops two curve counting techniques, the ""logarithmic gauged linear sigma model"" (log GLSM) and ""quasimaps"", and their combination, with the goal of making progress on challenging conjectures from physics, which have appeared out of reach of mathematicians until recently. This project will offer ample training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs.

In addition, effective invariants, which are a major ingredient of the localization formula, will be studied. In a different direction, the PI will explore applications of log GLSM to the tautological ring, to establish structural predictions observed in physics, such as the ""conifold gap condition"", for the quintic threefold and other one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to establish the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence for quintic threefolds in all genera. With regard to quasi-maps, the second main technique employed in this project, the PI will use quasi-maps for explicit computations of Gromov-Witten invariants of non-convex complete intersections. Quasi-maps appear necessary for approaching some of the more mysterious predictions from physics, and hence log GLSM will be extended to allow for quasi-maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, speakers may elaborate on what they just said, provide an explanation, or connect multiple events through narration. These connections form what are known as rhetorical or discourse relations between utterances and have been studied using multiple theories and frameworks. Each one has proposed its own set of names for these relations and ways of classifying them, but there has not yet been a study that investigates which categories people actually perceive. It is also very hard to identify these relations, both for humans and computational systems. In this doctoral dissertation project, researchers investigate how many and what relations English speakers perceive without presupposing any list of discourse relations. Along with training of a doctoral student, this project collects data that will improve our understanding of how speakers perceive and categorize discourse relations, which can be used to improve computational systems such as dialogue agents and writing assistants.<br/> <br/>This project approaches the study of discourse relations from a semantic categorization perspective, whereby categories of discourse relations are inferred based on similarity perceived by English speakers.

Together, this project develops a taxonomy of discourse relations suitable for spoken conversational data based on empirical research, compares how discourse relations are conceptualized by English speakers to existing taxonomies of discourse relations, and builds a dataset of discourse relations in spontaneous conversations that analyzes variation and individual differences among speakers, and that can also be used as input or training data to computational systems or other applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI will address these issues by leveraging a novel theoretical framework known as the entanglement bootstrap program, which was pioneered by the PI. This theoretical framework will lead to the development of efficient methods to identify and characterize strongly entangled phases of matter in experiments and in many-body simulations on classical computers.

First, the PI will discover the topological invariants that can characterize many-body quantum phases.

This is why electronic devices are engineered to shed heat and reduce the temperature under operation. This problem is critical at the nanoscale, where it is necessary to control thermal conduction at boundaries between different materials and components. Consider two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, which have shown great promise. These consist of layers of atoms that are tightly bound in the plane and weakly bound between layers. If heat cannot be efficiently transported between layers, there would be significant limits to the use of 2D materials in next generation electronics. On the other hand, a strong thermal boundary could provide the potential for remarkable materials with thermal isolation better than air. The need to understand and control thermal boundary conductance at 2D-2D interfaces and between 2D and bulk materials motivates this project. Investigators will manipulate the thermal properties of 2D materials through changes in their interface structure and chemistry. Investigators will study how to control physical coupling and the effect of novel heat transfer mechanisms. An integral part of this project will be to develop experiential education programs for underrepresented students at the University of Texas at Dallas, the Carnegie Institute of Washington, and local high schools and community colleges. The researchers will work with local museums to develop new artwork conservation programs using optical techniques such as Raman spectroscopy.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>A major gap in the present knowledge of thermal boundary conductance (TBC) is how it can be manipulated by changing the structure of 2D-2D and 2D-bulk interfaces. As these interfaces are often set when the sample is fabricated, only a subset of structure-property relationships has been investigated, and often across disparate samples subject to the variation common to 2D materials. This project is applying extreme pressure within a diamond anvil cell as a new technique for broadly changing the structure of the same interface while measuring the TBC. This is allowing researchers to decode fundamental knowledge on the structure-property relationships for the TBC while also gaining insights into practical pathways for manipulating the thermal properties of 2D materials and thermal limitations of 2D devices. Specific structural and chemical changes at the interface include (1) the increase of physical coupling, (2) the transition from nonbonded to bonded chemistry, and (3) the onset of new phononic and nonphononic heat transfer mechanisms. Raman spectroscopy at optical wavelengths is being used to simultaneously characterize the interface and measure the TBC. The measurements are backed by first-principles modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to the TBC, these models are allowing researchers to identify renormalizations of the phonon dispersion and scattering, which can affect many phonon-limited areas of energy transport and conversion in 2D materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because these traits often lead to trade-offs that affect reproductive success and survival, understanding them is a fundamental question in biology. Leopard seals are large predators in the Southern Ocean and an extreme example of female-biased size dimorphism in mammals, where females are the larger than males. This project will investigate the causes and consequences of the size differences in leopard seals and will generate new data on the life history, reproductive physiology, and breeding biology of this important and difficult to study polar predator. The information is critical for understanding leopard seals? past, present, and future?from how the species evolved to predicting their resilience to environmental variation. The project also has a strong education component. It aims to increase polar biology research participation by training, mentoring, and supporting two postdocs, two grad students, and 25+ undergraduates. It will also engage students and the public in scientific research through outreach activities at local, national, and international scales.<br/><br/>Trait differences can lead to important trade-offs that affect biological processes at multiple scales, from intraspecific differences in fitness to species-level life history strategies. Leopard seals exhibit an extreme form of female-biased size dimorphism. However, for solitary, wide-ranging polar species like leopard seals, it is difficult to study their life history and reproductive biology. As a result, it is unknown how leopard seals? size dimorphism relates to other aspects of their biology. The goal of this project is to examine fitness trade-offs associated with female-biased dimorphism in leopard seals. Specifically, this study will (1) assess differences in male and female morphology and life history, (2) compare reproductive physiology between males and females, (3) investigate their breeding behavior and reproductive activities, and (4) conduct a cross-clade synthesis of female-biased dimorphism in mammals. The team will analyze existing specimens from biological collections and conduct field efforts to generate novel, complementary data. This information is critical for understanding how leopard seals evolved to survive and persist in the variable environment of the Southern Ocean. The research aligns with NSF?s Strategic Vision for Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research and supports ongoing efforts to create and utilize open polar research software, as well as data and sample reuse in polar research. This project relies on strong collaborations across academia, non-profits, and government institutions worldwide, and the results will be broadly shared with global audiences. <br/><br/>As a CAREER award, this project has a strong polar education component that includes developing a research-intensive undergrad course (SEAL Lab) and providing graduate students and postdocs with hands-on leadership and mentoring experiences.

For example, biosensors operate at the interface between living matter and electronics. Hybrid perovskites with organic and inorganic components have shown great promise for high efficiency and low-cost solar cells. Hybrid materials consisting of alternating layers of organic and inorganic species linked by metal ions have shown promise for device applications. By varying the species and their interactions, it may be possible to tune the electronic and optical properties for a given application. Despite the importance of interfaces in these materials, there are fundamental questions about how the spacing, bonding, and orientation of molecules affect the properties of these metal ion linked multilayers. The goal of this research is to determine the structure of the multilayer assemblies and how that structure dictates their performance. Investigators will elucidate the properties of these structures by studying how polarized light is absorbed and emitted, combined with vibrational spectroscopy that detect oscillations of bound atoms. These studies will enable the rational design of structured multilayers with targeted properties for improved performance in solar cells, catalysis, sensing, and more.

While distinct in their outcomes/goals, most hybrid devices rely on interfacial electron and energy transfer which in turn are dependent on the molecular level structure of the interface (i.e., the distance, bonding, and orientation between molecules). Unfortunately, that structure is largely unknown. The goal of the research here is to 1) use a combination of polarized attenuated total reflectance (p-ATR), emission anisotropy, Raman, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the structure of multilayer assemblies, 2) understand how the metal ion and binding motif impact the multilayer structure and performance in photon upconversion solar cells, and 3) transfer knowledge of the technique and build a p-ATR instrument in the FSU Spectroscopy Lab user facility for use by the greater research community.

For example, electric cars are still not as practical as gasoline cars because, among other issues, they are difficult to recharge in short times. To improve this, new materials need to be developed since the currently used materials in LIB are already close to their maximum capabilities. This research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, focuses on designing and synthesizing materials and elucidating structure-property trends that may lead to insights on how to improve the capacity of batteries. The project combines computational approaches with modern materials chemistry experiments to develop nanoscale materials, one hundred times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, with increased electron transport capabilities. The principal investigators make use of computational fundamental science to guide experiments and therefore virtual testing of a wide variety of materials, reducing the cost of testing and trial-and-error to reasonable budgets. Since batteries are used in all areas of human activities, it is difficult to imagine any activity in our society where remote electricity would not be beneficial. Additionally, the projects supports efforts to increase diversity and train the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, researchers at the University of Cincinnati and Texas A&M, investigate the design and synthesis of hybrid electrode materials that combine carbon nanomaterials and copper metallic surfaces to create an efficient and robust pathway for electron transport. To facilitate the understanding and quantification of electron transport at the interface, the team employs open-ended carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attached to a bulk copper substrate using stable linker molecules. The CNTs are oriented vertically compared to the Cu substrate, and only the ends of the CNTs are connected to Cu atoms. The research combines ab initio analysis, synthesis, and characterization studies. With the aim of impedance matching at the interface the team studies the materials as anodes for Li batteries, investigates energy storage performance and dendrite formation in the context of computational and experimental structure-property correlations. The results of this research could pave the way for more efficient batteries, new sensors, new catalysts, and new biodevices. Additionally, the multidisciplinary project provides experiential opportunities for the next generation of scientists. The principal investigators encourage diversity and actively motivate more minorities to pursue college and specialize in fields of science and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, input from people will be incorporated into the learning framework to bias the learning in the form of both offline (before training) and online (during training) feedback. This approach is innovative in terms of three fundamental components of the learning problem agent: the environment, the agent?s representation, and the learning pipeline. The investigator will first develop generative models to learn from images collected from people and to create diverse interactive environments for the learning agent from them. The investigator will then focus on interpreting the internal representation learned by the autonomous agent. Lastly, the investigator will incorporate feedback obtained from online interactions with people to ensure that the resulting AI is safe and aligned with human preferences. The education objective of the project is to connect faculty and students from computer science, engineering, neuroscience, and social sciences by teaching AI as an interdisciplinary subject. The investigator will leverage the project?s interpretability framework to help students understand the AI's inner workings and use the interactive learning methods through simulation environments to create immersive educational experiences and motivate students from diverse backgrounds to learn the underlying mathematical principles between autonomous agents.<br/><br/>This research focuses on incorporating humans into three foundational components of learning an embodied agent: the environment, the agent representation, and the learning process: (1) Environment: The investigator will design a machine-learning model to generate and simulate diverse environments from human experiences. It will significantly improve the diversity and complexity of the training environments such that the trained agent can better generalize its acquired skills to unseen situations. (2) Agent representation: The investigator will interpret the learned representation of the embodied agent and discover interpretable motion primitives so that humans can comprehend the AI's internals and control the AI's behaviors in challenging unseen scenarios. (3) Learning process: The investigator will develop reward-free learning and adaptation methods to incorporate active human feedback, substantially improving AI alignment and safety.

Touchscreen phones and car dashboards demand visual attention, putting people's safety at risk. Virtual environments neglect or diminish users' abilities to grasp and move objects, impacting dexterity. The emerging immersive education and work training opportunities largely exclude blind and low-vision users. Finally, the fact that telecommunication (for example, calling family to check in) lacks social touch and a sense of co-presence leads to anxiety and depression over time. Advances in programmable touch technology, known as haptic technology, can offer a future free of these challenges, but experienced haptic designers are few, and becoming an expert in haptics takes years of practice. The main question in haptic design remains: ""How can I convey the desired meaning to users through touch?"" It is surprisingly difficult to design vibration signals that can evoke relevant meanings in users' minds and are easy to distinguish from one another. Currently, creating such signals relies on trial-and-error exploration of engineering parameters and extensive user testing. This inefficient process discourages domain-expert designers (car manufacturers, accessibility experts, educators, therapists, and the like) from including haptics in their applications. To address this barrier to using haptics, this project will democratize vibration design by investigating how humans interpret and distinguish vibration signals. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project will develop models that predict how people (1) describe a signal's meaning with natural language and (2) perceive the similarity of signals. Next, the investigator and her team will (3) build haptic authoring tools that interleave these models with designer input to help quickly converge on plausible haptic signals for an application. The investigator team will then study the tools' impact on enabling designers to achieve their creative visions. This project will focus on three vibrotactile technologies that target receptors in our hands and offer the widest range of contact and contactless vibrotactile feedback: mechanical vibration actuators, surface electrovibration devices, and mid-air ultrasound haptics. In contrast to previous studies that rely on signals with a few controlled parameters, this research will model the human processing of complex signals created by human designers. The outcomes of this research will pioneer the development of a new class of sensory language models, reveal generalizable trends in human vibrotactile perception and language across three technologies, and identify specific opportunities for haptic tools and residency programs to scaffold learning and collaboration for interdisciplinary haptic design teams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, our world was recently turned upside down by an RNA virus, which was then partially contained by an RNA vaccine. Contrary to common wisdom, RNA is not just an intermediate ?messenger? between the more well-known DNA and protein, but it can also have profound biological functions such as controlling gene expression. These functions are determined by RNA structures (the ?shapes? of the RNAs), and therefore accurate modeling of these structures is critical for understanding RNA functions and for designing vaccines, test kits, and drugs. However, existing experimental methods for determining RNA structure are extremely expensive and often limited to short sequences, and existing computational tools are rather slow and not completely accurate. This slowness hinders their applications to full-length viral genomes such as coronavirus (about 30,000 nucleotides or ?letters?). Therefore, there is a critical need to develop better computational methods to predict RNA structures that are more accurate and more efficient and scalable to longer sequences such as whole genomes. Advances in this direction could improve our understanding of RNA viruses (which include common cold, influenza, Rabies, HIV, Ebola, polio, measles, and more) and increase our readiness to fight the next pandemic.<br/><br/>This project develops efficient algorithms for predicting the structures of multiple related (?homologous?) RNA sequences such as SARS-CoV-2 variants. These algorithms will scale linearly in both the average sequence length and the number of sequences. This linear scaling will enable whole genome applications. The researchers aim to achieve these goals with ideas from two branches of artificial intelligence (AI): natural language processing and deep learning. Specifically, this project will improve three types of homologous folding algorithms and adapt them to structure discovery: (1) align-then-fold: first align the homologous sequences and then predict the consensus structure for the aligned sequences; (2) iteratively align-and-fold: iterate between sequence alignment and structure prediction; and (3) simultaneous align-and-fold: jointly predict alignment and structures. The team will adapt these fast methods to discover conserved structures using global structure prediction for RNA viral genomes and transcripts. This research will make it possible to discover new RNA structures and functions, and will help the design of vaccines, test kits, and drugs.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Divisions of Information and Intelligent Systems and of Chemistry and the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods Program in the Division of Chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent years have witnessed several empirical successes of RL, such as RL agents that outperform humans in video and board games. However, many empirical RL algorithms today often require many training examples to learn and can produce unreliable solutions (solutions that exhibit catastrophic failures, for example). While these issues are typically not problematic when training RL agents in simulators, they pose significant difficulties when deploying RL to real-world problems where data (including human feedback) is expensive, and reliability is essential. The main novelty of this project will be the development of new RL algorithms that can learn efficiently (from as few training data points as possible) and reliably (avoid catastrophic failures with high probability). The development of such RL algorithms can expand the applications of RL systems from simulation to real-world applications where data is expensive to collect and safety is critical. In autonomous driving, the developed technologies can make self-driving cars adapt to new road conditions safely by making fewer mistakes. In generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), efficient and reliable RL algorithms that can learn from rich human feedback will enable better human-AI alignment, making AI systems improve reliably and safely under human guidance.<br/><br/>The main research goal of this project is to enable real-world RL by advancing RL techniques, theoretically and empirically. The critical innovation in the project is to develop safe and efficient RL algorithms by leveraging specific problem structures and rich human feedback. The project has three main thrusts. First, the project will establish risk-averse RL algorithms that are provably correct and scalable to high dimensional data. Second, the project will develop RL algorithms that can leverage common problem-specific structures for improved sample efficiency. Third, the project will create new algorithms for RL with rich feedback beyond scalar rewards (including preference-based feedback and positive demonstrations). In addition to the proposed work on algorithmic advancements, the project will focus on their deployment to real-world problems, including database query optimization and optimizing generative models such as Large Language Models and Diffusion Models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign makes observations of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), the layer of the atmosphere from roughly 14km to 18km between the tropical troposphere and stratosphere, using balloons designed to float at a constant altitude for flights of up to 3 months.  The balloons are launched from the Seychelles and float around the equator just above the top of the TTL or in the lower stratosphere at an altitude near 20km.  Strateole-2 was planned as a set of three deployments, a preliminary engineering deployment with 8 balloon flights followed by two science deployments with 20 flights each. The first two deployments took place in 2019 and 2021 and funds for the PIs' participation in these deployments were provided through AGS-1642277.  The third deployment is scheduled to begin in October 2025.<br/><br/>Funds provided here support the development and deployment of a new instrument with the acronym RATS, for Reel-down Atmospheric Temperature Sensor.  Roughly speaking RATS is a thermometer lowered on a long tether below a balloon gondola which contains a second thermometer. The difference in temperature between the two thermometers can be used to detect gravity waves, atmospheric waves similar to ocean surface waves only they can propagate vertically as well as horizontally. RATS can detect gravity waves because the up and down motions of the waves cause cooling and warming, thus the difference in temperature between two appropriately separated thermometers can record the passage of a wave. The title of the proposal refers to the use of the RATS thermometers for the Characterization of Atmospheric Tropical waves of the lower Stratosphere (CATS).<br/><br/>Motivation for the work comes from the role of gravity waves in driving the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), the reversal in zonal wind direction over the equator that begins in the upper stratosphere and descends to the tropopause over a period slightly longer than two years.  The QBO matters for subseasonal weather prediction because it has been linked to modes of climate variability that influence weather around the world.  Models used for weather prediction have difficulty capturing the QBO, in part because the waves that drive it have wavelengths that are smaller than typical model grid spacings, particularly in the vertical.  RATS can detect waves with vertical wavelengths between 2 and 30 times the distance between the two thermometers, which is set to either 200m or 300m to capture wavelengths from 400m to 6km or 600m to 9km.  The longer wavelengths can be resolved by operational models and thus compared with the model output while the shorter ones are unresolved.<br/><br/>The award covers the development of the RATS hardware, which includes a Lower Measuring Unit (LMU) containing a thermometer (developed by CNES) along with an RS41 radiosonde sensor module (from Vaisala) to measures temperature, humidity, and pressure, and a GPS receiver for determining position.  The LMU is raised and lowered using a spool and pulley system that allows it to be docked to the gondola for launch and reeled down when the balloon reaches its flight altitude.  The gondola contains a second thermometer along with a barometer and GPS receiver.<br/><br/>The work is of societal interest given the prospects for better long-range weather predictions through improved representation of the wave driving of the QBO. The Strateole-2 field campaign involves collaborations with two operational weather prediction centers, thereby providing a connection from research to operations.  All field campaign data is made available to the global research community to pursue additional research topics on TTL physics and dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, more than 90% of DHH children in the US have hearing parents who do not know a sign language at the time of their DHH child?s birth. By the time these children are school-age, only 26% are using sign language regularly with their families at home and 53% are using some sign language at school. Consequently, a substantial number of DHH people are learning a sign language for the first time as young adults. Despite being one of the most common ways for DHH people to learn a sign language, researchers know very little about the factors that support second language learning success in this learning context. For example, proficiency in the first language and working memory are predictors of second language proficiency in other language learning contexts--are these predictors also important for DHH learners? Additionally, the quality and quantity of early language input that DHH people receive is highly variable--does this variation affect second language learning of a sign language?<br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation study aims to (1) extend existing research on predictors of second language proficiency to a new learning context, DHH second language signers, and (2) investigate relationships between spoken first language proficiency, non-verbal working memory, and signed second language proficiency. This research conducts a mediation modeling study assessing spoken language reading comprehension and non-verbal working memory in DHH people who grew up using a spoken language as a primary language and started learning a sign language as young adults and investigate how these variables relate to sign language receptive comprehension. The results of this study will lead to more generalizable theories of second language learning that account for variability in the quality and quantity of early first language acquisition. The results also inform family and school language policy for DHH children as well as second language teaching curriculum and interpreting strategies for adult DHH second language signers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One among these professional societies includes the Society for the Advancement in Biology Education Research (SABER), a leading premier international society with a primary focus on undergraduate biology education research. Scholarship related to this organization impacts every undergraduate biology learning environment. Additionally, members of this organization are also members of other professional societies, which makes SABER a critical lever for advancing systemic changes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion across various biology sub-fields and thus, helping to exert a larger impact on undergraduate biology education. <br/><br/>SABER since its inception and as exemplified by a self-study in 2019, has struggled with issues of diversity and representation at every level of its organizational structure, including key leadership positions. This aspect directly impacts the culture and climate of this society which ultimately affects the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts related to undergraduate biology education. Despite significant changes in its organizational structure, a concerted effort is needed to institute a permanent change related to equity and inclusion. This project aims to enact sustainable change by including diverse perspectives and voices to fundamentally change the culture of the organization and implement initiatives that promote an environment to enable cultural change. The goals of this project are as follows: (1) broadly and systematically advertise and recruit for SABER to broaden its reach to organizations, institutions, and individuals who are not currently aware of SABER, (2) offer travel support for individuals that are members of groups typically underrepresented in biology or who work at historically black colleges and universities and other minority serving institutions to attend the national meeting, (3) offer mentorship related to inclusion to individuals in leadership positions at SABER, and (4) develop networking, mentoring, and leadership opportunities to sustain the involvement of diverse members within SABER. We posit that increasing the number and including the perspectives of underrepresented scientists within SABER will enable a shift in the culture of this society to help advance inclusion by (1) creating welcoming spaces that foster an enhanced sense of belonging and professional growth of diverse individuals, (2) creating a supportive environment for members by developing and empowering environmental stewards within the SABER leadership and by offering them travel support and mentoring activities, and (3) introducing structural changes that will ultimately affect the culture and climate of SABER as an organization to create pathways that diversify the society?s leadership for diverse individuals.

The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics. The AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. This is the first time the AFW will meet in Oklahoma where many experts on automorphic forms and closely related topics are nearby. Thus, in addition to attracting speakers who participate annually, the workshop is likely to draw a mix of new attendees who will contribute new perspectives and energy and benefit from the workshop.  The workshop is known for its inclusive, encouraging atmosphere, particularly to early career researchers and to those from underrepresented groups in the number theory community. The workshop has traditionally been a fruitful place for these researchers to connect with potential collaborators and mentors at other institutions, working on related topics. To help achieve this goal, the 2024 AFW will feature five expository talks on various fundamental topics in the theory of automorphic forms, aimed at the graduate student level. There will also be two panel discussions focused on mathematical career questions.<br/> <br/>Automorphic forms play a central role in number theory, being integral to the proofs of many groundbreaking theorems, including Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor),  Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal).  Automorphic forms are the subject of many important ongoing conjectures, among them the Langlands program, connections to random matrix theory, and the generalized Riemann hypothesis.

DSC is an extremely powerful tool for drug discovery that has low adoption due to high costs and low throughput of only one sample every two hours. The power of DSC is the thermodynamic measurements, which do not require any prior specific knowledge of the molecules being studied and do not require any labels. By not requiring any specific knowledge, it is possible to screen a wider variety and a higher quantity of compounds in the search for new drug molecules. The instrument to be developed from this project will be capable of processing 24 to 96 samples every two hours, thereby making DSC-based drug discovery commercially viable. Innovations from this project will also reduce the cost of producing DSC instruments, making them widely accessible for research and educational purposes. An added benefit of the reduced costs is the potential also to be utilized as a teaching tool. The combination of unique drug discovery knowledge and low costs will serve to reduce the costs associated with discovering and analyzing potential new drug molecules.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project comprises the research and development activities required to produce a high-throughput differential scanning calorimeter. A unique feature of the proposed instrument is the utilization of single-use, sterile sample cartridges that can hold 24 to 96 samples. These cartridges will enable high-throughput sample processing compared to currently available instruments. Current instruments use sensors and heaters that are permanently attached to the sample cells. This project will address the technical challenges associated with using non-permanently attached sensors and heaters to enable a sample cartridge that can be inserted and removed from the instrument. Activities of this project will identify optimal materials and components and determine the layout of sample cells to maximize the number of sample cells in each cartridge. These activities will minimize risks associated with producing a production-ready instrument and deliver maximum customer benefit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology is well-suited for diseases that affect mucosal tissues such as the eyes, nose, and gastrointestinal and female reproductive tracts. Gene therapies hold promise in slowing the progression and potentially curing a wide range of diseases affecting these tissues. By minimizing exposure to healthy tissues, this technology can improve patient safety and reduce the strain on healthcare resources that are often required to manage treatment-related complications.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a biomaterial system which can be administered in a liquid form and, upon contact on the target tissue, rapidly transforms into a hydrogel capable of adhering to wet mucosal tissues. Owing to the potency of gene therapies and their utility in the treatment of a wide range of diseases, this hydrogel delivery system will be used as a therapeutic depot to deliver gene therapies to the diseased site. This innovation offers several advantages over conventional drug and gene therapies: local delivery avoids interactions with proteins and enzymes present in the blood stream that can render gene therapies ineffective when delivered intravenously and delivering the therapeutic payload directly to the affected tissue minimizes systemic exposure and associated side effects, reducing the risk of complications. Gene therapy itself is an attractive therapeutic modality as multiple disease-modifying targets can be addressed simultaneously for more effective disease management. Gene therapy can also significantly lower the frequency of drug administrations over a patient?s lifetime compared to conventional small molecule (e.g. steroids and antibiotics) and biologic (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) drugs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is critical information for users of the language to communicate, but previous research has not identified where such grammatical marking of arguments comes from in language. Children exposed to an established language acquire the language specific grammar at a young age, but what happens when children are not exposed to a language with this grammar? Around 95% of deaf children around the world are born into hearing families who do not sign. Age of first exposure to language for these individuals varies widely and often occurs in educational settings, if at all. When deaf children are gathered without access to a sign language, the communication system they develop will become a new sign language over generations of users. This doctoral dissertation project examines the effects of age of exposure and age of language on the development of argument structure by looking at the development of word order as grammatical marking in three sign languages of various ages. Two of the three sign languages have not been documented previously and are less than 40 years old. Along with training of a doctoral student, this project will engage underrepresented individuals in scientific research and raise public awareness about emerging sign languages.<br/><br/>The three studies use video recordings of sign language users describing pictures. The stimuli are carefully controlled to include different event types and both animate and inanimate arguments. Recordings are annotated for word order and any other potential grammatical devices used by the signers. Statistical analyses are used to determine how age of language exposure impacts the use of these grammatical devices in each of the three languages. Furthermore, differences between groups in the studies of this dissertation highlight interacting effects of both age of the emerging language and the age at which children enter the signing community on argument ordering. By looking at these factors in these unique situations, this project adds to the scientific understanding of the origins of argument ordering in language and the role of early access to language in that process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conventional optical components currently used in AR smart glasses cause the digital content to appear translucent and, hence, lack realism.  The proposed work is on developing a display technology that controls per-pixel transparency in the virtual image plane, virtual objects, and 3D holograms for black color. The blocking of light for black-colored parts in a hologram can show as realistic physical objects over the background reality. Using this approach, each display pixel can be made black, semi-transparent, or transparent at a user?s will, making visibility of digital content possible even in direct sun-lit environments.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes a holistic display solution for AR smart glasses that consists of three key elements: a spatially-multiplexed Total Internal Reflection?based subtractive-waveguide combiner; a single photo-reflective spatial light modulator (SLM) that is illuminated by two spatially-multiplexed illuminants; and a temporal multiplexing algorithm whereby the two spatially-multiplexed illuminants can be selectively modulated by the SLM during their dedicated sub-frame times. Since pixel-wise transparency control allows hard-edge occlusion, hence the proposed smart spatiotemporal multiplexed approach enables a single display that achieves pixel-wise hard-edge occlusion using only a single silicon display panel, thereby reducing cost and complexity while increasing see-through efficiency and battery life performance. These technological improvements are industry firsts and together allow for addressing a market need for AR devices for outdoor well-lit scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This simulation data will be pre-computed for all locations within the Electronic Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power grid, enabling planners and investors to quickly model the probabilistic impact of different renewable energy capacity pathways and different electrification trends.

Instead, this project will research an innovative combination of statistical simulation with artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging the strengths of each to compensate for the weaknesses of the other. For example, statistical simulation models are precise but do not scale, while AI simulation models can scale almost without limit but are not precise. The project research will investigate a new method to impose precision (via known statistics) on AI pattern generation, yielding a high-fidelity climate model at scale. The expected technical result of the project is the creation of a simulation engine that can simulate 1,000 outcomes of hyperlocal hourly weather over the state of Texas--with accuracy similar to a pure-statistics model benchmark while keeping the cost of cloud computing resources low.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues.

In the developing nervous systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, neurons express a wide diversity of cell adhesion molecules, which mediate interactions that are essential for specifying target selection and connectivity patterns. This proposal will study the molecular control of circuit development through a combination of genetic and biophysical approaches in which binding affinities and cell surface localization of cell adhesion molecules are manipulated and their effects on neural circuit formation are studied in the larva fruit fly. The proposed research will have a significant impact on multiple research fields due to the generality of the phenomena to be studied. Moreover, integrating computational and structural biology with developmental neuroscience is likely to stimulate similar collaborative efforts in these fields. In terms of training, students and postdocs working on this project will develop a deep appreciation of both computational and experimental work, thus providing exemplars for broadly trained interdisciplinary scientists. Women scientists constitute over 50% of the participating groups. The research program includes training of high school and undergraduate students, many of whom are from underrepresented minorities in sciences, through summer internships. The team will continue partnering with a network of high schools across lower-income districts and minority serving colleges, and run the DREAM-High cloud computing course for high school students that increases student awareness of and interest in biological sciences, empowers students to adopt scientific reasoning and critical-thinking skills, and inspires students to seek post-secondary education in related fields.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of binding affinity and cell surface availability of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on circuit formation in Drosophila. The study will focus on the larval neuromuscular system and mushroom body development. At the molecular level, the focus will be on two interacting groups of CAMs, the Dprs (Defective in Proboscis extension Response) and the DIPs (Dpr Interacting Proteins). The choice of these proteins and anatomical structures is based on the deep understanding of the biophysical properties of DIPs and Dprs that has emerged over the past few years, and on the demonstration of their crucial roles in the development of these anatomical structures. Here, by examining various Dpr/DIP cognate pairs in different neurodevelopmental settings, the findings should deepen currently limited knowledge of the in vivo consequences of altering avidity using both changes in binding affinities and in expression levels. A particular focus will be on the phenomenon of cis inhibition, whereby interactions between cognate binding partners on the same cell compete with trans binding to partners on apposed cells.

However, most professional societies grapple with issues related to lack of representation and inclusion of members of demographic groups that have historically been underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and career paths. One among these professional societies includes the Society for the Advancement in Biology Education Research (SABER), a leading premier international society with a primary focus on undergraduate biology education research. Scholarship related to this organization impacts every undergraduate biology learning environment. Additionally, members of this organization are also members of other professional societies, which makes SABER a critical lever for advancing systemic changes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion across various biology sub-fields and thus, helping to exert a larger impact on undergraduate biology education. <br/><br/>SABER since its inception and as exemplified by a self-study in 2019, has struggled with issues of diversity and representation at every level of its organizational structure, including key leadership positions. This aspect directly impacts the culture and climate of this society which ultimately affects the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts related to undergraduate biology education. Despite significant changes in its organizational structure, a concerted effort is needed to institute a permanent change related to equity and inclusion. This project aims to enact sustainable change by including diverse perspectives and voices to fundamentally change the culture of the organization and implement initiatives that promote an environment to enable cultural change.

This megadrought is an ongoing climate crisis that is severely impacting natural ecosystems, managed forests, agricultural systems, and human water resources. Despite such serious consequences, our understanding of the megadrought is quite limited. Specifically, the research community lacks a comprehensive understanding of how the megadrought has impacted soil moisture, particularly the deeper moisture pools that are critical for vegetation health. There is also a limited understanding of how carbon and water cycling have changed over the last 23 years; an important indicator of ecosystem function that mediates global climate feedbacks. This research enhances our ecological understanding of how drylands have been impacted by the megadrought, which sets the stage for a more predictive understanding of future climate change impacts. This knowledge is transferable to other dryland and non-dryland biomes, as such megadroughts are projected to increase in frequency and severity globally in the coming decades. <br/><br/>To accomplish these aims, the research combines hundreds of long-running soil moisture depth profiles with remotely-sensed estimates of shallow soil moisture, deep water availability, and groundwater. These data allow us to assess the impacts of the megadrought on plant-available water, and serve as a crucial validation of these remotely-sensed products for drought monitoring. Data from 21 eddy covariance towers are paired with a new gridded dataset of empirically-modeled ecosystem fluxes to uncover the drivers of dryland ecosystem function, and quantify the impact of the megadrought on carbon-water fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolutions. By synthesizing these data sources their unique strengths are leveraged; addressing detailed mechanistic questions with in situ data, and examining broad trends in carbon-water cycling using modeled and remotely-sensed data. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Ecosystem Science and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most professional societies grapple with issues related to lack of representation and inclusion of members of demographic groups that have historically been underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and career paths. One among these professional societies includes the Society for the Advancement in Biology Education Research (SABER), a leading premier international society with a primary focus on undergraduate biology education research. Scholarship related to this organization impacts every undergraduate biology learning environment. Additionally, members of this organization are also members of other professional societies, which makes SABER a critical lever for advancing systemic changes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion across various biology sub-fields and thus, helping to exert a larger impact on undergraduate biology education. <br/><br/>SABER since its inception and as exemplified by a self-study in 2019, has struggled with issues of diversity and representation at every level of its organizational structure, including key leadership positions. This aspect directly impacts the culture and climate of this society which ultimately affects the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts related to undergraduate biology education. Despite significant changes in its organizational structure, a concerted effort is needed to institute a permanent change related to equity and inclusion.

Recent technological advancements have enabled the development of therapeutic mRNAs that can be delivered to humans, notably evident in widely used vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. The success of these therapeutics suggests the potential of new generations of mRNA medicines with applications beyond vaccines, such as anti- cancer therapies and treatment for genetic disorders. Realizing these goals will require the design of mRNAs that optimize protein expression and can be customized for specific tissues and cellular environments. The goal of this project is to leverage a strategy for quantifying the translation functions of synthetic libraries of thousands of RNAs to discover features that modify the timing and quantity of protein production. Insights into these fundamental rules for gene expression will be important building blocks for engineering new classes of mRNA therapeutics to address a broader spectrum of human disease, thus advancing RNA biotechnology. The project will also provide training opportunities for postdoctoral scholars and engage middle and high school students in RNA biology.<br/><br/>The quantity of protein synthesized from an mRNA can span more than two orders of magnitude, vary across cell types, and rapidly change in response to cellular signals. The features of mRNAs that determine this range of expression remain largely unknown. Possibilities include sequence motifs recognized by RNA-binding proteins, structured RNA elements and nucleotide modifications that affect the translation process. This project will employ a recently developed massively parallel reporter assay to systematically identify features of thousands of human and viral 5? UTRs that determine the amount and timing of protein production. Aim 1 will examine the translation functions of diverse classes of nucleotide modifications and identify the molecular mechanisms that recognize them. Aim 2 will quantify protein production from a synthetic library of circular RNAs to identify RNA elements capable of accessing mechanisms for non-canonical translation initiation. Aim 3 will identify features of mRNAs that determine cell-type specific expression and the mechanisms that establish this specificity. These efforts will provide a comprehensive understanding of mRNA- encoded determinants of translation, providing insights into basic determinants of gene expression and guiding the design of new mRNA therapeutics.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Genetic Mechanisms program/Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Relatively few undergraduate research programs have specifically targeted FG students. Participants will work on a research project with a faculty mentor, and participate in workshops focusing on research skills, current research topics, and how to apply for graduate school and jobs. Additionally, the program experience will also include participation in a learning community where program participants can work together, exchange ideas, and use shared resources. Participants will be strongly encouraged to present their research findings and experiences at regional and national level conferences. They will also attend a hands-on workshop to learn about machine learning and design/build a working model of an automated system. It is expected that these experiences will prepare FG students for success in graduate school and/or in careers related to problem-solving and machine learning.<br/><br/>This project will provide an opportunity to conduct research on intersectional identities and needs of first-generation students who engage in undergraduate research. Although much work has been published on STEM research programs for undergraduate students, as well as on programs to help first generation students be successful in college and in STEM subjects, relatively little work has focused specifically on the needs of FG undergraduate participants in STEM research programs. However, first generation undergraduates who choose to participate in a STEM research program may have different needs and strengths than FG students who do not choose to engage in research. They are also likely different from continuing generation (CG) students who participate in undergraduate research. As a result, the types of support that FG researchers need to be successful may be different from the support needed by FG non-researchers or CG researchers. Expected outcomes include 1) a better understanding of the specific needs of FG undergraduate researchers and how to help them be successful; 2) increases in participants? research and problem-solving skills, knowledge of machine learning as related to research, awareness of research-related careers and how to prepare for them, and increased self-efficacy; 3) acceptance into graduate programs or offers for research-related jobs; 4) publications in research-related journals and conference proceedings; 5) retention and graduation rates for program participants that exceed the average for other first generation students in STEM at their institution.

Both flows are also hypothesized to mediate long-distance biochemical signaling within the plant that coordinate whole-plant function and represent important targets for crop improvement for sustainable agriculture. This project unites expertise on physicochemistry, device engineering, and plant biology to develop new tools for interrogating these processes and new fundamental biophysical and biological understanding of them. Many fundamental questions remain on the physiological mechanisms of operation and functional roles of these transport processes, particularly relative to the phloem and its coupling to the xylem and other tissues: 1) the biophysics of the loading and unloading of sugars, water, and signaling molecules to and from the phloem; 2) the dynamics of phloem transport as a function of biotic (e.g., photosynthetic rate and localized tissue growth) and abiotic (e.g., diurnal variations in water status) processes; and 3) the coordination of these processes at the whole-organism scale. Progress on these topics has been hindered by the lack of experimental tools with which to investigate hypotheses across scales, from local membrane-mediated to system-scale processes, either in vitro or in planta. To address these questions, an international team of researchers in the USA and France will work together to develop the first synthetic system that allows for recapitulation of the full, coupled operation of the xylem and phloem systems to test a diversity of biophysical hypotheses on the mechanisms and function of plant vasculature. The team will also develop new sensors for sensing of vascular transport processes, in-plant; and inform and confront in vitro experiments with biophysical and biochemical experiments in vivo. This effort will provide new insights into the biology and biophysics of plant vascular function and create new tools for basic and applied research by others.<br/><br/>The outcomes of this project will serve the broader community scientifically and technologically by creating new microfluidic devices and functionalities, new tools for in-plant measurement, and new understanding of the fundamentals of whole-plant integration of resources and signals.

These benign viruses introduce RNAs into plants to turn off the genes of pathogens that invade crops, thereby enhancing the ability of the plant to fight off pathogens through a process called virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). This project will use computational approaches, including artificial intelligence methods, to design hairpin shaped RNA structures that, when inserted into the virus genome, will increase the inherent stability of the viral RNA genome or the hairpin?s stability when encountering the enzyme that is responsible for replicating the genome. The VIGS RNAs will, thus, remain intact and capable of silencing the genes of pathogens that invade the plant hosts. This type of RNA therapy has significant impact on the agricultural economy, with direct application to treating, for example, citrus greening, a disease that has significant affected both domestic and foreign production of citrus fruits. In addition, graduate students and postdoctoral trainees will gain experience in working under an academic/private company collaboration.<br/><br/>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) makes use of plus-strand RNA viruses as vectors to exploit natural antiviral defenses (RNA silencing) in plants. Drs. Simon and Gao have determined that thermodynamic features of every viral hairpin contribute to stability of the entire viral genome, and natural hairpin structures reflect the end point of long-term thermodynamic evolution. Thus, hairpins inserted into viral RNA genomes that maintain the thermodynamic properties of endogenous hairpins should be stable. The investigators will extend our understanding of parameters required for stable hairpin design, focusing on features found in the few hairpins that were unstable when inserted into the citrus yellow vein associated-virus (CYVaV). They will investigate whether similar parameters dictate hairpin stability when inserted into unrelated tobacco rattle and citrus tristeza plant viruses. If CYVaV hairpins are not stable in these viruses, we will assess if hairpins that mimic their own hairpins are stable. They will also test the hypothesis that the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible for insert instability due to the inherent lack of fidelity of these polymerases. Additionally, they will determine if non-optimized hairpins introduce new RdRp obstructions to processivity. Rational design will be used to increase the fidelity of the CYVaV RdRp to ascertain if this enhanced property leads to stabilization of previously unstable hairpins. Effect of alterations on the fidelity/processivity of the RdRp will be determined using Nanopore sequencing to assess if there are fewer 5? terminal truncated RNAs and deletion products like defective RNAs, and if unstable hairpin inserts are now stabilized. Finally, to assist other researchers who desire stable inserts in their viruses, they will develop computational methodologies for stable hairpin design, which will require repeated interplay between experimental results and algorithm design software.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Plant Genome Research Program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, one might say ""John is building a house"" for an event that happens over time"" or ""John is crossing the finish line"" for an instantaneous event. Different languages express time in events differently. To talk about ongoing events in English, speakers use the same -ing form in ""John is building a house"" and ""John is crossing the finish line"". In other languages, by contrast, different grammatical markers indicate whether an ongoing event happens over time or instantly. Such differences in how time in events is expressed can be tricky for English speakers learning such languages. This doctoral dissertation project examines difficulties that native English speakers may have when learning how to express time in events in a second language that encodes such differences in the grammar. The study focuses on two things: how the grammar and meanings of such grammatical markers express time in events, and how use of these markers connects to real-world situations. In addition to the training of a graduate student, this research is expected to be beneficial to second-language teachers and inform textbooks. The project provides insights into the challenges speakers face in learning and using different grammatical markers.<br/><br/>Three experimental studies investigate knowledge, production, and comprehension of grammatical aspect markers. Study 1 explores whether second language learners know the ways that an aspect-marking language expresses time in events by having them judge the naturalness of sentences with time-in-event markers. Study 2 looks at how these same participants express time in events by having them continue the beginning of written sentences that include a variety of such markers.

The high level of WAT in humans, as compared to other primates, is interpreted as an adaptation to the assumed frequent dietary scarcity faced by our hominin ancestors. This concept is central to the idea that human bodies are adapted to face scarcity, and thus that humans are evolutionary predisposed to store energy in the form of fat (the thrifty-genotype and thrifty-phenotype hypotheses). The current obesity epidemic, according to this idea, results from a mismatch between a past environment of scarcity and the contemporary dietary abundance that is found in many places around the globe. If this idea is correct, the obese-tendency trait should be found in humans but not in other primates. However, very few data exist to indicate whether or not other non-human primates present this characteristic. If this trait is present in other non-human primates, it would suggest that a high WAT level is an ancient evolutionary trait and not a recent adaptation to scarcity. This doctoral dissertation project addresses this question by investigating how dietary changes affect body composition in humans and baboons. The study includes a variety of outreach activities, and collaborations with the Great Ape Heart project, which is constituted by a group of experts that aid in understanding and treating cardiac disease in great ape species.<br/><br/>To assess whether the obesity-prone tendency of humans is a trait shared with other primates, the researchers: (1) examine how dietary composition correlates with dietary biomarkers in humans; (2) assess body composition and bone mineral density in baboons (Papio anubis) that ate a low fiber but high fat and sugar diet, and (3) compare adipose deposits and lean body mass between species using DiceCT scans. The study informs about the variation in the plasticity of body composition across primate species, providing insights into the evolutionary history of human and non-human primate adiposity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result of the sun's energy, pollutants on the surface of the earth can be broken down. Even though the oil is invisible once it has been cleaned up, it can still have detrimental effects on aquatic health. Sunburned oil produces compounds that are water-soluble and can mobilize through the water. Several of these compounds contain heavy metals which are frequently found in petroleum mixtures. Research is necessary on heavy metal reactivity and fate, as well as heavy metal effects on aquatic life.  The energy in sunlight can break down petroleum, but very little is known about the resulting materials.  Project data will show how sunlight helps release the metals from the petroleum and how their transformations affect the natural biogeochemical cycle. The research will be complemented by education and outreach activities aimed at diverse students. Activities will introduce students to potential STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers, including in industry. This will be accomplished through a collaboration with a local nonprofit organization.<br/><br/>Under this award, petroporphyrins will be exposed to simulated sunlight.  Experiments will assess both physical and chemical changes that occur.  Metal concentrations will be determined using inductively coupled plasma triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

As they navigate international borders and higher education, bilingualism is a critical aspect of their everyday life. These border-crossing students are not a homogenous group; they come from a range of backgrounds and have varying perspectives. They may have different answers to questions such as, ""Which location do you prefer?"" or ""Do you feel connected to your campus?"" In turn, this diversity can map on to differences in language use across languages. Sociolinguistic research has studied how speakers use linguistic variation to construct styles that reflect socially meaningful categories within a local community. People can vary how they speak to emphasize a quality about themselves or an aspect of their identity. For example, they may use certain linguistic features to sound more ""feminine,"" or ""cool,"" or from a certain region. Since much of this work has focused on monolingual communities, an ongoing research question is how bilingual speakers draw on resources from multiple languages to construct styles that represent different social identities. Thus, the present study analyzes the varied bilingual styles that emerge among college students. By documenting the experiences of bilingual transborder students, this work not only advances research in sociolinguistics and bilingualism but also represents a valuable contribution to fields in related areas, such as education and border studies. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation aims to study how college border commuters vary in their linguistic practices and how higher education and regional identity shape their language use.

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. <br/><br/>This project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them.

These novel materials, termed dual-atom alloys, consist of an energetically stable pair of different metal atoms embedded in the surface of a host metal. Compared to single-atom alloys, a similar class of materials with well-defined active sites, dual-atom alloy active sites are anticipated to be more reactive and enable more challenging reactions including targeted bond scission.  However, accelerating the discovery of novel alloys requires addressing numerous challenges including identifying promising combinations of metals from the large materials space of potential pairings, understanding their structure/function relationships, and creating an effective feedback loop between experiment and computation. Dr. Montemore and his students will use machine learning combined with density functional theory (DFT) to identify candidate structures based on surface stability and low energy barriers for specific chemical reactions. Dr. Sykes and his students will experimentally synthesize, characterize, and test the predicted structures. Their discoveries could lead to the development of an entirely new class of catalysts where well-defined metal atomic structures can be combined with predictive models to accelerate a range of multistep reaction mechanisms. In addition to these broad scientific impacts, this project will also support a virtual reality K-12 outreach workshop, provide mentorship for Hispanic scientists and engineers, and inspire students from underserved high schools by facilitating a Reverse Science Fair.<br/><br/>Dual-atom alloys leverage several of the advantages of single-atom alloys: a well-defined active site that allows clear correspondence across computation, surface science, and reactor studies; opportunities to deviate from linear correlations in reaction energetics; and unique electronic structure. Just as with single-atom alloys, in which surface science experiments and computation preceded catalyst synthesis and testing, Montemore and Sykes will couple theory and surface science experiments to explore dual-atom alloy structure-reactivity space. This research is expected to lead to the development of structure-function relationships on a broad set of well-defined active sites, which would then serve as a guide to the larger heterogenous catalysis community. Furthermore, these studies have the potential to uncover new classes of materials with high catalytic performance, a particular need for reactions that are challenging with traditional heterogeneous catalysts, such as selective cross-couplings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can drive power outages and damage power components while also affecting pipelines and train systems. Developing the ability to predict GICs is important to protecting infrastructure and limiting the impact of geomagnetic storms on public safety and the economy. This project addresses GIC prediction by seeking to understand the connection between localized temporal changes in magnetic field measurements (dB/dt) and the magnetospheric and ionospheric phenomena causing them. This work will support the training of two graduate students that will be prepared to enter the STEM workforce with knowledge of space science, space weather, and machine learning and support the career of a woman PI leading the project. This project is jointly funded by the Magnetospheric Physics program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Aeronomy program.<br/><br/>Several studies have shown that peaks in dB/dt can be very localized, on the scales of hundreds of km. Thus, forecasting is needed at a localized level to provide power companies with actionable warnings. The current physics-based models used by the Space Weather Prediction Center lack the resolution needed to include physical phenomena at the spatial scales of the dB/dt peaks. Higher resolution models are being used for scientific studies, but are computationally expensive and take longer to run, making them more challenging to use for timely forecasting. An advantage of machine learning (ML) models is that once trained, the runtime to make predictions is significantly lower than physics based direct modeling. ML networks? ability to model nonlinear relationships in datasets can allow us to better understand the phenomena that result in localized dB/dt through the use of model explainability techniques. The following science questions will be addressed: (1) What are the spatial characteristics of localized magnetic perturbations? (2) What magnetosphere and ionosphere phenomena correlate with localized magnetic perturbations and why? The first question will be tackled using two methods that take advantage of the NSF-funded SuperMAG database: by characterizing the Region to Specific Difference (a parameter that compares the value at one location to the average values within a defined region) and by interpolation with spherical elementary current systems, and then comparing the results. The second question will utilize explainable machine learning techniques to explore magnetosphere and ionosphere phenomena that correlate with the spatially localized perturbations, incorporating datasets from satellites (e.g., DMSP, AMPERE, TWINS, and THEMIS). The results of this work will improve our understanding of geomagnetically active intervals, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, and the causes of localized perturbations in the ground magnetic field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This NSF CAREER Award aims to investigate mechanisms involved in insect cuticle formation by testing three possible mechanisms whereby the newly synthesized cuticle is protected from degradation during molting as the old cuticle is broken down by enzymes. While insects provide numerous benefits to humankind, they can also inflict extensive damage to crops and serve as vectors for pathogens that cause deadly diseases. Therefore, the research results could lead to innovative pest and vector management strategies. The acquired knowledge will be integrated into existing curricula and active learning approaches involving 3-D visualization modules on insect physiology will be developed, thereby enhancing the educational impact of the project. The project will offer multidisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of insect physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. By providing students from local institutions with comprehensive laboratory research experiences and opportunities to present their work at regional/national conferences, the project seeks to empower students to pursue STEM-based careers.<br/><br/>Chitin serves as a crucial structural component of the insect cuticle (exoskeleton), peritrophic matrix (gut lining), trachea, and eggshell. Insects periodically replace their old cuticle through molting or ecdysis to accommodate growth. During each molt, a new cuticle forms, while the old one simultaneously undergoes partial degradation by chitinases before being shed. Notably, chitinases do not degrade the new cuticular chitin despite being abundant in the procuticle. Previous research has demonstrated the critical role of the protein Knickkopf (Knk) in preventing premature degradation of the new cuticle by chitinases, albeit through an unknown mechanism. This CAREER project investigates how newly synthesized cuticular chitin is shielded from chitinase activity during molting to ensure the integrity of the newly forming cuticle. It will test the hypothesis that chitin deacetylases play a pivotal role in maintaining cuticle integrity by shielding against chitinases, potentially in collaboration with Knk. The project will (1) examine the impact of chitin deacetylation on chitinase function, (2) identify accessory proteins required for chitin deacetylase function, and (3) assess the importance of chitin deacetylation in gut peritrophic matrix integrity. To better understand the function of chitin deacetylases in maintaining cuticle integrity, the research will employ, and train students in, various molecular biology, confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and mass-spectrometry techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peatlands are wetland ecosystems that naturally store C due to very slow decomposition of plant material, and thus now store a massive amount of C as organic matter. How the C cycle in these peatlands will change as climate warms is unknown. Michigan is positioned at the southern end of the range of boreal (northern) peatlands, which means that Michigan peatlands will be among the first to be affected by warming. This project will establish a climate transect of peatlands to help predict how future warming will affect the C stored in these ecosystems. The transect contains seven sites, from Portage in the south to Newberry in Michigan?s Upper Peninsula. The sites span 5C in average temperature, which is approximately equivalent to the warming expected over the next century. The project will exploit these natural differences in temperature to determine how C cycle processes in peatlands will change with warming. In addition, a new course for first-year undergraduate students will be developed, centered around a field trip to sites on the peatland transect in the week before the start of classes, to train and inspire the next generation of environmental scientists.<br/><br/>The net C balance of the peatland ecosystem is determined by the net balance of C inputs (from plant growth) and C losses (through microbial decomposition of organic matter). Predicting future changes in the C balance has proved difficult because both of these fluxes are expected to increase with warming. C losses will be evaluated by measuring carbon dioxide and methane emissions from the soil, as well as litter bag decomposition experiments. Changes in C inputs via plant growth will be mediated by nitrogen (N) availability, due to the strong N limitation of peatland ecosystems. Therefore, the temperature sensitivity of N mineralization will be assessed in field measurements across the transect. Finally, the effects of warming on net C accumulation will be assessed using a geochemical approach, taking advantage of the 1C of warming that Michigan has already experienced. The long-term accumulation rate will be compared to the recent accumulation rate, using computer modeling to account for organic matter included in the recent rate that is still undergoing aerobic decomposition. This will allow direct testing of the hypothesis that warming has already begun to slow down peat accumulation in marginal peatlands at the southern edge of their climate window. Together, these approaches will provide a complete picture of how C inputs and losses from peatlands will change in response to the warming expected over the coming decades.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, terrestrial and aquatic microbiomes mix in rivers, soil microbial communities invade one another in agriculture, and human skin microbiomes come into contact when two people shake hands. Such cross-microbiome invasions are collectively termed community coalescence. How these mixing events impact the function of microbiomes and how often new communities with novel functions form as a result remains unclear. This research project uses fermented food microbiomes, including sourdough starters, kombucha, and fermented vegetables, to determine how microbiomes reassemble when they mix and how coalescence impacts microbiome functions. Findings from these experimentally tractable fermented food systems identify how community coalescence can be used as a tool for microbiome engineering and its potential to improve the manipulation of medically and industrially relevant microbiomes. The broad appeal of fermented food systems is also used to increase participation in undergraduate research and broaden the public understanding of microbiomes. This project also engages the public more broadly through popular science articles and interviews on MicrobialFoods.org, a popular science venue developed to explain complex biological concepts in scientific papers in accessible content for food enthusiasts and educators.<br/><br/>The mechanisms that govern cross-community invasions remain poorly understood. Most research has focused on the consequences of community coalescence in natural systems, while determination of underlying mechanisms is limited. This project manipulates a suite of fermented food model systems, derived from fermented food microbiomes, including sourdough starters, kombucha, and fermented vegetables, in conducting community coalescence experiments. The investigation sheds light on the consequences of coalescence, the mechanisms that govern it, and its potential utility for microbiome engineering. With the use of co-culture interaction assays, metabolic modeling, RNA-sequencing, and targeted metabolomics the project dissects the underlying interaction mechanisms that shape coalescence outcomes. Experimental evolution is used to determine how abiotic and biotic adaptation constrains or promotes cross-invasion outcomes. This project provides a mechanistic understanding that is required for predicting coalescence consequences and for leveraging community coalescence in industrial applications with microbial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Leishmania infections, even after patients clear out the parasites, the liver stays enlarged due to substantial changes in its tissue structure. This project aims to uncover how these parasites cause changes in the liver extracellular matrix (ECM) ? the tissue components that surround and support cells. At the core of this exploration are hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), pivotal architects orchestrating the construction of liver ECM. The investigators hypothesize that Leishmania manipulates these cells, instigating modifications to the ECM and an increase in liver size. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will employ materials that mimic the ECM in human bodies to culture HSCs and create mini tissue models in the laboratory. The team will then use these models to study how HSCs behave after Leishmania infection and examine their interactions with macrophages ? immune cells that are the preferred host for these parasites. Inspired by these research ideas, in parallel, the investigator will create a tissue engineering workshop for Latine middle-school students, implement an international virtual exchange for graduate students enrolled in ?Global Health in Biomedical Engineering."" and use crocheted SciArt and social media to inform people about the increasing dangers of these and other tropical parasites.<br/><br/>Organ enlargement is a common phenomenon observed in chronic protozoal infections. Protozoa of the Leishmania subgenus cause substantial swelling of the liver. Liver enlargement persists after parasite clearing and is linked to extensive modifications of host extracellular matrix (ECM). The biological processes through which these parasites induce ECM remodeling is not well understood. Because hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the dominant drivers of ECM production in the liver, the central hypothesis of this project is that Leishmania infection induces ECM remodeling through the activation of HSCs. Considering macrophages are the primary resident cell for Leishmania, a secondary hypothesis is that infected macrophages also mediate the activation of HSCs. Testing these hypotheses is not possible using traditional in vitro systems because culture on tissue culture polystyrene leads to the spontaneous activation of stellate cells. Furthermore, most Leishmania in vitro models study a single host cell type cultured in environments that fail to account for the characteristics of host ECM. The investigator will address these concerns by leveraging biomaterials to engineer improved in vitro models that address the following research objectives: (1) design a biomaterial that supports the culture of quiescent HSCs, (2) assess HSC activation and ECM production after infection with Leishmania donovani, and (3) evaluate HSC phenotype after co-culture with Leishmania-infected macrophages or their released extracellular vesicles. Thus, this proposal will leverage engineering and biomaterials strategies to address critical gaps in our understanding of host-parasite interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Now, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), post pandemic incidence of such conditions has increased by 25-35% worldwide and the WHO is calling for all countries to step up mental health services and support. This highlights the need for more accessible and less invasive treatment options for neurological disorders. Electrical neurostimulation methodologies, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have proven effective in treating various neurological disorders. TMS stimulates the brain using short-duration pulses of electrical current induced by a magnetic field. However, TMS requires stable high-power systems typically found in hospital settings. TMS treatment plans involve daily hospital visits for three weeks, or sometimes multiple treatments in a single day, which limits accessibility to patients who are already managing depression or anxiety symptoms such as social withdrawal and sleep irregularities that disrupt their everyday routines. Moreover, attending regular in-person treatment sessions may not be feasible for those in rural or low-income demographics. However, nanosecond electrical pulses (NEPs), distinguished by their high intensity and extremely narrow pulse width, have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for various neurological disorders. NEP has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in stimulating cells and nerves without causing harm and has potential for portable devices that would help reduce the need for hospital visits and greatly increase accessibility. This project seeks to understand the limitations of traditional NEPs and find solutions to adapt them to smaller devices. The project will produce a medical device prototype incorporating the research findings, broadening the range of non-invasive, accessible neurological treatment options for patients. The project's K-12 outreach, in collaboration with Sierra Nevada Journeys and employing biosensors in Family Science Nights and adult programs, will enhance STEM education through their feedback expertise.<br/><br/>NEPs offer substantial neuromodulation potential, capable of replicating physiological stimuli for non-invasive treatment of neurological disorders. Despite their potential, NEPs encounter obstacles in non-invasive in-vivo applications due to constraints in penetration depth and signal distortion through human or animal body. The objectives of this study are to (1) understand the limitations of traditional NEPs and find solutions to adapt them to smaller devices, (2) address the issue of signal distortions caused by varying anatomical differences, and (3) develop a medical device prototype that incorporates solutions to the aforementioned challenges. Leveraging the potential of NEPs, the research will employ RF signals for enhanced penetration, utilize deep-learning techniques for anatomical compensation, and incorporate wider pulse widths and MHz pulse repetition rates to lower the threshold voltage. The use of digitally generated RF-NEP could represent a significant innovative shift in neurostimulation methodology. This non-invasive approach allows for deeper penetration into animal bodies while including specific waveforms that satisfy specific needs. The integration of these innovative solutions into the design of a new medical device speaks to the translational potential of this research. This project anticipates advancing theoretical knowledge and a concrete, tangible improvement in neurostimulation treatment methods, contributing significantly to the broader neuroscience and neurological therapeutics field.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems (CCSS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Annual productivity losses are estimated to cost an additional $4.5 billion. There is a considerable health disparity in the diagnosis of skin cancer within the U.S.; The average wait time to see a dermatologist is currently 32.3 days but it varies greatly by location. Early detection reduces disfigurement by reducing the size and extent of surgical removal and reducing the side effects that late-stage patients experience from systemic therapies. Furthermore, the project increases the economic competitiveness of the U.S. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to productize a novel, pigmented, lesion analysis system for wide field-of-view images. The product will be built on a previously developed total body photography system and proof of concept lesion classification software as a medical device that was developed in Phase I. The dermatoscope-like resolution provides a solid foundation for a system that can automatically (without the involvement of a dermatologist) detect and classify various skin conditions in a clinical setting and/or a radiology center (similar to how mammograms are done). Skin cancers, including both melanomas and non-melanomas, are the most common types of cancer in the United States. Early-stage identification of suspicious pigmented lesions in primary care settings can lead to improved melanoma prognosis and a possible 20-fold reductions in treatment cost.

The success of this project will establish a powerful pharmaceutical technology for designing personalized therapies to treat the oncogenic mutant-driven lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers, where treatment options are extremely limited. This project will also enhance the academia-industry partnership, strengthen a burgeoning life science ecosystem in the Buffalo area, and develop a globally competitive STEM workforce for the Western New York region.<br/><br/>The proposed project addresses a critical barrier in the clinical translation of monobodies - a class of powerful tool biologics that are not cell-permeable despite their small size. The CPM technology overcomes this barrier by combining orthogonal crosslinking ? a proprietary method to rigidify monobody structure through site-specific inter-strand crosslinking - with monobody surface supercharging. As a result, the CPM technology potentially possesses several innovative features: 1) genetic modifications facilitate recombinant production of CPM in bacteria both at research scale and for manufacturing; 2) high binding affinity and specificity toward intracellular oncogene targets can be readily obtained using well-established display technologies; and 3) robust cytosolic transport efficiency can be obtained owing to the rigid scaffold and tunable surface charge. This project aims to unlock the commercial value of CPM technology by identifying potent and selective inhibitors oncogenic KRAS mutants that proved to be elusive with the small-molecule approach. Extensive optimizations of charge distribution and physicochemical properties will be performed using a reported monobody-based KRAS inhibitor as a template, with a goal to identify one CPM with sub-micromolar inhibitory activity in the KRAS mutant-harboring cell lines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the food waste in the cheese industry occurs during processing, with cheese/milk lost to trim losses. The new sensor will reduce trim losses by providing real-time information on the mechanical behavior of the cheese that will allow automated adjustments to cutting parameters. In addition, the mechanical property data gathered for each pack of cheese will create a detailed and labeled database that will be very valuable for cheese makers and retailers. For instance, cheesemakers may use the database to infer dietary, seasonal, and regional variations of cheese texture and constituents. This, in the long run, will promote standardization and reduce trim losses due to variations in cheesemaking. The database will facilitate quality control and pack-to-pack consistency and improve customer satisfaction at the retail stage. The sensor can be extended to other segments of consumer-packaged goods, such as portioned fruits, vegetables, meat, and cereal bars.  In addition, trainees will develop technical and entrepreneurial skills through this project. <br/><br/>This project will address the challenge of trim losses in cheese processing, which can result in up to 30% lost revenue and several billion pounds of cheese/milk loss annually. A sensor will be prototyped that leverages recent developments in using information contained in surface waves emitted during cutting to determine material behavior. The objectives are: (1) to develop a prototype sensor, (2) to test the sensor on well-controlled cheese substitutes, and (3) to test the sensor on common cheese.  The prototype sensor will be developed using low-cost optical sensors, which will undergo validation against multipoint laser vibrometry. Initial sensor testing will be completed on gelatin with deformable fillers. This cheese substitute has been selected because of prior research use and because it allows tight control over material behavior to confirm the sensor output.  Subsequent sensor testing will focus on cheeses that account for 2/3 of U.S. cheese consumption (mild/sharp cheddar, Gouda and mozzarella). The anticipated technical outcomes will be a working prototype sensor and a thorough understanding of the relationships between surface waves and cheese properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One among these professional societies includes the Society for the Advancement in Biology Education Research (SABER), a leading premier international society with a primary focus on undergraduate biology education research. Scholarship related to this organization impacts every undergraduate biology learning environment. Additionally, members of this organization are also members of other professional societies, which makes SABER a critical lever for advancing systemic changes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion across various biology sub-fields and thus, helping to exert a larger impact on undergraduate biology education. <br/><br/>SABER since its inception and as exemplified by a self-study in 2019, has struggled with issues of diversity and representation at every level of its organizational structure, including key leadership positions. This aspect directly impacts the culture and climate of this society which ultimately affects the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts related to undergraduate biology education. Despite significant changes in its organizational structure, a concerted effort is needed to institute a permanent change related to equity and inclusion. This project aims to enact sustainable change by including diverse perspectives and voices to fundamentally change the culture of the organization and implement initiatives that promote an environment to enable cultural change. The goals of this project are as follows: (1) broadly and systematically advertise and recruit for SABER to broaden its reach to organizations, institutions, and individuals who are not currently aware of SABER, (2) offer travel support for individuals that are members of groups typically underrepresented in biology or who work at historically black colleges and universities and other minority serving institutions to attend the national meeting, (3) offer mentorship related to inclusion to individuals in leadership positions at SABER, and (4) develop networking, mentoring, and leadership opportunities to sustain the involvement of diverse members within SABER. We posit that increasing the number and including the perspectives of underrepresented scientists within SABER will enable a shift in the culture of this society to help advance inclusion by (1) creating welcoming spaces that foster an enhanced sense of belonging and professional growth of diverse individuals, (2) creating a supportive environment for members by developing and empowering environmental stewards within the SABER leadership and by offering them travel support and mentoring activities, and (3) introducing structural changes that will ultimately affect the culture and climate of SABER as an organization to create pathways that diversify the society?s leadership for diverse individuals.

They will experiment with elasto-active structures comprising long and thin elastic beams connected to active agents and develop theoretical models and numerical simulations to rationalize their mechanics. Those agents are centimetric rigid-bodied micro-robots that use vibration to ""walk"" across a flat surface. The project first focuses on the spontaneous self-oscillations observed when a beam is clamped on one end and loaded by a micro-robot on the other end.  This system will be used to establish a minimal model that couples Langevin dynamics and the Kirchhoff equations for elastic rods. The project will next study the ""runners"" that form when a beam is loaded by a micro-robot at each end, resulting in the beam buckling and moving across the plane. The interaction of these runners with boundaries, e.g., planar reflection, interaction with obstacles, and passage through a slit, will be examined to elucidate the contributing factors to the runners? ability to solve complex mazes. Finally, the project will explore systems with three or more micro-bots involved, enabling run-and-tumble motions and wave propagation, thereby expanding the operating modes of these elastically coupled active agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biomass burning aerosol includes a wide range of organic compounds that may vary with fuel species and combustion conditions. The absorptivity of organic aerosol is known to change during aging in the atmosphere due to a wide variety of chemical and physical processes. Biomass burning aerosol contributes to poor air quality and can alter the radiative balance and impact climate. The goal of this project is to better understand the impacts of biomass burning aerosols on air quality and the climate system.<br/><br/>This effort involves a laboratory study of the initial and evolving light-absorbing properties of brown carbon as biomass burning emissions undergo processes such as irradiation, oxidation, and incorporation into the aqueous or organic phases of the aerosol. The focus will be on aerosol emitted from fires in the US Southern Great Plains (SGP) region, where the landscape includes grasses and some woody species, such as eastern red cedar. Achieving the objectives of the project involves the following tasks: (1) prepare biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) from under-explored fuel species relevant to the SGP location and determine its light absorption; (2) determine the spectroscopic and thermodynamic parameters dictating light absorption by individual BBOA chromophores and their complexes and oligomers; (3) determine the effects of atmospheric aging on the light absorption of biomass burning aerosol, including the chemical processing of BBOA and the physical processing of black carbon. Together, these tasks will enable fundamental insights into the origin and fate of light absorption by biomass burning aerosol.<br/><br/>Education and outreach activities include creating publicly available online visualizations of atmospheric chemistry concepts, conducting demonstrations of atmospheric processes at a museum and within selected university programs, and establishing a research rotation with Native American students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cellular tRNA molecules are decorated with a huge diversity of chemical modifications that are essential for correctly tuning tRNA structure, stability, and efficient and accurate protein synthesis. Defects in the enzymes and biochemical pathways that install tRNA modifications are linked to a wide range of human diseases from cancers to neurodegenerative disorders. However, for many of the enzymes that install key chemical modifications on tRNA, a clear understanding of how these enzymes selectively carry out their modification reactions is missing. Filling this gap in knowledge is important for our fundamental understanding of cellular RNA biology. This proposal will define the detailed atomic-level mechanisms for two distinct classes of metal-dependent enzymes (metalloenzymes) that install key modifications on tRNA that directly impact protein synthesis. Closely integrated with this research, a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) will be developed that engages both undergraduates and high-school students from underrepresented groups in a collaborative, discovery-based course where students will make and experimentally test predictions about protein-tRNA interactions. The outcomes from this work could provide new information on how tRNA-modifying metalloenzymes carry out complex, multistep reactions on tRNA and broaden engagement of students in research-focused activities at the undergraduate and high-school levels.<br/><br/>Hypermodification of the tRNA anticodon loop is essential for proper codon-anticodon recognition and mRNA decoding in the ribosome during translation. The cell installs numerous, chemically complex modifications at these locations to ensure and control translational efficiency and fidelity. This project combines techniques from biochemistry, structural biology, biophysics, and chemical biology to study two different classes of tRNA-modifying metalloenzymes that install sequential modifications on the anticodon loop of tRNA. The goals of this work are to: (1) define the stepwise chemical mechanisms used by these classes of metalloenzymes to install anticodon loop modifications, (2) unveil the structural mechanisms and protein conformations that control tRNA recognition and modification selectivity, and (3) provide new, broad information about how these classes of metalloenzymes are regulated in the cell. The research outcomes could deepen our basic understanding of tRNA biology and pave the way for future therapeutic development targeting these or similar metalloenzymes and tRNA modification pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both models raise similar security concerns: As clients lack full control over the service process, they need to make sure that service providers have the right economic incentives to not misbehave. Since the predominant framework in cybersecurity has been motivated by traditional in-house computing, our current thinking about cybersecurity often does not adequately emphasize economic incentives. This project is thus conducting interdisciplinary research to analyze the well-functioning of cyberinfrastructure in the presence of incentive issues. The project aims to enable a more diversified and robust infrastructure; improve digital service efficiency for economic competitiveness; foster competition in digital services provision with technology; bring frontier STEM topics to a broader audience including economists, business researchers, and the general public; and develop education materials to bridge the gap between tech and business students.  <br/><br/>With the overall objective to enrich the existing paradigm for cybersecurity analysis from a cross-disciplinary perspective, the project team is studying several specific topics under the theme, including the principal-agent frictions between cloud clients and providers, and how to deal with it using both contract theory and recent advances in cryptography, the long-term sustainability of decentralized systems featuring interactions among strategic participants as well as Byzantine faults, and the potential of using results from the first two thrusts to organize a more efficient, fair, and inclusive digital economy.

Over the next ten years, about 2000 OW turbines are expected to be constructed off our nation?s eastern coastline from Massachusetts to Virginia at a cost of about $100 Billion. This brings great challenges and opportunities for the shared-use of our coastal waters. The marine ecosystem in this region is already under great stress due to climate change which has reduced biodiversity and fishing stocks; thereby, communities in this region are very concerned about additional stresses on the marine ecosystem that offshore wind may bring. MOCEAN (Mission is the OCEAN) is the lead for this NSF project, and it aims to: (i) make OW farm development a win for all (OW industry, fishers, coastal communities, ocean habitats); (ii) drive large-scale sustainable OW energy that will contribute greatly to achieving U.S. climate goals and ocean health; and (iii) catalyze the investment required to build and operate OW farms to address societal inequities. This project will engage industry, stakeholders, public officials, affected communities, and public and private decision makers to develop an effective strategic plan and innovation community to achieve MOCEAN?s mission. <br/><br/>MOCEAN?s strategic plan and innovation community will be developed to support making significant advancements in science and technology; engineering, economic, and educational models; and associated policy drivers; the region of this community will include coastline areas from Massachusetts to Virginia. If the project succeeds in becoming an NSF Engine, then the advancements in science will range from the micro-to-macro scale, and these will include the formation of marine communities, marine biology, impact of stressors on habitats, the effect of different materials and coatings on marine growths, local ecosystems, as well as regional ecosystems. The advancements in technologies will include new sensing systems (e.g. eDNA, acoustic, image-based), robotics, coating systems, more durable materials, intelligent nature-inclusive scour protection, artificial reefs, and future-proof foundations. The advancements in engineering models will account for important factors that are presently ignored or insufficiently considered in practice (e.g. soil-foundation structure interaction, impact of cathodic protection on design life and the environment). For economics, the advancements will quantify the effect of local labor, environmental impact, and new blue technology within economic models that can be used in the decision-making process for the design and operation of offshore wind farms. In education, advancements will create new methods of engagement, support, and learning that lead to much greater participation of students and workers from marginalized communities in the New Blue Economy within MOCEAN?s region of service.

Importantly, RNAs can now be readily identified that bind virtually any other biomolecule of interest and display unique functions, including enabling the catalysis of chemical reactions, fluorescence, and more. But there is a major challenge obstructing progress ? RNA structure is incredibly sensitive to the local environment. Current strategies to identify functional RNAs almost universally proceed in test tubes, mostly yielding functional RNAs that also work well only in a test tube and unfortunately fail when translated into biological environments. This project seeks to deliver and optimize a new platform that will enable rapid and robust identification of functional RNAs directly in the mammalian cellular environment. The approach involves application of next-generation strategies to attain laboratory-timescale RNA evolution in cells, enabling efficient selection for desired RNA functions. Because the novel RNAs are identified within cellular milieus to begin with, they will consistently function in biological settings ? unlike functional RNAs discovered using current test tube-based methods. Alongside this progress, the project will provide opportunities for PhD student training as well as enable substantive expansion of an ongoing, successful high school internship program.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis of this work is that in-cell based directed evolution can solve the environment-sensitive folding and structure challenge that has hamstrung the functional RNA field. The research aims to deliver a bespoke, custom-designed mammalian phage-assisted continuous evolution system to enable the robust and efficient identification of mammalian cell-functional RNA aptamers, allosteric activators, and glue RNAs. The selection couples developed will be highly modular and generally useful for anyone in the field to evolve functional RNAs of interests. The resulting RNA-mPACE platform is intended to deliver ease-of-use, strategies to support parallelization, scaling, and speed of directed evolution campaigns, and methods to specifically target mutagenesis to the gene encoding the RNA of interest to further accelerate functional RNA development. Successful execution of this research will enable the enormous potential of functional RNAs in biology to finally be unleashed. For research applications, it will become far more feasible to modulate the activity of any biomolecule of interest. For medical applications, RNAs could become a preferred modality for all types of targets. Key fundamental insights will also become accessible, especially related to how cellular environments shape RNA structure-function landscapes.<br/><br/>This work is jointly supported by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Systems and Synthetic Biology cluster in MCB.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intrinsically meaningless speech sounds and letter shapes hit our eardrums or eyeballs, and, through a series of processing steps are turned into meaningful ideas in our heads. We can do this despite the fact that the linguistic input that we receive is not perfect; we understanding language in noisy environments, when faced with idiosyncratic factors such as accents, we can adjust to ambiguous words and structures, among many other factors. These challenges are not only due to uncertainty in the input; the human cognitive system has its own limitations, with lapses in attention or failures of memory impacting how we process language.  To remain successful and efficient in tasks of language processing despite this uncertainty, the human brain generates predictions about upcoming information based on the current context and/or prior knowledge. This project investigates this prediction, specifically focusing on the process of how we pick out the intended words - based on information like meaning, part of speech, and pronunciation, among a large set of competing words. Specifically, it looks at how the overall distribution of potential upcoming words - and specifically uncertainty about upcoming words - influences our ability to perceive and produce language, measuring this distribution at the level of an individual person with their own idiosyncratic experiences of the world. In terms of broader impacts, this project builds the language science community at Mississippi State University through the development of co-taught courses across different departments engaged in language science, and training students and faculty from across the university on how to use more advanced tools to answer a variety of questions about the nature of language processing. <br/><br/>To obtain a valid, sensitive and nuanced measure of uncertainty associated with upcoming linguistic material, the investigators measure ""information entropy"" for each research participant in specific sentential contexts. Information entropy reflects the uncertainty associated with the next word following a sentential context, and when measured for each participant for each context, it reflects uncertainty experienced by specific individuals in specific semantic domains, thereby providing a customized entropy measure for each individual. The investigators collect behavioral data, such as reading times, as well as brain data, such as ongoing brain activity commonly known and electroencephalogram or EEG, to assess how the human brain generates predictions about upcoming input. The investigators also measure other brain functions such as working memory span and attention control to examine how prediction generation interacts with those functions. The results of this project will advance our knowledge about the role of prediction when humans produce and comprehend language, and how those skills interact with other critical human brain functions such as working memory and attention. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Perception, Action and Cognition program, the Linguistics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within this ecology, scientists have emerged as increasingly pivotal risk communicators on social media: for example, scientists were propelled to the forefront of public discourse during the Covid-19 pandemic, positioning themselves as experts in these online information environments. This project explores how scientists may leverage social media to present their research and themselves to the public, as well as how public audiences might respond to this ?self-presentation.? Specifically, how might certain self-presentation strategies impact audience perceptions of scientists' competence, warmth, humility, and transparency, and how might these perceptions relate to risk understanding and support for risk-related policies? Understanding the potential persuasive impacts of scientists? social media use may support the identification and development of effective risk communication practices not only for scientists, but other stakeholders on social media and beyond. This research aims to help empower scientists at all levels and from different backgrounds and experiences in risk communication.<br/><br/>This research addresses these guiding questions by examining the impact of scientists' self-presentation strategies across two relevant areas: (1) the dissemination of their research outcomes and (2) the contextualization of their research processes. The researchers explore how these strategies may impact audiences? perceptions of scientists as risk communicators through two mechanisms?expectancy violation and identification?and how source perceptions may relate to risk perceptions and policy support. Lastly, the researchers examine two message-level features of these self-presentation strategies (personalization and emotionalization) as potential moderators that may impact these relationships. To test the conceptual framework, the researchers are collecting and analyzing data from two randomized experiments that involve a general population sample of adults. Altogether, this research bridges literature on social media with strategic risk communication and persuasion to offer a more nuanced perspective of an evolving aspect of risk communication as situated in a networked environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Altered activity of these proteins can lead to poor glucose absorption and nutrient deficiency. Unfortunately, cellular events that regulate SGLT activity are poorly understood. This is particularly true for tyrosine phosphorylation, a form of modification that can change protein structure and function, that has not yet been studied in relation to SGLT activity. Therefore, the long-term goal of this NSF CAREER research project is to improve the understanding of how SGLT tyrosine phosphorylation, or tyrosine kinase proteins that activate this form of modification, regulate changes in glucose movement into cells. The project also includes several strategies for educational improvements that include highlighting the biological importance of SGLTs, as well as the training and recruitment of junior scientists who will lead future science, technology, engineering, and mathematic efforts. Collectively, this research project is expected to impact many scientific disciplines, including molecular, cellular, and systems biology, through educational insight and novel scientific discoveries involving glucose transporters.<br/><br/>The research objective of this NSF CAREER project is to identify a novel post-translational event that regulates variability in SGLT activity and glucose absorption. Solute carrier transporters, including SGLTs, have been associated as passive pores that move substrates across cell membranes alone or with electrochemical gradients. However, the hypothesis to be tested as part of the current project is that SGLTs are tyrosine phosphorylated by specific kinases at the cell surface, and that these phosphorylation events are associated with transport function. To address this hypothesis, the project will 1) evaluate the phosphorylation status of SGLTs in different cellular compartments using cell fractionation and mass spectrometry; 2) identify the role of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in regulating SGLT activity using site-directed mutagenesis, kinase inhibitors, and SGLT activity assays; and 3) identify tyrosine kinases that mediate SGLT activity using phosphoproteomic analysis and kinase interaction assays. Additionally, the strategies and outcomes from the proposed research objectives will be used to improve basic scientific knowledge, generate a passion for research, and improve leadership capabilities in the field of biological sciences. This will be done by establishing an annual summer research position for high school students, working with middle school educators to increase recognition of reproducible and high-quality science, and developing online content that will increase familiarity with transporter proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by identifying classroom practices that enable a greater number of students to thrive in these courses.  Whether or not a person completes a four-year undergraduate degree is a primary driver of income levels.  Thus, barriers to earning degrees can present significant obstacles to socioeconomic mobility in the United States.  One such barrier is successful completion of introductory STEM courses.  Persistence in these courses varies even in STEM disciplines in which students from under-represented groups enter the major at the same rates as their majority peers.  Persistence of students is affected by how their instructors teach.  For example, incorporating active learning methods in introductory STEM courses can increase student achievement and lower performance gaps. However, not all implementations of active learning are equally effective for supporting these outcomes. A meta-analysis of over 46,000 students in a wide array of STEM courses compared student outcomes in lecture-based versus active learning classrooms.  Active learning reduced achievement gaps in exam scores by an average of 40% and the gap in failure rates by 75%. Surprisingly, some active learning interventions widened achievement gaps, raising questions about why the variation exists.  Findings from the literature point to two complementary elements of the classroom experience that are necessary to close achievement gaps: (1) an inclusive environment where all students believe they can be successful, which primes them to meaningfully engage; and (2) active learning that follows best practices for how people learn.  This project team aims to identify and test the impact of specific elements of classroom culture and course design that effectively narrow achievement gaps.<br/><br/>This project has three aims: (1) Generate an explanatory model of achievement gaps by identifying and measuring a set of critical elements for closing these gaps in 12 courses identified in a meta-analysis that either narrowed or widened achievement gaps; (2) Establish generalizability of critical elements on achievement gaps by training and validating a predictive model on a national sample of 40 additional introductory courses from a wide array of institution types; (3) Develop, evaluate, and promote a Practitioner?s Toolkit for Closing Achievement Gaps.  This Toolkit will include instructor and student questionnaires that feed directly to a data processing application that fits the predictive model for unique classrooms. In addition, the Toolkit will include self-reflection activities to promote engagement with the personalized results of the predictive model and a guidebook for improvement that explains implementation of each critical element.  Thus, this project intends to produce a novel set of tools that instructors can use to enhance student performance in higher education, helping to make a four-year degree attainable by all students.  The tools developed by the project will be freely available online and disseminated through invited seminars, workshops, and presentations at national meetings.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rice University is a small, private, four-year institution of higher education located in Houston, Texas, a city of approximately 2.4 million people that stands as the most diverse city in the United States. Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 53 unique, full-time students every year who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in science and engineering disciplines. This project will facilitate the transition of a group of academically talent low-income students from the time they are admitted to college to the start of their major core courses?and then throughout the remainder of their undergraduate programs. The project will begin in the summer and will combine a six-week, immersive bridge program that will cover the most challenging topics students will face in first-year mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science courses with numerous interventions: individualized professional advisors? coaching throughout the students? time at Rice, cohort-building activities, and other interventions designed to fuel persistence and remove barriers for success. Moreover, the project will sponsor summer activities such as opportunities to participate in state-of-the-art research, internships, and summer courses. This S-STEM grant will support academically talented low-income students in science and engineering, strengthening the pipeline of professionals across all STEM fields, while shedding light on the significance of critical events in the formation of STEM identity and persistence to a degree completion in STEM, as well as the effectiveness of the project in addressing student needs. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  The central hypothesis is that by using a series of carefully planned and integrated interventions, it will be possible to remove the barriers that lead to attrition in STEM and, thereby, advance persistence and academic success. The overall goal will be accomplished by pursuing the following objectives: 1) mitigate disparities in access to educational opportunities by helping students acquire core STEM content knowledge and develop college-ready study habits and skills; 2) provide an intentionally designed cohort experience that fosters belongingness and cultivates students? identity as members of the Rice science and engineering communities; 3) coach and mentor students throughout their college studies to build social capital and navigate or remove barriers to persistence; and, 4) provide summer academic and scholarly opportunities for sophomore and junior students. Critical events (called shocks) cause individual students to re-evaluate their educational arrangements, in part because shocks send messages about identity and expected futures. To understand the types of shocks experienced by students, the perceptions of their severity, and whether they differ by student socioeconomic status, a series of qualitative interviews will be performed. In addition, quantitative studies of student identity upon matriculation (i.e., STEM and status identity), shocks experienced during their first two years of study, and an assessment of student outcomes will be performed. The project will advance understanding of the types of critical events that students are experiencing, perceptions of the severity of those critical events, whether these perceptions differ by student status, and the effectiveness of the project in mitigating the adverse effects of these events. The success of the project will be assessed by formative and summative external evaluation, and the results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and papers presented at academic conferences. The project will also host a half-day workshop every summer to share effective strategies with other universities and community colleges across Texas. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This megadrought is an ongoing climate crisis that is severely impacting natural ecosystems, managed forests, agricultural systems, and human water resources. Despite such serious consequences, our understanding of the megadrought is quite limited. Specifically, the research community lacks a comprehensive understanding of how the megadrought has impacted soil moisture, particularly the deeper moisture pools that are critical for vegetation health. There is also a limited understanding of how carbon and water cycling have changed over the last 23 years; an important indicator of ecosystem function that mediates global climate feedbacks. This research enhances our ecological understanding of how drylands have been impacted by the megadrought, which sets the stage for a more predictive understanding of future climate change impacts. This knowledge is transferable to other dryland and non-dryland biomes, as such megadroughts are projected to increase in frequency and severity globally in the coming decades. <br/><br/>To accomplish these aims, the research combines hundreds of long-running soil moisture depth profiles with remotely-sensed estimates of shallow soil moisture, deep water availability, and groundwater. These data allow us to assess the impacts of the megadrought on plant-available water, and serve as a crucial validation of these remotely-sensed products for drought monitoring. Data from 21 eddy covariance towers are paired with a new gridded dataset of empirically-modeled ecosystem fluxes to uncover the drivers of dryland ecosystem function, and quantify the impact of the megadrought on carbon-water fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolutions. By synthesizing these data sources their unique strengths are leveraged; addressing detailed mechanistic questions with in situ data, and examining broad trends in carbon-water cycling using modeled and remotely-sensed data. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Ecosystem Science and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of the diversity in composition, the surface of a HEA nanocrystal naturally presents an enormous number of atoms in distinct coordination environments to produce a near-continuum distribution of adsorption energies for the key intermediate of a reaction. As such, HEA nanocrystals offer a versatile platform for the rapid development of new catalytic materials. Despite some progress in recent years, it remains a grand challenge to control the composition and surface structure of HEA nanocrystals, making it impossible to quantitatively and accurately describe the structure-property relationship of HEA-based catalysts. During this project, a transformative technique is developed to achieve deterministic and even predictable synthesis of HEA nanocrystals with controlled compositions and surface structures. The as-obtained nanocrystals can directly serve as advanced catalytic materials to benefit U.S. economy and society. The multi-disciplinary and collaborative nature of this project offers a vehicle to enhance and enrich the education and training experiences of students while also expanding the number of them in cutting-edge research. In particular, the students learn firsthand how to discover and develop advanced catalytic materials twice as fast at a fraction of the cost. The results from this project are also adapted to enhance classroom teaching, including the development of demonstrations and experiments to better illustrate the key concepts of science and engineering. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This research represents the first attempt to develop single-phase HEA nanocrystals with well-defined and controllable compositions and surface structures. Traditionally, colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals involves one-shot injection of the metal precursor. When directly applied to a bi- or multi-metallic system, such a protocol is subject to failures because different precursors have distinct reduction kinetics and their instantaneous concentrations in the reaction solution would decay differently with reaction time. Parting from the traditional method, the investigators co-titrate the solutions of different precursors dropwise into a reaction solution so that the instantaneous concentration of each precursor is kept in a predefined steady state throughout the synthesis. As a result, metal atoms are produced from the different precursors at stable, pre-specified rates for the generation of HEA nanocrystals with a uniform composition, with the atomic ratios determined by the reduction rates of their precursors in the steady states. When conformally deposited on preformed seeds with different shapes as overlayers of a few atomic layers in thickness, HEA nanocrystals with well-defined facets are obtained. The seeds can be selectively etched away to release the HEA overlayers as ultrathin nanoplates. At a thickness of three atomic layers, the nanoplates are perfect for resolving the composition and surface structure by electron microscopy and spectroscopy. In parallel, the HEA nanocrystals are tested for catalytic reactions, with a focus on the identification of a catalyst optimal in activity and durability toward oxygen reduction and bond-selective hydrogenation. The synthetic method can also be extended to accelerate the rational development of other types of nanomaterials with complex compositions for a range of applications, including those related to chemical production, petroleum industry, national security, and public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process of synthesizing proteins inside living cells normally occurs efficiently and smoothly. However, occasionally, and even more so under stress conditions, the protein synthesis machinery encounters problems and stalls. Fortunately, cells are equipped with quality control systems dedicated to overcoming problems in protein synthesis. The multiple components and mechanisms of action of the quality control systems are far from being fully characterized and understood. In this project, the cellular factors and molecular mechanism of a previously unknown critical protein synthesis quality control system in bacteria will be studied. The resulting new knowledge will inform new strategies for combating bacterial infections. The research activities will be incorporated in educational programs to train students from high school, college, and graduate programs, as well as postdoctoral researchers. The research findings will be communicated to the scientific community through presentations at local, national, and international meetings and by publications in peer-reviewed journals.   <br/><br/>It has been assumed that the enzyme peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) is essential for bacteria because of its ability to recycle transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules from peptide-tRNA complexes that dissociate from the ribosome during abortive cycles of translation. Recently, it has come to light that Pth is capable of cleaving peptidyl-tRNAs on ribosomes that have stopped making proteins with problematic sequences. This newly discovered involvement of Pth in translation quality control reveals that the reasons for the essentiality of this enzyme are yet to be fully understood. In this project, ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq), an approach that reveals the positions of ribosomes genome-wide, will help identify the gene sites in two model bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) where Pth acts as a rescue factor for ribosomes struggling to translate specific sequences. In addition, biochemical and structural approaches will be used to reveal the mechanistic principles underlying Pth-driven ribosome rescue. The project will advance our understanding of strategies for protein synthesis quality control. The findings of the project may guide future research to design novel antibiotics and treatments for diseases associated with defective protein synthesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this collaborative project researchers examine the emergence of one such imperial formation at an archaeological site that saw the transformation from an independent city-state into a tributary city. The expansion of ancient territorial empires has historically resulted in profound changes to the material culture and daily life of such settlements, regardless of their resistance to imperial incorporation. Existing research has predominantly focused on the evidence from the pre- and post-imperial control periods in such locations. However, pre-imperial traces of socio-political organization were often purposely erased or altered with the arrival of new ideologies and strategies of empire building. This makes it difficult to understand how societies adapted or resisted to imperial incorporation. Archaeology can provide insight by looking at contexts of continuous cultural practices like places of worship, rituals, and public activities that remained undisrupted, and thus, see variations on cultural traditions and learn how people responded to imposing external ideologies and governing in the past. This research provides insights into how local ethnicities maintained, modified, or altered their traditions in the service of new political systems are pertinent for comprehending how indigenous communities respond to contemporary foreign global expansions.

Understanding how muscle controls movement is essential for animal performance and evolution, and for maintaining human health throughout life. However, muscle function during fast, unsteady motions in complex environments cannot be accurately predicted by current models.  Current understanding is limited by isolation among fields, resulting in knowledge gaps between ?bottom-up? reductionist approaches that characterize molecules and tissues and ?top down? organismal approaches that focus on animal behavior. The Integrative Movement Sciences Institute (IMSI) will bridge these gaps by connecting ?bottom-up? and ?top-down? approaches to integrate the contributions of mechanical, neural, and sensory systems to movement control. An interdisciplinary team spanning 21 institutions across the country will lead scientific research and training to integrate investigations across structural levels and timescales from molecules to organisms and nanoseconds to generations. The IMSI collaborative network will train scientists in interdisciplinary teamwork, mathematical modeling, data analysis, and open data sharing. IMSI activities will drive innovation in biophysics, physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience, and engineering. Understanding the muscular control of agile movement has wide-reaching applications in bio-technology and the bio-economy through design of movement therapies, rehabilitation programs and mobility assistance devices.<br/><br/>Dynamic muscle function forms a critical foundation for an integrative understanding of movement, yet it remains a fundamental challenge to predict muscle force output in fast and unsteady conditions. IMSI will integrate muscular control of movement across scales by critically examining assumptions of current approaches, developing new experiments and models to bridge ?bottom-up? and ?top-down? perspectives, and constructing a dynamic muscle movement paradigm to transform basic science, clinical and technical applications. Cross-cutting themes include unsteady and perturbed movements, multiscale modeling, and unifying invertebrate, vertebrate, and human studies. Research Cores include: (1) intrinsic muscle dynamics with rheological and X-ray diffraction experiments at nanometer to organismal scales; (2) embedded neuromechanical control to investigate how intrinsic mechanics and sensorimotor networks shape unsteady movement; (3) resilience and versatility to determine how variation in musculoskeletal properties and capacity drive whole-body movement; (4) risk-reward and learning, to determine how experience leads to movement optimization when navigating environmental risks and rewards; and (5) diversity and convergence in motor systems to characterize evolution of dynamic muscle function. IMSI faculty have expertise ranging from molecular biophysics of muscle proteins to animal ecology and human-machine interaction. The team-based science, near-peer mentorship and co-supervisory structure will foster community and provide trainees with a wide mentor network from a range of institutions from primarily undergraduate institutions to research intensive institutions, creating a training pipeline from undergraduates to faculty.

The seed laser will produce a 10-milliwatt laser beam, which is passed through the phase modulator where it is modulated at high speeds (10-100 gigabit per second). After the modulator, the modulated beam is boosted via an optical amplifier and passed through a collimator to generate a collimated, high-power beam. The collimator launches the beam into free space and directs it to a steering mirror for coverage of its field of regard. It is envisioned that the system could achieve transmission speeds as high as 100 gigabit per second.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this collaborative project researchers examine the emergence of one such imperial formation at an archaeological site that saw the transformation from an independent city-state into a tributary city. The expansion of ancient territorial empires has historically resulted in profound changes to the material culture and daily life of such settlements, regardless of their resistance to imperial incorporation. Existing research has predominantly focused on the evidence from the pre- and post-imperial control periods in such locations. However, pre-imperial traces of socio-political organization were often purposely erased or altered with the arrival of new ideologies and strategies of empire building. This makes it difficult to understand how societies adapted or resisted to imperial incorporation. Archaeology can provide insight by looking at contexts of continuous cultural practices like places of worship, rituals, and public activities that remained undisrupted, and thus, see variations on cultural traditions and learn how people responded to imposing external ideologies and governing in the past. This research provides insights into how local ethnicities maintained, modified, or altered their traditions in the service of new political systems are pertinent for comprehending how indigenous communities respond to contemporary foreign global expansions. The team generates new comparative methods for the study of empire expansion while strengthening the relationship between current local and indigenous communities and their archaeological heritage through a collaborative research process including interpretation, community dissemination, and efforts at site conservation as well as training opportunities for archaeology students.<br/><br/>The team will conduct a multi-year effort focused on excavation of five public religious and funerary complexes such as pyramid-plaza compounds dating to the critical window of empire formation using mortuary analyses, precise mapping with LiDAR, GPS, and photogrammetry, and several dating methods including C14, archaeomagnetism, and bone collagen.

These novel materials, termed dual-atom alloys, consist of an energetically stable pair of different metal atoms embedded in the surface of a host metal. Compared to single-atom alloys, a similar class of materials with well-defined active sites, dual-atom alloy active sites are anticipated to be more reactive and enable more challenging reactions including targeted bond scission.  However, accelerating the discovery of novel alloys requires addressing numerous challenges including identifying promising combinations of metals from the large materials space of potential pairings, understanding their structure/function relationships, and creating an effective feedback loop between experiment and computation. Dr. Montemore and his students will use machine learning combined with density functional theory (DFT) to identify candidate structures based on surface stability and low energy barriers for specific chemical reactions. Dr. Sykes and his students will experimentally synthesize, characterize, and test the predicted structures. Their discoveries could lead to the development of an entirely new class of catalysts where well-defined metal atomic structures can be combined with predictive models to accelerate a range of multistep reaction mechanisms. In addition to these broad scientific impacts, this project will also support a virtual reality K-12 outreach workshop, provide mentorship for Hispanic scientists and engineers, and inspire students from underserved high schools by facilitating a Reverse Science Fair.<br/><br/>Dual-atom alloys leverage several of the advantages of single-atom alloys: a well-defined active site that allows clear correspondence across computation, surface science, and reactor studies; opportunities to deviate from linear correlations in reaction energetics; and unique electronic structure. Just as with single-atom alloys, in which surface science experiments and computation preceded catalyst synthesis and testing, Montemore and Sykes will couple theory and surface science experiments to explore dual-atom alloy structure-reactivity space. This research is expected to lead to the development of structure-function relationships on a broad set of well-defined active sites, which would then serve as a guide to the larger heterogenous catalysis community. Furthermore, these studies have the potential to uncover new classes of materials with high catalytic performance, a particular need for reactions that are challenging with traditional heterogeneous catalysts, such as selective cross-couplings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, implementing memory consistency correctly is notoriously non-intuitive and complex. Memory consistency is a significant source of hardware design bugs. As such, the ability to formally verify the correctness of implementations before manufacture and distribution is desirable. Unfortunately, comprehensive verification to rule out these subtle bugs is difficult. Consequently, real-world products often exhibit buggy behavior in the field. In spite of its importance, the intractability of formal verification at meaningful scales has thus far resulted in either (1) less-than-complete  approaches based on collections of tests, which are by no means comprehensive, or (2) comprehensive  verification of simple cores that are not representative of modern out-of-order processors. To address this problem, this project develops a formal verification framework -- QED -- to verify that an RTL (register-transfer-level) implementation of a modern, out-of-order processor with a cache hierarchy is compliant with a given memory consistency model (MCM). The project?s novelties are (1) a divide-and-conquer approach to isolate and focus on memory consistency violations separately from other verification tasks (such as pipeline verification) that are well-studied, (2) novel ways to  provably reduce the number of instructions to be considered, (3) an automatic way to scalably consider all possible reorderings by ignoring reorderings that are provably unobservable, and (4) reducing the RTL verification burden to that of checking specific, narrow predicates (binary questions) on the RTL implementation.  The project?s impacts are (1) tackling the grand-challenge MCM verification problem that is of high importance to the computer hardware industry, and (2) training graduate researchers in the field of MCM verification.<br/><br/>The key insights and observations behind the project?s innovations are as follows. QED reduces the memory ordering problem from having to consider arbitrary instruction sequence ordering (which is intractably large) to having to consider only pairwise instruction ordering (which is in the hundreds-thousands range) to achieve the same ordering guarantees. QED is able to further reduce the number of instruction reorderings to consider by leveraging  the notion of ?unobservable? reorderings -- instruction reorderings that produce the same values as the original order, which can thus be ignored safely in the verification effort. The team of investigators will develop formal un-reordering rules that will enable automatic verification of arbitrary implementations. Combining the above innovations, it is possible to consider all possible interleavings of pairs of memory accesses (and arbitrary external events) and develop a decision-tree-based verification framework that is scalable to any number of cores and any number of instructions. The nodes of the decision tree are effectively predicates about the implementation, which can also be automatically checked by QED's proposed automatic RTL predicate checkers. In combination, the techniques enable QED to feasibly verify the consistency behavior of modern, out-of-order processors with cache hierarchies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, chips carry near-infrared signals for communication, visible signals for imaging, and mid-infrared for thermal radiation and sensing applications. Conversion between these chips through electronics-driven detection and emission limits efficiency and operation speed. This research effort addresses the problem of efficient frequency conversion on a chip. It connects signals across five octaves of light through nonlinear and quantum light-matter interactions in designer nanostructures called photonic-phononic metasurfaces. Photonic-phononic metasurfaces will be conceived using modern tools of nanotechnology, as well as rigorous numerical design approaches and state-of-the-art optical testing tools, including femtosecond lasers and single-photon correlation techniques.

The researchers are conducting two studies that identify the linguistic elements used by such speakers and how those elements are perceived by various groups of people. The first part of this project examines how people who are minoritized in multiple ways describe different ways that people discuss identity. They determine a set of language features that these speakers use to express their identities and acoustically analyze them using phonetic software. They also conduct an experiment where listeners with varying degrees of shared identities with the speakers hear sentences that have been phonetically manipulated to shift listeners? social perceptions. In this experiment, listeners hear each sentence and rate the speaker on various social dimensions. This research adds needed breadth within linguistic studies of identity and how language influences social perceptions in new communities. Findings from this project are shared with the communities that are being studied, expanding the reach of scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It enables applications across various fields and has garnered significant attention from both industry and academia. However, the limited resources on edge platforms, such as edge servers and Internet of Things devices, hinder the ability to deliver fast and accurate responses to queries from deep learning prediction tasks. As a result, only some deep learning tasks and smaller DNN models suitable for edge deployment are feasible. To overcome this limitation, this project explores a new adaptive approach in building deep learning systems. The systems will make real-time adjustments to the DNNs executed for prediction tasks based on the varying resource demands arising from three critical dimensions -- variable task complexity, fluctuating inference workloads, and resource contention in multi-tenant edge environments. The goal is to optimize both system efficiency and accuracy. Realizing the envisioned adaptiveness will facilitate the effective deployment of deep learning techniques across diverse applications and environments. <br/><br/>This research has the potential to open new possibilities for the development of novel edge applications that were previously limited by resource constraints. It will enable a broader range of deep learning tasks to be executed on edge platforms, along with more powerful DNN models, a capability critical in fully unleashing the potential of edge intelligence. The practical impact of the project will be demonstrated in a variety of applications, and in particular, applications that enhance elder care through collaboration with the Massachusetts AI and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer?s Disease. Moreover, this project aims to cultivate a pipeline of skilled engineers and computer scientists with interdisciplinary expertise in computer systems and machine learning.

One project is concerned with the rate of transfer of energy in the excited molecule to another molecule, where theory will be developed that describes the process in terms of electrons excited in the donor molecule that transfer their energy to electrons in the acceptor molecule. By using a special model of interactions of electronic states of the molecules, the theory makes it possible to incorporate the influence of other nearby molecules or nanoparticles on the energy transfer process, and in some cases leading to enhanced rates or increased range of transfer, as is important in many kinds of optical devices. Another component of the research is concerned with the influence of quantum light in the form of entangled photons on the light absorption. Here time-dependent quantum theory is used to study the evolution of entanglement as energy transfers from light to electrons (i.e., converting quantum light to quantum electrons).  Also being studied are the properties of molecules that are in the entangled states to understand how their properties are different from those in unentangled states. This work is fundamental to technologies involved in photon-based quantum computers and in devices for secure communications. The students and postdocs who work on this project, including a significant number of women and minorities, will be trained in theory development and computational applications that they can use for both academic and industrial jobs related to new device technologies.  In addition, there will be outreach to K-12 groups, undergraduate training, numerous seminars and workshops, and communication with the public.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor George Schatz and his team will develop theories and computational methods for (1) describing single photon resonant energy transfer between molecules using real-time electronic structure methods, (2) characterizing the entanglement properties of molecular electronic (and vibronic) states, with emphasis on states that are excited by two-photon absorption, and (3) developing a time-domain description of the excitation of molecules by two-entangled photons that couples quantum electrodynamics to electronic structure theory to study the evolution of entanglement from photons to electrons as characterized using measures of the entanglement known as entanglement witness. The proposed research addresses several knowledge gaps that relate to the interaction of both classical and quantum light with molecules in complex environments.  The use of real-time electronic structure methods for energy transfer provides the opportunity to describe energy transfer mediated by nearby molecules or nanoparticles. For quantum light that involves entangled photons, it has recently been demonstrated that photon entanglement can for some problems be converted into electronic entanglement, but the underlying rules for this are not known. The proposed research will use concepts from quantum information science to characterize the electronic entanglement properties of molecules that are important in two photon absorption, including collectivity/Schmidt numbers and Shannon entropy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project proposes that societies must expand from their ?communities of practice?, which center on science, to incorporate ?communities of care?, which center on people. The researchers have already developed and tested a three-stage approach for scientific society leadership that includes education, reflection, and guided action planning within this conceptual framework. This project will engage 5 US-based scientific societies in a series of critically evaluated listening sessions, workshops, and events that address both internal structures (society leadership) and external structures (journal and conference organization). Using this approach, the researchers will coordinate the initial implementation and evaluations for actionable opportunities with ?community of care?-guided goals in each of these scientific societies. This project encompasses broader impacts by working to change discipline-level cultural values and through its direct support of over 100 scientists from diverse backgrounds and career-stages.<br/><br/>This project has already generated buy-in from 5 US-based conference societies and their journals, which demonstrates proof of concept for the Biology community?s commitment to new, evidence-based approaches for inclusion. The guided action planning will draw from the expertise of existing evidence-based strategies developed in informal learning and corporate settings for community building. A major strength of this parallel approach is that it will catalyze a broader movement around proven cultural change methods than a single society can otherwise drive. Using a modular, flexible approach rooted in sociological and psychological peer-reviewed research will allow the researchers to generate support from societies? leadership and membership who are invested in seeing their communities become more diverse, inclusive, and equitable but do not have the social and emotional tools or abundant resources to do so in a sustainable way.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RNA molecules underlie the origin of life on Earth and fundamental processes across all modern life forms, ranging from viruses to humans to the microorganisms that dominate the planet?s fixation of carbon. Researchers currently imagine that most RNA molecules wiggle and shift shapes to carry out their functions, but experimentally visualizing the many conformations of any RNA has been difficult. The broader impacts of the proposed research include establishing standardized data sets and methods disseminated through challenges, publications, public data, and code to the broad community of scientists who are now focusing on RNA, including experts, biotechnology companies, academic trainees from underrepresented backgrounds, and citizen scientists who engage in RNA research through a long-standing video game called Eterna. If successful, this work will drive the development of methods that could be applied to visualize and dissect many RNA-based machines of biological or biotechnological interest.  <br/><br/>The proposed research has two aims: (1) to design, model, and experimentally probe RNA systems with discrete conformational states whose populations can be intentionally tuned, and (2) to characterize and challenge the broader artificial intelligence and computational communities to predict the continuous conformational ensembles of ribozymes, riboswitches, and synthetic RNAs. In both aims, the research will evaluate accuracy through double-blind studies in which predictions from one set of personnel ? including independent labs, Eterna citizen scientists, and predictors in the biennial Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction ? will be tested through experimental data collected by an independent set of personnel. The research will advance innovative interdisciplinary approaches, bringing together high-throughput RNA biochemistry, crowdsourcing, computer modeling, and cutting-edge cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in the labs of the principal investigators, as well as the state of the art in deep learning research, molecular dynamics simulations, and sociology through collaborators and community-wide open science challenges. The research seeks to attain generality beyond any specific system through analysis of molecules drawn from viruses, bacteria, protozoans, metazoans, and from the imaginations of RNA nanotechnologists and citizen scientists. Finally, the research has the potential to benefit society through broader impacts in biotechnology and through educational opportunities involving direct mentorship of trainees from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds and active learning through the Eterna citizen science platform and an Eterna Academy massive open online course.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the integration of renewables through power electronic inverters introduces uncertainties to grid planning and operations due to their intermittent and variable nature. While battery-based energy storage systems can mitigate the impacts from renewables, they are also integrated through power electronic inverters. All these factors are shaping today?s power grid into an inverter-dense grid, posing a considerable challenge in the computer simulation of its tremendously complex, multi-timescale dynamics, ranging from microseconds to hours. This project aims to establish a unified multi-timescale modeling and solution framework addressing this challenge, and will bring transformative changes to the field of power system simulation. The intellectual merits of the project include assimilating heterogeneous multiscale methods and semi-analytical solution methods for highly accurate and efficient simulations. The broader impacts of the project include an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of inverter-dense grids, the establishment of a high-performance multi-timescale simulator paradigm, the fostering of interdisciplinary education and the facilitation of power grid decarbonization. <br/><br/>Power system simulation is crucial for assessing grid stability and reliability under disturbances. The multi-timescale behaviors of an inverter-dense grid may involve electromagnetic transient, electromechanical and quasi-steady-state dynamics. Accurate simulation of such a system requires solving numerous nonlinear and stiff differential and algebraic equations at a small time step over an extended period. The heterogeneous multiscale methods developed by the project will allow case-specific model reduction and solver parameterization to enable automatic zoom-in and -out of the simulation resolution between macroscopic and microscopic timescales on the fly of simulation. Variable-step and -order mechanisms will be employed in each timescale through semi-analytical solvers. The validation studies will encompass sub-synchronous oscillation, transient stability, and black-start scenarios in realistic grid models with a penetration of inverter-based resources ranging from 50% to 100%. The results from the project have the potential to advance knowledge in efficient simulation methodologies, which are also applicable to other multi-timescale networked systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central focus of the conference - and the dedicated aim of its first day - is to encourage a high level of participation by women in math and physics. The first day is designed to encourage junior researchers to come and network, give talks in a friendly environment,  and participate without concern over the precise fit of their research to the narrow theme of the workshop. <br/><br/>The conference Arithmetic Quantum Field Theory, and the two-month program of the same title it concludes, are aimed at catalyzing interactions between mathematicians and physicists by disseminating exciting new connections emerging between quantum field theory and algebraic number theory, and in particular between the fundamental invariants of each: partition functions and L-functions.  On one hand, there has been tremendous progress in the past decade in our understanding of the algebraic structures underlying quantum field theory as expressed in terms of the geometry and topology of low-dimensional manifolds. On the other hand, the arithmetic topology dictionary provides a sturdy bridge between the topology of manifolds and the arithmetic of number fields. Thus, one can now port over quantum field theoretic ideas to number theory. The program will bring together a wide range of mathematicians and physicists working on adjacent areas to explore the emerging notion of arithmetic quantum field theory as a tool to bring quantum physics to bear on questions of interest for the theory of automorphic forms, harmonic analysis and L-functions, and conversely to explore potential geometric and physical consequences of arithmetic ideas.<br/>The conference website is https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event/aqftconf/ where recordings of the talks and notes from lectures will be made widely available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both landslides initiated on steep, forested slopes; the 11-Mile Slide killed six people and cut off power, telephone landlines, and access to about 75 homes, while the Middle Ridge Slide initiated at a switchback of a gravel road. The team of investigators on this RAPID project hypothesize that 1) the high winds combined with moderate rainfall of the November 2023 storm triggered the Wrangell landslides, and 2) the presence of a gravel road affected the extent and trajectory of the Middle Ridge Slide. The team's primary objective is to capture the ephemeral data from these landslides to determine their initiation mechanisms and processes, soil thickness, and the role that trees and infrastructure played.  What is learned from analysis of the data will inform the development of early warning systems for communities throughout Southeast Alaska. A post-data collection workshop will provide the Wrangell community with a greater understanding of local geology and landslide mechanisms, and an opportunity to guide the direction of future early warning systems and/or landslide event response.<br/><br/>The investigators will capture field data that can be incorporated into landslide models, thereby constraining input parameters with on-the-ground measurements to allow for back analysis of these landslide events.

As a result, conservation programs have sought to minimize human impact on the landscape through land management programs and resettlement of people who called national parks home. One such national park is located in one of the most biodiverse regions on earth. In the belief that humans may be negatively impacting this biodiversity, the livelihoods of long-term residents have been significantly altered. They have been discouraged from carrying out farming, herding animals, gathering wood for fire or building houses and are also no longer allowed to hunt. The terraces on which they once lived are being actively reforested as part of a national conservation program. In addition, the location of their traditional settlements are being shifted from high altitude terraces to valley bottoms: a process that may expose the parks inhabitants to geomorphological hazards such as landslides. However, archaeological evidence suggests that the concern that people are negatively impacting the environment may be misplaced and shows that people have occupied this landscape for thousands of years. <br/><br/>An interdisciplinary team conducts excavations and employs archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological, geomorphological and isotopic evidence at a key site to answer how humans managed forests, planted crops, managed their animals and managed erosional processes over deep time. As the original community members of the valley are being resettled, traditional knowledge associated with how landscapes, plants and animals were managed is being eroded.  These community resources are, however, critically important to local identity.  Project personnel who are native to the region are being partnered with during fieldwork to co-produce results and to record terms and uses of key plants/animals and technologies in local languages; contributing to language preservation and sovereignty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the data to be used in this project already exists from previous buoy spectrometer observations, this work focuses on reanalyzing the data, comparing the data to other observations, and conducting modeling experiments to examine the potential iodine-influenced atmospheric chemistry in the Arctic. The main hypothesis to be tested in this proposed work is that while reactive bromine still dominates ozone depletion chemistry for most of the Arctic, chemical synergies with reactive iodine may accelerate the process, particularly in some regions. Success in this project is likely to have a strong positive impact on the Arctic atmospheric chemistry community, the broader climate research community, and the public.<br/><br/>In the previous NSF-funded project, which focused primarily on bromine chemistry, the research team utilized multiple-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations from free-floating buoys as a part of the NSF Arctic Observing Network and determined that bromine is the dominant ozone depleting reactive halogen in the Arctic. New research indicates that iodine may have a more critical role than previously assumed. These existing measurements will now be reanalyzed with a focus on iodine chemistry and compared to recent observations of halogens within the Arctic. Seasonal and regional distributions of iodine and bromine amounts will be quantified and validated with collaborative ground-level measurements and a 1-D chemical model will be used to determine the relative role of iodine and bromine in ozone depletion chemistry at buoy locations.

With the power of the internet, there's a fast-growing global interest in forming distributive gas sensing networks that could enable us to continuous monitor gas threat broadly. This has led to a rising demand for the next generation of small, lightweight, low-power, and low-cost gas sensing devices with high sensing performance. Despite the remarkable sensing capabilities offered by mid-wave infrared gas sensing methods, substantial challenges persist in reducing device size, power consumption, and production costs, limiting their application in modern sensor network scenarios. This research project thus aims to explore innovative mid-wave infrared photonic engineering methods to advance gas sensing technologies, striving for efficiency, compactness, and cost-effectiveness. Beyond the research focus, the project also fosters a STEM-competent workforce in photonics. Photonics is foundational to many cutting-edge technologies, impacting a significant portion of the economy and enabling future advanced manufacturing processes. To stimulate the future generation?s interest in light and photonics, the PI will create an education outreach program to help rural STEM teachers to develop new photonic teaching modules, and to promote student participation in afterschool education events. The PI will also engage undergraduate students in research activities to support their STEM career path.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive understanding of quantum-inspired new states of light within the mid-wave infrared range, spanning 3-5 microns. The obtained knowledge will facilitate the control of their non-trivial light-matter interaction properties to enhance the performance of three critical optical components in mid-wave infrared gas sensing systems: the light source, photodetector, and light-gas interaction waveguide. The intellectual merit lies in the marriage of quantum-inspired parity-time-symmetry and topological photonic principles with the mid-wave infrared photonic engineering research. Specifically, this project will pursue three research objectives: 1) enabling parity-time-symmetry control in active resonant gratings to overcome the low extraction efficiency and multimodal broadband emission constraints and facilitate the development of bright and cost-effective mid-wave infrared light emitters; 2) employing a novel low-cost, self-oriented wet chemical synthesis method to prepare high-quality PbSe thin films for boosting the performance of uncooled mid-wave infrared photodetectors; and 3) engineering topological sensing waveguides to overcome the inherent limitations of on-chip gas sensing, such as intrinsic structural disorder and fabrication resolution. Overall, the project's outcomes will broaden the portfolio of mid-wave infrared photonic engineering strategies, elevating their technological impact to revolutionize gas sensing technologies while adhering to size, weight, power, and cost requirements.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems division(ECCS), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lakes are widely regarded as sentinels of climate change and, among these, polar lakes are the most sensitive. Beneath meters of permanent ice and liquid water, many Antarctic lakes contain complex microbial communities that are already being transformed by climate change. The structurally complex spatial patterns that these microbes create provide the opportunity to pursue research questions about spatial ecology that cannot be addressed elsewhere. This project focuses on research that will advance understanding of the spatial structure of benthic communities in Antarctic lakes, their relationships with environmental conditions, and predictions for likely changes in the future. This project will also advance methods in integrating the morphology and spatial patterning of modern microbial communities in relationship to their biophysical and biochemical environments. The quantitative framework being developed has potential to refine understanding of controls on microbial community patterning and thus interpretation of both the effects of climate change and ancient fossil microbial communities in the geologic record. Such understanding will address key questions about Earth?s evolutionary and environmental history and future.<br/><br/>Lake Vanda in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctic, has modern microbial pinnacles covering its lake floor. Using existing datasets on spatial structure of benthic communities from 37 sites on the floor of Lake Vanda, the project team will apply recent theories from Spatial Ecology to investigate the mechanisms that give rise to spatial patterns of pinnacles formed by benthic microbes. The work addresses two questions: (1) What are the morphological and spatial patterns of pinnacles and how do they vary over developmental stages, along environment gradients, and from 2013 to 2023? And (2) what mechanisms give rise to the geometry of individual pinnacles and their spatial distribution? Lake Vanda provides an exceptional opportunity to address these questions. It features well characterized gradients in sedimentation, nutrients, irradiance, transport mechanism, and colonization history. Benthic communities at different locations in the lake manifest distinct spatial patterns, as they experience distinct conditions. Lake level has increased  >10 m in the past few decades, creating additional opportunities for a ?natural experiment? on pattern development by comparing relatively newly flooded substrates (pinnacles of 1 to 15 years old) with deeper, well-developed mats (> 70 years old). Since microbial communities respond to environmental change rapidly, analyses can characterize changes in patterns in pinnacle spatial data collected 9 years apart (Dec 2013 and Jan 2023), providing the opportunity to directly assess responses of spatially self-organized ecosystems to environmental change. As such, Lake Vanda is a natural laboratory that allows research (1) to effectively sort out mechanisms of pattern formation affecting benthic microbial communities residing there; and (2) to test the theory of spatial self-organization: mechanisms of pattern formation and responses to perturbations, applicable to ecosystems worldwide. Research questions will be addressed by integrating existing datasets, spatial pattern analyses, Bayesian statistical models, and process-based numerical models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, more than 2 billion people are iron deficient because their plant-based diets are not a rich source of iron, making iron deficiency the most prevalent nutritional problem in the world today. Clearly, understanding iron metabolism in plants is crucial, both from the point of view of improving plant growth and crop yields, as well as improving human nutrition.  Despite progress in tracing how iron moves throughout the plant, scientists still do not understand how plants integrate information about iron supply and light conditions. This project will help to explain how a protein called URI receives and then conveys information about both the iron status of a cell and light quality.  In partnership with the New Hampshire Academy of Science, students in grades 6-12 will be offered research experiences that will raise their appreciation for all that plants do and teach them how to leverage the power of plants to ensure long term sustainability and health. NHAS runs summer and after school discovery-based scientific research programs for students from a wide geographic section of NH and VT. Their outreach covers rural areas where students generally have few opportunities to experience authentic scientific research.  Broader impacts will also include training the next generation of scientists. Undergraduates from several different mentoring programs will participate in the proposed work.<br/><br/>Iron is an essential nutrient for plants, yet too much iron can be toxic.  Therefore, plants only take up iron when needed. The essential bHLH transcription factor, URI/bHLH121, is required for mounting the iron deficiency response.  A phosphorylated form of URI accumulates under iron deficiency, forms heterodimers with subgroup bHLH IVc transcription factors and induces transcription of another class of transcription factors, the sub-group Ib bHLH. These Ib bHLH in turn heterodimerize with FIT/bHLH29, and drive the transcription of the genes encoding the iron transporter IRT1 and the ferric chelate reductase FRO2, to increase iron uptake. Although the mechanisms controlling iron uptake from the soil are now relatively well understood, little is known about how URI may integrate information about iron supply and light conditions.  Light is required for URI phosphorylation, suggesting that a light-regulated kinase is involved.  Genetic experiments were designed to determine whether URI phosphorylation is a red light or blue light response, and whether members of the photoregulatory kinase (PPK) family are involved.  Experiments will also address a second point in the iron deficiency pathway where light information is required, namely the induction of the FIT transcription factor. The long-term goal is to understand the entire network of genes responsible for orchestrating a coordinated response to iron deficiency at the whole plant level. Such an understanding will transform efforts towards sustainable improvements of crop yields, in terms of plant productivity and nutrient content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They represent a key link in the polar food web as they are prey for penguins, seals and toothed whales. These fish have evolved in the constant, extreme cold for millions of years and therefore, are very sensitive to the increasing water temperatures associated with global warming. These studies will investigate the impacts of incremental heat exposure on the biology of these fishes by examining their ability to respond, or inability to respond, to elevated temperatures. The project will employ cutting-edge technology to examine responses at the cellular level that may help these environmentally sensitive fishes adapt to the challenges of global warming. The primary goal is to increase our collective understanding of how polar ecosystems are likely to be impacted in the coming decades.<br/><br/>Part 2:  The proposed research is designed to use an existing bank of frozen tissues from a species of cold-adapted Antarctic fish to investigate protein-level responses to heat stress. These samples were collected earlier in the PI's career during fieldwork at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Four tissues (control as well as heat- stressed) will be analyzed via mass spectrometry to characterize their proteome, defined as the entire complement of proteins in a sample. This includes both identification and quantification of these proteins. The goal is to determine what mechanisms of response to elevated temperature are available to the extremely cold-adapted, stenothermic fishes of Antarctica. Follow-up analyses will use immunoblotting (Western blotting) with antibodies specific to a sub-set of proteins revealed to be heat-responsive in the proteomic analyses. As this is a Mid-Career Advancement Award, training and mentorship in proteomic analyses for the PI will be supported, with time spent at the partner institution, the University of California, Davis. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>While there has been an increase in the use of genomic technologies to probe gene expression profiles in Antarctic species, few studies exist looking at protein level changes during exposure to heat stress in these organisms. Therefore, the proposed studies would represent a large leap forward in our understanding of how these environmentally sensitive species can, or cannot, respond at the cellular level as the Earth continues to warm and water temperatures rise. As proteins do the ""work"" in the cell, it's vital to understand which proteins are present and in what quantity and how dynamic this ""proteome"" is during stress. The proposed studies would provide this information for thousands of proteins, using already existing samples. The findings would be entirely novel and would allow us a much better picture of how animals that evolved in the cold for millions of years are likely to respond to climate change. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The PI has established relationships with several regional K-12 institutions and will continue to provide outreach in the form of classroom visits and the creation of classroom curricula. The PI has an on-going collaboration with the Oregon Coast Aquarium (Newport, OR) to create novel teaching materials for grades 6-8. The Aquarium has partners in surrounding school districts and will help disseminate videos about marine biology and climate change. Modules concerning polar species will be created under this proposal. An interactive website will be created demonstrating the Antarctic food web. All of the proteomic analyses and libraries generated under this award will be made publicly available for use by any interested researcher.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project proposes and tests a model of the interdependence between stress, cognition, changes in the abundance of resources, and group decision-making. The model contributes to the science of group decision-making by investigating how stress (biology) and resources (the environment) impact how groups make decisions. The model seeks to explain why some groups of diverse people coalesce and effectively manage shared resources in uncertain environments, while others fail. The results of the project inform decision-makers faced with complex challenges related to climate variability, public health, and defense by building tools for diverse teams to cultivate systems thinking, manage shared resources, and improve cooperation over time. The project also broadens participation in online education and systems thinking skills.<br/><br/>This project develops and tests an embedded Model of Adaptive Capacity (eACM). The eACM proposes that the capacity of groups to continually solve complex problems depends on the ability of individuals to cognize key challenges in a resource system and to converge on joint solutions to those challenges. The eACM couples resource dynamics with individual variation in mind-body systems through the process of group sensemaking. Sensemaking occurs when groups create an understanding of their environment and form joint plans of action for cooperation. The project tests the eACM through behavioral experiments and manipulation of stress. Formal models of the systems dynamics of group decision-making aid in generalizing the results of the experiments.

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. <br/><br/>This project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them. The project team will also train hundreds of early career scientists, whose research and teaching will benefit from the easy manipulation and use of digital biological specimens. Additionally, bootcamp opportunities will transform motivated grad students and post-docs into future inventors of new analytical tools and functionalities, which will grow the community of morphologists working in digital environments.  MorphoCloud will make working with digital biological specimen data as routine as working with genomics data, so that biologists can focus on their scientific questions rather than get bogged down with complex workflows, technicalities, and limited resources. Proposed cloud services and analytical tools will also make wider-scale, multi-lab collaborations friction-free, via derived data exchange of 3D phenotypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fast growth of renewable energy will lead to the low-inertia issue that substantially impacts the grid frequency stability. Addressing this low-inertia challenge is crucial for grid operations. The project will bring transformative change in enhancing power system frequency stability while ensuring sufficient power capacities to meet the electrical demand. This will be achieved by leveraging advanced machine learning technologies to accurately predict critical frequency stability metrics, which will be integrated into the day-ahead energy scheduling model. The intellectual merits of the project include developing a novel frequency-constrained energy scheduling model, and using machine learning to reduce model complexity and enhance computational efficiency. The broader impacts of the project include promoting the grid integration of sustainable energy, developing open-source curriculum, and encouraging the engagement of a broad range of students in research and educational activities.<br/><br/>In most practical power systems, traditional synchronous generators are gradually being replaced by inverter-based resources such as wind and solar power. This transition will introduce the low-inertia challenge to grid operation and stability. However, traditional day-ahead unit commitment models cannot effectively consider the impact of this emerging challenge. To bridge the gap, this project will develop an innovative frequency-constrained unit commitment (FCUC) model by leveraging optimization methods and machine learning technologies especially graph neural networks. This project will first develop a frequency stability performance metric estimation model and then integrate it into FCUC as additional constraints to enforce frequency stability requirements. Moreover, this project will develop machine learning-assisted approaches to reduce the model complexity of FCUC by converting a subset of variables into constants and eliminating unnecessary nonbinding constraints. Lastly, this project will develop machine learning-assisted accelerated decomposition algorithms to further enhance computational efficiency and ensure quality solutions can be obtained within the specified timeframe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It aims to use this critical period in the history of science to bring attention to how Indigenous people in the Hispanic world made key contributions to modern botany, as well as exploring how earlier societies dealt with the rapid influx of new information in an Information Age of their own. Many plants are familiar to global audiences, including marigolds from Mexico, citruses from China, lilies from South Africa, and many more. Most of these plants became familiar to global audiences only after the rise of the colonial empires, when regular cross-oceanic voyages made the transfer of plants, animals, people, and information around the world faster and easier than ever before. The results of this project will illustrate the many ways in which people have understood the natural world over time, recognizing the continued co-existence of multiple worldviews in different places.

These new hydrogel elastomers have the potential for broad impact across the U.S. healthcare and medical device industries. Their utility as both a low-friction, durable structural design material and as a bio-inert surface coating alternative makes them relevant in a wide range of new and existing medical device technologies. To avoid environmentally damaging perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) substances, the need for new, low friction, durable polymer alternatives has become more acute. This technology is in a prime position to fill an emerging void in the biomedical materials landscape. The potential broader impact can be extended to new tools, ranging from complex surgical instruments and implant technologies to simple wound care dressings and medical tubing.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) hydrogels possessing the necessary durability, elasticity, wear resistance, biostability, and biocompatibility to be considered as structural materials in medical device design. These materials were engineered to exhibit intrinsic surface lubricity at a range of material durometers while remaining perfluoroalkyl substance- (PFAS) and fluoropolymer-free. TPEs are key components in a broad range of medical devices, but there is a critical need for low friction lubricity at the exposed surface to minimize interactions with biological tissues. Existing TPE materials lack such lubricity, and biomedical device designers are forced to depend on expensive and complex hydrophilic surface treatments or on the use of hydrophobic, fluoropolymer liners or resin coatings to achieve low surface friction and biological surface passivation. Hydrogel based materials, with their intrinsic lubricity and tendency to suppress bioactivation, have been touted as possible players in such devices, and the hydrogel material technology this project explores would be one of the first on the market that can meet the durability demands required in most product applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, for youth, it is often presented as settled, a fixed collection of facts, principles, and theories that can seem sterile and unimaginative. This project is designed to combat that idea. This Research in Service to Practice project brings scientists, middle school youth and choreographers together to explore unsettled scientific phenomena from a complex systems perspective using choreography and agent-based modeling (ABM), to engage all participants in cutting edge scientific inquiry. Given the ubiquity of complex systems, being able to adopt a complex systems perspective is critical to understanding the world and our relationship to it. However, research has shown that this can be a challenge, specifically for youth. While most complex systems research has not focused on the role of the body, recent studies have shown the promise and potential of embodiment as its own form of reasoning about complex systems. Thus, this project will create exploratory science spaces foregrounding embodiment in the process of scientific discovery. The program has two phases: (1) a 20-hour training workshop where scientists and choreographers engage in interdisciplinary collaborative design work, and (2) a 60-hour summer program where the researcher-practitioner partnership involving scientists, choreographers and youth engages in agent- based & embodied choreographic scientific modeling. The summer program takes place in community-based centers in Gainesville, FL and Boston, MA broadening perceptions of what science research looks like and can be. Each site will host 20 youth, two local scientists, and a local choreographer. Participants will engage in embodied collaborative inquiry, brainstorming and modeling to create choreographic representations and culminate in a public event for the community. The project aims to understand the experiences of and shifts in youth and scientists as they engage in these activities and to understand how to design such a model for informal learning. The project will also help scientists apply a complex systems lens to their own work and settled perspectives. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. <br/><br/>Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, the project will develop and expand embodied and agent-based learning theories, while also piloting, analyzing, and refining collaborative models for science learning in informal spaces. The research questions are: 1. How does engaging in the process of creating embodied and agent-based models of complex systems contribute to new ways of understanding science, de-settle ideas about the process of how science gets ?made?, and impact understanding of the role of the body in making science? and 2. How can arrangements of bodies and modeling tools work together to support understanding of complex systems? The research and design are informed by three main theoretical principles: (a) science is ?dance of agency?, a process of inquiry that through iterative dialogic interaction with tools, technology, and humans, produces understandings that more and more closely explain natural phenomena; (b)  embodied-interactionist theories of learning allow us to understand representational sense-making by looking closely at the processes by which representations are made, not just at representational end- products; and (c) creative embodiment and agent based modeling are valuable tools for sense-making around complex science ideas and emergent phenomena. Two cycles of design, implementation, and analysis across two different informal learning sites will be conducted. Data will be collected at both sites, resulting in four implementation and data collection periods.  Each round of implementation will be staggered so that reflections and lessons from an implementation can inform the next design iteration. This project will provide insights on the relationship between choreography and ABM as tools for scientific sense-making and expand ABM to consider the role of movement and bodies more broadly in physical space. It will also contribute to an understanding of how underrepresented youth?s perceptions and conceptions of science can be shaped through embodied science activities, and of the relationships these youth see between their own bodies and identities, science, and the creative arts. Finally, by involving individuals from underrepresented communities as researchers, designers, scientists, evaluators, and advisors, this project expands cross-cultural and training opportunities within the field of education and STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Speech-language pathologists who treat speech disorders report that evidence-based treatment and resources for some sound pronunciations are scarce. Very few empirically-tested interventions are available that allow visualization of the acoustic speech signal, an evidence-based method to enhance learning. This software can also be implemented remotely via videoconferencing or telepractice, with the potential for significant impact on service providers, clinicians, and individuals. Ultimately, providing access to more efficient technology can improve communication and quality of life for many individuals.

The technology uses the form of a real-time linear predictive coding spectrum of the speech signal. Manipulating certain characteristics of speech, such as resonant frequencies of the vocal tract, is a complex concept. This software can be used across a wide range of devices and via videoconferencing.

How do these traits influence the success of individuals in producing more offspring (i.e. increasing fitness)? These questions are fundamental to our understanding of biological diversity but remain poorly understood. This project aims to explicitly link genes, traits, and fitness in a group of colorful songbirds, called wood warblers. The researchers have previously identified candidate genes responsible for differences in coloration in the group, particularly those involving carotenoid molecules. This project will test how those genetic differences actually translate into differences in the enzymes that interact with carotenoid molecules. The project will also include a field study of birds that differ in their carotenoid coloration to study how different coloration traits influence reproduction. In addition, given that carotenoids must be obtained from the diet?i.e. birds cannot synthesize them on their own?the project includes undergraduate researchers using molecular tools to test hypotheses about the diet of birds from fecal samples. Finally, to help broaden participation in science, inspire students, and entice them to learn more about the natural world, the project will develop a set of virtually immersive evolutionary biology experiences focused on avian ecology and evolution.<br/><br/>The research project focuses on wood warblers (Parulidae), a family of birds with over 100 species that diversified within the last 10 million years, and which has one of the fastest diversification rates across songbirds. The goal of the project is to study the evolutionary history of genes?and their function?potentially involved in the diversification of this group. The focus of the current study is on carotenoid processing genes, specifically beta carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2). This gene has been implicated in plumage coloration in these and other birds, yet it has not been functionally characterized outside of domesticated species. The goal will be to characterize the carotenoids present across the radiation of warblers, and also synthesize the multiple BCO2 protein variants and test how they interact in vitro with different carotenoid substrates. The work includes a field study of hybridizing Vermivora warblers, which differ in their BCO2 genotypes, to test whether these have an influence on phenotypes. This will require a multi-generational pedigree of individuals within the hybrid zone. Recognizing the dietary dependence of carotenoids, the project engages undergraduate researchers in using molecular tools to analyze fecal samples from these birds in the hybrid zone. This allows for testing hypotheses about the birds' diets, shedding light on the intricate relationship between gene expression, traits, and other ecological factors. Finally, the work includes a partnership with Penn State?s Center for Immersive Experiences to generate a set of virtual reality experiences and 360-degree videos that will give high-school and undergraduate students in central Pennsylvania a sense of the type of field work, as well as teach them about the biology and genetics of hybridization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nonetheless, existing technologies heavily depend on costly rare-earth permanent magnets, which present significant obstacles to achieving sustainability objectives and promoting electrification efforts. The demand for rare-earth permanent magnets, such as neodymium iron boron (NdFeB), is expected to surge more than 20 times to fulfill sustainable energy and transportation goals by 2050. The projected demand for rare-earth magnets in offshore wind turbine and electric vehicle applications will reach 36.3% (273.7 kt) and 35.3% (266 kt), respectively, which is more than 70% of the total demand. Therefore, identifying motor drives that are free from rare-earth elements yet maintain high-performance and efficiency is a significant area of research. <br/><br/>This CAREER project aims to develop a magnetically integrated electric drive system with a topologically optimized magnet-free and brushless wound-field flux-switching (WFFS) motor, eliminating the need for expensive rare-earth permanent magnets. The research involves optimizing the motor design to eliminate inefficient magnetic flux paths, co-designing the motor and the inverter for high torque density and thermal performance, and accurately quantifying motor and drive losses for advanced control technique development. The outcomes of this research have broader implications for various sectors, including electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, more electric aircraft, and industrial processes, where electric drives are vital components. By providing an alternative to rare-earth magnet-based drives, the project seeks to revolutionize industry and contribute to the development of sustainable and high-power density electric drives. The research also addresses environmental concerns and supply chain challenges associated with rare-earth materials, promoting sustainability in the transportation and renewable energy sectors. The research outcomes will contribute to the body of knowledge in the field and have a lasting impact on the transition to cleaner energy sources and sustainable transportation systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key feature of mMIMO is the ability for directional transmissions by suitably coordinating the settings of large number of antenna elements, which requires careful alters the signal characteristics of phase and amplitude for each element. In collaboration with Torsten Braun at the University of Bern, Switzerland, this project aims to address the challenge of computing the parameters required to properly configure these massive antenna arrays in real time using the concepts of reinforcement learning and federated learning (FL). This project will forge new connections not only between the U.S. and Switzerland through collaborative research, bi-directional visits, and joint coursework development, but also between machine learning and wireless communities. The PIs will give also record short video tutorials on applied machine learning targeting wireless engineers, and release these on media-sharing platforms. Finally, all findings derived from the research activities, including position/vision papers, will be disseminated in top peer-reviewed conferences and journals in networking and communications.<br/><br/>Beamforming for directional transmissions in mMIMO involves adjusting the phase and amplitude of the transmitted signals to direct the signal to the intended receiver and minimize interference with other users. However, the channel estimation process, a pre-requisite step for setting precoding data bits transmitted over a multi-antenna system, can be computationally intensive and time consuming. This project considers the challenges associated with beamforming in an mMIMO system, significantly increasing the computational overhead over classical MIMO. Even with rapid strides in computing technology, classical processing cannot keep up with the demands of configuring an mMIMO system in real-time, such that the entire process is completed within the channel coherence time. The project has two major scientific objectives to address this challenge. It aims to advance the state-of-the-art in resilient and personalized channel estimation using (i) distributed and federated learning and (ii) multi-modal sensor data. For objective (i), the research will address challenges of contamination of pilot signals due to interference and design of personalized FL for channel estimation based on shared knowledge among. For objective (ii), the research will leverage multimodal sensor data, transfer learning and attention-based transformer neural networks to minimize model training costs and delay. The concepts, approaches, and algorithms developed will be validated in real-world experiments and simulations based on realistic collected data on the NSF Colosseum and in over-the-air testbeds. The data sets, code developed for the models and algorithms will be available for independent validation and re-use.

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. <br/><br/>This project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them.

However, most professional societies grapple with issues related to lack of representation and inclusion of members of demographic groups that have historically been underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and career paths. One among these professional societies includes the Society for the Advancement in Biology Education Research (SABER), a leading premier international society with a primary focus on undergraduate biology education research. Scholarship related to this organization impacts every undergraduate biology learning environment. Additionally, members of this organization are also members of other professional societies, which makes SABER a critical lever for advancing systemic changes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion across various biology sub-fields and thus, helping to exert a larger impact on undergraduate biology education. <br/><br/>SABER since its inception and as exemplified by a self-study in 2019, has struggled with issues of diversity and representation at every level of its organizational structure, including key leadership positions. This aspect directly impacts the culture and climate of this society which ultimately affects the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts related to undergraduate biology education. Despite significant changes in its organizational structure, a concerted effort is needed to institute a permanent change related to equity and inclusion. This project aims to enact sustainable change by including diverse perspectives and voices to fundamentally change the culture of the organization and implement initiatives that promote an environment to enable cultural change. The goals of this project are as follows: (1) broadly and systematically advertise and recruit for SABER to broaden its reach to organizations, institutions, and individuals who are not currently aware of SABER, (2) offer travel support for individuals that are members of groups typically underrepresented in biology or who work at historically black colleges and universities and other minority serving institutions to attend the national meeting, (3) offer mentorship related to inclusion to individuals in leadership positions at SABER, and (4) develop networking, mentoring, and leadership opportunities to sustain the involvement of diverse members within SABER. We posit that increasing the number and including the perspectives of underrepresented scientists within SABER will enable a shift in the culture of this society to help advance inclusion by (1) creating welcoming spaces that foster an enhanced sense of belonging and professional growth of diverse individuals, (2) creating a supportive environment for members by developing and empowering environmental stewards within the SABER leadership and by offering them travel support and mentoring activities, and (3) introducing structural changes that will ultimately affect the culture and climate of SABER as an organization to create pathways that diversify the society?s leadership for diverse individuals.

The utilization of nanostructured materials, however, is limited by their poor thermal stability against grain coarsening and defect annihilation, as well as difficulties of the scale-up of existing synthesis techniques and their integration into modern manufacturing processes. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) International Multilateral Partnerships for Resilient Education and Science System in Ukraine (IMPRESS-U) award supports the exploration of a novel non-contact approach to surface nanostructuring based on a simultaneous generation of a high density of crystal defects by short pulse laser processing and stabilization of these defects through the laser-assisted nanoalloying. The goal of this project is to provide a proof of concept for the feasibility of a nimble laser-assisted defect engineering and stabilization, pushing forward the frontiers of the laser processing technologies. The project benefits from the complementary expertise and existing research links between the members of the international research team from the United States, Lithuania, and Ukraine. One of the major goals of the project is to establish a long-term sustainable collaboration fully integrating Ukrainian researchers into the global research community. Mutual visits, exchange of research expertise, and educational activities create a fertile ground for the emergence of a new area of research strength at the Lviv Polytechnic National University. In particular, the best practices of a well-established Center of Laser Technologies in Vilnius, Lithuania are adopted by the research center emerging at Lviv Polytechnic. Leveraging computational expertise at the University of Virginia grounds investigations at the Ukrainian research center on solid fundamental understanding of processes underlying material modifications from short pulse laser processing.<br/><br/>The challenge of revealing and untangling the intertwined processes responsible for the generation of various crystal defects in laser nanostructuring is addressed in this project by combining large-scale atomistic modeling of laser-induced structural and phase transformations, advanced large-area non-ablative laser processing using a novel setup for nanoalloying, and nanoscale characterization of the laser-modified surfaces. The stabilization of laser-generated highly nonequilibrium defect structures through nanoalloying is achieved by adding alloying elements that preferentially segregate to grain boundaries and other defects, thus reducing the free energy of nanocrystalline structures and acting as obstacles for defect migration. The fundamental mechanisms responsible for the generation of crystal defects at a rapidly advancing crystallization front and their stabilization through nanoalloying is systematically investigated in atomistic simulations. The conditions of the simulations are mapped to those realized in laser processing, and the computational predictions are verified in a detailed experimental characterization of surface regions modified by short pulse laser irradiation. The direct mapping of the computational predictions to the results of nanoscale characterization of laser modified surfaces guides the exploration of the multidimensional space of laser processing parameters and enables the verification and refinement of the model assumptions. Several strategies for expanding the range of irradiation conditions leading to nanocrystallization are explored, including suppression of subsurface cavitation and spallation by performing laser processing in a liquid environment and under confinement by a transparent solid overlayer. The effect of alloying/compositional gradients on the solidification kinetics and final nanostructure are systematically investigated for different target configurations in simulations and experiments.<br/><br/>This EAGER: IMPRESS-U project is jointly funded by NSF, Research Council of Lithuania, US National Academies of Sciences, and Office of Naval Research Global (DoD).

This project proposes and tests a model of the interdependence between stress, cognition, changes in the abundance of resources, and group decision-making. The model contributes to the science of group decision-making by investigating how stress (biology) and resources (the environment) impact how groups make decisions. The model seeks to explain why some groups of diverse people coalesce and effectively manage shared resources in uncertain environments, while others fail. The results of the project inform decision-makers faced with complex challenges related to climate variability, public health, and defense by building tools for diverse teams to cultivate systems thinking, manage shared resources, and improve cooperation over time. The project also broadens participation in online education and systems thinking skills.<br/><br/>This project develops and tests an embedded Model of Adaptive Capacity (eACM). The eACM proposes that the capacity of groups to continually solve complex problems depends on the ability of individuals to cognize key challenges in a resource system and to converge on joint solutions to those challenges. The eACM couples resource dynamics with individual variation in mind-body systems through the process of group sensemaking. Sensemaking occurs when groups create an understanding of their environment and form joint plans of action for cooperation. The project tests the eACM through behavioral experiments and manipulation of stress. Formal models of the systems dynamics of group decision-making aid in generalizing the results of the experiments. The project pushes the boundaries of theory by converging the study of cognition with the study of stress arousal in strategic decision-making, generating a more integrated explanation for the biological and cognitive foundations of adaptive teams. The results of the project enhance online education and systems thinking skills for diverse students and teams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organizations and individuals use various multimodal features such as images, background music, and visual effects to maximize message viewing in hopes of shifting public opinion toward important issues. Message sensation value (MSV) captures how content and format features of messages can influence audience engagement, directly or indirectly changing public opinion towards the issues. Previous studies present conflicting views on MSV?s impacts on persuasion. This research captures and tests MSV?s impacts using a novel short video dataset, aiming to enable science and health communicators, policymakers, and technological platforms to better understand and address the effects of sensational social media features in influencing how people consume and are influenced by these messages. <br/><br/>This research employs a combination of large-scale computational video analysis and an online experiment. First, the project uses computational techniques to systematically identify multi-modal features in 10,000 videos of varying message content quality and examines the associations of 18 multi-modal features to video engagement metrics. This research provides evidence on the role played by multi-modal features in the propagation of messages.

The edge computing device market is projected to reach $157B by 2032. Expanding on this, machine learning, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), relies on cloud infrastructure to conduct massive computation for both model training and inference, so OPUs would have beneficial security and environmental impacts since they would reduce reliance on the cloud. The proposed OPUs could overcome the von Neumann bottleneck while also enabling a smaller form factor, increased energy efficiency, and faster speeds. As the US seeks to reduce reliance on foreign microchip manufacturers, OPUs could also provide a powerful, viable alternative that could be manufactured in the US. The technological impacts of this project would result from a more fundamental understanding of how oscillators, which are one of the most prolific dynamic systems in the universe, can also be reconsidered as physical computers. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to leverage two types of oscillator-based neuromorphic computers.

Further, this is expected to provide insights into how optimal oscillator cores could be constructed for Oscillator Processing Units (OPUs). These enhanced OPUs will converge two separate methods of analog computing: physical reservoir computers and adaptive oscillators. Ultimately, since an oscillator core?s memory and processing are not independent, OPUs could provide a solution to the von Neumann bottleneck. This work would establish a fundamental scientific understanding of the link between physics and information.

The invention of lithium-ion batteries has been paradigm-shifting, finding widespread applications in mobile phones, laptops, electric vehicles, and more. However, the continuous development and improvement of battery technologies is currently facing major challenges, as existing battery chemistries are limited in energy density and safety. The fundamental factors determining such limits are still not well understood. The project will bridge this knowledge gap by using a set of tools to probe the internal processes occurring at anode-electrolyte interfaces. The project will focus on the early stages of the battery cycling process and determine the interfacial electrolyte and passivation layer structure. The insights gained from this project will serve as guiding principles to design novel electrolytes for safer, more powerful, and more durable batteries. Education activities of this project, in synergy with the research efforts, are focused on disseminating knowledge on surface/interface science and renewable energy to the scientific community and the general public, especially underrepresented minorities, through hands-on instrument training, scientific demonstration, mentoring, and teaching. These efforts will strengthen the materials characterization capabilities in the research community, raise the awareness and stimulate interest in clean energy and STEM among K-12 students as well as the general public, and enhance the knowledge of electrochemistry and renewable energy among undergraduate students. In the long term, the research and education activities combined will foster a diverse population of qualified individuals to work in STEM and the energy sector.<br/><br/>In lithium-ion batteries, a critical component is the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is formed at the anode-electrolyte interface during early battery cycles. While significant efforts in the research community have been devoted to characterizing the structure and composition of fully-grown SEIs, their dynamic nucleation and growth process and the underlying mechanism remain largely elusive, which is a major bottleneck preventing the predictive design of electrolytes and SEIs for targeted battery applications. The project will study how the structure of solvation layers (also called electrical double layers) at the anode-electrolyte interface plays a dominant role in the SEI nucleation and growth processes. The project will determine the structure and dynamic evolution processes of the electric double layer (EDL) and SEI by combining in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical 3D atomic force microscopy (recently developed in the PI?s lab), ex situ methods, and atomistic simulations. One outcome of the project will be a quantified electrolyte-EDL-SEI correlation. Specific objectives include: (I) determining the EDL structure at pristine graphite (anode) surface, (II) unraveling initial SEI nucleation and correlation with EDL, and (III) deciphering the mature SEI structure and its formation mechanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in practice, human demonstrations can be inadequate, partial, imperfect, environment-specific, or suboptimal. To address these challenges, this project introduces a novel framework that allows formal specifications to guide the data-driven learning process of IL. The project?s novelties are new theories and algorithms for combining formal specifications of different forms with data in imitation learning. The project's impacts are manifold, including overcoming the over-reliance on data in current IL approaches, improving their performance and robustness, and catalyzing new cross-disciplinary research at the intersection of machine learning and formal methods. With strong institutional support, the project is providing outreach opportunities to K-12 students from disadvantaged backgrounds, broadening the participation of women and minorities in STEM research, and helping inspire younger generations to pursue a college degree or a future career in engineering.<br/><br/>The central idea behind this project is that expert inputs need not be limited to demonstrations. For instance, it can be more natural and economical for an expert to specify safety properties that the learned policy must satisfy, instead of showing the many different ways that the system can fail (imagine crashing an expensive vehicle hundreds of times just to generate these ""negative examples""). In addition to offering complementary information, specifications can also provide structures to the learning process and improve the overall learning outcomes. For example, automata-based rewards are much more suitable for modeling temporally extended tasks than Markovian rewards. This project is exploring the synergies between data and formal specifications in a unified learning framework, and has the potential to transform how we develop AI systems in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nonvolatile electronic memories have a rich history, and they can be broadly categorized into three primary groups: phase change material (PCM), memristor, and ferroelectric memory, operating through thermal-induced atomic restructuring, current-driven ionic dynamics, and electric field-oriented polarization, respectively. Over the past half-century, electronic memory technologies have witnessed significant growth, achieving a high level of maturity in terms of scalability, endurance, and CMOS integration. Being able to perform uniform phase transitions over a subwavelength scale makes PCMs particularly suitable for photonic applications. For switching between amorphous and crystalline states, the chalcogenide PCMs are brought to a melting temperature to break the covalent bonds. The cooling rate determines the final state. The high melting temperature sets the upper limit of clock rate, integration density, and the device lifetime. The proposed works will explore alternative optical reversible tuning mechanisms, address a few myths and challenges in the new material platform, and locate proper photonic memory device schematics. The CAREER project will be carried out by graduates, with the involvement of undergraduates and high school interns. Through local society-organized summer camps, our undergraduate and high school interns will share their initiatives and motivations for choosing STEM with the younger generations. The proposed projects bridge the fields of layered material physics, semiconductor manufacturing, and photonic technologies, and strengthen multidisciplinary education among quantum mechanics, nanofabrication, optoelectronics, and photonic system engineering.<br/><br/>The proposed work explores melting-free mechanisms in layered chalcogenide materials for nonvolatile tuning and switching in integrated photonics, enabled by the unique atomic structures in these materials. The small energy barrier facilitates low temperature reversible phase transitions, which reduces the chance of element segregation-associated device failure. This material search started with In2Se3. Its layered structures are convertible and stable at room temperature. In addition, loss-invariant large refractive index tuning in layered chalcogenide through photochemistry will be explored in ambient conditions. Through in-situ probing of the material and device responses, a physical framework will be developed for describing the complex interplay between the thermal and mechanical processes in the phase transition process, understand the details of transient dynamics at atomic scale, and optimize device geometric design and fabrication steps towards selected photonic applications, from high contrast coherent optical modulator, phase array to integrated multi-layer metasurface system for photonic computing.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems division(ECCS), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the CREST-PRP is to increase the STEM workforce presence of individuals who are members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields. CREST-PRP awards recognize investigators with significant potential and support their research experiences to broaden their perspectives, facilitate interdisciplinary interactions, and prepare CREST-PRP scholars for positions of leadership within the scientific community. The research project ?CREST-PRP: Exploring the Impact of Heat-Waves and Nutrients on Bloom-Forming and Habitat-Building Seaweeds Along the South Florida Coast? is in direct alignment with the CREST-PRP goals. Submitted by a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the CREST Center for Aquatic Chemistry and the Environment (CAChE) at Florida International University, the project will investigate the impact of climate change and nutrient contamination along the South Florida coast by exploring the role of heat waves and nutrients on bloom-forming and habitat-building seaweeds regionally. Seaweeds are a diverse group of primary producers that are critical to the health and prosperity of marine ecosystems. This project will be important in helping predict how this combination of stressors will increase the presence of certain seaweeds that affect the ecosystems they inhabit, like coral reefs and seagrass beds. The effects of climate change and pollution conditions on seaweeds will be studied with field and experimental approaches, thus advancing our understanding of these impacts. Additionally, this project will provide direct educational and research opportunities to Florida International University students, thus promoting Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education amongst underrepresented students. These students will be recruited for retention into FIU graduate programs, enhancing support for successful minority students in STEM careers. Data will be made available to educate members of the public about the direct impact of changes in water quality on quality of life, ecosystem response, and the loss of coral reefs.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of heat waves and increased nutrients on bloom-forming and keystone algal species found on reefs in South Florida in an effort to understand how these changes may jeopardize the aquatic environment and affect human welfare. The stoichiometry ratios of stable carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous (C:N:P) in multiple algal species will be analyzed in situ along an urbanization corridor adjacent to nearshore coral reefs and across all seasons. In addition, the study will attempt to detect environmental thresholds for a variety of algal species and functional groups by cultivating seaweeds in laboratory mesocosms and subjecting them to varying nutrient and temperature regimes, measuring algal photosynthetic response to simulated heat waves and determining how the metabolism of nutrients varies across nutrient and temperature gradients. Seaweeds studied will include multi-species communities of algae,  and representatives from all four major seaweed clades (Bangiophyceae, Florideophyceae, Phaeophyceae, and Ulvophyceae),  addressing how increasing temperature and nutrients affect broad communities of seaweeds, including those of turf algae and crustose coralline algae. Field samples will also be collected and preserved as herbarium specimens (deposited at FIU with photographic scans and metadata uploaded to the online Macroalgal Herbarium Portal), with replicate C:N:P ratios determined after varying preservation times, thus providing initial data necessary to expand surveys of historical herbarium samples. The research will expand upon prior results which showed that just 5% of macroalgal genera are responsible for 50% of global seaweed biodiversity, and that this subset of are significantly positively correlated with increasing sea surface temperatures, and thus more likely to expand during expected climate change scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has sparked interest in quantum-based data science and learning, with the anticipation that certain systems could provide a quantum speedup. This project will harness the multi-disciplinary expertise from our NSF TRIPODS collaboration to develop noise-aware and resilient quantum learning systems. This project bridges the gap between research communities in traditional data science and quantum computing, thereby introducing classical data science researchers to the opportunities in quantum data science (QuanDS). Furthermore, this project will contribute to developing a skilled workforce, well-versed in cutting-edge AI and equipped to navigate the unique challenges of this emerging field in QuanDS.<br/><br/>This project develops a quantum learning system using a data-driven approach that integrates static-dynamic combined circuit analysis. This method combines static metrics with the inherent dynamic noises of quantum systems by developing a set of noise-involved evaluation metrics, such as circuit sensitivity indicator.

Through these studies, biologists can understand what changes have happened through time; get a good glimpse of the variability within a species, and even predict whether they are likely to survive with global environmental challenges. Morphological data is best acquired using 3D imaging technologies. These technologies can range from surface scanners to high-resolution 3D microscopes that use UV or X-ray to collect data. Biologists then process and visualize these datasets in computers to either collect data for research or use them as visual aids in the classroom. However, some of these imaging modalities produces datasets that are much larger than typical personal computers can handle; or may require specialized software that may not be available to everyone due to licensing or cost issues. Both can have the potential to create sharing and usage obstacles for publicly funded data, impeding teaching, scientific exploration and collaboration. <br/><br/>This project provides equitable and convenient access to publicly funded cyberinfrastructure (JetStream2) and data resources (MorphoSource) for biologists, who otherwise may not benefit from their availability; either because they lack the computational resources or the technical expertise to use them.

Additionally, bootcamp opportunities will transform motivated grad students and post-docs into future inventors of new analytical tools and functionalities, which will grow the community of morphologists working in digital environments.  MorphoCloud will make working with digital biological specimen data as routine as working with genomics data, so that biologists can focus on their scientific questions rather than get bogged down with complex workflows, technicalities, and limited resources.

Underserved and small farms in the state are predicted to be most vulnerable to the effects of climate change as they are often located in areas more exposed to risks associated with extreme weather events. Building climate resilience into small farms requires a vibrant innovation ecosystem in which farmers? needs are communicated to researchers, discoveries are translated to demand-driven products, and farmers are incentivized to adopt new technologies and practices to build environmentally and economically sustainable farms. The CROPS project confronts entrenched sources of social, economic, and racial inequity by igniting the full potential of an innovation corridor to meet the needs of small- and mid-sized farms, especially underserved farmers, in the face of climate change. The overall goal is to develop an overarching CROPS ecosystem that seeds more equitable and needs-centric knowledge sharing, technology development, and creation of incentives to de-risk adoption among farmers, universities, industry, and stakeholder communities. In this Development phase, CROPS builds a strong organizational infrastructure that promotes and sustains this ecosystems? growth and maturity. CROPS prioritizes diversity within our multifaceted stakeholder ecosystem ? farmers, researchers, policy makers, funders, and industry. CROPS focuses on key nodes of systemic connectivity between underserved farmers, consortium research partners, and education-focused academic and extension agents who are dedicated to preparing a future ready workforce, while addressing climate, technological, economic, and societal challenges faced by NC farmers.<br/><br/>Although the major NC metropolitan regions of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) and the Piedmont Triad (PT) have promoted technological innovation and economic opportunity, there has been insufficient economic impact in the underserved rural counties of Eastern and Central NC whose focus on agriculture. This award mechanism better positions the RTP and PT regions to cultivate and bolster interdisciplinary, multi-organizational teams of researchers, industry, entrepreneurial, and non-profit partners, and other stakeholders to work collaboratively with underserved farmers, small business owners, and landholders. The lead institution of this engine is North Carolina A&T State University, the largest HBCU in the nation, which has a long history of working with a diverse group of farmers to improve their success through its extension network. Core CROPS partners also include Alamance Community College, Duke University, East Carolina University, NC Biotechnology Center, NC State University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, RTI International, and Wake Forest University. The proposed 42-county NC Agricultural Tech Innovation Corridor mobilizes innovative research, accelerates product commercialization, and trains the workforce needed to sustain the ecosystem.

For example, terrestrial and aquatic microbiomes mix in rivers, soil microbial communities invade one another in agriculture, and human skin microbiomes come into contact when two people shake hands. Such cross-microbiome invasions are collectively termed community coalescence. How these mixing events impact the function of microbiomes and how often new communities with novel functions form as a result remains unclear. This research project uses fermented food microbiomes, including sourdough starters, kombucha, and fermented vegetables, to determine how microbiomes reassemble when they mix and how coalescence impacts microbiome functions. Findings from these experimentally tractable fermented food systems identify how community coalescence can be used as a tool for microbiome engineering and its potential to improve the manipulation of medically and industrially relevant microbiomes. The broad appeal of fermented food systems is also used to increase participation in undergraduate research and broaden the public understanding of microbiomes. This project also engages the public more broadly through popular science articles and interviews on MicrobialFoods.org, a popular science venue developed to explain complex biological concepts in scientific papers in accessible content for food enthusiasts and educators.<br/><br/>The mechanisms that govern cross-community invasions remain poorly understood. Most research has focused on the consequences of community coalescence in natural systems, while determination of underlying mechanisms is limited. This project manipulates a suite of fermented food model systems, derived from fermented food microbiomes, including sourdough starters, kombucha, and fermented vegetables, in conducting community coalescence experiments. The investigation sheds light on the consequences of coalescence, the mechanisms that govern it, and its potential utility for microbiome engineering. With the use of co-culture interaction assays, metabolic modeling, RNA-sequencing, and targeted metabolomics the project dissects the underlying interaction mechanisms that shape coalescence outcomes. Experimental evolution is used to determine how abiotic and biotic adaptation constrains or promotes cross-invasion outcomes. This project provides a mechanistic understanding that is required for predicting coalescence consequences and for leveraging community coalescence in industrial applications with microbial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign makes observations of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), the layer of the atmosphere from roughly 14km to 18km between the tropical troposphere and stratosphere, using balloons designed to float at a constant altitude for flights of up to 3 months.  The balloons are launched from the Seychelles and float around the equator just above the top of the TTL or in the lower stratosphere at an altitude near 20km.  Strateole-2 was planned as a set of three deployments, a preliminary engineering deployment with 8 balloon flights followed by two science deployments with 20 flights each. The first two deployments took place in 2019 and 2021 and funds for the PIs' participation in these deployments were provided through AGS-1642277.  The third deployment is scheduled to begin in October 2025.<br/><br/>Funds provided here support the development and deployment of a new instrument with the acronym RATS, for Reel-down Atmospheric Temperature Sensor.  Roughly speaking RATS is a thermometer lowered on a long tether below a balloon gondola which contains a second thermometer. The difference in temperature between the two thermometers can be used to detect gravity waves, atmospheric waves similar to ocean surface waves only they can propagate vertically as well as horizontally. RATS can detect gravity waves because the up and down motions of the waves cause cooling and warming, thus the difference in temperature between two appropriately separated thermometers can record the passage of a wave. The title of the proposal refers to the use of the RATS thermometers for the Characterization of Atmospheric Tropical waves of the lower Stratosphere (CATS).<br/><br/>Motivation for the work comes from the role of gravity waves in driving the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), the reversal in zonal wind direction over the equator that begins in the upper stratosphere and descends to the tropopause over a period slightly longer than two years.  The QBO matters for subseasonal weather prediction because it has been linked to modes of climate variability that influence weather around the world.  Models used for weather prediction have difficulty capturing the QBO, in part because the waves that drive it have wavelengths that are smaller than typical model grid spacings, particularly in the vertical.  RATS can detect waves with vertical wavelengths between 2 and 30 times the distance between the two thermometers, which is set to either 200m or 300m to capture wavelengths from 400m to 6km or 600m to 9km.  The longer wavelengths can be resolved by operational models and thus compared with the model output while the shorter ones are unresolved.<br/><br/>The award covers the development of the RATS hardware, which includes a Lower Measuring Unit (LMU) containing a thermometer (developed by CNES) along with an RS41 radiosonde sensor module (from Vaisala) to measures temperature, humidity, and pressure, and a GPS receiver for determining position.  The LMU is raised and lowered using a spool and pulley system that allows it to be docked to the gondola for launch and reeled down when the balloon reaches its flight altitude.  The gondola contains a second thermometer along with a barometer and GPS receiver.<br/><br/>The work is of societal interest given the prospects for better long-range weather predictions through improved representation of the wave driving of the QBO. The Strateole-2 field campaign involves collaborations with two operational weather prediction centers, thereby providing a connection from research to operations.  All field campaign data is made available to the global research community to pursue additional research topics on TTL physics and dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It recently has been suggested that the artificial introduction of chlorine into the atmosphere to remove methane might be a viable option for mitigating the climate impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. While limited laboratory studies have shown the potential for such a mechanism to remove methane, there is essentially little understanding of the viability of the method and its potential for causing harmful impacts.<br/><br/>The MDSA (mineral dust-sea spray aerosol) mechanism depends on the recycling of hydrogen chloride by the methane and chlorine (CH4 + Cl) reaction. Establishing the catalytic efficiency of the process with respect to iron and chlorine under different atmospheric conditions is the key goal of this project. An aircraft campaign will be conducted near Barbados over a 6-week period during June/July 2024 in conjunction with MAGPIE (Moisture and Aerosol Gradients/Physics of Inversion Evolution), a dynamical meteorology project funded by the US Navy and NOAA. Measurements will be made of aerosol load and size distribution, and concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and hydrogen chloride, as well as 3-D wind speed and direction and temperature. Air samples will be collected for subsequent analysis of delta 13C in CO and CH4 as this data will validate the existence of the chlorine-hydrogen abstraction mechanism from atmospheric methane, believed to yield highly depleted 13CO in the summertime.

In the developing nervous systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, neurons express a wide diversity of cell adhesion molecules, which mediate interactions that are essential for specifying target selection and connectivity patterns. This proposal will study the molecular control of circuit development through a combination of genetic and biophysical approaches in which binding affinities and cell surface localization of cell adhesion molecules are manipulated and their effects on neural circuit formation are studied in the larva fruit fly. The proposed research will have a significant impact on multiple research fields due to the generality of the phenomena to be studied. Moreover, integrating computational and structural biology with developmental neuroscience is likely to stimulate similar collaborative efforts in these fields. In terms of training, students and postdocs working on this project will develop a deep appreciation of both computational and experimental work, thus providing exemplars for broadly trained interdisciplinary scientists. Women scientists constitute over 50% of the participating groups. The research program includes training of high school and undergraduate students, many of whom are from underrepresented minorities in sciences, through summer internships. The team will continue partnering with a network of high schools across lower-income districts and minority serving colleges, and run the DREAM-High cloud computing course for high school students that increases student awareness of and interest in biological sciences, empowers students to adopt scientific reasoning and critical-thinking skills, and inspires students to seek post-secondary education in related fields.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of binding affinity and cell surface availability of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on circuit formation in Drosophila. The study will focus on the larval neuromuscular system and mushroom body development. At the molecular level, the focus will be on two interacting groups of CAMs, the Dprs (Defective in Proboscis extension Response) and the DIPs (Dpr Interacting Proteins). The choice of these proteins and anatomical structures is based on the deep understanding of the biophysical properties of DIPs and Dprs that has emerged over the past few years, and on the demonstration of their crucial roles in the development of these anatomical structures. Here, by examining various Dpr/DIP cognate pairs in different neurodevelopmental settings, the findings should deepen currently limited knowledge of the in vivo consequences of altering avidity using both changes in binding affinities and in expression levels. A particular focus will be on the phenomenon of cis inhibition, whereby interactions between cognate binding partners on the same cell compete with trans binding to partners on apposed cells. The underlying hypothesis is that cis-inhibition is a key regulatory mechanism in neural development.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Neural Systems Cluster in IOS and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in MCB of the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A goal of restoring agricultural land to grassland is to promote the recovery of diverse native plant communities that can withstand and bounce back from periodic stress, and that improve the health of soil degraded from cultivation. However, the composition of plant communities that develop and rate at which soil recovers in restored grasslands is highly variable and difficult to predict. Forecasting plant community outcomes and soil recovery is further complicated by an increasingly variable climate, especially in the southern Great Plains. This research uses a series of grassland restorations established in an agricultural field every other year for twelve years, encompassing a wide range of climate conditions, to understand of the role of climate variability on plant community composition, the resilience of restored communities to drought, and the rate at which carbon accumulates in the soil. This long-term study provides new insights into the role of climate in achieving conservation goals and reduces uncertainty about the capacity for restored grasslands to sequester carbon in soil. <br/><br/>The similarly reconstructed grasslands provide a novel framework to test the hypotheses that stochastic variation in climate has deterministic consequences for restored community states, resilience develops as communities age and interact with community state, and climate-driven differences in plant composition contribute to variation in soil carbon accrual. Previously collected and continued measurements of plant species composition are used to model the effect of planting-year climate on restored community trajectories of change. Climate-influenced community states in these grasslands vary uniquely and widely in the ratio of C4-grasses and C3-forbs. The grasses and forbs produce organic matter that varies in both substrate quality and stable carbon isotopic signatures that are measured to determine whether soil carbon accrual is influenced more by recalcitrant or high-quality inputs, respectively. The occurrence of multiple droughts over the course of establishing this long-term experiment provides a rare opportunity to evaluate whether resilience varies predictably with restoration age and whether it interacts with climate-influenced community state. Ultimately, this research helps to transition long-term studies in community ecology toward prediction, advance understanding of factors influencing resilience in ecosystems, and help resolve competing hypotheses regarding plant-based controls on soil carbon accrual.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Ecosystem Science and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With this project, which is jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), a collaborative research team from the University of Maine and the University of Alabama develops, synthesizes, and investigates a new class of perovskite halides for optoelectronics. In this combined theoretical and experimental investigation, the team also evaluates the materials? stability under ambient environmental conditions. Unlike traditional halides with two to three metal elements, these newly developed perovskite halides consist of five or more principal metal elements in nearly equal concentrations. The workplan features a closed feedback loop between theory and experiment and focuses on materials advancement by performing theoretical predictions, developing synthesis methods, characterizing optoelectronic properties, and evaluating stability under exposure to gases, light, and heat. New perovskite halide materials discovered from this project could lead to a wide variety of optoelectronic applications including solar cells, light-emitting devices, photodetectors and lasers, photoelectrochemical catalysts, radiation detectors, and sensors. This research allows project participants from interdisciplinary programs at these two universities to interact and contribute to technology development within Maine and Alabama. Three Ph.D. graduate students and six undergraduates are trained to acquire skills and competency in the three foundational pillars of computation, experiments, and data analysis which are key attributes for the next-generation workforce. STEM outreach and education activities disseminated to K-12 students, high-school teachers, and the general public within Maine and Alabama are aimed at conveying how collaborative energy-materials design-driven research is relevant to addressing societal challenges. <br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This project, which is jointly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), aims to computationally design and experimentally realize a new class of lead-free perovskite halide materials with enhanced thermodynamic and environmental stability along with desired optoelectronic properties. Entropy-stabilized perovskite halides (ESPHs) containing five or more principal metal elements are investigated for enhanced optoelectronic properties and stable environmental performance. The key hypothesis is that the configurational entropy of mixing plays a dominant role in stabilizing a single-phase crystalline ESPH structure. The validation of this hypothesis not only provides a new experimentally controllable pathway to design more stable perovskite halide materials but also yields unique composition-structure-property relationships that are absent when chemical order prevails. Specific objectives are to (i) predict the combinations of metal elements that can give rise to stable ESPHs using high-throughput first-principles calculations, (ii) synthesize the predicted ESPHs using the solid-state solution, hydrothermal, and solvent precipitation methods, (iii) characterize the compositional, structural and optoelectronic properties of the synthesized ESPHs, and (iv) evaluate and analyze the stabilities of experimentally synthesized ESPHs under various laboratory environments including humidity, oxidizing/reducing gases, and heat. New ESPHs from this project are poised to substantially expand the chemical space of perovskite halides, providing more capabilities to tune and tailor materials properties of interest (such as lattice parameter, bandgap, optical absorption strength, and conductivity) and render high potential for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications including solar cells, light-emitting devices, photoelectrochemical catalysts, photodetectors and lasers, radiation detectors, and sensors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These late first language deaf signers can experience dramatic effects on all aspects of life including language outcomes. While much of the previous research on this topic has looked at language outcomes at the sentence level, this project aims to better understand the effects of late first language acquisition by looking below the sentence and word levels at how signers process the smallest pieces of language that make up signs/words. This work is necessary for a more complete understanding of the effects of late first language acquisition and better insight into how the human brain processes language more broadly. Practically, this work helps those who work with deaf individuals, like speech language pathologists and educators, to better understand how late first language signers process the linguistic pieces that make up language. <br/><br/>In this dissertation, participants are deaf signers who acquired a sign language at a variety of ages, from early in childhood to late in adolescence. Study 1 investigates how the signers produce the smallest pieces of the sign language (manual forms like handshape, movement, and location) through sign repetition and error analysis. Study 2 investigates how the signers perceive the manual forms of sign language through similarity judgments. Study 3 investigates how the signers identify and process the manual forms of sign language through form monitoring and using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Together, these studies provide insight into how late first language signers compared to early first language signers produce, perceive, and process the smallest pieces of sign language, providing a systematic look at the effects of late first language acquisition at the sub-word level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This frameshifting in translating the mRNA triplet code has been found to be preprogrammed in viruses and human cells to modify the expression of gene products and to regulate biochemical processes. This study aims to computationally predict and experimentally test how introducing mutations to mRNA affects its three-dimensional structure and, consequently, programmed frameshifting in prototypical viral genomes. Revealing the specific structural and sequence requirements for frameshifting in prototype viruses will facilitate the design of novel efficient frameshifting elements, with potential applications to viral packaging of genes. This project will provide interdisciplinary training to students in mathematics, computer science, biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering, with particular emphasis on enhancing minority participation in STEM activities. Public outreach efforts will be included to reach general audiences and highlight the intersection of mathematics, biology, computing, and biotechnologies that have implications in human health.<br/> <br/>Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a widespread mechanism for modifying the gene expressed by altering the mRNA triplet-nucleotide transcript to generate an alternate gene product. Indispensable to many viruses including HIV and SARS-associated coronaviruses for translating overlapping mRNA reading frames, PRF is also a mechanism in endogenous human, eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. Because PRF has been shown to dramatically influence viral viability or the biochemical regulation of human processes, the modulation of frameshifting defines a platform for engineering gene expression. However, the complex aspects of frameshifting and the structural plasticity of the RNA frameshifting element (FSE) must be understood before engineering and therapeutic strategies can succeed. In this synergistic biological, chemical, mathematical, and computational research program, graph-theory-based tools will be developed to predict FSE mutations for prototype viral systems aimed at substantially lowering frameshifting efficiency as a novel biotechnological strategy against viral infections and related human diseases associated with PRF. The effect of these mutations will be assessed by Luciferase assay measurements, and the resulting FSE structural landscapes analyzed by techniques suitable for RNAs with multiple conformations. Besides an improved understanding of the mechanisms of frameshifting and computational tools for predicting FSE-landscape-altering mutations, this project will produce new biotechnological, RNA modifying tools as potential therapeutic agents against RNA viruses or applicable to human and other genes that employ frameshifting. Applications to viral packaging/drug delivery also arise, as frameshifting is a compact mechanism to store gene coding information and can be exploited to overcome genomic size limitations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Chemistry (CHE), the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS), and the Division of Physics (PHY) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology leverages mechanical compliance to achieve this micromotion. The innovation includes: 1) the design of a single-piece, linear motion compliant mechanism bone plate, reducing the part count and assembly relative to alternative dynamic plates; 2) novel analytical models to select geometry of flexible elements, which allow the tuning of plate stiffness for various clinical scenarios without changing the material; 3) subtractive and additive manufacturing methods for machining thin flexible members which must endure many loading cycles; and 4) retaining critical plate features present in current rigid plates (i.e. locking screw holes, stainless steel materials, limited contact regions on the bone-facing side of the plate) to both preserve surgical technique and create a feasible regulatory clearance pathway with the Food and Drug Administration.

For example, electric cars are still not as practical as gasoline cars because, among other issues, they are difficult to recharge in short times. To improve this, new materials need to be developed since the currently used materials in LIB are already close to their maximum capabilities. This research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, focuses on designing and synthesizing materials and elucidating structure-property trends that may lead to insights on how to improve the capacity of batteries. The project combines computational approaches with modern materials chemistry experiments to develop nanoscale materials, one hundred times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, with increased electron transport capabilities. The principal investigators make use of computational fundamental science to guide experiments and therefore virtual testing of a wide variety of materials, reducing the cost of testing and trial-and-error to reasonable budgets. Since batteries are used in all areas of human activities, it is difficult to imagine any activity in our society where remote electricity would not be beneficial. Additionally, the projects supports efforts to increase diversity and train the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, researchers at the University of Cincinnati and Texas A&M, investigate the design and synthesis of hybrid electrode materials that combine carbon nanomaterials and copper metallic surfaces to create an efficient and robust pathway for electron transport. To facilitate the understanding and quantification of electron transport at the interface, the team employs open-ended carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attached to a bulk copper substrate using stable linker molecules. The CNTs are oriented vertically compared to the Cu substrate, and only the ends of the CNTs are connected to Cu atoms. The research combines ab initio analysis, synthesis, and characterization studies. With the aim of impedance matching at the interface the team studies the materials as anodes for Li batteries, investigates energy storage performance and dendrite formation in the context of computational and experimental structure-property correlations. The results of this research could pave the way for more efficient batteries, new sensors, new catalysts, and new biodevices. Additionally, the multidisciplinary project provides experiential opportunities for the next generation of scientists. The principal investigators encourage diversity and actively motivate more minorities to pursue college and specialize in fields of science and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, our knowledge is limited due to challenges in analyzing genomics data, such as bias arising from an overrepresentation of European study participants and simplistic statistical models that do not sufficiently capture the data. This project overcomes these challenges across three main scientific goals, in which innovative statistical models map DNA mutations to their target genes, and two educational goals, in which scientific training and diversity are simultaneously cultivated. First, the investigators will improve the fidelity of mapping mutations to target genes for groups of individuals that are not well-studied, such as minority populations. Second, the investigators will develop a new method to connect mutations to genes by considering how genes interact with each other in genome-wide networks, suggesting functional effects for many uncharacterized mutations. Third, the investigators will characterize the specific cells in which mutations exert their effects using scalable models that reflect the natural distribution of data from single cell genomic assays. This research advances the fields of bioinformatics and human genetics by introducing new, robust statistical models that link mutations to their target genes. This project also enhances equity and diversity in biomedical discoveries, while simultaneously enhancing diversity within research environments. Toward the latter, the investigators initiate a multi-week on-campus research program for high school students from under-resourced communities, as well as genetics training courses for undergraduate and graduate students, supplying quantitative interdisciplinary skills coveted by industry and academia alike. This award will generate extensive datasets, open-source statistical models and genomics tools, high-impact publications, and course materials, thereby engaging and fueling the scientific community to partake and propel related research. <br/><br/>This project focuses on developing new genetic models to understand how specific genetic variations influence gene expression. These models overcome current limitations in characterizing the function of genetic variation, which often has the subsequent goal of implicating target genes in the regulation of human phenotypes such as height and cancer risk. Challenges of existing algorithms include statistical issues due to finite sample sizes (especially for understudied minority populations), multiple hypothesis burdens restricting the knowledge gained from genome-wide analysis, and model misspecification especially for new datatypes of growing popularity, such as single cell genomics. The investigators address these challenges across three main objectives. First, the investigators link genetic variation to changes in gene expression in understudied minority populations, by jointly modeling genetic associations across globally diverse datasets. Second, the investigators develop a comprehensive approach to map genome-wide genetic variants to changes in gene expression using a priori knowledge of gene regulatory networks and advanced machine learning algorithms to reduce the burden of multiple testing. Third, the investigators design a new statistical model to characterize the cell-type-specificity of gene expression regulation at high resolution; this model leverages the natural distribution of single cell data, resolving model misspecification of state-of-the-art methods and reduces measurement noise by modeling millions of single cell measurements across donors. This award supports the generation of open-source genomics software and data repositories characterizing the function of genetic variants, while also creating educational and training opportunities for under-resourced high school students and motivated undergraduate and graduate students. The symbiotic research and educational intertwine in a relationship that is expected to enhance both the diversity in research environments, as well as the diversity in research cohorts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many students are capable of becoming engineers but do not because they (a) do not understand what engineers do or (b) do not think they have the abilities needed to become an engineer; this is particularly common for underrepresented groups such as females and minorities. Diversifying the engineering workforce could result in more diverse solutions to engineering challenges. A lack of exposure to engineering in grades K-12 could limit the number of students pursuing engineering careers. This project fosters partnerships between tribal and community colleges and the surrounding rural and tribal school districts to engage rural and indigenous elementary students in place- based engineering-focused activities that will help motivate and prepare them for engineering- related careers. Professional learning communities consisting of pre and in-service elementary teachers, instructors from partner tribal and community colleges, and faculty from Montana State University will work together throughout the project with the goal of supporting teachers in the design and implementation of placed-based engineering activities to increase 3rd - 5th grade students' awareness of, interest in, and preparedness to pursue engineering related careers. Students and their families will document their views about learning, knowledge, and engineering through photo journals which will be used, along with classroom observations, to identify students' current perceptions of engineering and to develop place-based engineering- focused interventions for the students that connect to the programming and research happening at the tribal and community colleges.<br/>The citizens of rural Montana and the seven tribal reservations within Montana have a great wealth of local funds of knowledge. Children internalize these family and community funds of knowledge and resources to make meaning and define themselves, creating funds of identity that serve as a lens through which they view and absorb new information and new identities. This project explores the connections between funds of identity and engineering identity development and the mediating factors that inform this relationship. The project team engages with teachers to identify methods that can be used to identify elementary students' funds of identity and current perceptions of engineering. This information is then utilized by professional learning community members to develop place-based engineering-focused interventions for students. The research design is a multiple case study with Little Big Horn College (tribal college) and partnering reservation elementary schools as Case A and Gallatin College (community college) and partnering rural schools as Case B. Both quantitative and qualitative data are collected from individual students, teachers, and tribal and community college partners at multiple time points, allowing researchers to examine the intervention across time and contexts. Data are analyzed at the individual, with-in case, and cross-case levels to examine student, teacher, and community level impacts. This exploration of the connections between funds of identity and engineering identity in children will provide valuable insight into how educators can leverage funds of identity to create meaningful learning experiences that allow students to recognize the value of their knowledge and support their engineering identity development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology supports a wide range of commercial applications across multiple fields, including semiconductor manufacturing, biomedicine, and healthcare. Although there have been multiple efforts to push the limits of current additive manufacturing technologies, one of the major challenges is how to print and control the surface properties of deposited materials on flexible and porous substrates. The technology addresses this issue by enabling selective sintering of nanomaterials on different types of substrates, such as paper, gauze and even human skin, which enables its commercial application in flexible electronics, medical devices, and personalized healthcare. The technology can be used to print a radio frequency antenna on gauze or human skin to monitor the vital parameters of an individual. The technology can also be used to deposit complex electronic circuits on a flexible polymer film, which can be mounted on a drone to reduce the load weight and attain energy efficiency.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a low-temperature, atmospheric plasma sintering method to deposit nanomaterials on flexible surfaces. In this method, the sintering of nanoparticles is carried out in-situ by injecting metal and metal-oxide nanoparticles in the active plasma region of the atmospheric plasma jet. The activation energy provided by the atmospheric plasma and subsequent annealing of nanoparticles by the downstream plasma leads to the formation of a uniform thin film. This technique has been tested for the deposition of gold, silver, and graphene oxide thin films on silicon, glass, and polyimide, as well as screen printed paper electrodes for improving the response of biosensors. The salient feature of the technique is that the process is carried out at ambient pressure and room temperature, which makes the solution advantageous for depositing materials on various surfaces such as paper, gauze, and complex three-dimensional objects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator aims to develop a general method to overcome high dimensionality of these PDEs via developing an iterative solver that combines the advantages of tensor-network, Monte Carlo, and convex optimization methods. The main idea is to solve for only a small number of descriptors of the solution (e.g., the statistical moments of the solution) and then recover a compressed representation of the solution through these descriptors. An improved solution procedure will contribute to the Material Genome Initiative by developing new computational tools for physical and chemical simulations. The proposed education plan aims to train graduate students for quantitative research at the intersection of mathematical and physical sciences, fostering a new generation of researchers well-equipped to tackle problems of national interest in scientific computing, machine learning, and quantum computing. Through research advising, a summer mentoring program, and the development of a summer school for quantum mechanics, the proposal aims to encourage the participation of students in scientific research and higher education. <br/> <br/>Currently, Monte Carlo methods have been widely successful in many practical physical and chemical simulation tools due to their flexibility, despite potential drawbacks such as slow mixing time and high variance. An alternative approach to characterizing chemical/physical systems is to deterministically solve for the solution of a PDE over the entire space, which can work only for small (and consequently low-dimensional) problems. The proposed research attempts to address the limitations of sampling-based and PDE approaches through the development of an iterative solver. It involves fast iterations achieved by alternating between short-time Monte Carlo simulations and estimating a tensor-network ansatz. It relies on the initialization strategy underpinned by convex optimization in order to reduce the number of iterations. Monte Carlo variance of traditional sampling methods is significantly reduced since only a small number of tensor-network parameters need to be estimated. On the other hand, it significantly extends the flexibility of tensor-network methods by allowing stochastic operations. To this end, a novel tensor-network-based generative model is proposed where density can be learned from empirical samples without the use of any optimization. It would impact statistics by providing new density estimators and analysis without the curse of dimensionality.

However, despite decades of development, current IR semiconductors possess numerous drawbacks that limit their widespread use and the development of critical emerging technologies. This project will investigate completely new light-matter interactions, theoretical and computational approaches, novel polymer semiconductors with tailored electronic structures, and devices to enable optical to electrical transduction of IR light, a fundamentally new capability for organic materials. These materials and devices will satisfy the functional and economic requirements for technologies that can address critical national needs with global societal impacts in climate change, manufacturing, energy, healthcare, information science, consumer applications, future aerospace and defense-wide applications, and many others. New theoretical, synthetic, characterization, and device advances will coalesce with Air Force Research Labs and industry partnerships to produce new materials and devices for technology transfer. Workforce development efforts will focus on multidisciplinary education through co-mentorship, industry and Department of Defense interactions, outreach to underrepresented high school and undergraduate students, and professional development actives for research and leadership training.<br/><br/>Technical Description: <br/>This project will address grand challenges to revolutionize our understanding of charge photogeneration and emerging solid-state transport phenomena in order to enable optical to electrical transduction of IR light from organic materials. To achieve this, the research team will establish a closed loop between theory, computation, synthesis, spectroscopy, and device fabrication, engineering, and physics. Revolutionary ab initio and time-dependent quantum chemical calculations that incorporate non-adiabatic dynamics will for the first-time provide detailed insight into IR excitations in correlated organic materials with complex excitonic, vibrational, polaronic, and spin properties. Systematic theory-synthesis-spectroscopic approaches will be developed and applied to benchmark these new theoretical approaches and correlate molecular design with emerging functionality and coherent quasiparticle dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal timescales. This will be related to the fundamental electro-optical physics and device performance, enabling new functionality. These new, foundational design principles will be combined with experimentally validated physical structure-property models and data-driven machine learning methods to simulate new polymer structures, rapidly screen materials candidates, improve performance, and create new material libraries. This will create a comprehensive materials genome for conjugated polymers that operate throughout the IR. Thus, this project will enable fundamentally new scientific capabilities and revolutionary performance in organic electronic devices, acting as a core enabler of transformative technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The U.S. produces over 100 million metric tons of coal fly ash each year through burning coal for power and has more than two billion metric tons in storage ponds across the country, estimated to contain up to 100 years? worth of U.S. demand of REEs. What is missing is a sustainable, scalable, and economic method of separation. REEs play critical roles in many different technologies, ranging from national defense applications to manufacturing and consumer electronics, to healthcare treatments, and much more. One particularly important industry is clean tech, where REEs are used in high-performance wind turbines and electric vehicles. Currently, the U.S. lacks a stable domestic supply of REEs and is reliant on mining efforts in foreign nations that lack similar labor and environmental protections. This dependence is a strategic vulnerability. Harvesting REEs from coal ash would build a sustainable, diverse, and resilient supply chain of materials needed to support the clean energy transition, as well as create new jobs and provide utilities with an economic pathway to better utilize ash and empty existing ash ponds.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project will optimize a novel ionic-liquid-based recovery process to harvest rare earth elements (REEs) from coal fly ash. The ionic liquid in question has a high binding affinity for REEs and additionally displays unique thermomorphic behavior: upon heating, water and the ionic liquid form a single liquid phase, and REEs are leached from coal fly ash via a proton-exchange mechanism. Upon cooling, the water and IL separate, and leached elements partition between the two phases. The recovery strategy exploits this behavior in a new method that represents a breakthrough technology: the ionic liquid can extract the REEs directly from the solid ash without the need for digestion and separate the REEs from bulk elements. This dramatically lowers chemical consumption and waste generation and simplifies costly downstream processing. In Phase I of the project, efforts are focused on improving REE concentration in the IL phase, developing new processes for purifying REEs from ionic liquid concentrate, and validating the process for a variety of coal ash samples. The output of this project is expected to be comprehensively tested and validated recovery process ready for scaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to exploit the characteristics of these dinuclear species to understand how molecular structure can assist in violating EPR selection rules to enable high intensity transitions. The specific transitions being explored may yield new capabilities for bioimaging techniques that use EPR transitions. The research project spans the interface of inorganic and physical chemistries with synthetic and spectroscopic analyses as a key part of the work. The broader outreach goals for the program will be to create an easy-to-access lesson for synthetic chemists to approach the selection rules of EPR. This plan will follow the pedagogical strategies commonly employed for more common techniques, e.g. UV-vis spectroscopy, and as such aims to be a cornerstone in bringing new chemists into the EPR arena.<br/><br/>The longer-term goal for the work is to enable low-frequency EPR transitions at high magnetic field, which would permit the chemical sensitivity of EPR imaging to be integrated with MRI. The singlet-to-triplet transition of two-spin systems is a promising way to realize such an EPR transition, because of its unique field dependence. Yet, the transition is forbidden and therefore weak hence, chemical design strategies for molecules to override the EPR selection rule and increase signal intensity are needed. Dinuclear metal complexes have a plethora of magnetic interactions that could potentially violate the EPR selection rule, but experimental tests of the efficacy of these violations have yet to be performed. This work will study the singlet-to-triplet transition in a variety of dinuclear metal complexes to explore how exchange coupling, hyperfine coupling, and relative spin orientation all contribute to the intensity of the forbidden resonance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These emission reductions will be accomplished through the development of a new type of air pollution control technology that can be cost-effectively applied to small emission sources that cannot be effectively controlled using existing technologies. These small emission sources are numerous, and in some cases, located near sensitive or overburdened communities, so the emissions control will have a large impact.

This need is accentuated by the fact that after decades of aggressive miniaturization, electronic devices are currently reaching the end of the road for traditional materials as we ?run out of atoms?. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, a relatively new class of materials consisting of few-atom-thick sheets, provide a platform to address these challenges. Particularly interesting are 2D transition metal carbides, known as MXenes, composed of two to four atomic layers of transition metals separated by an atomic layer of carbon. MXenes are studied for various applications, including energy storage and generation, blocking electromagnetic waves, and antenna. Despite significant progress, room temperature magnetism, important for quantum computation, computer memories, and spintronics, has remained elusive. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, Professor Babak Anasori at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis and Professor Alejandro Strachan at Purdue University and their research groups will design and fabricate novel 2D MXenes that contain rare-earth elements, such as neodymium and gadolinium, and develop a fundamental understanding of how such elements can be used to control the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of these materials. Computational modeling is used to guide the experimental design of these new materials and reduce the number of experiments to the most promising candidates. The team hypothesizes that the use of rare-earth elements in MXenes can lead to the first room-temperature 2D magnets. To accelerate innovation, all experimental and theoretical results produced and models developed will be made accessible for the researchers and educators for online computing. The microscopic images of nanomaterials and 2D materials have been used in many nanoart visualizations, such as NanoArtography, to promote STEM. The nanoart images will be integrated into local nanoscience outreach activities, such as Purdue?s NanoDays, to motivate art-enthusiastic children to have a chance to learn about the science and engineering behind nanoart images.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>2D transition metal carbide MXenes have become one of the largest 2D material families over the past decade. MXenes have metallic electrical conductivities, are hydrophilic, and capable of intercalating a host of ions and organic molecules, leading to outstanding performance in applications such as energy storage, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, wireless communications, catalysis, and biomedicine. Double-transition metal MXenes are a subfamily of MXenes that enable significant tunability in properties by changing the MXenes transition metal compositions. The research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, aims to design, synthesize, and characterize a new family of 2D double-transition metal carbides: rare-earth (RE) f-element 2D MXenes opening the possibility of magnetic properties. This will be accomplished via a synergistic combination of theory and experiments. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of how different rare-earth elements can be incorporated into MXenes and use it to control the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of these novel phases. The limiting factor hindering f-element MXenes is their synthesis that requires the design of novel f-element MAX phase precursors among the large compositional space. This project uses high-throughput first principles and thermodynamic calculations to identify stable precursors and their MXenes and use data science tools to guide experimental efforts. Rare-earth f-element MXenes can have radically different properties that have never been measured in regular MXenes and are absent in other 2D and bulk materials. Rare-earth MXenes can have potential applications from EMI shielding, optoelectronics, and catalysis to quantum computation, spintronics, and magnetoelectronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will explore a particular class of high-performance alloys (printable refractory alloys) that are strong and durable at elevated temperatures and amenable to fabrication using 3D printing. This is important because 3D printing allows for more complex part design, bolsters energy efficiency, and reduces emissions in next-generation systems.

LeCain, PI; Kirke D. Elsass, co-PI<br/><br/>Cement?the substance that binds together and solidifies concrete?is indispensable to building modern transportation, energy, and residential structures. Global production of cement contributes around eight percent of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. Primarily for this reason, chemists and engineers around the world seek replacement materials and new building techniques that might reduce cement use. ?Cementing Spaces,? a historical study of cement and society, complements and informs the work of those material scientists who are rethinking concrete. The study accounts for cement as both an environmental element and a cultural element in the past. It introduces evidence that conventional cement affected the development of cultures in both subtle and profound ways. In short, cement created new spaces with which people created new cultures. Studying the cultures created with cement in the past provides a framework for industry researchers and public officials to consider and anticipate the many consequences to society that will ensue from their exploration and implementation of alternatives to cement.<br/><br/>?Cementing Spaces? focuses on the relative impermeability of cement. Cement?s potential to create environmental barriers, cultivated for control of water during the nineteenth-century canal era, proved to be an appealing and influential quality in a variety of ubiquitous twentieth-century structures. Case studies of home basements, public sidewalks, and prison cells will employ archived documents to deeply explore the ways cemented environments shaped new cultures of family, mobility, and incarceration. The project hypothesizes that cement, by separating people from water, dirt, or one another, had a role in turning cellars into modern basements, inviting new municipal codes and new footwear styles of urban life, and supporting carceral authorities? use of solitary confinement as a punitive measure. The findings of ?Cementing Spaces? will contribute to scholarship that reveals how nonhuman things participate in the development of societies, here with a novel focus on a material technology that despite its ubiquity is not popularly understood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This product has applications to a host of industries where employees may be subject to biases that can influence decision making outcomes. Practitioners and training facilitators in fields such as health and human services, child and adult welfare agencies, educational institutions, and licensing and accreditation organizations largely recognize the need to better engage with clients from increasingly diverse backgrounds and interests. In response, agencies and educational entities are actively seeking ways to address issues of decision-making bias among professionals. Traditional training (i.e., seminars, written case studies, use of live actors), is typically done in physical spaces, may not be easily accessible, and can therefore be costly. The proposed product can be accessed remotely which lifts many logistical barriers to consumers. By providing evidence to support the efficacy and viability of the product, expected outcomes may include improved practitioner knowledge, skills, and competencies. This will likely enhance service delivery, reduce work related stressors, and decrease workforce challenges with the goal of increasing effectiveness of service delivery and quality of life for the client/customer/employee.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an evidence-based simulation program to prepare current and future point-of-care/contact professionals (such as welfare workers, health providers, law enforcement officers, public service/first responders, educators, etc.) to become more aware of and responsive to their unconscious bias. This product allows participants to examine potential unconscious biases using real-time simulated virtual experiences. In many industries, clients often engage in systems with professionals who have inadequate training in recognizing unconscious bias in their practice. This lack of awareness, and thus decreased likelihood for responsiveness, increases the risk of negative impacts on decision making. In addition to targeting increased awareness of unconscious bias, this innovative training may also help to reduce workforce turnover, and therefore, the repeated expense of hiring and onboarding new professionals. Given that the impact of unconscious bias in decision making often results in financial cost to organizations, negative service outcomes, and challenges with recruitment/retention, the product offers a potential cost-effective and accessible means to help address numerous pain points.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to enhance public awareness by providing critical historical context for recent concerns over globalization, technology trade, and the Buy American movement. It, furthermore, speaks to the geopolitical and socio-economic stakes of such trade, helping us understand when globalized supply distribution works?and doesn?t?and for whom.<br/><br/>Drawing on extensive research in business and state government archives as well as oral histories with former tech workers, the project explores the creation of a global supply chain at one major US-based firm?Control Data Corporation. Control Data, US Defense contractor and rival of IBM, produced some of the fastest and most powerful supercomputers of the twentieth century. Facing a decline in US Defense Department funding for research and development (R&D), however, the company began globalizing its manufacturing operations in the early 1960s. This global assembly line broke manufacturing into phases?R&D, marketing, assembly, and the production of parts and components?and strategically placed these phases around the world, from eastern Kentucky to Romania to South Korea. Reorganizing production lowered the costs of basic manufacturing, allowing executives to redistribute savings across the firm and take advantage of the dollar?s strength in international trade. At the same time, this production model assisted US power abroad by reordering public-private partnerships forged at the height of the Cold War across various federal agencies (Defense, State, Labor, etc.). The research zeros in on not only the interplay between company representatives and government officials in making the supply chain model in high-tech, but also foregrounds businessmen and bureaucrats? enlisting thousands of women into the company?s global electronic assembly operations. Overall, the project demonstrates that, by the time the Soviet Union collapsed and Control Data wound down in the early 1990s, one-world trade had been well underway for three decades in the computer industry?an arrangement with its own social and strategic trade-offs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary method of tracking and estimating the intensities of these storms is through viewing satellite images of the thick circular deck of high cirrus clouds that surround the center (or ?eye?) of the storm, also known as the cirrus shield. This project will examine the sources and budgets of the moisture and condensate (ice and snow) in the cirrus shield and how this relates to the overall structure and intensity of the storm. It will also investigate to what extent the strongest thunderstorms in and around tropical cyclones are transporting ice to even higher altitudes, which may represent a source of water vapor molecules that play important roles in the chemistry of the stratosphere, with implications for the ozone layer and Earth?s climate. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the dynamical processes and moist physics of the upper-level outflow that lies above all tropical cyclones (TCs). This outflow contains the central cirrus cloud shield seen by satellites that provide the vast majority of intensity estimates for all TCs around the globe. Occasional in-situ observations, airborne Doppler radar analyses, and increasingly realistic numerical simulations suggest that both the primary outflow, and also compensating inflow layers above and below, can have highly asymmetric structures, and are embedded with waves, dynamical instabilities, and overshooting cloud tops from strong updrafts. These overshooting updrafts may also be injecting moisture irreversibly into the stratosphere, possibly playing a non-trivial role in the water budget of the stratosphere. Airborne Doppler radar observations, dropsonde measurements, satellite images, and very high-resolution computer simulations will be used to better understand the three-dimensional structure of the outflow, including the adjacent inflow layers above and below the outflow.

These systems ensure that large-scale services (e.g., search, social networking) and critical services (e.g., e-commerce, healthcare) can reliably access essential data, even in the face of failures. However, a pressing concern when designing fault-tolerant storage systems is that their strong fault-tolerance guarantees come at the cost of performance. For instance, a fault-tolerant key-value store built using existing approaches can perform up to 20x worse than a stand-alone version of the store (that does not tolerate failures). This project aims to build fault-tolerant storage systems that closely approximate the performance of fault-intolerant (non-replicated) storage servers. The project will achieve this goal by systematically rethinking widely used fault-tolerance paradigms. This project will develop novel fault-tolerance protocols and abstractions and build new practical systems. In particular, it will first develop a new replication protocol optimized for modern storage devices. Second, it will explore a novel CPU-free replication approach that unlocks the full potential of remote direct memory access (RDMA). Third, it will realize a new fault-tolerance architecture tailored for emerging disaggregated datacenters. Finally, it will develop a new shared log abstraction for storage applications.<br/> <br/>The solutions developed in this project will enable the development of reliable and performant systems, eliminating the need to make compromises that threaten the data safety of critical applications.

The project will be an important opportunity to develop insights about how to teach scientific uncertainty at the undergraduate level?for which there is not yet any established research. The project will culminate in a guide designed to help faculty members at institutions across the country implement similar concepts in their own courses. Not only will enhanced understanding of scientific uncertainty help students to better understand the nature of science, but it will also help them communicate scientific findings more effectively with the broader public. The project thereby supports the NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science.<br/><br/>There are two research goals of the project: exploring how the integration of scientific uncertainty within the context of existing STEM courses impacts (1) understanding of scientific uncertainty and (2) students? ability to communicate about scientific uncertainty. It is expected that the integration of scientific uncertainty in STEM courses will positively impact both measures. The project will begin with a workshop offered to current faculty members at Morningside University which trains them in methods in teaching scientific uncertainty. Participating faculty members will design an uncertainty module to integrate into their courses which highlights scientific uncertainty in the context of the course material. The project team will conduct pre- and post-module implementation surveys and interviews (based on established measures of scientific literacy and uncertainty) to assess the changes in student perception and understanding of uncertainty as well as their ability to communicate what they have learned. The effectiveness of the modules will be evaluated by comparing the experimental group to control classes, where there is no added module about scientific uncertainty.

Weather prediction models were originally designed to operate at about 10-km grid resolution. At about 1-km grid resolution, atmospheric models enter the so-called ?gray zone,? where traditional physics parameterizations no longer hold, leading to errors in weather prediction. This project will create a new scale-aware framework to improve these parameterizations in the gray zone, with broad impacts for weather and regional climate forecasts, which increasingly use models in the gray zone for practical applications. The researchers will collaborate with scientists at NCAR and NOAA to guide this process and to make sure that the scale-aware approach is thoroughly tested and ready to implement in operational codes. Ultimately, this will further enable a vast array of applications at gray-zone and finer resolutions, such as weather prediction, wind energy forecasting, wildfire smoke modeling, and air quality modeling in urban environments. This project will also provide connections with the environmental justice community of concern in Stockton, California, where two teachers will be provided with summer research opportunities to develop a hands-on air pollution curriculum which will reach 700 high school students in the first two years. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to extend scale-aware turbulence parameterizations into the gray zone to allow a consistent representation of turbulent and resolved motions as grid resolutions increase. The scale-aware turbulence framework will be tested in the WRF model with a variety of physically and mathematically consistent closure models, with a focus on the dynamic reconstruction model (DRM) and simpler ?mixed models?. Mixed models combine a scale-similarity component with an eddy-viscosity model; mixed models are scale aware and have been shown to allow mesoscale models to better operate in the gray zone. This project will extend and thoroughly evaluate mixed models across the gray zone. New strategies for grid nesting will also be tested, including adjusting grid nesting ratios and using the FastEddy GPU code with very large domains to explore skipping the gray zone. Simulations will be performed over the Southern Great Plains, an area of interest for wind resources, and over Northern California, including inland locations with poor air quality and offshore regions being considered for wind energy development. Long-term simulations will be performed to assess improvement in model skill.

Many existing inference algorithms suffer from a ""curse of dimensionality"" that prohibits their applicability to models describing interacting dynamic processes occurring within and between many spatial locations. New algorithms will be developed, and shown in theory and in practice to advance capabilities for spatiotemporal data analysis. This methodological research will be carried out in the context of addressing a public health concern, transmission of dengue virus. Global incidence of dengue has risen 30-fold over the past fifty years, with notable geographical expansion in South and Central America. The municipality of Rio de Janeiro is a focal point for dengue transmission in this region. Spatiotemporal data on dengue cases in Rio de Janeiro will be analyzed, together with data on human movement, temperature, and rainfall. Policy decisions for the detection, control, and potential eradication of infectious diseases are informed by model-based understanding of disease transmission. Improved understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of disease transmission will have implications for improvements in disease control. Mathematical models will be developed to describe spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue transmission, and the novel statistical methodology will be used to link these models to the data from Rio de Janeiro.<br/><br/>Spatiotemporal partially-observed Markov process models provide a framework for formulating and answering questions relating spatiotemporal data to an underlying stochastic dynamic process. Statistically efficient inference involves integrating out over possible values of the latent process, a task known as filtering. Except when the system is approximately linear and Gaussian, filtering spatiotemporal models is challenging. One algorithm developed in this project will address the curse of dimensionality by guiding Monte Carlo particles toward important regions in the latent variable space. Another algorithm will combine many weak, independent filters to give a global filtering solution. Disease transmission systems, which are highly nonlinear and stochastic and are imperfectly observable, will be used to motivate and demonstrate the capabilities of the new algorithms. Specifically, models will be developed for the dynamics of dengue transmission in the major metropolis of Rio de Janeiro.  Spatiotemporal stochastic epidemiological models will be used to examine the role of human mobility, host immunity, and climate variability in the context of a heterogeneous socioeconomic landscape.  A particular goal is to identify locations that function as sources of infection critical to disease invasion and persistence as well as those that act as sinks incapable of sustained local transmission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the research is to understand how to amplify environmental detection by the quantum states of metal-ion magnetic nuclei, which would be essential for the development of next-generation quantum bits or magnetic resonance imaging sensors. The project lies at the interface of coordination chemistry, physics, and quantum information science and will thus educate scientists at all levels in these areas.

Three specific classes of hybrid electron/nuclear complexes will be prepared to answer the following questions: 1) Can spin-crossovers be harnessed to amplify the environmental sensing by metal-ion nuclear spins? 2) Can valence tautomerizations be used to effect environmental detection capabilities by a metal-ion nuclear spin? 3) What are the design principles for a radical satellite to best amplify the response of metal-ion spin dynamics to changes in local chemistry?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, the distributed nature of the computations demands efficient communication; dynamic resources and computations demand online solutions without full knowledge of the future. For instance, scalable artificial intelligence (AI) requires the effective mapping of dynamic neural network computations into networks of computing devices. This project concerns the design of efficient and effective algorithms for scheduling large-scale computations in distributed infrastructure such as cloud systems and datacenter networks.  The expected outcomes of the project are solutions for more effective processing of large AI tasks and resource allocation policies in cloud computing systems, with improved performance for business operations and mission-critical systems.  The integrated educational component of the project includes training undergraduate and doctoral students in infrastructure algorithms, curriculum development, and outreach to engage high school students and inspire them to explore careers in math and computing.<br/><br/>This project has two major thrusts.  The first concerns the scheduling of precedence-constrained jobs and computation graphs in distributed networks and reconfigurable machines.  This is motivated by the fact that as computational workloads get larger and more complex, it is often necessary to distribute many communicating jobs across a large network of devices. These devices may have different speeds, different computing capabilities, and restrictions on which jobs they can execute due to resource and security concerns.  The second thrust concerns the online migration of computations and servers in a distributed system in response to dynamic requests. One motivation comes from data intensive applications that generate significant network traffic; to enable efficient communication among processes dispersed across many clusters, distributed systems are increasingly reconfigurable and strategically migrate processes to reduce communication. The presented problems include communication-aware scheduling of precedence-constrained jobs in networks with general delays, scheduling of split table jobs in reconfigurable machines, minimum-stretch embedding of graphs, heterogeneous variants of the classic online k-server problem, and online balanced graph partitioning. The technical approaches include new linear-programming based techniques that address communication and topological constraints, and new methods in online algorithms. This project also explores new frameworks for studying these problems, including learning-augmented algorithms through predictions of processing times and communication needs, reconfigurable architectures, and mobile ad hoc networks with heterogeneous devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there are no large-scale or nationwide professional development opportunities focused on reforming chemistry laboratory curricula. This comprehensive year-long professional development program will empower chemistry educators to enhance student learning in chemistry laboratories by promoting scientific practices and fostering a sense of belonging. Moreover, as part of the professional development program, participants will create and disseminate more than 40 new inquiry-based laboratory projects, which have been shown to be more effective for student learning than traditional ?cookbook? style laboratory experiences. Data will be collected and analyzed to broaden understanding of the extent to which such professional development affects teaching beliefs and instructional practices of laboratory curricula developers. This new knowledge will have the potential to impact the success of future faculty professional development initiatives. Overall, this project will lead to direct instructional support that can benefit thousands of undergraduate chemistry students and may lead to long-term changes in the instructional practices of up to 126 laboratory curriculum developers. This Institutional and Community Transformation Level 2 project aligns with NSF's mission to advance science education, serving the national interest by improving student success.<br/><br/>Chemistry educators have long been dissatisfied with traditional laboratory approaches, but many face barriers that prevent them from adopting new frameworks and evidence-based practices. This project aims to establish a nationwide community of chemistry laboratory curriculum developers equipped with the knowledge, skills, and resources to implement effective instructional reforms. Three bodies of work comprise the theory of change guiding this project: (1) Clarke and Hollingsworth?s Model of Teacher Professional Growth; (2) Wenger?s Communities of Practice framework; and (3) AAC&U?s Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM logic model. Four cohorts containing 42 institutional teams from varying contexts and institutional settings (including minority-serving and 2-year institutions) will collaborate to create and disseminate more than 40 inquiry-based laboratory projects. The teams will participate in a comprehensive yearlong professional development during which they will learn about evidence-based practices, including (1) curriculum reform through backward design with a specific focus on pedagogical aspects unique to chemistry (e.g., Johnstone?s triangle); (2) reducing equity gaps through fostering a sense of belonging; and (3) building scientific practices through inquiry (NGSS framework). By establishing this nationwide community of laboratory curriculum developers with training in evidence-based practices (84-126 instructors and 42 TAs), this program will have a transformative impact on chemistry laboratory instruction practices. Additionally, through triangulation of student and instructor surveys, instructors? reflections and interviews, and laboratory artifacts, the project will generate new knowledge about the landscape of instructional thinking and practices of the laboratory curriculum developers and will evaluate the extent to which professional development impacts progressions in the thinking and practices of the laboratory curriculum developers.

Currently, the average menstruator spends $20 on feminine hygiene products per cycle, but often experiences unnecessary discomfort or embarrassment when using pads and tampons. In addition, these commonly used products put them at a higher risk for developing endometriosis, toxic shock syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Although menstrual cups are available on the market, many menstruators won't convert from their current solutions due to the product's intimidating size and difficulty with insertion and removal. This technology addresses these concerns and may bridge the gap between the convenience of tampons and the benefits of menstrual cups.  Women have reported that menstrual cups may provide increased comfort, less interference with activities, less irritation, decreased odor, and the ability to wear a cup for longer periods of time than a pad or tampon.  The technology may offer a sustainable and easy-to-use menstrual cup that provides users a safe solution with long-lasting comfort and function.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translational potential of the technology. The technology is based on the prior development of an intravaginal menstrual cup and applicator to collect menstrual fluid. The technology uses a bell-shaped cup and loop tab design in combination with a tampon-like applicator. The product?s bell-shape provides optimal capacity for collecting menstrual fluid and is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably within the vaginal canal. For insertion, the device uses a common folding technique, known as the C-fold. The flexible silicone device is inserted into the polycarbonate plunger-applicator to be deployed into the vaginal canal. For removal, a loop at the base of the cup provides an attachment point for a biocompatible and adjustable cord. This design allows for mess-free and easy extraction. The cup has been shown to have a longer wear time, reducing the need for frequent changes.  In addition, the solution has an eco-friendly, reusable design that may result in a significant reduction in environmental waste.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, weed control costs have been growing due to the rise of herbicide-resistant weeds and the increase in costs of agricultural labor. Additionally, increased demand for fruits and vegetables leaves these specialty crop farmers struggling to find options to increase productivity while keeping expenses manageable. Several companies offer automated weed control in vegetables; however, these large platforms struggle not to damage fruit in berry orchards. This project aims to develop swarms of robotic devices that can operate underneath the plant canopy to provide mechanical weed control for berries throughout the year without impacting plant growth. This technological development will enable domestic fruit production to meet the growing consumer demand and allow for less chemical use in fruit production, reducing herbicide-associated health risks to farm workers and consumers. Long term, these devices can augment weed control strategies in other crops and perform different agricultural tasks such as fungicide treatments and plant health monitoring, with the goal of automating agriculture to be more efficient and sustainable. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer project aims to develop rugged, low-to-the-ground, multi-legged robots that can locomote in various agricultural fields. This technology builds off of recent works demonstrating the effectiveness of centipedes and centipede-like robots when traveling over diverse terrains. When properly coordinated, these mechanically redundant legged systems demonstrate robust locomotion in complex terrain without the need for sensory feedback. This project will leverage this platform and perform systematic robot experimentation and theoretical modeling to develop coordination schemes for various maneuvers in agricultural terrain analogues. These strategies will then be implemented on a hardened robot to reliably locomote beneath the canopy in crop fields and identify weeds using an onboard camera and computer vision techniques. This device will make use of low-cost components and principles of mobility in complex environments to deliver guaranteed locomotion in these unpredictable terrains. Eventually, swarms of these devices will be deployed on various crop fields to provide autonomous weed management throughout the growing season, decreasing the costs of production for farmers and consumers. This project will result in a robust robotic platform that can provide cheap, reliable, all-terrain locomotion and such a device can extend beyond agriculture to address other U.S. sectors such as search-and-rescue and defense.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, most essential services we use today, such as Microsoft 365, Apple Photos, Stock Exchanges, and ChatGPT, are ensconced in large data centers that include Microsoft Azure, iCloud, and Google Cloud -- collections of many thousand servers connected by large data center networks.  It is no surprise then that Internet databases (so-called prefix tables), used for routing, are growing steadily in both the wide area and data centers.  Worse, they are also getting wider (from 32 bits to 128 bits per data packet) with the rapid adoption of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) by mobile carriers.  All this has stressed the capability of the Internet core?s routers and router chips, especially with additional power constraints.<br/><br/><br/>This grant seeks to take first steps towards creating a new approach to designing Network Algorithms (sometimes called Network Algorithmics) using a new model of router processors called the CRAM model. In the CRAM model, fine-grained Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) and random-access memory (RAM) can be dynamically allocated to a set of programmable processors. This model is an abstraction of newer network processors such as Intel?s Tofino-1 and 2 (used by the Arista 7170 and Cisco Nexus 34180YC) and is apparent in many other new processors in the market such as AMD?s Pensando.  Intellectually, the CRAM model is a new abstraction of these processors (like famous earlier models of complexity like the RAM and parallel random-access machine (PRAM) models) that allows quickly designing and evaluating scalable algorithms for all router processing tasks. Practically, we show early results that using CAM and RAM strategically can greatly improve router scalability.  For example, our new viewpoint allows us to create new algorithms that enable the Tofino-2 to scale to 5 million IPv4 prefixes while a pure CAM implementation only allows at most 250,000 prefixes, 28% of the current wide area database. Similarly, a second new algorithm allows Tofino-2 to scale to 700,000 IPv6 prefixes, 5.8 times larger than a pure CAM solution.  Our grant seeks to further develop the intellectual foundations of the CRAM model, build compilers from higher level CRAM descriptions to actual implementations, and generalize beyond IP lookups to find new scalable algorithms for packet classification, machine learning and security tasks, that can help sustain the amazing growth of the Internet and its accompanying services.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference is a 5-day research and professional development workshop for graduate students in the fields of geometric group theory, geometry, and topology.  Its primary goals are to a) expose graduate students to a wide range of current research in topology,  b) build their communication, networking, and problem-sharing skills, and c) give guidance on necessary but typically untaught aspects of the profession.   Approximately 50 graduate students will participate, guided by 10 mentors, who come from a wide range of career stages and represent a broad array of topics within geometry and topology including contact and symplectic topology, 3-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry, group actions, and complex dynamics. The conference provides the participants, especially those from underrepresented groups, with many tools that will help them to succeed as scientists at the highest levels, in graduate school and beyond.<br/><br/>For many of the students, the TSW is the first conference they attend and at which they present their own results. The workshop is designed to facilitate this experience (for instance, our first professional development session is an introduction to conferences and how best to benefit from them).  The goal is to build confidence and research potential among students, as well as to build community.  The skills addressed here are not typically taught in grad school and can be disproportionately beneficial to students from minority groups, as indicated from responses from participants in previous iterations of the program. The professional development and research sides of the workshop run in tandem, with mentors giving guidance in both areas.  The workshop includes structured sessions on networking and etiquette, the job application process, communication skills, and a panel discussion on career paths (which also involves mathematicians from organizations such as NSA, Amazon, Google, and private high schools).   Mentors also give research talks, both to model good communication and introduce their research areas (deliberately chosen broadly) and relevant problems to students who are embarking on a research career.   Effective communication is a major theme: two evening sessions are devoted to workshopping presentations in small groups; the final presentations are videotaped and critiqued by those in attendance.

The forest products industry employs nearly one million people and contributes hundreds of billions of dollars to the US economy each year. Yet, there has been very little technological innovation in logging in recent decades. This project aims to research and develop computer vision technology that will augment a person?s ability to grade harvested trees accurately.

During the project, a suitable domain-specific dataset will be established, a new chain of computer vision models will be created and trained, and a fully integrated prototype will be deployed in a remote environment. To achieve these goals, the company will research the use of self-supervised learning to expedite the creation of a domain-specific dataset, along with adaptable chains of models and model compression to enable efficient inference at the logging site (i.e., without the need for cloud computing resources). The company will also create new methods for determining specific objects of interest (such as defects) and assessing the grade of each log. If successful, the project will demonstrate a computer vision system that is able to identify and locate specific logs of interest, track the logs, assess each log?s dimensions, locate defects on the logs, accurately determine a grade for each log, and give visual feedback to a machine operator ? all within the operator?s brief decision timeframe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although hydrogen offers zero exhaust emissions, it poses challenges due to its higher flame temperature and reactivity with alloys compared to natural gas. This project focuses on developing a high-temperature alloy system, fabricated through additive manufacturing, ensuring longevity and reliability in hydrogen combustion environments. Through scaling a patent-pending thermal treatment, the project aims to enhance the alloy's material properties for durable aftermarket parts like vanes, blades, shrouds, and panel segments. These components can surpass the properties of existing precision investment castings and are essential for converting industrial gas turbines to efficiently burn hydrogen, currently powering a significant portion of US combined heat and power and global electricity generation. The carbon abatement potential is substantial, with the conversion of one targeted segment capable of reducing over 1 GT of CO2 emissions. The innovation extends to manufacturing advanced, high-value components for aerospace jet engine repair and overhaul, presenting a potential Year 3 production revenue of $20 million and providing critical supply base resiliency for hard-to-source components in gas turbines. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to advance additively manufactured, high-temperature alloy research, focusing on applications in hydrogen combustion within industrial gas turbines. The project will fabricate mechanical and environmental test specimens using an alloy composition containing oxide dispersion-strengthening constituents designed specifically to withstand reactive hydrogen conditions. Testing will encompass critical properties like creep resistance, low cycle fatigue, and hydrogen embrittlement. A pivotal aspect involves post-processing the alloy through directional heat treatment and modifying the grain structure to enhance creep resistance, which is critical in the high-temperature operation of vane segments, shrouds, blades, and gas turbine components. Studies show superior properties compared to existing additively manufactured superalloys and precision investment cast equivalents. The project's objectives include optimizing the alloy, refining manufacturing conditions, and obtaining key performance data for service conditions. Preliminary design curve data will be established, facilitating the fabrication of components for hot-fire testing and retrofitting into real gas turbine engines.

One of the goals of attosecond and strong-field physics is to access fundamental information on electronic motion in its natural time scale and be able to control charge migration in molecules, e.g., to select a specific bond breaking at a molecular site, or to trigger a chemical reaction. The main objective of the project is to develop a new, efficient, and versatile numerical method to support the experimental and theoretical study of the interaction of multi-electron systems with ultra-short and intense laser pulses. This work aims at contributing to the development of attochemistry and ultimately bridge the gap between attosecond physics and biology. In addition, as connecting experimental measurements to real-time meaningful physical observables has shown to be far from simple, new methods will be investigated to track the rapid dynamics of photoelectron emitted from different valence shells in molecules, as well as during tunnel ionization in intense laser fields. <br/><br/>With attosecond physics becoming among the most thriving fields of science, new theoretical tools are needed to support the exploration of attosecond phenomena in complex systems. ATTOMESA, a new numerical method for ultrafast physics, will be designed to treat various multiphoton processes investigated with current experimental setups, and to study unexplored aspects of driven multielectron attosecond and strong field dynamics in atoms and molecules. The formalism used in ATTOMESA includes electron correlation and exchange, as well as inter-channel coupling. It is based on a hybrid quadrature approach, where a quantum-chemistry description using Gaussian-type orbitals is used in the short-range to mid-range electron-molecule interaction region, while finite-element discretized variable representation functions complement the description at larger electronic radius, resulting in a highly efficient parallel ab initio method able to treat strong field processes in molecules. Consequently, processes such as high-harmonic generation and frustrated tunnel ionization can be handled fully ab initio. In this work, the following physical processes will be treated with ATTOMESA; photoionization time delay near a Cooper minimum and between different valence shells using a new spectroscopic method, estimation of electronic coherence in a biomolecule after sudden photoionization, and finally assessing the role of electron correlation in streaking/attoclock experiments. Finally, Bohmian mechanics will be employed as a useful tool to interpret strong-field phenomena in atoms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This development embodies the emergence of cyber-human relationships and Digital Twin and Smart Factory applications, reinforcing U.S. manufacturing leadership, bolstering economic competitiveness, and fortifying national security. The anticipated commercial Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution is poised to benefit approximately 10,000 U.S. manufacturing firms. Beyond its economic implications, the first-generation, open-specification Reality Modeling Language (RML) developed in this project is expected to gain widespread acceptance in the international standards community, improving spatial system automation across diverse industry verticals. Ultimately, this system will render the physical world more accessible, searchable, and comprehensively annotated with data, unlocking new frontiers in user support, safety, and efficiency.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses mission-critical challenges for fully leveraging Augmented Reality (AR) tools in manufacturing environments. It draws upon ontologically structured data and a proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven knowledge system for automating the generation and display of context-specific AR content in 3D space, eliminating the need for individually designed AR interactions. The solution enables training and work instruction systems to become spatially- and contextually aware, in order to adapt to dynamic conditions impacting worker safety and efficiency. The objective of this project is to demonstrate and quantify how automatically generated, spatially- and semantically aware AR can provide work guidance, machine status data, and hazard warnings to increase worker capabilities versus conventional guidance tools.

The different kinds of auroras have different generation mechanisms with the discreet appearing as ?curtains? or well defined ?ribbons or lines? in the sky, while the latter are visible as ?fuzzy? structures from the ground. TECHNO (Thermospheric Estimation and Characterization with Nitric Oxide) aims at improving the modeling of aurora and probing in detail how the circulation in the upper atmosphere responds during magnetic storms. The methodology involves incorporating the physics and chemistry associated with discrete aurora in the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) model, as it currently is limited to diffuse aurora. TECHNO will investigate how the circulation of the upper atmosphere changes during magnetic storms by looking at how key chemical components of the atmosphere, Nitric Oxide (NO) varies seasonally and how it is related to changes in the aurora and the polar vortex. Investigating these issues is crucial to improving forecasts of the aurora that directly impact HF radio communication and GPS/GNSS satellite navigation, as well as changes in the density of the upper atmosphere that affect the orbits of satellites and space debris in Low Earth Orbit. This inter-disciplinary work advances scientific knowledge and will support training of an early-career scientist.<br/><br/>NO plays a significant role in the overall heat budget of the thermosphere due to its role in radiative cooling via infrared emissions. Thus, it is one of the processes that govern the distribution of energy and momentum in the ionosphere-thermosphere system. The other factors include intensification of (a) discreet aurora during increased particle precipitation and (b) meridional winds due to increased pressure gradients. The main objective of the work is to investigate the changes in NO concentrations caused by the polar vortex variability and discreet aurora. The second goal is to quantify the model uncertainties in temperature and densities as it relates to NO. The methodology comprises use of various ionospheric models (GITM, MAGNIT), simulations of storms using GITM, validation with the satellite data sets. The project will conclude with a study of how the uncertainties in auroral energy and increased downward flux affect variations in the resulting neutral density and temperature. Relevance of this research to both GEM and CEDAR programs will enhance collaborations between these two scientific communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ENSO causes shifts in precipitation in arid coastal areas which can cause flash flooding and severe damage. This study emphasizes how changing floodplain morphology can make it more difficult for people to reduce their exposure to these floods. Flood events can alter the landscape to the extent that peoples? capabilities to adapt to future events are limited. Consequently, knowledge about how to adapt to these events must be updated to deal with future potential hazards. Communities must continuously experience, observe, and communicate as they adjust over centuries and millennia to evolving floodplain conditions. Archaeology is well-suited to examine these processes of adapting to the evolution of river hazards. Attention to ancient settlement patterns and their respective floodplain environments reveals how societies mitigated potential flooding by finding elevated areas and generating flood-adapted infrastructure. Interpretations of this data inform modern mitigation efforts as flooding is an ongoing, dynamic risk experienced increasingly by populations worldwide. <br/><br/>The interdisciplinary project consists of two parts: integrated hydrologic modeling to predict river behavior and a geological study of sediment sampled from past floods. The model uses historic stream flows, geospatial data, paleoclimatic reconstructions, and ethnohistoric accounts to determine ENSO flood hotspots. Additionally, paleochannels and remnant riverbeds are significant conduits of and contributors to overland flooding. Given their longevity in floodplain geomorphology, they serve as critical indicators for where past and future flooding might occur. Researchers study 650 previously surveyed archaeological sites in a single river valley to determine their exposure to increasing ENSO flood magnitudes in the floodplain and alluvial fan. The team utilizes geophysical and geochemical methods to evaluate soil characteristics in paleochannels to ascertain the impacts of flooding on the long-term stability and primary productivity of bankside landscapes. Leveraging multiple approaches to investigating flooding, this project contributes to archaeological methods and theories regarding flood risk, water resource management, and land use to explore past human-environment interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

OSA affects over 1 billion people globally, including 54 million in the U.S. Untreated, CCCp leads to debilitating daytime sleepiness, neurocognitive dysfunction, accidents, and doubles the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes, costing the US healthcare system $88 billion annually. Notably, 30% of all OSA patients, or 16 million Americans, suffer from CCCp, a particularly challenging form of sleep apnea to treat. Over half of the patients fail the first-line treatment of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and many avoid costly surgeries, leaving 6 million untreated yearly. This solution offers a non-invasive, clinically effective treatment for OSA patients, focusing on CCCp and poorly treated palatal collapse. This technology seeks to transform sleep apnea care by providing an accessible treatment option with significant societal and commercial impact.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a neurostimulation platform addressing the need for non-invasive, clinically effective treatment of palatal collapse in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Unlike traditional neurostimulation methods with limited applicability and invasive implantation, this approach takes a non-invasive approach by targeting stimulation to the palate and pharynx. The device may be fit and titrated in-clinic and deployed by patients each night at-home. The technology involves a removable oral appliance that activates stimulation during sleep, timing therapy delivery to patient inspiration. The device set, comprising the oral appliance and a wireless charging case, enables easy control of stimulation parameters. The case also records and uploads usage and disease parameters, offering data for clinician-guided therapy optimization. Validation through research, including benchtop, ex-vivo and in-vivo porcine and cadaver studies, has poised this technology for clinical trials and eventual Food and Drug Administration approval.

Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as the delivery of a baby before 37 weeks of gestation. PTB is the number one cause of infant death worldwide and it also the number one cause of infant neurological disorders and long-term cognitive impairment.  PTB leads to health issues, including problems with hearing, vision, digestion, and breathing. To decrease preterm births, it is important to identify at-risk pregnancies to initiate preventive interventions. Unfortunately, numerous studies indicate that current methods are insufficient and ineffective in predicting preterm birth. The strength of the cervix collagen fiber network is integral to maintaining gestation, and loss of collagen architecture is intrinsic to many preterm labor occurrences. Using the technology developed in this project, the Portable Preterm Imaging System (PRIMM) to monitor collagen architecture, the team can non-invasively assess the risk of pre-term labor at early stages. The risk assessment of PTB could be used to formulate a therapeutic strategy, including using medications or bedrest to delay birth. Affording the infant a few additional weeks of gestation could improve health outcomes for both mother and child as well as reduce healthcare costs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a method for scanning, imaging, and screening cervical dysplasia, infections, and cancer. The Portable Preterm Imaging System (PPRIM) introduced in this research is a proprietary technology comprising a specialized imaging system enclosed within a flexible insertable sheath. This imaging system is equipped with a camera featuring integrated polarizers, accompanied by a custom-made LED ring illuminator. The novel design approach employed in this system enables the generation of a matrix dataset capable of forming voxel per sample. Notably, the PPRIM is unique due to its wide field of view which ensures the entire cervix can be captured in a single image. Furthermore, its fast acquisition time facilitates quick and efficient examinations. The PPRIM has been designed to prioritize ease of use and provide comfort during the procedure. Its simplicity is a key feature, as the device offers comprehensive coverage of the cervical area, delivering valuable information to healthcare providers and patients alike.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project supports the development and expansion of TimeTree, an open-source and unified database that synthesizes these data into a global timetree of life. Users can obtain the divergence time of any two species, a timeline showing all evolutionary splits back in time, and exportable timetrees of any group or from a custom list of species. Events in geological and astronomical history, such as asteroid impacts, oxygen levels, and solar luminosity, are integrated into the same timescale with species timetrees and timelines, facilitating interdisciplinary research and applications in areas like molecular biology, conservation, and medicine. The new TimeTree resource will implement new algorithms, tools, and application programming interfaces to speed, improve, and increase the efficiency of timetree curation and data mining.

The objectives of this project are to design, synthesize and characterize core-shell structured organic molecules, to gain a fundamental understanding of the structure-property-performance correlation of synthesized organic molecules, and to leverage this understanding for designing a transformative hybrid flow battery for future energy storage applications. The project offers several broader impacts, including fundamental knowledge of organic molecules, novel battery technology development, training of the future science and technology workforce at undergraduate and graduate levels, and an outreach program that can engage high school students including students from groups traditionally underrepresented in chemistry and chemical engineering.<br/> <br/>To unleash the potential of hybrid magnesium-organic flow batteries, new organic molecular structure design is proposed.  The design consists of core-shell structured organic molecules with an aromatic core, a redox-active shell, and a polyether chain connecting them. Such core-shell structured molecules have the potential to enable fast electron-transfer reactions to the redox-active moieties located in the shell, and provides multiple design freedoms to tune the solubility, capacity, potential, and stability of organic molecules. Thus, this approach has great potential to achieve transformative energy storage performance compared to the state-of-the-art hybrid flow batteries. A systematic experimental study is proposed, including design and synthesis of core-shell structured organic molecules, chemical and electrochemical characterization of the synthesized molecules, a device-level study of flow battery performance of synthesized molecules, as well as in situ/ex situ studies to understand reaction mechanisms and performance limiting factors. The overall long term aim is to achieve a comprehensive fundamental understanding of the structure-property-performance correlation of core-shell structured organic molecules for magnesium-organic flow batteries. The goal is to eventually provide rational structure/design guidelines of organic materials for high-voltage, high-capacity and stable non-aqueous magnesium-organic flow batteries.  Such tunable organic molecules in the longer term have potential application areas that include supporting redox-flow batteries, CO2 capture, electrochemical sensing, organic electronics, and separations science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One such disease is cervical myelopathy (CM), a condition in which the spinal cord is compressed within the neck. Cervical myelopathy is estimated to affect up to 2% of adults globally, but is often underdiagnosed due to subtle complexities in imaging and presentation. Cervical myelopathy has an insidious and irreversible progression of neurological symptoms that may require surgical intervention, and the current path to diagnosis may take up to 2 years from symptom onset to diagnosis/treatment with an average of 5 consults. This technology is designed to automate and standardize analysis of the spinal cord using medical imaging. Early detection of spinal cord disease, quantification of degenerative pathology, and identification of surgical candidates are all unmet needs that may improve patient outcomes, decrease cost, and reduce medical burden for CM patients.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The technology is based on the prior development of a machine learning-based software solution that uses spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical findings to identify patients at high risk for particular degenerative spinal diseases. The technology uses deep learning and image registration models to annotate anatomical structures and enable extraction of clinical metrics. In addition, an automated image analysis pipeline has been developed that generates novel clinical metrics designed in collaboration with surgeons and radiologists that aid in the characterization of spinal disease pathology. Next steps include developing models on larger-scale clinical imaging datasets for further model training, validation, and statistical analysis, in addition to incorporating additional machine learning techniques to improve the robustness of model performance on different MRI acquisition techniques.

Sketching and streaming algorithms have been successful in tackling many problems in these settings, ranging from data analysis, network algorithms, to optimization. One research objective of this project is to further improve these algorithms, in terms of time and memory efficiency, with the aid of machine learning predictions. This project will also apply sketching techniques to develop federated machine learning algorithms where data is distributed across machines or devices, offering privacy advantages due to their decentralized nature. The project also aims to improve the foundation of data science and computer science education at San Diego State University and in the community at large through collaboration with the TRIPODS EnCore Institute at UC San Diego.<br/><br/>Unlike traditional worst-case analysis, by incorporating machine learning to unravel the underlying structure of the data, it becomes possible in many cases to design better algorithms. The investigator plans to improve the efficiency of existing sketching and streaming algorithms using machine learning. These improvements are in terms of space and time complexity as well as approximation quality. A wide range of problems in this paradigm including data summarization, graph theory, and combinatorial optimization will be considered. Additionally, the investigator plans to utilize sketching to aid the design of machine learning algorithms in distributed and federated settings. Data sketches offer several advantages for this task. They have a small memory footprint and can be merged to form a sketch of the combined data. Additionally, they reveal minimal information about local data, benefiting privacy. The investigator aims to employ sketching algorithms on various problems such as building boosted decision trees for classification and regression, and learning a Bayesian network to explain the data.

Widely used examples include GitHub Copilot and OpenAI ChatGPT. However, code generated by these tools can have bugs that are not caught by users, and this presents a serious safety risk. This project will leverage an idea called ""proof-carrying code"" where code suggestions are packaged together with a mathematical proof of their safety, allowing programmers to be confident that the program is safe to deploy. This project will develop tools, techniques, and empirical results for using LLMs to generate trustworthy code together with mathematical proofs. Project outcomes, including code, data sets and course materials, will be developed in the open and made available online to researchers working on LLMs, end users of LLM-based code generation, and early industry and open source adopters.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, researchers in the programming languages community recognized a powerful idea known as proof-carrying code (PCC): they showed how code can be shipped together with a proof of its safety that could be vetted ? efficiently ? by an end user. LLMs can be viewed as high-resource computations, and LLM users as low-resource entities. Seen through this lens, PCC maps naturally to the safety problem for LLM-generated code. The technical aims of this project are divided into four thrusts: (1) Gather empirical data on code that is currently generated by LLMs, and to determine core safety risks, to enable building of a dataset that will be useful to other researchers; (2) Develop a framework for PCC, including enumeration of safety properties of interest and showing how to instantiate the framework with existing program verification, proof languages, and proof frameworks; (3) Implement new tools for verification condition generation from source code for popular programming languages and for specific safety properties; and (4) Evaluate the use of LLMs for generating proofs in this context, including developing new algorithms and proof sampling techniques to improve model effectiveness. The research will lead to new insights into the current capabilities of LLMs, to new relevant safety properties for code generation in a black-box setting, and to new techniques to generate verification conditions -- to bridge the gap in formal verification technology from special-purpose languages like Coq and Dafny to general-purpose programming languages in popular use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there are no large-scale or nationwide professional development opportunities focused on reforming chemistry laboratory curricula. This comprehensive year-long professional development program will empower chemistry educators to enhance student learning in chemistry laboratories by promoting scientific practices and fostering a sense of belonging. Moreover, as part of the professional development program, participants will create and disseminate more than 40 new inquiry-based laboratory projects, which have been shown to be more effective for student learning than traditional ?cookbook? style laboratory experiences. Data will be collected and analyzed to broaden understanding of the extent to which such professional development affects teaching beliefs and instructional practices of laboratory curricula developers. This new knowledge will have the potential to impact the success of future faculty professional development initiatives. Overall, this project will lead to direct instructional support that can benefit thousands of undergraduate chemistry students and may lead to long-term changes in the instructional practices of up to 126 laboratory curriculum developers. This Institutional and Community Transformation Level 2 project aligns with NSF's mission to advance science education, serving the national interest by improving student success.<br/><br/>Chemistry educators have long been dissatisfied with traditional laboratory approaches, but many face barriers that prevent them from adopting new frameworks and evidence-based practices. This project aims to establish a nationwide community of chemistry laboratory curriculum developers equipped with the knowledge, skills, and resources to implement effective instructional reforms. Three bodies of work comprise the theory of change guiding this project: (1) Clarke and Hollingsworth?s Model of Teacher Professional Growth; (2) Wenger?s Communities of Practice framework; and (3) AAC&U?s Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM logic model. Four cohorts containing 42 institutional teams from varying contexts and institutional settings (including minority-serving and 2-year institutions) will collaborate to create and disseminate more than 40 inquiry-based laboratory projects. The teams will participate in a comprehensive yearlong professional development during which they will learn about evidence-based practices, including (1) curriculum reform through backward design with a specific focus on pedagogical aspects unique to chemistry (e.g., Johnstone?s triangle); (2) reducing equity gaps through fostering a sense of belonging; and (3) building scientific practices through inquiry (NGSS framework). By establishing this nationwide community of laboratory curriculum developers with training in evidence-based practices (84-126 instructors and 42 TAs), this program will have a transformative impact on chemistry laboratory instruction practices. Additionally, through triangulation of student and instructor surveys, instructors? reflections and interviews, and laboratory artifacts, the project will generate new knowledge about the landscape of instructional thinking and practices of the laboratory curriculum developers and will evaluate the extent to which professional development impacts progressions in the thinking and practices of the laboratory curriculum developers.

Unfortunately, they currently suffer from chemical degradation at the interfaces and deposition of Li between particles of the oxides frequently used as the electrolyte, which ultimately hinders their long-term reversibility. The goal of this work, supported by the Ceramics Program within the Division of Materials Research, is to develop fluoride-based materials that are more robust against these detrimental side reactions. While fluorides have been explored as solid electrolytes in the past, very few phases with fast ionic conductivity at room temperature have been discovered. This work postulates that the formation energy of defects plays a critical role for enabling fast diffusion and seeks to elucidate ways to control their evolution during synthesis. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will study new fluoride-based garnets and Zr-based compounds to better understand how the structural rigidity of fluorides affects ionic conductivity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations will be used to gain a deeper understanding of charge transport through the weakly polarizable anionic sublattice of fluorides. Aliovalent chemical substitutions will be performed to examine the impact of increasing the lithium content or creating vacancies in the lattice has on the conductivity. Fundamentally, the proposed research seeks to develop a deeper understanding of how to promote fast ion transport in fluoride-based solid electrolytes through an integrated approach involving synthesis, advanced characterization, and theoretical modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadening participation in technology is a national imperative, not only because it is a matter of societal equity and beneficial to innovation, but also because of critical labor market needs. Women of color are underrepresented in tech education, and careers and many years of research has documented that women who identify as African American, Black, Hispanic, Latina, American Indian, Asian American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or of other Pacific Islander face a range of structural and social barriers in tech education and careers. The meeting series will culminate in the development of a systemic action map, co-designed by the participants, that will guide a dynamic systems-change strategy.<br/><br/>This three-meeting series will bring together a range of stakeholders across academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations in tech to work together to develop a systemic action map, which will serve as a resource to the broader tech ecosystem in supporting efforts at intersectional gender equity in support of women of color in tech. This meeting series is distinctive in its focus on the creation of a community-built resource to guide a systemic approach that is specific to women of color in tech. The effort is guided by the 2022 National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine consensus study report Transforming Trajectories for Women of Color in Tech. The map will serve as a resource that will visually show where there are opportunities for disruption in the system that can serve as levers for change, as well as identify inhibiting feedback loops that consistently undermine policies, practices, and efforts that seek to support greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech but fail to do so meaningfully. At the culmination of the three-meeting series, the systemic action map, and associated report that explains the map and the process for its creation, will be made available as a public resource. The map will guide the development of an implementation plan. This effort will ultimately reveal ways in which stakeholders across tech can work together, or separately, as appropriate, to advance action with the key insights that emerged from the mapping process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team will implement new approaches, which are needed because traditional electromagnetic (radio-frequency) spectrum monitoring approaches are losing effectiveness. The continuing growth of wireless communications requires the limited available spectrum to be used ever more efficiently. To pack wireless systems more tightly, transmitters and receivers are evolving to use directional antennas that can steer away from interference. Directional transmissions mean a sensor at a single location can no longer rely on detecting all nearby transmissions, and when the sensor does observe an incoming signal, it cannot easily predict what other devices or locations are impacted. SweepSpace seeks to overcome these limitations and provide new spatial and directional information that enables safely increasing communications and sensing capacity without increasing spectrum cost. This project evaluates the new methods and the SweepSpace prototype through analysis, laboratory tests and limited field experiments. The project will provide training for the next-generation workforce for wireless communications and spectrum science by engaging graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, including students from underrepresented groups. SweepSpace sensor kits, based on a low-cost software defined radio, will be created for use in workshops, demonstrations, and classrooms. <br/><br/>SweepSpace is a generalized spectrum sensing architecture designed to report all spatio-temporal activity in a spatial-frequency volume. Complete knowledge of transmissions requires the deployment of a dense network of sensors; it requires each sensor to detect all incoming signals across a wide range of frequencies; and it requires each sensor to identify the direction of all incoming signals. Rapid sweeping across 3D space over a wide band enables a low-cost sensor with a single moderate-bandwidth receiver to frequently sample every channel in a wide range and to frequently sample all incident directions via a sweeping phased array antenna. The team will investigate the use of off-the-shelf components to develop a prototype low-cost SweepSpace node. They will investigate 1) reconstruction of a full spatio-temporal activity map from samples that are sparse across space, time, frequency, and incident direction; 2) enhancing the directional precision of individual sensors; 3) optimizing the placement and parameterization of the; and 4) identifying spatio-temporal holes for safe insertion of new activity. They will also investigate single-sensor questions, such as minimum detectability bounds, risk of missed detections and false positives, and optimal scheduling policies, and they will characterize the probability of missed detections by a network of sensors. The project includes development of risk mitigation tools that can be used by others to tailor SweepSpace for their use cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While many antimicrobial agents have optimal bactericidal activity at a neutral pH, the unusual acidic pH can impair the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of pharmaceutical drugs and promote bacterial resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as an alternative solution to conventional antibiotics to address the global problem of infectious diseases due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and less tendency for bacteria to develop resistance. Although AMPs are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics, their widespread use and translation into clinical application is hampered by several intrinsic limitations, including their susceptibility to proteases and moderate to severe toxicity towards host cells. It is generally believed that new design and engineering strategy is needed to overcome the intrinsic limitation of traditional AMPs for targeted antimicrobial therapy. The PI?s group recently developed a technology platform of self-assembling antimicrobial nanofibers (SAANs) to circumvent the shortcomings of both traditional antibiotics and AMPs. SAANs are supramolecular assemblies of multidomain peptides (MDPs) that can undergo programmed self-assembly into nanostructured filaments. While killing broad-spectrum antibiotic-resistant bacteria, SAANs offer key advantages over traditional single chain AMPs in terms of improved stability, precisely controlled AMP loading capacity, minimal cytotoxicity and greatly improved hemocompatibility. More recently, the PI?s group advance the fundamental design principles to develop a novel acid-activatable SAANs using pH-responsive MDPs as the molecular building block. The long-term goal is to apply SAANs as stable systemic nanocarriers for targeted AMP delivery. The research objectives of the present proposal are to expand the family of SAANs containing pH-responsive non-natural amino acids to further modulate materials stability and activity, and to develop more potent pH-dependent multicomponent SAANs with synergistic antimicrobial effect to eradicate bacteria at their preferred acidic environment without affecting healthy tissues and cells. At the University of Texas at Arlington which is a Hispanic-serving institution, the PI contributes to education of increased diversity in STEM fields, particularly encouraging research participation from underrepresented students with weakly performing academic record along with her other outreach and education efforts. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The NSF project is focused on the synthesis and self-assembly of pH-responsive peptides with non-natural amino acids that show triggered antimicrobial activity in the weakly acidic pH range.  The project is driven by our recent discovery of Acid-Activatable Self-Assembled Antimicrobial Nanofibers (AA-SAANs), which is generated through the self-assembly of pH-responsive multidomain peptides (MDPs). The MDPs are assembled into nanofibers at the physiological condition and being inactive. At the acidic infection site where the local pH decreases, AA-SAANs are triggered to dissemble and release the activated MDPs to interact with the bacterial cell membrane and kill bacteria. In this proposal we will validate and advance the fundamental design principle by using MDPs with expanded chemistry to develop more potent AA-SAANs. The research objectives of this proposal are: 1) Establish AA-SAANs using new pH-responsive MDPs containing non-natural ionic amino acids; 2) Fabrication and evaluation of multicomponent AA-SAANs with synergistic antimicrobial activity; 3) Evaluate the pH-dependent biological activity of these materials in vitro. These efforts will provide critical insight into the fundamental molecular and supramolecular chemistry that govern the structure and antimicrobial activity of AA-SAANs. Further, this strategy is highly transformative for the rational design and synthesis of functional materials with built-in pH-responsive properties to probe various complex biological processes in which pH gradient plays an important role.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, we know little about the early life stages of seafloor invertebrates - embryos, larvae, and juveniles ? which are vital for the health of marine ecosystems but are especially vulnerable to environmental stressors. This dissertation research will focus on documenting the life cycles of seafloor invertebrate animals to understand how seafloor communities are impacted by a warming climate. While current research has shown that seafloor community changes over space and depth in Arctic glacial fjords, it is currently unknown how dispersal and mortality in the early life stages of these animals shape these gradients. This research will identify when and where young organisms settle to the seafloor and characterize mortality rates throughout a glacial fjord. The research will demonstrate how environmental stressors, such as warming temperatures or the introduction of invasive species, can impact animals? life cycles and drive the gradients in their communities. <br/><br/>This study will address three critical questions in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard: (1) How do the distributions of benthic invertebrate larvae vary across temporal and spatial scales? (2) How does settlement (e.g., rate and species composition) vary across a glacially dominated fjord? (3) What are the patterns of post-settlement mortality in an Arctic hard bottom system? A newly-invented camera system will be deployed in Kongsfjorden to continuously and autonomously observe settlement and post-settlement mortality in benthic invertebrates for the first time. Larval samples will be collected using plankton nets and identified using integrative morphological and molecular taxonomy to understand dispersal patterns for both local species and those moving north from lower latitudes. Additionally, the integrative taxonomy will yield a paired photographic and genetic dataset to aid in morphological identification of larvae that will be made available to other researchers. These innovative approaches will allow for refined predictions of climate impacts in glacially influenced polar fjords. This project will also promote Arctic education by producing interactive data and materials for use by a wide range of K-12 educators and students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop's goals are to provide mentorship and direct feedback to aspiring PIs on their proposals, which can represent either their first submission attempt or a revision of a previously declined proposal. The workshop's novelties are its one-on-one meetings with mentors about their research plans, participation in mock panels that simulate the NSF's merit review process, and the development of a research executive summary. Together, these activities are designed to help aspiring PIs develop compelling and comprehensive research plans.

They defend against a variety of diseases, including cancer. Some cancers disguise themselves from T-cell recognition. Others suppress the killing response of T-cells. T cells can be modified with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). These are synthetic molecules that provide T cells with a renewed ability to sense and destroy cancer cells. CAR engineered T cells are clinically effective at fighting some blood cancers. Unfortunately, our understanding of parameters that tune how a T cell responds to a cancer cell is severely lacking. This project aims to gain a fundamental understanding of the parameters of CARs that tune T cell responses, and to characterize how these parameters affect CAR engineered T cell function and fate. This research program is integrated with an education plan that aims to support students in the community college system in the Tampa Bay area, providing mentorship and guided research experiences for students as they navigate the STEM pathway.<br/><br/>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic T cell receptors that mimic T cell receptor activation and co-stimulation. These empirically designed receptors provide a potent but unoptimized signaling response.  As a result, engineered T cells are susceptible to overactivation or suppression, two common but distinct challenges to cell therapy. The influence of important parameters such as dephosphorylation kinetics and downstream adapter preferences on CAR signaling remains essentially unstudied. Optimizing receptor function to support robust T cell activation remains a trial-and-error exercise. This project will combine protein engineering, cell biology, and omics experiments to establish a fundamental understanding of how the signaling components of CARs can be tuned to yield improved responses under activating and suppressive conditions. These experiments will provide fundamental advances through 1) surveying motif landscapes for phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and adapter binding in synthetic T cell activation; 2) quantitatively understanding how dephosphorylation kinetics influence CAR signaling; 3) mapping synthetic signaling in T cells with adapter bias.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CARDAMOM is led by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in partnership with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, and the University of Alabama. Metal additive manufacturing (AM), also known as metal 3D printing, is transforming manufacturing within the United States and around the world. This new disruptive technology has already resulted in several success stories, primarily within the aerospace and biomedical sectors. However, further expansion to the greater manufacturing community is impeded by limitations in powder feedstocks, a lack of access to flexible and comprehensive metal AM research and production facilities, and a workforce with limited AM design experience. CARDAMOM proposes to address these research needs by assisting industry members along the entire ?powder-to-part? development cycle to address fundamental research questions with a view toward final engineering applications. In addition, the team will address societal impacts of education and workforce development which will have a significant impact on the training of students from diverse backgrounds and educational institutions. Eventually, CARDAMOM aims to be a steady provider of high-quality engineers and technicians to manufacturers and government research laboratories. <br/><br/>The mission of CARDAMOM is to transform the manufacturing of high-performance, quality metallic components created with AM via active engagement with Center industry members. With respect to the technological impacts, CARDAMOM will pursue multiple thrusts in order to: develop methods for production of AM feedstocks for new alloys; develop new methods and techniques to understand and interpret in situ measurement data; use advanced characterization to provide 3D microstructural and nanostructural information that connects processing methods to component performance; develop new computational methods to predict and understand microstructural development, leading to better ways to design new materials and processes; develop innovative measurements to quantify laser-metal interactions; use advanced metrology and NDE to enhance AM build quality; develop new data analytical (machine learning) approaches for data interpretation and scientific insight. CARDAMOM will engage potential members across the full supply chain, including equipment manufacturers, aerospace and defense companies, tool and die producers, materials development companies, process optimization designers, and government laboratories. The University of Alabama will specifically emphasize, custom metallic alloy powder production, solid state additive manufacturing process development, and advancement and application of ICME tools for AM materials and process development. The Alabama Atomization Facility has an inert gas atomization capability, which is routinely used to produce AM-appropriate metallic alloy powders. The faculty at UA have a number of active programs involving cold spray, laser assisted cold spray, and additive friction stir deposition for AM.

They are, however, not useful in binding to and blocking the action of proteases. This is important because protease activity can trigger the development of cancers. Key proteases involved in cancer development, called matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), are overproduced during the development of cancer and during diabetes, for example. The objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of modifying antibodies with unique amino acids on the regulation of MMP activity. The education component of this proposal seeks to enhance the Tufts STEM Ambassadors program and strengthen a partnership with the biotechnology program of an area vocational/technical high school.<br/><br/>Extracellular proteases and peptidases play key roles in human health and disease. The specific disruption of these enzymes remains a fundamental challenge. For example, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play key roles in development, inflammation, cancer, and infectious disease. Highly specific inhibitors are essential for uncovering the molecular functions of enzymes and for establishing a new generation of inhibitors with improved therapeutic potential. The overall goal is to establish principles of ?chemically diversified? antibodies that enable next-generation protease inhibitor discovery. This project will evaluate integration of noncanonical amino acids and yeast display technology to exploit covalent (irreversible) binding and metal binding functionalities within antibodies. The investigators hope to discover chemistries capable of interfering with enzyme functions. These studies could also identify use cases where adding chemistries to antibodies leads to inhibitors with properties (such as potency, duration of action, or specific epitope targeting) that cannot be engineered into conventional antibodies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional Na-S and K-S batteries are attractive for LDES due to their low cost and the use of earth-abundant elements. However, their deployment is severely hindered by their high operational temperature of 300-350oC and associated degradation and safety issues. This project will use materials design and simulation-driven approaches to develop innovative electrolytes to dissolve insoluble reaction products in Na-S and K-S batteries and advance knowledge on underlying dissolution mechanisms. Such novel electrolytes will enhance reaction kinetics so the operation temperature can be reduced to 60-120oC, which not only enhances thermal stability but also decreases operational costs. The new material systems from this project have the potential to be deployed for LDES, which enhances the economic competitiveness and sustainability of U.S. The project activities will integrate research and education, targeting students from K-12 to graduate school and promoting underrepresented communities' education through hands-on experiences, advising, and research integration across all levels. <br/><br/>The primary challenge in traditional alkaline metal sulfur (AMS) batteries arises from the formation of solid M2S2 and M2S compounds during discharge (M = Na, K), which exhibit poor electrochemical kinetics. This limits the reversible redox range mainly to S/M2S3 reactions, reducing specific capacity and energy density. The goal of this project is to identify and develop new solvents that can dissolve M2S2/M2S readily to replace conventional ether electrolytes, which will in turn make M2S2/M2S electrochemically active. This will double the specific capacity of sulfur from 500 mAh/g in ether electrolytes to 1000-1500 mAh/g, along with a long cycle life. The project will utilize a simulation-driven approach to design electrolytes, such as combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML). MD simulations calculate solvation free energy, and ML enables high-throughput screening for solvents with superior M2S2 and M2S solubilities. Promising candidates will be experimentally validated. After experimentally confirming the high-performance solvents, multi-scale/multi-modal characterizations will be used to understand the fundamental dissolution mechanisms, electrochemistry and transport in the proposed system comprehensively. An Ah-level prototype will be constructed and tested, and the cost of developed materials and devices will be analyzed for large-scale deployment. The advances in knowledge and research tools together will help develop next-generation batteries for long-duration energy storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its five-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 200 unique students: pre-transfer A.A. life sciences students at MDC; post-transfer B.S. Microbiology and Cell Science (MCS) majors at UF; or students who are seeking an M.S. in MCS at UF. Although the individual timelines may vary, students who enroll full-time will usually receive scholarships of up to 2 years at each level (i.e., while pursuing associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees). Miami Dade College enrolls a large diverse population of undergraduates, and transfer students are more likely to be from groups historically underrepresented in STEM, including women, veterans, and first-generation college students. Consequently, this project has the potential to significantly broaden participation in the STEM enterprise and to identify key factors that affect retention and success of low-income transfer students. This project will also increase access by offering online options for scholars pursuing B.S. and M.S. degrees through MCS. Online education further extends opportunities to nontraditional students including adult learners, student parents, and individuals from underserved areas. By leveraging a statewide network of research facilities and existing online course-based undergraduate research experiences, both in-person and online scholars will be able to participate in faculty-mentored undergraduate research. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. This project is informed by the lessons learned from a prior S-STEM project at MDC and UF that has awarded over 400 scholarships to students pursuing associate and bachelor's degrees. Project research will use focus groups, student surveys, institutional data, and existing S-STEM data from 2018 to investigate how changes to the FAFSA in 2024 impact eligibility and awards amounts for scholarship recipients. The research plan will also explore the longer-term impacts of scholarships on transfer, graduation, and persistence in STEM and identify barriers and successful interventions in the A.A. to B.S. transfer process. The project will be assessed by a qualified independent evaluator to ensure progress toward project goals and identify elements of the project that most effectively drive student success. Results of this project will be made available through presentations at STEM education conferences, informational webinars, and publications in peer-reviewed journals. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

Climate change is increasing hydrological variability and water stress in many regions, leading water planners to invest in expensive new water supply infrastructure. However, many low-income households currently struggle to pay their water bills. Therefore, costly investments in water supply infrastructure may counterintuitively harm water security by making water unaffordable for a larger number of people. This NSF grant addresses this problem by, first, developing a new approach to assess the impact of climate change on water affordability that considers the environmental, social, and infrastructure factors that combine to determine water affordability. Second, it designs infrastructure and policy solutions to enable water supply systems to be both reliable in a changing climate and affordable for low-income populations. Through partnership with external stakeholders, this research will develop knowledge that local water planners and policymakers can use to improve the effectiveness of water affordability programs. <br/><br/>This project will develop an approach to comprehensively assess the impact of climate change on household water affordability and design solutions. To achieve this, the project will advance theory for operationalizing distributional equity in systems models and methods for multi-scale urban water systems modeling. First, the project will advance understanding of the drivers of household water affordability through a novel systems-modeling framework that integrates environmental, human, and infrastructure dynamics across state, city, and household scales. Second, the research team will project climate change impacts on water supply and demand, using an approach that targets projections to the scales relevant for water system outcomes. Third, the project will leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning to design infrastructure and policy solutions to meet water affordability and reliability targets. To ensure the findings translate to practice, the research team will partner with two cities and develop an external advisory board. Additionally, the project will advance education on water equity and affordability for students, water managers, and local communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the chemical forms of copper in seawater is therefore important to understanding its effect in ocean ecosystems. Results from the principal investigator?s previous research investigating copper in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans indicated that most dissolved copper (Cu) in the ocean is inert and likely does not undergo chemical exchange with other compounds in seawater.  It appears that Cu is only released from the inert form in surface waters, where it is decomposed by light-mediated reactions. In this project, the team will determine the rates and processes of exchange between inert and labile forms of copper in seawater in samples from the Pacific Ocean and Columbia River. The project also aims to understand how dissolved organic matter in seawater will react with copper over the timescales of ocean circulation. The project includes summer research opportunities for high school students in the South Central Los Angeles Area through a program known as USC Young Researchers Program that provides students with a mentor throughout the summer. Research opportunities will be provided to undergraduate students to work on laboratory-based exchange kinetics work. <br/><br/>This research project challenges the current paradigm that copper speciation and distribution in seawater is dominated by strong, labile organic complexes that can be characterized by thermodynamic equilibria. The objectives of this project include: 1) determining rates of exchange of Cu between inert and labile pools, 2) characterizing the stable isotope composition of labile and inert Cu from samples collected from the Pacific Ocean and Columbia River, and 3) understanding the relationship between inert Cu and dissolved organic matter. The team will work to reassess the understanding of the chemistry of copper in seawater and determine the processes and mechanisms that control its cycling and biological availability. The work will expand the methodology utilized previously to isolation of inert Cu on reverse phase columns coupled with chromatographic separation. The results will provide a basis for more detailed structural characterization and provide a basis for including speciation-based natural isotope abundance data into models of Cu biogeochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop's goals are to provide mentorship and direct feedback to aspiring PIs on their proposals, which can represent either their first submission attempt or a revision of a previously declined proposal. The workshop's novelties are its one-on-one meetings with mentors about their research plans, participation in mock panels that simulate the NSF's merit review process, and the development of a research executive summary. Together, these activities are designed to help aspiring PIs develop compelling and comprehensive research plans. The workshop's broader significance and importance are the impact these activities will have on better equipping aspiring PIs from a range of institutions and backgrounds to write competitive SaTC proposals, better reflecting the breadth of the nation's researchers and their ideas.<br/><br/>Writing a successful funding proposal often requires substantial implicit knowledge about community expectations and norms. Experienced PIs (i.e., those who have previously been funded) and their colleagues draw on past experiences having proposals reviewed, as well as ""folk knowledge"" from discussions with their peers. Aspiring PIs who lack this experience typically experience lower levels of success in the competitive funding process even though their intellectual ideas might match or exceed those of experienced PIs. Notably, experienced PIs are more likely to work at large universities that already receive generous NSF support, be part of existing professional networks, and come from the same academic lineages. The aspiring PI workshop aims to ensure that aspiring PIs' ideas about improving the nation's security and privacy are on a more level playing field with experienced PIs' ideas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tardigrades can survive many environmental extremes, including desiccation, high and low temperatures, radiation, osmotic shock, and pressure. Although the survival mechanisms of tardigrades are poorly understood, evidence points towards accumulation of bioprotectant proteins as a key element to their survival. This research project looks at the structure of several bioprotectant proteins identified in tardigrades and how they protect other proteins when the environment becomes unsuitable for life. Carefully controlled experiments conducted in test tubes and in cultured cells will assist with the interpretation of measurements made directly in living tardigrades. Dr. Davis will advance the state of climate change education in Connecticut and nurture the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and teachers through a scaffold of education initiatives supported by Yale?s Pathways to Science program. This work will target communities that are underprivileged and most vulnerable to climate impacts. In addition, this proposal will support the training of high school, undergraduate, postgraduate, and graduate researchers on state-of-the-art instrumentation, producing climate scientists prepared to help the nation obtain new knowledge that can lead to a more sustainable planet. <br/><br/>The research under this award aims to develop a detailed physiochemical understanding of the structure and function of tardigrade disordered proteins.  These families of proteins and other intrinsically disordered proteins assist organisms with rapidly adapting to environmental extremes and the goal of this work is to unravel the mechanisms that allow for this. The broad hypothesis is that tardigrade disordered proteins protect other proteins, i.e. prevent aggregation and unfolding, through distinct mechanisms that enable tardigrades to survive extreme stress. In situ infrared and fluorescence imaging techniques are being developed to accomplish two separate but related projects. Optical photothermal infrared imaging will reveal differences in the secondary structure of tardigrade disordered proteins under basal and stress conditions. To determine whether the same structures form in situ, measurements will be made in vitro, in cell, and in living tardigrades. Complementary fast relaxation imaging measurements will examine how tardigrade disordered proteins change the structure and stability of other proteins in vitro and in living tardigrades. Taken together, this proposal will provide insight into the fundamental processes that tardigrades employ to resist climate change and related environmental impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research project ?CREST-PRP: Investigation and Design of Molecular Spintronic Photovoltaic Devices Via Raman Spectroscopy? is in direct alignment with the CREST-PRP goals. Submitted by a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the CREST Center for Nanotechnology Research and Education (CNRE) housed at the University of the District of Columbia, the project will focus on the development of a new type of solar cell that is superior to typical silicon-based solar cells in terms of efficiency, cost, and sustainability. Building on the foundational work in this emerging solar cell science already occurring at the CNRE, this project will take advantage of the spin property of electrons to generate spin-based solar cells developed from inexpensive, Earth-abundant materials like iron and nickel, making them cheaper and recyclable. The proposed research will advance solar cell science by providing insights into the fabrication of a large area solar cell capable of generating a substantial photocurrent. The optical activity under investigation in this project holds potential to promote other innovations in light harvesting materials, optical sensors, and novel metamaterials. Further, this project will provide training and mentorship to a postdoctoral researcher, enhancing the scholar?s skills as a researcher and principal investigator.

This study will include a variety of paramagnetic molecular bridges, ferromagnetic electrode compositions, and insulator thicknesses. Raman studies also indicate that the MTJMSDs ferromagnetic electrodes respond to visible light radiation; this factor will allow the use of Raman spectroscopy to investigate the spatial range of the photovoltaic effect on the MTJMSD cross-junction area. Findings will be used to fabricate a large area (1 cm2) solar cell based on the optimal molecule/electrode/spatial orientation observed in the studied MTJMSDs.

CARDAMOM is led by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in partnership with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, and the University of Alabama. Metal additive manufacturing (AM), also known as metal 3D printing, is transforming manufacturing within the United States and around the world. This new disruptive technology has already resulted in several success stories, primarily within the aerospace and biomedical sectors. However, further expansion to the greater manufacturing community is impeded by limitations in powder feedstocks, a lack of access to flexible and comprehensive metal AM research and production facilities, and a workforce with limited AM design experience. CARDAMOM proposes to address these research needs by assisting industry members along the entire ?powder-to-part? development cycle to address fundamental research questions with a view toward final engineering applications. In addition, the team will address societal impacts of education and workforce development which will have a significant impact on the training of students from diverse backgrounds and educational institutions. Eventually, CARDAMOM aims to be a steady provider of high-quality engineers and technicians to manufacturers and government research laboratories. <br/><br/>The mission of CARDAMOM is to transform the manufacturing of high-performance, quality metallic components created with AM via active engagement with Center industry members. With respect to the technological impacts, CARDAMOM will pursue multiple thrusts in order to: develop methods for production of AM feedstocks for new alloys; develop new methods and techniques to understand and interpret in situ measurement data; use advanced characterization to provide 3D microstructural and nanostructural information that connects processing methods to component performance; develop new computational methods to predict and understand microstructural development, leading to better ways to design new materials and processes; develop innovative measurements to quantify laser-metal interactions; use advanced metrology and NDE to enhance AM build quality; develop new data analytical (machine learning) approaches for data interpretation and scientific insight. CARDAMOM will engage potential members across the full supply chain, including equipment manufacturers, aerospace and defense companies, tool and die producers, materials development companies, process optimization designers, and government laboratories. At UTRGV, the team will leverage equipment and resources at the Center for Advanced Manufacturing which hosts metal AM equipment and custom-built open-platform AM processes including: laser-assisted cold spray, open-platform powder bed fusion equipment, 8 kW open-platform laser DED, robotic friction stir weld, and robotic wire arc. UTRGV thrusts include: 1) high deposition rate convergent laser DED processes, 2) additive manufacturing of refractory metal alloys for high-temperature applications, 3) in-situ induction heat treatment for laser additive manufacturing of high-entropy alloys, 4) recipe development for LPBF and laser DED to fabricate metal boride for energy, tool and die industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New principal investigators, whom we term aspiring PIs, often find writing their first successful SaTC funding proposal intimidating and difficult. This project funds a 1.5 day workshop to support these aspiring PIs in preparing competitive SaTC funding proposals. The workshop's goals are to provide mentorship and direct feedback to aspiring PIs on their proposals, which can represent either their first submission attempt or a revision of a previously declined proposal. The workshop's novelties are its one-on-one meetings with mentors about their research plans, participation in mock panels that simulate the NSF's merit review process, and the development of a research executive summary. Together, these activities are designed to help aspiring PIs develop compelling and comprehensive research plans. The workshop's broader significance and importance are the impact these activities will have on better equipping aspiring PIs from a range of institutions and backgrounds to write competitive SaTC proposals, better reflecting the breadth of the nation's researchers and their ideas.<br/><br/>Writing a successful funding proposal often requires substantial implicit knowledge about community expectations and norms. Experienced PIs (i.e., those who have previously been funded) and their colleagues draw on past experiences having proposals reviewed, as well as ""folk knowledge"" from discussions with their peers. Aspiring PIs who lack this experience typically experience lower levels of success in the competitive funding process even though their intellectual ideas might match or exceed those of experienced PIs. Notably, experienced PIs are more likely to work at large universities that already receive generous NSF support, be part of existing professional networks, and come from the same academic lineages. The aspiring PI workshop aims to ensure that aspiring PIs' ideas about improving the nation's security and privacy are on a more level playing field with experienced PIs' ideas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first part focuses on the foundations of machine learning/data science, which guarantees the theoretical convergence of numerical algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, Markov Chain Monte Carlo) in non-convex optimization and multi-modal distribution sampling. This project will develop algorithms to solve such problems in big data and engineering, which include uncertainty quantification in AI safety problems, control robotics motions, and image processing. The second part focuses on the stochastic models in mathematical finance and algorithm designs in option/asset pricing. The applications in this part target efficient algorithms for path-dependent option pricing with rough volatilities, which are expected to significantly impact some computation-oriented financial instruments, such as model-based algorithm trading involving rough volatility and high-frequency data.

In the first part, the PI will study the ""hypocoercivity"" (i.e., convergence to equilibrium) for highly degenerate and mean-field stochastic dynamical systems and their applications to algorithms design in machine learning. One of the proposed topics will focus on the (non)-asymptotic analysis of the general degenerate/mean-field system and its exponential convergence rate to the equilibrium (e.g., Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations; Langevin dynamics on higher order nilpotent Lie groups). As applications of the convergence of such dynamics, the PI will design algorithms focusing on non-convex optimizations and distribution samplings in machine learning. In the second part, the PI will study non-Markovian stochastic dynamical systems capturing path-dependent and mean-field features of the financial market. The topics include path-dependent PDEs, stochastic Volterra integral equations, conditional mean-field SDEs, and the Volterra signatures. The PI focuses on addressing the fundamental issues, including the density for the rough volatility model and conditional mean-field SDEs and the structure of Volterra signatures.

Seismometers at the Earth's surface record seismic waves from local and distant earthquakes, and these recordings can be used to derive three-dimensional images of the Earth's interior, from its innermost solid iron core to the surface. Creating these seismic images requires recordings from real earthquakes and from simulated earthquakes that calculate how waves propagate through realistic three-dimensional models of Earth's structure. By comparing real recordings with simulated recordings, it is possible to improve the models of Earth's structure. In this project, these simulations of seismic waves will be used to investigate previously established models of the subsurface structure of Alaska, as well as to develop new models based on recently recorded earthquakes. The results will enable a better understanding of the relationship between earthquakes and faulting in Alaska, while providing a more accurate method for determining the places where certain ground motion is expected to be relatively strong due to the presence of sedimentary layers at the Earth's surface. The project will establish general procedures for other scientists to interrogate Earth structure models made by other methods and data sets. The project promotes free and open software development and training opportunities, and it advances two topics relevant to society?computational science and elasticity?with potential benefits to seismic hazard assessments, oil and gas seismic imaging, materials science, and structural engineering.<br/><br/>Seismic images of Earth's interior structure, also known as tomographic models, are commonly produced by approximate methods, and they are typically qualitatively compared to one another. These images and comparisons raise fundamental questions regarding the accuracy of the images as well as how to interpret them in the context of the compositional and thermal structure and dynamics of the Earth. This project addresses three facets of this problem. First, it will use seismic wavefield simulations to generate the simulated seismograms needed for comparison with the recorded seismograms. This will enable the most accurate physics to be deployed within the imaging problem. Second, it will apply wavefield simulations to a reference data set to directly and fairly compare previously derived tomographic models. Third, it will formalize these procedures and offer them to others by hosting a virtual workshop featuring how to access tomographic models from the Earth Model Collaboration and how to perform seismic wavefield simulations in the open-source software package Specfem3D. The focus of these efforts in on Alaska, which has had exceptional coverage of EarthScope seismic stations since 2017 and exhibits extreme subsurface tectonic complexity caused by collision at the eastern margin of the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone. The availability of earthquakes, the quality of station coverage, the complexity of subsurface structure, and the complexity of subsurface geodynamics all provide motivation for using Alaska as a focus for the broader effort of validating and improving tomographic models. The efforts will consider a more complex representation of Earth structure, in the form of tilted transverse isotropy, which is present in minerals and rocks (for example, shale) but which is challenging to determine at larger scales, such as the crust and uppermost mantle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional Na-S and K-S batteries are attractive for LDES due to their low cost and the use of earth-abundant elements. However, their deployment is severely hindered by their high operational temperature of 300-350oC and associated degradation and safety issues. This project will use materials design and simulation-driven approaches to develop innovative electrolytes to dissolve insoluble reaction products in Na-S and K-S batteries and advance knowledge on underlying dissolution mechanisms. Such novel electrolytes will enhance reaction kinetics so the operation temperature can be reduced to 60-120oC, which not only enhances thermal stability but also decreases operational costs. The new material systems from this project have the potential to be deployed for LDES, which enhances the economic competitiveness and sustainability of U.S. The project activities will integrate research and education, targeting students from K-12 to graduate school and promoting underrepresented communities' education through hands-on experiences, advising, and research integration across all levels. <br/><br/>The primary challenge in traditional alkaline metal sulfur (AMS) batteries arises from the formation of solid M2S2 and M2S compounds during discharge (M = Na, K), which exhibit poor electrochemical kinetics. This limits the reversible redox range mainly to S/M2S3 reactions, reducing specific capacity and energy density. The goal of this project is to identify and develop new solvents that can dissolve M2S2/M2S readily to replace conventional ether electrolytes, which will in turn make M2S2/M2S electrochemically active. This will double the specific capacity of sulfur from 500 mAh/g in ether electrolytes to 1000-1500 mAh/g, along with a long cycle life. The project will utilize a simulation-driven approach to design electrolytes, such as combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML). MD simulations calculate solvation free energy, and ML enables high-throughput screening for solvents with superior M2S2 and M2S solubilities. Promising candidates will be experimentally validated. After experimentally confirming the high-performance solvents, multi-scale/multi-modal characterizations will be used to understand the fundamental dissolution mechanisms, electrochemistry and transport in the proposed system comprehensively. An Ah-level prototype will be constructed and tested, and the cost of developed materials and devices will be analyzed for large-scale deployment. The advances in knowledge and research tools together will help develop next-generation batteries for long-duration energy storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this nutrient source is only biologically accessible to a subset of microbes that can reduce it into ammonium NH4+. The biological capacity to fix N2 is a critical step in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and essential to life on Earth. The enzyme responsible for this reaction is nitrogenase and its activity relies on its associated metallocofactors. This project aims to elucidate initial reaction steps involving the synthesis of nitrogenase metallocofactors that are promoted by proteins NifU and NifS. Previous studies have established the involvement of these proteins in supporting the synthesis of initial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) building blocks for nitrogenase metallocofactors. The research supported by this award will explore how NifU and NifS assemble these Fe-S units in the model bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. The interdisciplinary, collaborative international project will engage undergraduate and graduate students through research experiences and professional development opportunities. A German and an American PI partnership will support two synergistic research and professional development efforts: (a) collaborative research experiences abroad for graduate students and (b) mentored research fellowships for local undergraduate students. These efforts are relevant for preparing the next generation of STEM leaders for a diverse and globalized workforce. <br/><br/>The project is aimed at investigating the mechanistic and chemical steps of Fe-S cluster synthesis in the context of a native environment and the presence of physiological reductants by establishing 1) the location and spectroscopic features of novel cluster species associated with NifU, 2) the involvement additional factors in this process, and 3) the reactivity of newly identified cluster species as building blocks for the synthesis of nitrogenase metalloclusters. Uncovering molecular and mechanistic details that enable nitrogen fixation has intrinsic intellectual merit in understanding their sustained and conserved requirement throughout evolution.

No single funding assistance program can address the myriad needs at scale. Navigating duplicative home assessments confuses households, frustrates provider organizations, and misses decarbonization opportunities. Decarbonization of energy systems has rapidly emerged as a central goal to address climate change. Many cities and states have set high carbon reduction goals as part of their climate policies and corresponding initiatives. While Detroit?s housing crisis created its sense of urgency, numerous cities around the country are grappling with the desire to braid financial resources and coordinate services to support housing stability and accelerate net-zero goals. In response to these needs and opportunities, a team of academic and community-based researchers and civic partners have come together to co-design and pilot a decarbonization-readiness module for integration with a common, comprehensive home assessment protocol emerging in Detroit, MI. This resource will be field-tested, and retrofits will be completed for a study cohort of low-income homes. Qualitative social science data will be collected with providers, clients, and stakeholders to complement quantitative energy use and air quality data. Simplified digital home models will be used to simulate supportive rate structures, demand response programs, grid-interactive appliance programs, and associated controls. <br/><br/>The intent of this effort is three-fold.

The Arctic landscape, particularly permafrost (frozen ground), stores a massive amount of carbon ? nearly twice as much as the atmosphere. As air temperatures in the Arctic increase, the permafrost thaws and carbon-rich organic matter can be released. Once released, this carbon can be transformed into carbon dioxide and methane ? greenhouse gases. The carbon released from permafrost may also be transported to the ocean where it can be buried for many years, keeping it out of the atmosphere. The primary goals of this research are to find hotspots of permafrost thaw in the Arctic landscape and to understand what happens to carbon after it is released from the permafrost. This project supports one postdoctoral scholar and provides funding to analyze samples collected from a river in Arctic Alaska. This work will result in a mathematical model that simulates the flow of carbon across the Arctic landscape. The PI will also create an educational tool to teach students about carbon-climate feedbacks.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a mechanistic understanding of the feedbacks between physical erosion, oxidative weathering, and organic carbon (OC) transformation in Arctic landscapes. This project uses a ?source-to-sink? approach to study the physical and chemical effects of permafrost thaw at the landscape-scale and assess the transformation of OC upon mobilization and downstream transport. Focusing on the Canning River in northern Alaska, the PI will compare modern river OC fluxes with long-term catchment-average OC export derived from cosmogenic radionuclide geochemistry. To determine whether permafrost-derived OC is oxidized to CO2 during transport across the Arctic landscape, this project applies novel geochemical methods, including ramped pyrolysis oxidation-14C and dissolved rhenium analyses. The results will constrain decomposition rates of OC mobilized from thawing permafrost, which are largely unknown but needed to predict future CO2 emissions from the Arctic. Using data generated from this project, the PI will construct a model of coupled erosion, weathering, and carbon cycling in Arctic river catchments. Further application of this coupled model will reveal the feedbacks among climate, erosion, sediment routing, and OC cycling that will advance our understanding of Arctic landscape response to future climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical approach of representing data as blocks of information bits falls short of addressing diverse requirements, including scalability, efficiency, and reliability, of the next generation storage, computation, and communication systems. This project develops an alternative paradigm for transmission of data across massively connected wireless networks by proposing methods to embed the information into mathematical constructs called subspaces (i.e., linear-algebraic objects in a vector space), via a technique called subspace coding. While these structures capture the essence of gathered data in a wide range of signal processing applications, fundamental limits of compression as well as practical and universal techniques to attain these limits are not understood. This project characterizes a natural duality between error correction and compression in the subspace domain and proposes to leverage this connection in order to develop explicit and efficient compression mechanisms for massive data sets that exhibit certain properties. This interdisciplinary project is tied with an education plan and provides a stimulating and innovative research environment for students at all levels. Furthermore, workshops are developed as part of an active outreach program in order to introduce high school students to concepts in fields related to data science and communications, exposing them to careers essential to tomorrow?s workforce.<br/><br/>Wireless networks are rapidly growing in size, are becoming more hierarchical, and are becoming increasingly distributed. Conventional methods including channel estimation of point-to-point links and block coding do not properly scale with the size of such massive networks. This project proposes that subspace coding in the analog domain becomes relevant for conveying information across networks in such a scenario. Furthermore, the dual problem in the compression domain is central to a wide range of applications involving large-scale raw data, often exhibiting low-dimensional structures, which require techniques for low-dimensional subspace recovery and dimensionality reduction. The specific objectives of this project are summarized as follows: (1) Provide a comprehensive framework, including a certain metric space and an analog operator channel, to study coding for wireless networks in a non-coherent fashion; (2) Construct subspace codes for analog operator channels and characterize their performance; (3) Develop techniques for low-rank subspace recovery given constrained observations; (4) Characterize fundamental limits on compression of low-rank matrices and leverage the duality with subspace codes to design explicit compression mechanisms; (5) Develop schemes for subspace-coded distributed computation to efficiently compute the outcome of algorithms operating over matrices and subspaces while minimizing the delay.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic devices, directly convert sunlight into electricity. Dramatic efficiency improvements and cost reductions have led to widespread adoption of solar power. There are still problems that limit further adoption. These include incorporation of expensive or toxic raw materials as well as the need for energy intensive, high temperature production processes. This project will investigate an emerging solar technology based on low dimensional chalcogenides as light absorbers. These materials are earth abundant, non-toxic and stable upon exposure to sunlight under ambient conditions. They can also be processed at relatively low temperatures with fewer raw materials consumption and less carbon footprint, making this emerging solar technology potentially cost-competitive and sustainable. This project aims to significantly improve the efficiency of solar cells based on low-dimensional chalcognides through advanced device engineering. The aim is to pave the way to commercialize this newly developed solar technology to provide more affordable solar electricity. This project will impact the community through a long-term partnership with local elementary schools. The PI will reach out to young students to introduce and foster clean energy concepts and solar technologies. The PI will also participate in an on-campus material summer camp for the local secondary school teachers, giving introduction lectures and providing hands-on demonstrations of solar technologies. Teachers can then implement these lessons in their home schools to attract more students, especially those from minority and underrepresented groups, to pursue science and engineering careers.

Polycrystalline low dimensional chalcogenide absorbers possess anisotropic atomic chains and intrinsically benign grain boundaries, which provide unique anisotropic carrier transport behaviors and great grain boundary defect tolerance. Considerable fundamental material and device challenges will be addressed in this project to achieve high-performance low dimensional chalcogenides based PV devices. The following four tasks with a combination of device-level characterization will be carried out: (1) understand the anisotropic growth mechanisms of the low dimensional chalcogenide absorbers layer, and how they impact the carrier transport in the atomic chains and device performance; (2) tailor bandgap of low dimensional chalcogenide absorbers by the alloying approach to maximize the photovoltage with optimized bandgap and minimize the photocurrent loss; (3) engineer defects and interfaces in the low dimensional chalcogenides based PV devices to reduce the carrier recombination sites and increase carrier extraction with a guide of theoretical prediction using first-principle density functional theory calculation; (4) conduct extrinsic doping engineering to increase the photogenerated carrier density and carrier lifetime of the low dimensional chalcogenides based PV devices. Fundamentally, this project will elucidate the relationship between absorbers material microstructure, photogenerated carrier transport properties, and device performance in low dimensional chalcogenide-based PV devices.

This project will explore one genetic mechanism that could help explain those differences: the variation in the timing of DNA replication. This project will measure the progression of DNA replication across the chromosomes of many humans, chimpanzees, and other great apes.  Subsequently, the project will identify differences, reconstruct their evolutionary trajectory, and link DNA replication variation to mutation rates, gene expression and possibly, the evolution of new traits. As part of the societal impact of the project, results will be disseminated to current and prospective veteran undergraduate students, a group which is under-represented in leading universities. Veterans have a high interest in STEM fields but often do not have the same opportunities to engage in biological research.

The Northern Hemisphere was largely ice-free 4 myr ago followed by an acceleration of global temperature decline at ~3.6 myr ago, with continental ice sheets developing on northern hemisphere continents by ~2.7 myr ago. Limited atmospheric CO2 records suggest a decline in CO2 from ~400 to ~300 parts per million by volume (ppmv) during that time period could have cooled the Earth sufficiently to enable ice sheets to grow. Yet the cause for this decline in CO2 remains unknown. This international research and educational collaboration between 7 U.S. and 3 Chinese institutions will evaluate a new hypothesis: atmospheric dust derived from Central Asian deserts fertilized the North Pacific ocean, stimulating algal productivity, which in turn drew down atmospheric CO2 leading to Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG). Through field work studies in China, laboratory analyses of ocean and terrestrial sedimentary deposits, and atmospheric and ocean modeling studies, the investigators and students will generate and compare a wide range of paleoclimate records from diverse geological archives to evaluate the role of atmospheric dust in CO2 decline and global cooling at the onset of NHG.  The findings from this research project may ultimately contribute to knowledge with global policy implications.<br/><br/>By evaluating the significance of atmospheric dust in sustaining cool climate conditions on Earth, this study is expected to elucidate the mechanisms of climate cooling in the recent geologic past. Specifically this study will establish records of: 1) the aridification history of Central Asia, northern Tibet, and the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) as related to records of deformation and surface uplift in high Asia within and to the west of these regions, 2) wind erosion of Central Asia basins and dust accumulation in the CLP, 3) dust flux, algal productivity, and sea surface temperature in the North Pacific and South Atlantic, and 4) terrestrial CO2 in the interval of 4.5-2.5 Ma. Modeling and sensitivity studies will (1) evaluate the sensitivity of Asian climate and the dust cycle to the growth of topography and to the background global climate; (2) determine the amount of cooling that could result from Pliocene dust transport to the North Pacific; (3) evaluate the potential influence of Asian dust on atmospheric CO2. Through this research program, US graduate students will gain access to research facilities as well as field localities in China that would otherwise be inaccessible and engage in mutually beneficial collaborative research activities with Chinese partners via bilateral visits; US undergraduate students will also have the opportunity to participate in summer schools, workshops, and research projects; the investigators will develop outreach tools for museums to increase public understanding of the role of atmospheric dust in climate change."

As a very aggressive pathogen, P. palmivora is often capable of infecting almost all plant parts of a host, rendering its control extremely challenging. As a result, it has become an increasing threat to agricultural production and ecosystems. Diseases caused by P. palmivora are managed by frequent application of fungicides with limited success.

This project is expected to generate significant foundational knowledge essential for developing desirable disease control measures, thereby significantly contributing to food security, sustainability of natural ecosystems and the bioeconomy. In addition, the project will contribute to STEM workforce sustainability by providing training opportunities to graduate, undergraduate and high school students, and introducing plant pathology and gene-editing technology to middle/high-school teachers to attract a new generation into agriculture and life sciences. <br/><br/>Oomycetes form a distinct phylogenetic lineage of eukaryotes, with many causing devastating diseases of plants and animals. Phytophthora palmivora is a destructive broad-host-range oomycete plant pathogen with host specificity. P. palmivora delivers a diverse array of effectors to manipulate the host cellular processes to facilitate infection, including the superfamily of RxLR effectors that are defined by an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a canonical RxLR (or RxLR-EER) translocation motif that mediates entry into host cells. The P. palmivora RxLR effector designated PpalRxLR1 contains a functional nuclear localization signal with potential DNA-binding activities and was identified as a key pathogenicity factor on cacao. It is present in all examined P. palmivora isolates obtained from cacao infections, but exhibits presence/absence polymorphisms across the species, suggesting that it may be a determinant of host range and specificity. This project is to: 1) determine the mechanisms by which PpalRxLR1 confers pathogenicity on cacao by determining its nuclear-localized molecular interaction dynamics and the subverted host cellular processes during infection, 2) determine the role of PpalRxLR1 as a key component in host range evolution of P. palmivora by analyzing its evolution relative to the species and association with host range, 3) identify additional effectors with key roles in pathogenicity of P. palmivora on specific or a broad range of hosts using the natural variation of P. palmivora isolates. Integrating across specific aims is expected to transform understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity and host range evolution of P. palmivora, key aspects of plant-microbe interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particle crushing occurs in railway ballast, granular fault gouge, high tailing dams, and is also relevant to pile installation and offshore foundation design. Crushing and grinding are essential in mining operations, as well as manufacturing processes in the pharmaceutical, agricultural and food sectors. However, these operations are still highly energy-inefficient. Through this research, the PIs will gain a fundamental understanding of the effect of mineral heterogeneity on particle breakage. Findings will contribute to optimizing particulate material handling in mining operations, deep foundation design and pharmaceutical and agricultural manufacturing techniques. Modeling the evolution of polymineralic aggregate microstructure and mechanical behavior will also serve the deployment of penetrometer devices for in-situ soil characterization and wheeled vehicles for terrestrial and extraterrestrial exploration. Besides their research tasks, the PIs will create multi-semester undergraduate research opportunities and international research experiences for students, and integrate diversity, equity and inclusion training into their scholarly activities in partnership with Georgia Tech organizations. Both PIs are committed to enhance public awareness on the critical role of geotechnical engineering in addressing energy and sustainability challenges.<br/><br/><br/>Most natural geomaterials are polymineralic, and yet, there is no known experimental method that can disentangle the effects of morphology and mineralogy on aggregate crushing. The goal of the project is to unveil the yet-unknown mechanisms of dry polymineralic grain crushing and to enable energy-efficient industrial applications by optimizing dry aggregate breakage. Towards this goal, the PIs will (1) Measure intra- and inter-mineral bonding properties in quartzitic and granitic aggregates; (2) Conduct single-particle crushing tests on monomineralic and polymineralic aggregates; (3) Model fragmentation processes during these tests with the Distinct Element Method (DEM); (4) Image aggregate assemblies during monotonic and cyclic loading by high-resolution X-ray computed tomography; (5) Simulate sequential breakage and fabric evolution in heterogeneous aggregate assemblies with the DEM; (6) Predict self-organization and ultimate fabric by Machine Learning. Several fundamental questions will be addressed, mainly: Can heterogeneous granular assemblies self-organize upon cyclic loading and particle breakage? Do fragments evolve towards an asymptotic size and/or shape upon sequential breakage? The synergistic deployment of experimental, numerical, and artificial intelligence methods proposed in this project has the potential to transform the current practice of geomaterial characterization and behavior prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Technologies that are central to this - subsurface remediation, geothermal energy systems, batteries, fracking, etc. - are governed by complicated flow through porous media, which is not currently well understood. A porous medium has multiple, convoluted pathways of various sizes for fluid flow through an otherwise solid material. The flows can be single phase (liquid/gas) or multiphase, and can occur at constant temperature or with heat transfer. The flow can occur in a single direction, or oscillate. When all of these are combined, nonlinear effects can result, which could improve the behavior of a system or negatively impact performance, depending on how the effects are propagated and understood. The major objective of this work is to experimentally study oscillating and multiphase flows in porous media, and then develop a numerical approach that can be used to gain further insight into the fundamental behavior, thereby improving energy efficiency, and lowering both economic costs and environmental impacts. Although porous media flow sounds esoteric, it occurs in many daily applications (brewing coffee, etc.). Therefore, this project is well suited for pre-college outreach, and several topics related to it will be used to engage underrepresented students from K-12 classrooms. In addition, this project will promote STEM education via an inter-college educational collaboration for undergraduate design projects, and demonstration units about porous media flows will be created for pre-college classrooms.<br/><br/>This research will combine experimental and numerical techniques to describe the effects of the physical porous structure, the flow/heat transfer boundary layer (including a comparison between oscillation and non-oscillation) and the variations in wettability from materials and manufacturing process. Experimentally, naturally-occurring and engineered porous media will be scanned, analyzed, and catalogued in a database, and an experimental platform will also be designed and developed to study in situ oscillating and multiphase transport phenomena inside porous media using the Neutron Imaging Facility at Oak Ridge National Lab. This experimental work will be coupled with numerical simulations through parallel development of a multiphase discrete Boltzmann method model and a hybrid discrete/lattice Boltzmann method model to capture kinetic behaviors and multiscale interactions, in order to elucidate the fundamental behavior of oscillating multiphase thermofluidic phenomena and fluid-solid interactions. The knowledge developed in this project will, in turn, be used to improve the design of porous structures in a variety of energy applications, including thermal storage in concentrated solar power plants, carbon retention in rock structures, and fuel cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recently discovered class of ceramics, entropy stabilized oxides (ESOs), exhibit a unique reversible phase transformation behavior that provides significant control over the properties via heat treatment, thus  allowing for an efficient means of manufacturing these materials into complex shapes without fracture or failure. This award supports fundamental research to explore the mechanisms underlying transformation superplasticity and uncover new methods of manufacturing ESOs. These materials show promise as supercapacitors, battery cathodes, catalysts, and electrolytes, which impacts U.S. industry and economy. The project explores the fields of advanced manufacturing and materials science and engineering, with educational, training and outreach activities that provide exposure to interdisciplinary topics for undergraduate, graduate and K-12 students, especially those from underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Entropy stabilized oxides (ESOs) are ceramic materials in which configurational disorder is compositionally engineered into a single phase with multiple cations randomly populating sublattice locations. ESOs display a reversible phase transformation behavior when heat treated within a particular temperature window. This phase transformation manifests as a controllable phase heterogeneity, giving unprecedented control over the microstructure of ESOs. Such a dramatic transformation could be leveraged to enhance ductility during high temperature deformation, allowing for efficient forming through transformation superplasticity and cyclic deformation. Transformation superplasticity allows for mechanical deformation of more than 100% due to the internal strain that arises from the mismatch between co-existing phases, which can accumulate during thermal cycling. The research involves the following tasks: 1) synthesis and consolidation of bulk ESO samples with different grain sizes; 2) heat treatment to achieve the desired phase state (amount and composition of the secondary phase(s)); 3) high temperature deformation and superplastic forming; and 4) evaluation of microstructure and properties. Experiments are complemented with theoretical modeling to analyze the influence of grain size, applied stress, pressure, strain rate and temperature on diffusion, and consequently deformation mechanisms and superplasticity. This research establishes a relationship between starting microstructure and deformation behavior, thus advancing the understanding of deformation mechanisms in ESOs and their potential for superplastic forming using techniques such as forging and extrusion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to its large capacity and low energy footprint compared to traditional volatile memory, non-volatile memory has long been envisioned as an ideal solution for building large-scale, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and recoverable applications in many critical domains, including high-performance computing, machine learning, and embedded systems. Although non-volatile memory is available as commercial memory chips and offers numerous promises, it has not yet been widely adopted in production systems. The major obstacle is the difficulty to ensure that data is timely and correctly written to non-volatile memory, allowing it to be restored to a consistent state after a crash. Currently, application developers carry the burden of porting legacy applications to non-volatile memory, which is tedious and error-prone. This project seeks to establish a generic framework for user-transparent persistence and crash consistency that allows unmodified legacy applications to run efficiently and correctly with non-volatile memory. The success of this project will help unleash the full potential of non-volatile memory and make it easier to adopt. The research will also provide valuable insights into data management in future hybrid, disaggregated memory systems. In addition, this project involves mentoring Ph.D. students, engaging minority students, course development, and K12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project integrates non-volatile memory into the page/buffer cache in memory management ? i.e., an abstraction that bridges the view of byte-addressable memory and a backing memory device -- to provide persistence and crash consistency to user-space programs with no or little user involvement. The challenges lie in 1) how to intercept program updates and redirect them to non-volatile memory for persistence; 2) how to properly order the updates and ensure update atomicity to guarantee crash consistency; 3) how to efficiently integrate non-volatile memory into page/buffer cache management without incurring noticeable overhead or performance degradation. This project addresses these challenges by focusing on persisting three types of program data ? file-backed data, dynamically allocated application memory, and program metadata for virtual memory management, such as page tables, and exploring various software and hardware techniques, such as copy-on-write, undo logging, shadow paging, and extended page tables, for each data type to achieve efficient crash consistency. This project advances the understanding of hybrid memory management for volatile and non-volatile memories while simultaneously achieving high usability, good backward compatibility, and high efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use the tools of mathematical logic (and computability theory in particular) to study the way that information can be coded into mathematical structures of the types that arise in all areas of mathematics. The general paradigm is that information is encoded into a mathematical structure if it can always be recovered in an intrinsic way from the structure, without artifacts from the way that the structure is presented. For the simplest kinds of information, like a string of 0's and 1's, the situation is well-understood. But for more complex kinds of information, the situation is much less well-understood and there are many interesting phenomena to explore. Understanding the coding of information will help us understand both the nature of information and the ability of structures of various kinds to code information. This, in turn, informs and guides the mathematical practice of other mathematicians. This project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students and outreach to high schools.<br/><br/>More formally, we say that a piece of information A is coded in a structure B if from every copy of the structure, we can recover in a computable way a copy of the information A. For example if B is a countably infinite group then a copy of B is a Cayley table for the group, noting that for an infinite group there are many different Cayley tables obtained by listing the elements of the group in different orders. By a piece of information we mean, in order of increasing complexity, a binary string (or subset of the natural numbers), an infinite family of binary strings, an infinite tree, or some other structure. For the first case of a binary string, there is a good structural characterisation of when a structure codes a binary string; one can interpret this as saying that there is always a good reason for a binary string to be coded by a structure. This is not the case for any more of the more complicated types of information; it seems that there are structures which happen to code information, but there is no good structural reason as to why. This project aims to explore these phenomena and push them to their limit with one aim being to give new tools to attack difficult open problems on degree spectra which have been resistant to current techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the day, plants and other photosynthetic organisms use solar energy to fix carbon dioxide and store excess carbon as carbon polymers such as starch or glycogen. At night, these storage carbons are broken down as the energy source for dark survival. The dark-to-light transition represents a universal environmental stress for photosynthetic lifeforms. For example, many metabolites necessary for photosynthetic reactions upon light exposure are limited or depleted due to metabolic reactions conducted in dark. It is important for photosynthetic organisms to have a mechanism in place to cope with this stress and ensure healthy photosynthetic performance upon exposure to light. How photosynthetic organisms achieve this dark-to-light transitions remains unclear. This research project applies cutting-edge biochemical and systems biology approaches to dissect the molecular mechanisms that allow this dark to light transition to occur in a model photosynthetic blue green alga. Knowledge gained from this research will how storage polymers like glycogen pave the way for carbon dioxide fixation to occur during the dark to light transition and eventually lead to ways to improve photosynthetic efficiency for crop productions. The research project also provides training opportunities for one postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student, and several undergraduate students. Components of this research are also integrated in a cluster education program as well as in the form of a special topics course on Synthetic Biology to broaden the training opportunity and strengthen scientific literacy for both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Cyanobacteria experience drastic metabolic changes under daily light/dark cycles. The smooth metabolic transition from dark to light is crucial for healthy photosynthetic performance and the overall fitness of phototrophs. It is known that glycogen metabolism is involved in supporting the initiation of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle reactions during dark-to-light transitions in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. However, the molecular mechanisms of how glycogen metabolism supports photosynthesis are not clear. This project applies proteomics, metabolomics, metabolic flux analysis, and photochemical analyses to characterize the coping mechanism of cyanobacteria for the dark-to-light transition stress. The research activities will illustrate the status of a stalled CBB cycle, and understand how glycogen metabolism helps replenish and restart carbon fixation reactions, as well as protecting Photosystem I from photoinhibition during dark-to-light transitions. Discoveries from the research will significantly advance the understanding on a fundamental mechanism employed by photosynthetic lifeforms to cope with the dark-to-light transition stress and further our knowledge on energy balance between photosynthetic light reactions and carbon fixation.

With the size of the systems of interacting particles or waves being large, a deterministic description of their behavior is not feasible, and it is necessary to resort, via a branch of mathematics called kinetic theory, to an averaging description. In this context, the investigator aims to develop analytical and computational tools to describe the properties of such systems by means of averaging quantities and provide a statistically accurate prediction of their evolution in time. The project will offer training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>The idea behind kinetic theory is to identify macroscopic properties of a large system and to study their asymptotic behavior as the size of the system tends to infinity, with the intent of finding limiting effective equations, which in turn will reveal properties observed in a system of large but finite size.

This project will expand this program to include: the derivation and analysis of kinetic equations for phenomena not covered by Boltzmann equation, for instance multiple particle interactions in non-ideal gases or mixture of gases, the derivation of wave kinetic equations in the inhomogeneous setting, as well addressing the question of local and global well-posedness in wave turbulence theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When life moved out of the ocean, surviving environments with limited water became a necessity. One approach to survive this new extreme, that is present across all kingdoms of life, is to dry out, or desiccate, while waiting for water to return. Tolerating desiccation requires coordination across cells, tissues, and organisms, but the details of how this happens are unknown. The Water and Life Interface Institute (WALII) Biology Integration Institute will fill in these gaps using fungi, plants, and animals with low and high desiccation tolerance. The long-term goals of this Institute are understanding how organisms tolerate desiccation, inventing technologies, and concepts for working in low-water environments, engineering proteins, cells, and organisms to increase desiccation tolerance, and building a national community of desiccation scientists. Research at WALII will impact society by finding new, desiccation-tolerance-based strategies for crop loss prevention, developing dry storage solutions for storing medicines currently stored cold, and mitigating ongoing decreases in species diversity. Establishing a national, integrated research community requires an expert, multidisciplinary workforce, and integration with the public. To that end, the WALII training programs will support career development for over 100 scientists from diverse backgrounds at all career stages, and its outreach initiatives will invite the public to join WALII?s scientists in desiccation tolerance experiments.<br/><br/>Concepts and tools in life sciences have been made primarily in the context of fully hydrated systems. WALII will study the interaction of life and water across timescales and hydration states in diverse organisms, using four intertwined themes: 1) Physical and molecular determinants of desiccation tolerance; 2) Molecular and cellular rehydration responses across the continuum of desiccation sensitivity; 3) The role(s) of intrinsically disordered proteins in conferring desiccation tolerance; and 4) Short- and long-term evolutionary histories of desiccation tolerance. The multiscale, transdisciplinary studies of anhydrobiosis at WALII aim to ignite a transformative new field of solid-state biology, focused first on modeling function and dysfunction of biomolecules, cells, tissues, and organisms under desiccation stress. New methods and approaches will be essential, including better protocols for seedbank preservation and stabilizing plant sexual reproduction, better water-resistant materials and water-retention strategies, and sensitive in vivo tools for sensing and manipulating cellular responses to desiccation. WALII combines the expertise of researchers from several disciplines such as biophysics, cell biology, computational biology, desiccation tolerance, evolutionary biology, ecology, genetics, and plant, animal, seed, fungal, and pollen physiology and diverse organizations such as non-profit research institutes, universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Primarily Undergraduate Institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, owing to the boom in artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Neural Network (DNN), there is a need for high performance, efficient, fast, and adaptive AI-based big data processing systems. However, those requirements are not sufficiently met by existing computing solutions due to the power-wall in silicon-based semiconductor devices, memory-wall in traditional Von-Neuman computing architecture, and ultra computation- and memory-intensive DNN-based AI algorithms. This project brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers, with expertise spanning from material science, device fabrication, integrated circuit design, computer architecture, and AI algorithms to undertake innovative device-circuit-algorithm co-design for developing an AI Processing-In-Memory (AI-PIM) system that could leverage the emerging non-volatile magnetic memory technology to implement efficient AI data processing, as well as situation-aware on-chip continual learning. This project targets to significantly improve the AI data processing energy efficiency, with 100X higher efficiency than that of state-of-the-art Graph Processing Units (GPUs). The project will greatly benefit various application areas, such as autonomous driving, robotics, personalized cognitive speech, and smart connected health, etc. This project will also involve education and workforce development activities, including K-12 STEM outreach, undergraduate/graduate training, curriculum development in semiconductor, semiconductor industry internship mentoring, cleanroom fab internships, advance integrated circuit design courses. It will also encourage broader participation of female and under-represented minorities in the microelectronics and semiconductor chip industry. <br/><br/>This project will advance knowledge and conduct cross-layer research spanning from emerging Spin-Orbit Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (SOT-MRAM) material, device, circuit, architecture, to AI algorithm exploration with three main interweaved thrusts. Thrust 1 will explore unconventional spins in SOT materials, e.g., MnPd3, and novel device geometry to fabricate a new design of 2-terminal SOT-MRAM, which simultaneously delivers unlimited endurance, nano-seconds programming time, very high cell density, deterministic programming without external magnetic field, zero leakage, and non-volatility. Leveraging the developed 2-terminal SOT-MRAM, Thrust 2 will design and tape-out an AI Processing-in-Memory (PIM) chip to implement fully digital ?in-memory sparse multiplication-and-accumulation (MAC)? operations that support both forward and backward computations of neural networks. Following a co-design methodology, Thrust 3 will first investigate automated network architecture search methods to construct AI model best suitable for given situation while considering our AI-PIM system constraint. This thrust will further develop novel PIM-friendly, compute- and memory-efficient, situation-aware continual learning algorithms that could minimize the power-hungry on-chip weight update (i.e., memory write) complexity, while learning new situation- and user-specific data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accordingly, the goal of this project is to design the Multimedia Streaming Cloud (MSC) platform with high-level management abstractions that can reap the benefits of the continuum while hiding the complexity of working with it. MSC promotes the Function-as-a-Service computing paradigm and offers the Object-as-a-Service (OaaS) abstraction as a first-class citizen to represent various streaming sources, hence, relieving the users and developers from both the resource and data management difficulties. OaaS enables flexible migration of the objects across the continuum and accelerates the development of streaming services too. Preserving the object's state facilitates seamless object migration, hence, elasticity and mobility of objects across the edge-to-cloud continuum are achieved. MSC offers cost-efficient and robust QoS to each streaming object via smart task management and resource allocation methods operating on heterogeneous cloud resources. An open-source prototype of the MSC platform is developed and tested via recording devices, a local edge computing system, and a public cloud to assess its usability and robustness. <br/><br/>The MSC platform democratizes multimedia streaming and lays the foundation for the next generation applications operating based on multimedia streaming. MSC will pave the way for stream providers to become solution-oriented and let them focus on developing advanced streaming services and integrate them to their applications. The project results will impact not only the forefront of scientific discovery, but also benefit the society by offering flexible and robust streaming services across various applications. The object abstraction and the intelligent resource allocation methods of the MSC platform can be adapted to and employed in other soft real-time computing systems.

The advantage of the technologies is the capability of manipulating an object in accordance with the task requirements and the perceived object properties including shapes and materials. This project has great potential to benefit numerous industries by improving productivity, deskilling robot programming, simplifying robot planning, and lowering the technical boundaries. This project will support the national strategy in bringing manufacturing back to the US while benefiting many industries and increasing their economic competitiveness. <br/><br/>The project will establish a holistic framework of Context-Aware Task-Oriented Manipulation (CATOM) to address three cornerstone challenges in dexterous manipulation: object affordance perception, dexterity modeling, and manipulation planning and learning. An object affordance refers to actions that match with the physical properties of an object, such as shapes, mass, and friction. The object affordances are obtained from object characteristics measured by multimodal sensors. For this purpose, a knowledge-driven model will be designed, which fuses heterogenous sensing and incorporates human experience. The object affordances will be represented by potential contacts under each grasp taxonomy. A topology-based modeling method will be used to align potential hand postures with the contacts for a proper grasp. With the topology-based modeling, a complex task will be represented as a spatial-temporal sequence of hand topologies and operations. A hybrid learning and planning mechanism will be implemented to deploy hand topologies and perform actions under contextual constraints.

This project will implement an integrated experimental and modeling strategy to address this objective. The identification of the mechanisms governing plastic strain recovery will raise the possibility of designing metal components that may recover after being deformed or dented. This fundamental knowledge will be used to develop predictive tools, which will facilitate the accurate prognosis of life to mitigate premature failures. There is a wide range of applications such as gas turbines and tribological coatings among others that can benefit from these developments. In addition, the project will provide an integrated training platform for the future and diverse workforce via the education of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of computational mechanics and microscopy. A particularly interesting ativity in this regard is the partnership with a local community college, whose students will be able to apply for 8-week long research internships.<br/><br/>The deformation behavior of nanocrystalline metals substantially differs from that of coarse-grained metals. One such unique behavior is the ability of nanocrystalline metals to recover plastic strain. This phenomenon is quite unusual since plastic deformation in metals is considered permanent after unloading. The critical micromechanical driving forces are not clear however and remain a subject of conjecture. As a result, a microstructure-sensitive predictive modeling framework also remains elusive. Specific objectives of this work are to: (1) identify the influence of mismatch in elastic response of nano-sized grains on plastic strain recovery; (2) elucidate the influence of texture on the residual stresses; (3) identify the connection between grain boundary sliding and strain compatibility; and (4) identify the influence of grain boundary sliding on the residual stress gradients. An integrated experimental-modeling plan is put in place to achieve these objectives that includes extensive in-situ testing and characterization using advanced microscopy techniques, such as the scanning transmission electron microscopy, and sophisticated elastoplastic phase field modeling method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The demand for high-performance and large-capacity storage systems is rapidly increased to cover this big data environment; still, it is a critical challenge to satisfy both high performance and large capacity in a single storage device with a low cost. To achieve this goal, an emerging storage device named hybrid/convertible Solid-State Drive (SSD) provides unique properties compared to traditional storage devices and can satisfy the requirement in such an environment. However, the emerging device has not been fully investigated and cannot reach its full potential. This project aims to fully explore the abilities of hybrid/convertible SSDs. The completion of this project will initialize a paradigm shift in today?s storage systems to handle massive amounts of data more efficiently with high capacity and high-speed access.

Recent technological advances had a profound effect on our answers to that challenge.  They allow for rapid and cost-effective sequencing (i.e., reading) of pathogen genomes and can generate enormous amounts of data in almost real time. Genomic epidemiology is an interdisciplinary research area that uses the large-scale analysis of viral genomes to understand how viruses evolve and spread.  The methods of genomic epidemiology are currently becoming major instruments not only for research, but also for public-health decision making of broad societal importance. However, its computational toolkit is still developing, and this process faces many hard algorithmic challenges.  Some of the major problems are: (i) how to extract the whole spectrum of viral genetic diversity, including newly emerging mutations and variants, from noisy and fragmented sequencing data; (ii) how to use genomic data to investigate outbreaks and reconstruct virus-transmission networks; and (iii) how to identify highly pathogenic or transmissible viral variants. The algorithms for these problems should be accurate, reproducible, interpretable and scalable with respect to the levels of ""big data"" produced by modern sequencing platforms. Development of such algorithms and study of the corresponding algorithmic problems is exactly the goal of this project. Other major objectives are to help to bring computational genomics into high-school and undergraduate classrooms, to broaden participation in computational biology via advanced pedagogical techniques, and to facilitate training of the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers, who will simultaneously possess an expertise in computer science, epidemiology, and molecular biology, and will be able to develop innovative algorithms and apply them to real-life problems.<br/><br/>This project will undertake the systematic study of fundamental computational problems of genomic epidemiology from the theoretical computer-science perspective. The overarching objective is the development of new methods based on cross-disciplinary convergence of techniques from algorithmic graph theory, network theory and mathematical (and, particularly, combinatorial) optimization. The first major specific scientific goal is the development of methods for assessment of viral genetic diversity using networks of statistically linked mutations and a graph-decomposition approach. The second goal is the development of a family of combinatorial algorithms for reconstruction of viral transmission networks using the fusion of phylogenetics and a network-theory approach to social networks relevant to infection dissemination.  The final goal is the design of scalable computational techniques for quantification of viral phenotypic diversity using combinatorial and convex optimization.  The investigator will closely collaborate with biologists and epidemiologists to ensure biomedical relevance and applicability of the developed algorithms. It is also expected that some of the new machinery will be applicable to non-biomedical problems arising in graph theory and in studies of complex networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop an innovative, demonstrable approach to mitigate insider threats to an organization. The new mechanisms developed in this project will substantially enhance the state-of-the-art in securing enterprises including private and public sectors. It will improve an organization's preparedness to thwart these important threats, and will reduce the risk for the organizations to be negatively influenced by these threats and endure potentially negative economic and societal impacts.

Access control systems are fundamental to mitigating insider threats and attribute-based access control (ABAC) has emerged as a promising model in recent years. This project develops a comprehensive framework based on ABAC that utilizes a combination of moving target defense (MTD) and deception techniques to address insider threat challenges. This is achieved through the development of several components in a systematic way. The first is a scientific foundation for defensive deception that includes deception modeling and planning, and an approach to generate consistent and affordable deception plans for insider threat prevention. The second utilizes moving target defense techniques to increase the cost and time burden on the insider to achieve an unauthorized access by proactively changing ABAC system configurations. The third one introduces the notion of honey elements in ABAC, and integrates them with active deception and moving target defense techniques. The framework will result in a significant improvement in the security of the large-scale enterprises so that proactive countermeasures for insider threats could be deployed with consideration of the system security requirements, and effectiveness of countermeasures. The proof-of-concept prototype will demonstrate the ability to monitor insider access and enforce corresponding authorization policies to mitigate insider threats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology may be used to assess the severity of illnesses remotely and route patients to the appropriate care facility.  Industry experts estimate that more than 30% of all emergency admissions are unnecessary and could be reduced by better and easier to access remote physiological monitoring systems.  A record of heart rate and heart rate variability using real-time telemetry may help to effectively triage and proactively manage patient conditions before they are escalated to emergency rooms. In addition, the proposed technology may be a step towards bridging socioeconomic gaps and advancing healthcare equity.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a deviceless software that will allow clinicians to assess and monitor patients? current status from conventional phone calls. The proposed technology adds an additional layer to existing phone calls that uses voice input to capture vital signs such as heart rate and heart rate variability, sharing them with a clinician in real-time. The proposed technology is designed to allow an outpatient to call a hotline where the software is used to analyze vitals prior to speaking with a clinician and be routed accordingly, i.e., Emergency Room, Urgent Care, or in-home treatment. In addition, the proposed technology may be used for post-hospital event monitoring purposes where the patient receives a daily phone call to record vitals and answer a series of questions for doctors to review weekly as part of current physiological status assessment. With a 92% accuracy level, the proposed technology promises a streamlined method for clinicians to track vitals and manage health conditions at home.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Loss of control can lead to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. One central control system for protein degradation is referred to as UPS (ubiquitin-proteasome system). The activity of the UPS is highly variable across individual cells in a population. It is important therefore to be able to measure activity on a single cell basis. This project will develop fluorescent sensors to measure the UPS activity of individual cells. These sensors could enhance efforts to develop new drugs and optimal treatment strategies on a patient by patient basis. Hands-on learning modules will also be developed and presented to middle school students in the Baton Rouge area. Undergraduates and high school students will also be recruited to participate in extended research experiences in an effort to develop and populate a robust biomanufacturing workforce.<br/><br/>The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) governs DNA repair and protein degradation. Its specificity is governed by E3 ubiquitin ligases, which recognize select degradation sequences, or degrons, on target proteins.  Unfortunately, our understanding of E3 ligase and proteasome activity is incomplete. This translates into an inability to obtain a complete picture of proteasome activity across a population of cells. The UPS could be harnessed to inhibit proteins by directing them to the proteasome for degradation using proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs). While effective, current PROTACs suffer from reduced potency due to low cell permeability and high protease susceptibility. Thus, there is a need for long-lived, cell permeable peptides to be incorporated into the next generation of PROTACs. Our overarching hypothesis is that degron-based substrates can be utilized as (1) a next generation method to directly quantify proteasome activity and (2) a novel PROTAC with increased lifetime and sensitivity. The proposed work will evaluate peptides containing a &#946;-hairpin motif as a new approach for quantifying proteasome activity in intact cells and degrading difficult to inhibit targets. We will also investigate the use of highly stable, non-natural amino acid sequences as a new class of degron-based substrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humans frequently take for granted and exploit these ecosystem services without fully understanding the ecological feedbacks, linkages, and interdependencies of these processes to the wider ecosystem. As demands on coastal ecosystem services have risen, marshes have experienced substantial loss due to direct and indirect impacts from human activity. The rapidly changing coastal ecosystems of Louisiana provide a natural experiment for understanding how coastal change alters ecosystem function. This project is developing new metrics and tools to assess food web variability and test hypotheses on biodiversity and ecosystem function in coastal Louisiana.  The research is determining how changing habitat configuration alters the distribution of energy across the seascape in a multitrophic system. This work is engaging students from the University of Louisiana Lafayette and Dillard University in placed-based learning by immersing them in the research and local restoration efforts to address land loss and preserve critical ecosystem services. Students are developing a deeper understanding of the complex issues facing coastal regions through formal course work, directed field work, and outreach. Students are interacting with stakeholders and managers who are currently battling coastal change. Their directed research projects are documenting changes in coastal habitat and coupling this knowledge with the consequences to ecosystems and the people who depend on them. By participating in the project students are emerging with knowledge and training that is making them into informed citizens and capable stewards of the future of our coastal ecosystems, while also preparing them for careers in STEM. The project is supporting two graduate students and a post-doc.<br/><br/>The transformation and movement of energy through a food web are key links between biodiversity and ecosystem function. A major hurdle to testing biodiversity ecosystem function theory is a limited ability to assess food web variability in space and time. This research is quantifying changing seascape structure, species diversity, and food web structure to better understand the relationship between biodiversity and energy flow through ecosystems. The project uses cutting edge tools and metrics to test hypotheses on how the distribution, abundance, and diversity of key species are altered by ecosystem change and how this affects function. The hypotheses driving the research are: 1) habitat is a more important indirect driver of trophic structure than a direct change to primary trophic pathways; and 2) horizontal and vertical diversity increases with habitat resource index. Stable isotope analysis is characterizing energy flow through the food web. Changes in horizontal and vertical diversity in a multitrophic system are being quantified using aerial surveys and field sampling. To assess the spatial and temporal change in food web resources, the project is combining results from stable isotope analysis and drone-based remote sensing technology to generate consumer specific energetic seascape maps (E-scapes) and trophic niche metrics. In combination these new metrics are providing insight into species? responses to changing food web function across the seascape and through time.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Biological Oceanography and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Qualitative researchers collect and analyze non-numerical data to understand people's interactions, opinions, and experiences. The presence of potential bias in qualitative research is a well-recognized problem, but research to increase transparency and trustworthiness in the analysis phases have been limited. This research develops a novel role for visualizations in addressing current challenges in qualitative data analysis through the integration of text analysis and multimodal data extraction. Given the prevalent use of qualitative research in academia, qualitative data analysis without transparency and verification can have far-reaching negative impacts such as discriminating policies, suboptimal patient-care, and reinforced stigmas. Thus, qualitative data analysis should be conducted in a rigorous manner to yield trustworthy and meaningful results. The techniques developed will significantly contribute to the data analysis, visualization, and human-computer interaction fields.<br/><br/>Despite advances in qualitative data analysis software, there are three key dilemmas in the current qualitative research process: the cognitive burden resulting from the vast amount of data, subjectivity and potential bias that are introduced by the researcher, and the underutilization of multimodal data containing important non-verbal cues such as vocal tones and facial expressions. The specific objective of this proposal is to identify and demonstrate: (1) how text analysis techniques can be combined with visualization and human feedback to alleviate cognitive burden and lessen bias; and, (2) how visual summaries of audio features can promote the incorporation of non-verbal cues in qualitative analysis. An open-source visualization webtool supporting these enhanced analysis techniques will be developed using an iterative, user-centered design methodology.

Mn takes multiple chemical forms in the soil, depending on oxygen availability and acidity in the soil; some of these forms are more active in driving the degradation of SOM than others.  This proposed research will use a combination of high-technology tools to evaluate the forms of Mn, and experiments to evaluate the interactions of these forms with SOM and with the populations and activity of soil bacteria and fungi.  The project will also afford research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and opportunities to broaden participation of members of underrepresented groups in science, including community outreach to Native Hawaiians.<br/> <br/>SOM is the largest pool of potentially active carbon (C) in the biosphere, but much of that C turns over slowly because it is chemically recalcitrant and/or physically protected. Mn can override this recalcitrance, driving SOM breakdown through multiple pathways that relate to its three oxidation states. This project will evaluate how the oxidation state of Mn varies as a function of rainfall, and how the different oxidation states of Mn drive the decomposition of SOM.  Fieldwork will take place on a well-defined precipitation gradient in the Hawaiian Islands, on which most potential controls of ecosystem processes can be held relatively constant while climate varies widely (from <300 mm/yr annual precipitation to >3200 mm/yr) and in well-defined ways; it also draws upon information from National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and other sites to evaluate Mn oxidation states and their implications in a broad range of sites that differ in other factors in addition to precipitation, as a test of the hypothesis that precipitation is the dominant driver of Mn oxidation states and its consequences to SOM stability.

However, the computational tools to analyze and manipulate the massive-scale species biogeography data has not been fully developed. Historically, classifications of biogeographic regions were based on descriptions of the ecology, taxonomic composition or vegetation features of regions. Recent approaches provided more quantitative, and objective classifications, but broadly recapitulated earlier efforts and overlooked the evolutionary implications captured by the shared phylogenetic relationships of species. Because the field of biogeography has traditionally developed as an observational science rather than an experimental one, developing replicable analytical tools for biogeography into reproducible workflows is critical. The R software package phyloregion ? designed for biogeographic regionalization and macroecology ? can overcome these computational challenges. It contains tools for biogeographical regionalization, macroecology, conservation, and visualization, and has potential application in various disciplines including evolution, microbial diversity, systematics, ecology, phylogenetics, and many others. In this project, the research team plans to substantially increase computational efficiency of functions in phyloregion, to add new functionality, and create a model for user-guided software development in biogeography.<br/><br/>The project will develop and implement new tools in phyloregion for biome evolution and biogeographical investigations. Novel Grade of Membership model that represents sampling units as partial memberships in multiple groups will be established to analyze large biogeographic datasets. It will extend phyloregion with new tools to visualize patterns of biogeography, macroecology and evolution. Phyloregion will be enhanced to pass objects between R and RevBayes (a C++ tool for Bayesian phylogeography) for phylogeographic visualization through R. Finally, it will introduce new tools for conservation that reflect the key dimensions of phylogenetic diversity including richness, divergence and regularity. Phyloregion is already widely used and represents one of only a few biogeographical resources in R tailored for megaphylogenies and macroecological datasets. This research will create new, open-source, and freely distributed software tools with potential for transformative impact in biogeography and beyond. Workshops and conferences will be used for dissemination, and to provide introduction to intermediate R coding and implementation of biogeographical tools. Workshops will target a mix of faculty, postdocs, and especially graduate and undergraduate students, who will be trained on the use and application of phyloregion in their research, and to help develop their own novel biogeographic functions to assemble into an R package. The research team will work with existing diversity programs at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi and Southeastern to recruit diverse undergraduate participants, and provide resources for them to learn about graduate school. All products from this project will be disseminated free and open-sourced through computer codes, publications, conferences, workshops and vignettes. Phyloregion vignettes will be used to create an upper-division course for undergraduate and early graduate students. The grant will support the mentoring of one postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student and many undergraduates. Women and traditionally underrepresented groups will be specifically encouraged to apply for the postdoctoral research position, as well as for the workshops.

Each step may be optimized, yet for a step there may be uncertainty about the larger context of its contribution that if known during production would allow for greater efficiencies, better quality, and improved productivity.  If a global system analysis and optimization could, in addition, be conducted cooperatively with each step during production, the end product and overall production would greatly benefit. Advances in hybrid distributed control and optimization, in highly networked cyber-physical systems, and in artificial intelligence and machine learning have opened new opportunities in cyber-enabled manufacturing.  This Future Manufacturing Research Grant (FMRG) CyberManufacturing project connects and coordinates the ensemble of various manufacturing processes, operating at different manufacturing stages under a cyber-coordinated close-knit system, defined by an analytical framework, known as STREAM, a multi-stage distributed future manufacturing system. This project provides a public online repository that hosts the STREAM data, models, simulators, controllers, analytics, and empirical studies, and that facilitates sharing research experiences about STREAM with the research and industry communities. The project creates new outreach and workforce development activities for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as working professionals in the field of manufacturing. These research results will be included in the university curriculum for  advanced manufacturing, architecture design, machine learning, simulation, and system control and optimization. <br/><br/>This project is an interdisciplinary research project with three interconnected research tasks: (1) STREAM architecture design and implementation. There is a novel bridging middleware architecture to enable seamless machine interoperability, and software- and hardware-based accelerators will be built to enable efficient communication and computing in cyber-manufacturing systems. (2) STREAM modeling and quality control. There is a novel multi-layer functional graphical model to address the high-dimensional functional dependencies over STREAM machines and a spatial-temporal iterative learning control method to achieve an accurate and efficient process quality control. (3) STREAM simulation and production control. To handle the multi-level dynamic process interactions in the system that collectively meet process quality, cost, and resource constraints, there are coordinated, high-fidelity multi-resolution simulators, assisting with the hybrid control of STREAM production. These research tasks are validated in an open-source additive manufacturing testbed for the manufacture of high energy/power density supercapacitors. The modeling and analysis methodologies form a rigorous basis for continuous improvement of quality, manufacturability, and productivity of future multi-stage and distributed manufacturing systems.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS) in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and the Divisions of Civil.

Despite more than 5,000 authors publishing refactoring papers in the last two decades, refactoring researchers, students, and new community members lack publicly available refactoring benchmarks, tools, and datasets. They must frequently replicate existing refactoring research from scratch ? this wastes time, effort, and introduces threats to validity. The project's novelties are to create and disseminate a repository of software refactoring-related artifacts and online tools, to enable refactoring as a service, sufficient to support rigorous empirical studies and experiments with the detection, prioritization, repair, testing, and documentation of software quality issues across a broad community of researchers, educators, software engineers, and STEM researchers. The project's impacts relate to issues of great economic impact: large software companies spend millions of dollars yearly to reduce the technical debt through refactoring. The publicly-released infrastructure will support the transition of refactoring research into practice and will enable STEM researchers to better maintain their software prototypes as these inevitably decay. The proposed infrastructure REFCRI will be a catalyst for revamping software engineering courses at many universities to emphasize real-world examples of refactoring and will offer tremendous education resources for practitioners. The investigators will organize workshops on the platform to foster a thriving community.<br/><br/>The investigators will curate a repository of refactoring data sets via data pre-processing techniques to (i) clean the data, and (ii) check its coverage and diversity. The team of this project will release an API to allow the refactoring community to easily upload datasets, refactoring teaching examples/tutorials, tools, and publications. The data sets will serve as benchmarks that enable researchers to validate new tools and will enable new empirical studies in the field of software engineering. The data sets will provide realistic training examples and tools to enhance the integration of refactoring into software engineering curricula and will serve as a tremendous educational resource for practitioners. The investigators will integrate and orchestrate (based on Kubernetes) multiple tools covering the whole lifecycle of refactoring by automatically transforming the inputs/outputs of existing tools into generic data processing formats and packaging tools as Docker images. They will make existing refactoring tools easy to configure, execute, and integrate. REFCRI will re-implement several refactoring tools, from papers and repositories, as services in the cloud. The investigators will first automatically mine millions of examples of refactorings that open-source developers applied manually and then they will use them to recommend and synthesize new refactorings-by-example to support Python and other data science languages widely used by the STEM community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While today?s Internet was developed to provide widespread connectivity to individuals and businesses across the world, the networks that support the Internet do not have built-in security mechanisms. This project is focused on solving that problem by investigating future network designs based on new network technology that would support security and provide defense across a wide variety of attacks.  The project vision is to develop Programmable In-network Security, or ?Poise?. Poise aims to design and integrate a wide range of defenses directly inside the network, leveraging the technology trend of network programmability. If successful, a Poise network would support security as naturally as today?s networks support connectivity. This project will develop new scientific foundations for network security, investigate practical use cases, release open-source tools, and produce educational materials. The potential impact of Poise is to make future networks fundamentally more secure than they are today.  <br/><br/>This project presents a vision of Programmable In-network Security, or ?Poise?, informed by the recent trend that network devices are becoming increasingly programmable, and with a goal of supporting security as a first-class network attribute. The project plans to take a three-pronged approach to realizing this goal. First, Poise aims to transform a programmable switch into a defense platform by designing a wide range of security applications that reside in the switch. Second, Poise aims to transform a network of programmable switches into a defense fleet, by architecting defense applications into the network paths and synchronizing them for whole-network defense. Third, Poise seeks to ensure that the defense applications, individually and collectively, are themselves secure against attacks. In its ultimate embodiment, a Poise network would toggle a wide array of defenses rapidly on and off as traffic flows through, mitigating attacks in real time. This project will advance the state of the art in network security in the above three dimensions and will produce scientific foundations and reusable system prototypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electrical potential recordings using a large microelectrode array from neuronal cultures has been widely used to monitor neural spike activities and cellular activities. However, this approach does not monitor neurochemical release, and therefore only contains indirect information regarding synaptic neurotransmission. The neural spike activities and the neurotransmitter secretions are related; however, one cannot be used to predict the other because of the complex vesicle trafficking and exocytosis processes. Because many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer?s disease and Parkinson?s disease, interfere and modulate synaptic functions prior to neuronal loss, ideally, the new technology should be able to monitor the dynamics of both neural spike activities and neurochemical release from synapses. The central objective of this project is to serve this unmet need. The educational objective of this project is to lead an exciting role in closing the knowledge and interest gaps in science and engineering via a multidimensional approach. The education program is expected to (i) increase public scientific literacy, (ii) engage underrepresented student groups in STEM, and (iii) provide a highly demanded curriculum to prepare students in the emerging field of neural engineering. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a novel neurochemical-electrophysiology sensor technology that can simultaneously monitor neurochemical and neural spike activities. The neurochemical-electrophysiology sensor will enable the comprehensive investigation of synaptic function from action potential (AP) propagating through the axon to rapidly evoking neurochemical events at the synapses which cause the extracellular release of neurotransmitters. The new neurochemical-electrophysiology technology will provide label-free, multisite, and long-term monitoring of neuronal synaptic transmission activities, hence, enabling the characterization of synaptic function in physiological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. The project's Research Plan is organized under three aims: (1) Develop high-density neurochemical-electrophysiology amplifiers with fast-scan cyclic voltammogram (FSCV) capability; (2) Develop on-chip 16,384 microelectrode array and investigate switch-matrix connectivity; and (3) Apply the neurochemical-electrophysiology technology to monitor synaptic transmission from a large neural network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The estimates for the number of fungal species on the planet range from 1.5 to over 5 million and it is thought that likely over 90% of fungi remain to be identified.  To date, a relatively small percentage of the identified fungi are associated with marine environments. However, fungi have been found from the surface of the ocean to depths of many kilometers in ocean sediment, and these organisms have potential key roles in carbon cycling and degradation of anthropogenic materials.  Fungi that survive in the marine environment have remarkable abilities to respond to the myriad of stresses, including UV exposure, limited nutrients and high salinity that are features of the ocean.  This work examines how marine fungi cope with environmental stresses by changing cell shapes and controlling how the cells divide.  Fundamental understanding of growth, division and stress response is a missing link to understanding how marine fungi can contribute to the function of oceans.  The work will involve the training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers along with several community outreach efforts.<br/><br/>Cell function is intimately tied to cell morphogenesis across the biosphere.  This is especially clear in fungi where combinations of spherical, ovoid and hyphal-shaped cells build diverse structures across many scales. From micrometer-sized spores, centimeter-sized mushrooms and kilometer-spanning hyphae, a conserved family of cytoskeletal proteins called septins is integral to creating this morphological diversity.  Despite their ubiquity, the basic biophysical properties and regulation of septin polymers are only beginning to be understood.  This project links biophysical properties of septin polymers at the nanometer scale to their function in cell morphology at the micron scale.  Septin form and function will be analyzed across highly morphologically diverse fungal systems called ?black yeasts? that were isolated from the ocean.  Fungi in this group are considered to be amongst the most stress tolerant eukaryotes.   Comparative analysis of protein sequence variation, biophysics and cell biology of septins in these diverse black yeast species will reveal how plasticity in the septin cytoskeleton supports diversity in cell shape, function and stress tolerance. The research will analyze this problem from three scales: 1. Polymer properties: How do biophysical properties of septin filaments control higher-order structures? 2. Dynamics: How are septin dynamics used to sculpt assemblies and enable stress responses? 3. Morphogenesis: How do different septin assemblies promote distinct cell morphologies. These questions will be addressed using interdisciplinary approaches including biochemical reconstitution, advanced live cell imaging, molecular genetics and quantitative modeling.  Integral to this research plan is the training of undergraduate and graduate student scientists, along with several community outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inclusion of an elementary mathematics specialist on a team of teachers has potential to systemically improve mathematics education, build students? mathematical capacity to succeed, and increase student achievement in mathematics.  Too few students in the U.S. are attaining high levels of mathematics learning, compounded by persisting gaps in mathematics achievement.  This project aims to improve mathematics teacher effectiveness and teacher leadership in elementary schools in which many students have great economic needs and are from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.  The project focuses on the recruitment, preparation, support, and retention of elementary mathematics specialists who deliver rigorous mathematics instruction and serve as mathematics teacher leaders. <br/> <br/>This project at Georgia State University includes partnerships with the metro Atlanta school district Gwinnett County Public Schools and the nonprofit Corners Outreach.  Project goals include to: (1) recruit successful, experienced, and diverse elementary mathematics teachers from high-need schools that serve underrepresented student populations to become elementary mathematics specialists; (2) increase the number of elementary mathematics specialists in these schools through evidence-based preparation in two university endorsement programs; (3) develop elementary mathematics specialists who are highly effective mathematics teachers and teacher leaders; and (4) support and retain elementary mathematics specialists as they serve as teacher leaders, including coaching university teacher candidates, in these schools.  This five-year project will involve 26 in-service elementary teachers, aiming to promote mathematics equity and access, support teacher retention in high-need schools, and situate teacher candidates in a hiring pipeline.  The project's teachers will be prepared and supported as elementary mathematics specialists through completion of the K-5 Mathematics Endorsement and Teacher Support & Coaching Endorsement. In addition to completing these two endorsements, teachers will also engage in a Professional Learning Community and one-on-one mentoring.  Evaluation and research involving mixed methods will demonstrate how the intentional and continuous project components affect the mathematical content knowledge, instructional practices, beliefs, and teacher leader skills of elementary mathematics specialists.  Results have the potential to advance understandings in the areas of mathematics teacher education and professional development, particularly of elementary mathematics specialists in high-need schools. This Track 3: Master Teacher Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

SmartSight uses federated learning to take advantage of collective observations of users and improve its perception accuracy. The platform is robust against failure in its communication with remote tiers and is able to provide its basic functionality using only local tiers. For that purpose, SmartSight dynamically adjusts approximate computing knobs and allocates critical tasks to resources, only if they can produce timely results. A prototype of SmartSight will be developed and tested with blind and VIP to assess its usability, robustness, convenience, and discreteness. <br/><br/>SmartSight enables ?AI+Systems for social good.?

This relies on our ability to reconstruct accurate images of brain activity from millions of neurons. However, traditional electrophysiological techniques using the current paradigm of the ?single-neuron per electrode? approach lack the scalability to read signals from millions of neurons. Therefore, it is critical to investigate new means of interacting with neurons. To address this unmet need, the objective of this CAREER project is to discover a new neural interfacing modality using brain neurochemicals that can accurately capture the brain?s activity at a large scale. The project will also lead an exciting role in closing the knowledge and interest gaps in science and engineering via a multidimensional approach, including a new high-school research program, undergraduate research experience, and teach-in events at local public schools. <br/><br/>The main idea of this project is to exploit the stochastic nature of neurotransmitter diffusion to investigate a superresolution neurochemical imaging technique. The excitation of neurons results in action potentials that propagate through the neuronal body and axons toward synapses. At the synapses, these action potentials instigate the secretion of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter molecules released from a single vesicle diffuse and subsequently reach multiple adjacent electrodes to be measured. Based on the diffusion characteristics, the precise origin of neurotransmitter secretion can be localized. This localization technique is similar to triangulation in principle, but it considers the diffusion path to make precise localization of neural activities. This method has unique advantages over triangulation by being able to distinguish both x-y location and also z position based on the diffusion characteristic. Also, because the diffusion of molecules is a slower process compared to voltage propagation, the point source can be pinpointed with high accuracy. Using this approach, a few electrodes can produce neurochemical imaging with a high spatial resolution. This new approach will transform neural interfaces by enabling simultaneous measurements from millions of neurons without requiring an equivalent density of electrodes. The superresolution neurochemical probe will help unravel the complex role of dopamine?s spatial distribution in cognitive processes by directly mapping the neurochemical activities in the brain with high spatiotemporal resolution. This project will result in not only the most advanced neurochemical probe available to date but also the superresolution algorithm that can enhance the spatial resolution into nanometers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to understand the social and ethical dimensions of how Automated Hiring Platforms are created and how they function within the job market. This will be accomplished through surveying companies that use Automated Hiring Platforms about how they use them, observing how Automated Hiring Platforms are designed, and through interviews with those who design and develop them and with human resources professionals and job applicants. The project will also result in the creation of a new code of ethics for the design and use of Automated Hiring Platforms.<br/><br/>Automated Hiring Platforms are among the most visible and consequential forms of artificial intelligence because of their importance for hiring decisions, because they can be systematically biased in their selection criteria, and because they often operate as 'black boxes' the design and inner workings of which are unknown.

For example, many of the EDA problems such as Boolean optimization are combinatorial optimization problems, which are unlikely to be solved by polynomial-time algorithms. In practice, those problems can be solved using scalable optimization algorithms with approximations and domain-specific heuristics, which are mostly developed by extensive hand-engineering efforts with strong domain knowledge. However, recent progress in developing  such algorithms and associated heuristics is slowing down significantly due to the high barrier of technical knowledge, time-consuming hand-engineering, and several misleading designing strategies. This project aims to employ reinforcement learning and neural networks to enable self-learning high-performance algorithms and heuristics over graphs, which can outperform existing hand-crafted approaches without human supervision and domain knowledge. This will can be generalized to autonomously learn and discover novel graph-based combinatorial optimization heuristics at a wide range of application domains without any human guidance. This project will produce open-source software and conference tutorials to facilitate technology transfers and fruitful industry-academia interactions in a multidisciplinary community.<br/><br/>This project develops the OneSense system, a graph learning driven reinforcement learning framework for exploring self-learning novel algorithms and heuristics over graphs, with special focuses on graph-based large-scale Boolean optimization problems. The core of the project includes novel reinforcement learning formulations and neural architecture with domain-specific online graph sampling techniques to enable self-learning high-performance graph optimization heuristics. The reinforcement agent with the various reward formulations and novel training methodologies and algorithms will enable effectively learning novel combinatorial optimization heuristics with a wide range of performance customization. OneSense system will be integrated with an open-source end-to-end EDA design space exploration system, which will allow productive exploration and deployment of self-learned optimization heuristics over graphs in Boolean optimization. Moreover, the OneSense reinforcement learning framework will be released to allow exploring self-learned graph optimization algorithms in other research domains and be used as an educational platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research helps us understand how societies manage environmental risks. Climatic shifts have been shown to increase both interpersonal and inter-group conflict in every world region, meaning that mitigating climate change is a matter of national security. Understanding how to gain support among those most skeptical in high carbon-emitting economies is key to forming effective policy. This project identifies the material and psychological sources of public support for and resistance to climate mitigation policies around the world. It will develop three new public datasets and associated qualitative materials, encouraging replication and extensions, and contributes to education and research infrastructure. <br/><br/>In wealthy nations, women tend to express more concern about climate change than men. Yet the gender gap in climate attitudes does not exist in poorer countries. This project develops a new theory to explain how political elites shape citizens' perceptions of the costs and benefits of climate action in ways that vary across countries (by economic development) and by gender within countries. We test this theory by collecting and analyzing four data sets: (1) a 60-country dataset on major parties' climate policies; (2) a 60-country dataset on media references to the winners and losers of climate action; (3) qualitative case studies in seven countries to investigate the development of climate policy frames; and (4) a survey experiment in five countries to gauge how policies that lessen the perceived costs of climate action differently affect policy support among men and women. <br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Accountable Institutions and Behavior (AIB) and the Security and Preparedness (SAP) programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Users can thus achieve a high level of engagement by interacting with the augmented environment through the mobile user interface. Typical MAR apps require executing several compute-intensive tasks to render virtual objects and, using Artificial Intelligence (AI), analyze the environment. However, due to their relatively small form factor, mobile devices only have limited computing resources and energy available for the MAR app execution, which may lead to short battery life and poor user experience. To ensure the future success of MAR, it is thus important not only to conduct novel research on how to enable high energy efficiency in MAR apps but also to educate the future workforce in the best practices for energy efficient mobile software design. To achieve these goals, this project will propose an edge-assisted and energy-efficient framework for MAR apps. Specifically, the project designs runtime algorithms that (1), on each mobile device, control user-perceived performance and energy consumption by manipulating virtual object quality, AI-model complexity, and AI-task allocation on the heterogeneous computing resources, (2), on the supporting edge servers, ensure scalability by grouping similar virtual object decimation requests for minimized cross-user performance cost under limited edge computing and storage resources, and (3) will be implemented and tested on a physical testbed.<br/><br/>By providing a framework that makes MAR apps more energy-efficient, this project will help speed up the adoption of augmented reality in many different key sectors of modern society, such as education and workforce training, and will unlock the full potential of new technologies such as augmented remote meetings and augmented experiences in public places. The project will also result in the creation of new graduate-level courses to educate the future workforce on energy-efficient mobile resource management, new research opportunities for undergraduate students, and new summer camps for K12 students. The course material will be made available to other universities interested to introduce similar courses, projects, and summer camps. The results of this project will be disseminated through publications in top-tier conferences and journals. Similarly, all the source code of the proposed algorithms will be made available as open source.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
